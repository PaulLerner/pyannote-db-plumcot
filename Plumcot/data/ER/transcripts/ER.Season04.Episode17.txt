not_available I assumed Dr.

not_available He wanted to focus on the surgical applications of substitute blood.
not_available I'm surprised he let you go ahead on your own.
not_available Truth is, he doesn't know yet.
not_available Trying to break free? It's more like branching out.

not_available Once her labs are back, we'll know our options.
not_available Do whatever it takes to save her.
not_available I understand.

not_available Listen, I was just about to start a splenorenal shunt.
not_available But I can get somebody to cover for me.

not_available Scott just overdid it.
not_available It's cool, Dad.
not_available Jeanie'll keep me company.

not_available Dr.

not_available Taking them to Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Lizzie, what are you doing? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano? 
not_available I didn't authorize HemoAid in the ER.
not_available I tried to tell you, I moved ahead with a study.
not_available Got a rhythm.
not_available Faint pulse.
not_available Who said you could? Dr.
not_available Greene signed on as my faculty advisor.
not_available I see.
not_available I'd like to explain.
not_available Let's repeat a crit.
not_available I haven't moved my office.
not_available I feel a lot better now.
not_available That's because we rehydrated you.
not_available But with hyperemesis gravidarum, the vomiting could continue or get worse.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Your labs indicate that your kidneys aren't functioning properly.
not_available And you have a low potassium level, which could cause cardiac arrhythmia.
not_available I don't know what Dave said to you, but I'm not giving up this baby.
not_available I'm not suggesting that.
not_available But there are drugs available which could reduce the vomiting.
not_available But my OB said that drugs could put my baby at risk.
not_available There is that possibility.
not_available But endangering your health also puts your baby at risk.
not_available I'm sure you'll make a great mother.
not_available But physically, you might not be able to be one without medical intervention.
not_available Would you take the drugs? Yes, I would.
not_available I can't.
not_available Think about it.
not_available If your condition worsens, your life could be at risk.
not_available Hey, Doug, you ever been to Hog Head McDunna's? Great taco bar.
not_available I'll have to take a rain check on tonight.
not_available Listen, Carol can come along.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, Anspaugh's on the phone.
not_available Okay.
not_available I still need to talk to you.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll need a record of his vitals after every bag was hung.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, this is Lindsey Jang.
not_available He is your patient's son.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wasn't aware any relatives had arrived.
not_available How's my father? He's been taken to surgery.
not_available His heart stopped, but we resuscitated him.
not_available Did it stop because you gave him fake blood? No.
not_available In fact, he responded quite well.
not_available One of the benefits of HemoAid is it can transport oxygen to areas whereWho gave you permission? 
not_available I've got a consult.
not_available Good luck, Mr.
not_available Jang.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jang, we did use an experimental product on your father.
not_available But it was intended to help him.
not_available Here is some literature explaining the protocol.
not_available He should've gotten real blood.
not_available He did.
not_available If you'd just read
not_available I don't care about your study! If he dies, I'm holding you responsible.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available How you feeling? A little better.
not_available Can I talk to you outside for a second? Yeah.
not_available I wanna hear.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Your labs indicate that you're pancytopenic.
not_available You have low blood cell counts.
not_available Well, how low? Tap the bone marrow, see if it's producing cells.
not_available You'll have to get transfusions and be put in an isolation room.
not_available You know, Doug, maybe we should talk outside.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll be back.
not_available A bone
not_available marrow biopsy? He could have the flu.
not_available Wouldn't lower his white cell count.
not_available His counts probably haven't come back because of the chemo.
not_available Jeanie, he needs the biopsy.
not_available I've seen Scott at his worst.
not_available I'm sure Anspaugh would agree.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, I already talked to.
not_available And he said to move forward.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll set up Exam 4 for isolation.
not_available About Scott's pain 
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Natalie Logan.
not_available Off with one hat, on with the other.
not_available Yosh.

not_available Nurse Hathaway.
not_available Hi, Natalie.
not_available Does your dad wanna come back? 
not_available That's okay.
not_available It's not a problem.
not_available Mark, have you seen David Morgenstern? No.
not_available And I'd rather not.
not_available He just spent an hour with my patient talking about her collection of antique creamers.
not_available He might have come back to work a little early.
not_available Oh, we need to discuss this Doug Ross situation at some point.
not_available What situation? Well, it sounds like he's not coming back next year.
not_available Does your father know you're here for birth control? Not exactly.
not_available You won't tell him, will you? Not if you don't want me to.
not_available How have your periods been since your last progesterone injection? Light.
not_available Any pain, leg cramps, visual changes, weight gain? Are you using condoms to prevent sexually transmitted disease? Sometimes my boyfriend forgets.
not_available It's your responsibility too.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available All right.
not_available Here's your follow
not_available up reminder.
not_available Have you come back in three months.
not_available And here are some condoms.
not_available Use them.
not_available I will.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available John? You never returned my call last night.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I need to get a new answering machine.
not_available You also need sleep.
not_available You look like the walking dead.
not_available It's insomnia.
not_available I get it every once in a while.
not_available Try this for a quick fix.
not_available Doctor? Just wanted to say thanks for nothing.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available Fearn.
not_available But your wife's not ready to
not_available Save it for your priest, okay? When I saw your name, I should've asked for someone else.
not_available My name? You're Catholic, right? So? You get points for putting a baby's life ahead of my wife's? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I am Catholic.
not_available And I'm Italian.
not_available And I'm a woman.
not_available And I'm a doctor.
not_available And I have done everything in my power to help your wife and your child.
not_available Dave.
not_available Listen, be patient.
not_available Let her make her decision.
not_available What's this I hear about you not coming back next year? 
not_available Leave it to Weaver.
not_available So it's true? I tried to tell you.
not_available I'm not renewing my fellowship because I'm applying for an Attending position.
not_available I can't be a Fellow forever.
not_available I don't know.
not_available You were on your way to convincing me.
not_available The problem is County General doesn't have a Pedes ER Attending position.
not_available Maybe it should.
not_available A third of the cases that come in are pediatric but nobody's overseeing it.
not_available I wouldn't go that far.
not_available So a Pediatric Attending would increase the care, right? So you're serious? 
not_available Doug, we're ready for that biopsy.
not_available You back me up.
not_available Elizabeth, I hear you got your first HemoAid candidate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And lost him again.
not_available No thanks to Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available What'd he do? 
not_available That's not important.
not_available What can I say, he's a jerk.
not_available Actually, that was perfectly put.
not_available Don't let him get to you.
not_available And if you need a backup, call me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available Peter, what's wrong? Reece has a fever.
not_available I've gotta get him to Carla's and my car won't start.
not_available Plus I've got an ileectomy scheduled.
not_available Well, I could take him.
not_available My car's here.
not_available You know, I don't think that would be a good idea.
not_available Come on, Reece.
not_available I'm a good driver, Peter.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I just think it would be awkward.
not_available Fine.
not_available You drive and I'll keep this little one company.
not_available Hello, sweetheart.
not_available All right, we could just make it.
not_available Go get your coat.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are you looking for a student? 
not_available No.
not_available I see him.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bull's eye.
not_available Kerry.
not_available It's not wise to sneak up on a man when he's got a needle in his hand.
not_available I wanted to check on your eye.
not_available Much better, thank you.
not_available Saline did the trick.
not_available After six months, I figured it couldn't hurt to brush up on my anatomy.
not_available Well, everyone can benefit from that on occasion.
not_available Do you ever think about patients when you work on them? You know, their hopes, their dreams? Honestly, no.
not_available I never did.
not_available But in that trauma room all I could think about was that old grocer's life and how he was relying on me.
not_available I don't know if you heard, but last month I suffered a grand mal seizure during a HAZMAT incident
not_available Then you know.
not_available Know what? About perspective, about looking at the big picture.
not_available I know that the big picture can be humbling maybe even destructive to one's focus and sense of confidence.
not_available Nonsense.
not_available Kerry Weaver, meet John DeLeo, welder, father of five.
not_available Never retired despite crippling arthritis, outlived three of his kids never left Chicago.
not_available You know all that about this cadaver? No.
not_available I made it up.
not_available But if I did know, it wouldn't make me less focused.
not_available It would make me a better doctor.
not_available You're almost there.
not_available Crux of the climb.
not_available Just a few hundred feet to go.
not_available Your fingers search across the rock till you find the perfect handhold.
not_available You feel it? I've got it.
not_available Okay, Scott.
not_available I'm gonna put the needle in now, buddy.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available All you gotta do is just hold on and breathe.
not_available You're almost there.
not_available You're almost to the top.
not_available Okay, I got you.
not_available It's okay, Scott.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available After the E light comes on, I have almost a day's worth of petrol left.
not_available I'm not gonna risk running out of gas in the middle of Garfield Park.
not_available For your sake, I hope you don't inherit your father's stubbornness.
not_available When we get to Carla's restaurant, I'm gonna run in.
not_available So you don't mind waiting out in the car, do you? Are you still in love with her? Carla? It was never love.
not_available But you're worried about her seeing us together.
not_available I'm not worried.
not_available Is it because I'm white? Excuse me? Well, we spend time together.
not_available There's a chemistry.
not_available But there's an obstacle.
not_available Is it racial? Elizabeth, I don't even know how to respond to that.
not_available Damn it! Are you okay? Reece? 
not_available Yeah, we're fine.
not_available Damn it! Oh, my God! Okay, here we go.
not_available Elizabeth, call 911.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Here we go.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available Auto versus pedestrian.
not_available BP's okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? Yes, we got involved in a bit of an accident.
not_available We're here, Miss Ingram.
not_available Finally.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton's involved as well.
not_available Involved? He ran into me.
not_available Reece was with him.
not_available I was at lunch.
not_available I need to call my boss.
not_available Peter, you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let me get it.
not_available No.
not_available I got it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Pulse is 160.
not_available Resps 32.
not_available He cried after it happened.
not_available Now he's become somnolent.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I backed into a pedestrian.
not_available I think he's okay.
not_available He was in his car seat.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll check him out.
not_available Anna, can you take a look? 
not_available Of course.
not_available How's the pedestrian? Don't worry.
not_available She's in good hands.
not_available He feels warm.
not_available He had a fever earlier.
not_available Hey, little fella
not_available No, no.
not_available Get a CT of his head, neck and abdomen first.
not_available Peter, let me look at that head lac? 
not_available Let Anna check out Reece.
not_available No.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Peter, go with him.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Let's get a CBC, type and cross for four.
not_available Let's get a chest and a pelvis.
not_available Dip a urine for blood.
not_available I have to get to work.
not_available Someone's calling your boss.
not_available Harbilas and Kleiderman Law Offices.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got it.
not_available How is she? Superficial lacs, contusions and abrasions.
not_available Pulse ox, 99.
not_available I checked her in the ambulance.
not_available Her abdomen's benign.
not_available Does this hurt? 
not_available Yes! You were more worried about your kid than where you were going.
not_available I tried to explain that you
not_available Peritoneal lavage tray.
not_available Not necessary.
not_available Peter, you shouldn't be in here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Has the trauma team been paged? 
not_available Peter.
not_available Come on.
not_available Do it.
not_available I should go check on Reece.
not_available Anna's taking care of him.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Did you lose consciousness? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I was barely moving.
not_available Well, it doesn't need sutures.
not_available I never saw her.
not_available She was in my blind spot.
not_available Well, don't beat yourself up.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Damn it! I'm missing surgery.
not_available Hey, Peter, Reece is fine.
not_available Did you get a CT? 
not_available Not necessary.
not_available Normal fundi.
not_available He's interactive.
not_available Malik's giving him a bottle.
not_available Thanks, Anna.
not_available Sure.
not_available Stay still.
not_available Romano.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Stay still.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano! Where have you been? Brin's screaming bloody murder.
not_available I was in a car accident.
not_available Why were you out when you had surgery? Dr.
not_available Romano, I'm afraid Peter brought you down here for nothing.
not_available Surgical consults for your victim? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Let's see what damage you've wrought.
not_available What did you tell that woman about me? In the ambulance, she wanted to know what happened.
not_available She works for a damn lawyer.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, these two would like to question you about the accident.
not_available Hi, Jeanie.
not_available Hello.
not_available Doug told me about Dr.
not_available Anspaugh's son.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available He's holding up.
not_available I opened the clinic so the staff can get tested as possible marrow donors.
not_available Jerry's e
not_available mailed the other floors and Anna's making up flyers.
not_available It's a nice gesture, Carol.
not_available I know it's hard to find a match.
not_available But people want to help.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available It's just premature.
not_available His biopsy results aren't even back yet.
not_available Let's give the kid a chance, you know? Now, the pump is computerized.
not_available It'll release the exact amount of pain medicine whenever you push the button.
not_available So you're calling the shots, all right? Can I OD if I press this too much? It's programmed to lock out so that won't happen.
not_available All right.
not_available Be back.
not_available I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
not_available Anspaugh called.
not_available He's concerned about putting Scott on PCA.
not_available He called you? 
not_available He wanted to know the ER's policy.
not_available I told him we didn't have one.
not_available I was unaware you used PCA on kids.
not_available Well, I am.
not_available You should've told me.
not_available Didn't know I needed permission.
not_available Keep me informed.
not_available Would you have told me not to? I'm not asking you to answer to me.
not_available Just speak up.
not_available This is why we need a Pedes Attending.
not_available I'll talk to Anspaugh.
not_available If that's okay? What'd Romano say about her belly? 
not_available He agreed.
not_available It's benign.
not_available And her labs? 
not_available They're not back yet.
not_available You gotta stay on top of this one.
not_available Scary, isn't it? I mean, one mistake and your life changes just like that.
not_available Has she had other complaints? Yeah, she's got a headache.
not_available But I don't think it's anything.
not_available All right.
not_available Order a CT.
not_available A CT? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just do it, okay? 
not_available No, no.
not_available He's been a real trouper.
not_available That's my good boy.
not_available Peter, there you are.
not_available It's just a minor accident.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available He's fine.
not_available What about you? 
not_available It's not as bad as it looks.
not_available I was getting gas.
not_available And then all of a sudden
not_available Yes.
not_available Elizabeth filled me in.
not_available Just the highlights.
not_available Well, I should really be getting Reece home.
not_available Thanks again for taking care of him.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available You feel better now, Reece.
not_available Hey.
not_available Call me if he becomes irritable or lethargic, okay? 
not_available I will.
not_available I will.
not_available All right.
not_available See you.
not_available She takes things in her stride.
not_available Like what? Peter, you've just got to relax.
not_available If I had taken the El or waited for that taxi or got my car fixed, this wouldn't have happened.
not_available You mean, if only I hadn't got involved.
not_available That's it.
not_available Elizabeth, I didn't say that.
not_available No.
not_available You didn't have to.
Diagnosis too many bologna and cheese sandwiches.
not_available And too many hours in front of video games.
not_available Fleets enema? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And the number of the local Cub Scout pack.
not_available Boys need activities.
not_available Stay fit, make friends, have fun, all at the same time.
not_available You came back.
not_available Why wouldn't I? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, I'm losing a pulse on Plazik! 
not_available What's his history? Presented with pyloric stenosis secondary to chronic ulcer disease.
not_available Ate a big lunch followed by bad heartburn.
not_available He take any meds? 
not_available Just bicarb.
not_available Baking soda.
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Probably vasovagal.
not_available Do you think his stomach is distending? Damn! 
not_available Esophageal strictures.
not_available Here.
not_available David, let me try.
not_available No.
not_available I can't get it either.
not_available Get me an 18
not_available gauge needle.
not_available And a syringe.
not_available What are you doing? We gotta decompress him, or he's gonna explode.
not_available Are you sure? Pulse is coming back.
not_available Excellent work, doctor.
not_available Thanks for doing this, Mark.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The bone
not_available marrow drive is a great idea.
not_available I'm glad you and Doug are going out tonight.
not_available What do you mean? He canceled on me.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available I told him we could cancel tonight.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Natalie? Is there a problem? 
not_available Are you "C.
not_available Hathaway, R.N.
not_available "? 
not_available That's me.
not_available I'm Natalie's mother, Abbey Logan.
not_available I found your clinic follow
not_available up note along with these.
not_available Natalie won't talk to me.
not_available So I thought you might.
not_available Confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing Natalie's medical history.
not_available I just want to know what's going on.
not_available I understand that.
not_available Maybe I can answer some questions for Natalie in private.
not_available She might be more willing to discuss this.
not_available Whatever you can do.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie.
not_available I had no idea how much you wanted your own piece of the pie.
not_available I didn't intend to go behind your back.
not_available Never apologize for being ambitious.
not_available I just wish you'd spend your time on a study that was more respectable.
not_available Respectable? Foisting substitute blood on hapless John Does in the ER.
not_available And without consent, it's a bit morally ambiguous, don't you think? 
not_available So you're concerned for my soul.
not_available Among other things.
not_available How'd you like to become the Chicago coordinator for the HemoAid O.R.
not_available study? You are joking.
not_available Drug company's expanding the science and they've asked me to oversee it.
not_available Join me, you'll leap up the ladder from worker bee to queen bee.
not_available It's a generous offer.
not_available Is it contingent on me dropping my ER study? I can't imagine you'd have time for both.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Your parents obviously care.
not_available Trust me.
not_available This would seriously flip them out.
not_available It may reassure them to know you're being responsible about birth control and STDs.
not_available But you're not gonna tell them, right? 
not_available I can't tell them.
not_available And I won't.
not_available Okay.
not_available But sometimes it's worse when you shut out the people who care.
not_available And your mother is concerned.
not_available Your father brought you here.
not_available That wasn't my father.
not_available That man who you saw me with earlier he's my teacher.
not_available Natalie, are you having sex with your teacher? It's not like he forces me to or anything.
not_available I mean, we really love each other, you know? But we keep it quiet.
not_available If Jim's wife found out
not_available He's married? Yeah.
not_available But she's real unstable, his wife.
not_available So he can't tell her just yet.
not_available But when I'm 18, Jim's gonna get a divorce.
not_available This teacher of yours, Jim, he's what? About 40 years old? About that.
not_available Natalie, what he's doing is illegal.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I love him.
not_available And he loves me.
not_available It's simple.
not_available No.
not_available It's definitely not simple.
not_available Biopsy results came in.
not_available And? 
not_available Cancer's back.
not_available How bad? Lymphomas in the bone marrow.
not_available That's why he was so anemic.
not_available I told him it was all behind him.
not_available He made it through before.
not_available He can do it again.
not_available This means bone
not_available marrow transplant.
not_available And more chemo.
not_available He'll have to be isolated because of a greater risk of infection.
not_available I did contact the National Bone Marrow Registry.
not_available His father or his sister could match.
not_available Does he know yet? No.
not_available I was about to go tell him.
not_available His dad's with him.
not_available I thought you'd like to come along.
not_available No.
not_available I think they should have some time alone.
not_available I'll be by later.
not_available All right.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Well, Mr.
not_available Jang, it looks like you've made it through with flying colors.
not_available He doesn't understand English very well.
not_available I just wanted to see how he was doing.
not_available My father wants to thank you for helping save his life.
not_available You're very welcome.
not_available I told him about your blood study.
not_available And even though I still have reservations he'd like to know more about it.
not_available Well, certainly.
not_available With your help, of course.
not_available Should you be here? So how are you feeling? Better.
not_available I'd like to go home now.
not_available As soon as we're sure you're fine.
not_available Your CT came back negative.
not_available But these labs indicate an elevated amylase and lipase.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Carter, you missed something in Miss Ingram's labs.
not_available This level indicates a pancreatic injury.
not_available No.
not_available You missed something.
not_available B.A.L.? Pointone
not_available six.
not_available Did you consume any alcoholic beverages during your lunch break? Great 
news Mr.
not_available Jang's decided to remain in my study.
not_available That's terrific.
not_available I guess you won't need help from me after all.
not_available Actually, I'll still need your support if I'm to make a go of this.
not_available You having second thoughts? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I'm staying put.
not_available It may not be the smartest move, but it feels like the thing to do.
not_available Are you behind this marrow drive? I'm very touched.
not_available Actually, it was Carol Hathaway's idea.
not_available How did Scott take the news? That boy continues to surprise me.
not_available He is determined to beat this thing.
not_available He has a spirit I haven't seen before.
not_available Have you told Scott about your health status? No.
not_available Of course not.
not_available I didn't think so.
not_available Somehow he senses something.
not_available Respects you as a kindred spirit.
not_available Anyway, I know he's eager to see you.
not_available I wonder how many donors actually match for a bone
not_available marrow transplant? I heard less than 1 percent.
not_available I guess I won't wait by the phone.
not_available How's Chase? Still pretty early.
not_available You know Chase.
not_available When can I visit him? You know, Kenner's kind of strict about visitors.
not_available I know.
not_available Tell him I said hi.
not_available You bet.
not_available Your turn.
not_available You know, she confided in me because she thought her secret was safe.
not_available Providing birth control is one thing.
not_available Sexual abuse is something else.
not_available I hope it won't scare other kids from coming to the clinic.
not_available She did the right thing coming here.
not_available This is one unique case.
not_available Well, let's hope.
not_available This guy's a 40year
not_available old man, he's a teacher, he's married and having sex with a minor.
not_available Carol, a policewoman's asking for you.
not_available You got a crime to report? Yeah.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available She sobered up, and thought twice about getting a lawyer? She said, "I wanna crawl under a rock and pretend it never happened.
not_available " Well, she's not the only one.
not_available You were lucky, hon.
not_available Peter.
not_available I thought I'd missed you.
not_available Listen, I ran into Dr.
not_available Brin.
not_available I convinced him to let me assist on a thyroidectomy in the morning.
not_available I wanna check on Reece.
not_available So I think we should cancel.
not_available I assumed that.
not_available I need my car keys.
not_available Thank you, Peter.
not_available It was a thrill to see you in action again.
not_available We make a good team, you and I.
not_available I'm sorry if I was presumptive before.
not_available You're a conscientious person.
not_available It makes you a good doctor.
not_available And a good manager.
not_available I tried to fill the void while you were on leave.
not_available And surpassed me.
not_available Probably because of your sincere interest in all things administrative.
not_available I never gave a damn about the bureaucracy before.
not_available Didn't interest me then.
not_available And now? And now everything interests me.
not_available Carol, Anna, you two have plans this evening? I did, and then I didn't, and now I don't know.
not_available I'm free.
not_available Why? Fancy a girls' night at my place? 
not_available I make a mean cosmopolitan.
not_available That sounds good.
not_available Say 8:00? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't know what you two are doing, but I have plans this evening.
not_available So have fun.
not_available Together again.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I've made women cry before.
not_available How you feeling? Well, this helps.
not_available Are you sure you're not being Mr.
not_available Tough Guy like earlier? No.
not_available I really feel better.
not_available Good.
not_available My dad said that you could come to Yosemite with us if you wanted to, I mean.
not_available Yeah, I'd like to.
not_available Hey, the Bone Marrow Registry found eight people who preliminarily match your marrow type.
not_available Eight? That's my lucky number.
not_available We still have further matching to do, you know? Hey, it's a start.
not_available Right? Yeah.
not_available It's a start.
not_available Seven brothers, seven sisterinlaws, 
not_available Number 13 on the way.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available You're considered the family freak.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available My Aunt Tessa bursts into tears every time she sees me.
not_available Well, my parents cope by treating me like a bachelor son.
not_available Your families must be proud of you two.
not_available Oh, sure they are.
not_available But you, Carol, have something that I really envy.
not_available What? A sex life! Cheers to that! I have no complaints in that department.
not_available Give us more than that.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Please.
not_available Let's live vicariously, please! You wanna hear about my sex life? 
not_available Yes! Yes! Okay.
not_available What do you wanna know? Hold that thought.
not_available Pizza's here.
not_available Let me get it.
not_available No, no.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Peter? I know I should've called first.
not_available But I 
not_available You're right.
not_available I was? Yeah.
not_available I do have a problem dating white women.
not_available This isn't really the time to
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available There's a lot you don't understand
not_available Hey, Elizabeth, do you need some more money? I didn't know you had company.
not_available Hi, Peter.
not_available Bye, Peter.
not_available It was a spurofthe
not_available moment thing.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available You don't need to explain.
not_available Peter, we could do it another time now that you know where I live.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Hey, cuz.
not_available What you watching? CNN? Anything going on in the world that I should know about? Here.
not_available I brought you something.
not_available It's Walker Evans.
not_available A complete retrospective of his work.
not_available I think there's a photograph in here that you love if I can find it.
not_available Evening, John.
not_available Hi, Joyce.
not_available Why, Chase, look at that book your cousin brought you.
not_available Okay, Chase.
not_available Take a sip.
not_available Oh, no! Your book! That's okay.
not_available Book's fine.
not_available Book's fine.
not_available He's been having more trouble with that hand.
not_available There you go.
not_available Not a perfect match.
not_available But it'll do.
not_available Thanks, Joyce.
not_available There we go.
not_available You want to try it? Okay, okay.
not_available Hey, I'll do it.
not_available I'll do it.
