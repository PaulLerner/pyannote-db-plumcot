not_available He's shown us 17 houses 
not_available not one of them close.
not_available Don't think the problem could be us? All right, what about this one? No.
not_available It doesn't seem fair to schedule it like that.
not_available You work all night, now you gotta rush back.
not_available You're tired.
not_available What do you mean, I'm tired? Do I look like I'm tired? Of course not.
not_available No.
not_available You look chipper.
not_available It's just
not_available Smoodge.
not_available You're just
not_available You're worrying so much.
not_available You know, they don't schedule tenure meetings around the candidates.
not_available Hey, at least you're overthinking the wardrobe.
not_available I am not worrying.
not_available And I am not overthinking.
not_available You know, tenure means financial security.
not_available We could get a house, start a college fund for Cosmo.
not_available What if Cosmo doesn't want to go to college? What? 
not_available Baby, I can go back to work.
not_available I know.
not_available You can make more at a private hospital.

not_available I did not faint.
not_available I was tripped.
not_available It was witnessed.
not_available Syncopal event at his club.
not_available Unconscious 30 seconds.
not_available Who told you that? Those old geezers? They're unconscious most of the day.
not_available Must've been a long ride.
not_available Oh, tell me about it.
not_available Get out of here! Bring back the omelet! 
not_available Okay, we'll see what we can do.
not_available Now! Delirium, tachycardia, hyperthermia, mydriasis.
not_available Better not have spinach! 
not_available What do you think? Don't get high by snorting antihistamines? I hate spinach.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available This is classic.
not_available Mad as a hatter, red as a beet 
not_available Dry as a bone.
not_available Anticholinergic toxicity.
not_available Bingo.
not_available What's your plan? IV, tox screen, activated charcoal.
not_available Yes.
not_available What else? 
not_available EKG, rule out cardiac effects.
not_available Ativan for the agitation.
not_available Excellent.
not_available And what happens if the delirium worsens despite benzos? Physostigmine.
not_available The only acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that crosses the blood
not_available brain barrier.
not_available Everybody get that? Where do I sign to get out of here? We need to examine you first.
not_available If I wanted help, I wouldn't come to this place looking for it.
not_available I want another hospital.
not_available We're just gonna check you out.
not_available I don't want this place.
not_available It won't take long.
not_available I don't want your doctors.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, we need you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Especially that one.
not_available I don't want that one anywhere near me.
not_available He killed my wife.
not_available Sam, what's the deal with my lymphoma guy? CT was ready for him 40 minutes ago.
not_available Man, I totally spaced.
not_available I'll go take him.

not_available Okay.

not_available That was the Guatemalan blend.
not_available I said sorry.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's move some bodies.
not_available Transfer from Seashore House, fever and incontinence.
not_available I got stuck with the last dump.
not_available Abby, I'll trade you.

not_available No, Ray.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Neela, 85year

not_available And as much as I hate doing this to you, I'm out of here.
not_available Exam 3.
not_available I've served on the curriculum and admissions committees for three years.
not_available And we appreciate that.
not_available We're also looking for excellence in teaching.
not_available You've won the Resident teaching award three years running.
not_available That's very impressive.
not_available Seven years as an Attending only four publications? 
not_available No original research? First author? I just submitted a review article.
not_available And I have other studies lined up.
not_available I'm waiting to hear about the grants.
not_available Emergency medicine's a smorgasbord.
not_available Sometimes it's hard to find your niche.
not_available Excuse me? The university is willing to float junior faculty for a few years.
not_available But
not_available Tenured Attendings need the ability to carry their own weight.
not_available You mean, bring in grant money.
not_available Okay, my focus hasn't been research.
not_available I've spent the last seven years becoming a good clinician and teacher.
not_available That's clear, Susan.
not_available And we put a great deal of value on that.
not_available Well, I don't want you to do anything until I can talk to my own doctor 
not_available Stanley Obermeyer.
not_available Right.
not_available We have a call in to him.
not_available Yeah? Well, Stanley's not gonna like what you guys are doing, prodding me here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux, I can't hear while you're talking.
not_available You've been listening for 5 minutes.
not_available You've been talking for 5 minutes.
not_available Anyone ever tell you you have a murmur? 
not_available A what? A murmur? The sound of blood rushing through the heart.
not_available You think I have that? 
not_available I'm pretty sure, yeah.
not_available Oh, "pretty sure"? Is that all you can say? I'd like to run some tests.
not_available What tests? EKG, chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Draw some blood.
not_available Look, no offense, but I don't want some nurse calling the shots around here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux, I am not a nurse.
not_available I am a doctor.
not_available Well, you're not my doctor.
not_available And I'm not gonna let you do anything else until I talk to him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jeez.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Take a deep breath for me.
not_available Sats 88 on a nonrebreather.
not_available Is he dead? Is my husband dead? 
not_available Behind us.
not_available Doctors are working on him.
not_available He's alive? Wife fired a couple of rounds to his chest.
not_available Pulse at 133, BP, 90 palp, went apneic in the rig.
not_available Access? Two large
not_available bore IVs.
not_available Liter en route.
not_available Another day, another happy couple.
not_available All right, on my 
count One, two, three.
not_available Two of Versed right away.
not_available Your husband stabbed you? He cornered me in the kitchen, had a knife to my throat.
not_available Definite ETOH.
not_available Have you been drinking, Mrs.
not_available Casey? I didn't know what to do.
not_available I grabbed his gun from the kitchen.
not_available Decreased breath sounds.
not_available You have a collapsed lung.
not_available I need to reinflate it.
not_available Sam, you were supposed to check the airway boxes.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available According to the schedule.
not_available I thought it was Malik's turn.
not_available We're out of 8.Os.
not_available Malcolm, who's sorry now, you bastard? 
not_available What did you do? Take a vacation? Not my fault Sam didn't stock the shelves.
not_available Tube.
not_available I can barely palpate a femoral.
not_available Heart rate's up to 140.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hang the Oneg and call for type
not_available specific.
not_available Ray, he needs an IJ.
not_available And a surgeon.
not_available O.R.
not_available 3's on hold.
not_available You got this? I need to check next door.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Her lungs are down.
not_available She's stable but she's agitated.
not_available Sam, where's that Versed? What are they doing? 
not_available Here you go.
not_available I was getting it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I was just right here.
not_available I've got it covered, Luka.
not_available Okay.
not_available They better not send him home.
not_available I'm changing the locks, not gonna let him in.
not_available Mary, you need to calm down and answer some questions for me.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Some hospital.
not_available And what year is it? 
not_available 2005.
not_available Good.
not_available And where do you live? 
not_available West Garfield.
not_available West Garfield? Do you got a problem with that? Bilateral crackles, 3/6, harsh systolic murmur JVD and the liver's down four centimeters.
not_available You heard him.
not_available He doesn't wanna see me.
not_available Why don't you present to Kovac? 
not_available Tied up in a trauma.
not_available We're waiting on call from his doc.
not_available I got him to calm down by promising to bring in an experienced physician.
not_available Which means an Attending.
not_available Means you.
not_available All right.
not_available Any cardiac history there? Chronic CHF and evidence of an old infarct.
not_available I sent off troponins.
not_available I'll get an EKG when you're done.
not_available And did Obermeyer call yet? Hello.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I remember your name.
not_available Ten years, I don't forget.
not_available I understandYou remember my name? Rubadoux? 
not_available That's a very unusual name.
not_available You don't even remember.
not_available And you don't remember my wife then either, do you? Just some other old person.
not_available Give them the old song and dance and ship them off.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need to hear from your doctor.
not_available So in the meantime
not_available I knew she didn't have much time left.
not_available But why did you have to put her through all that? My sweet Sylvie.
not_available Keeping a smile every step of the way.
not_available Let's take a quick listen.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I want my own doctor.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux, he's the Attending.
not_available He has to examine you.
not_available What do you mean, "has to"? What is there, a law around here a rule when you come into this place? Yes.
not_available Actually, there is.
not_available All right.
not_available Make it fast.
not_available What was that about? A very unsatisfied customer.
not_available He needs an echo.
not_available I called Kayson.
not_available He's on it.
not_available Radiology called about that kid with the huge head.
not_available Hydroceph? 
not_available Hydrocephalus, yeah.
not_available I'll call Neurosurg.
not_available Even more of a handful than before.
not_available You remember him? Don't let him get to you, Carter.
not_available It was a long time ago and you were just a student.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, thought you were off.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Don't ask.
not_available Been paging you.
not_available I was in a meeting.
not_available I turned my pager off.
not_available Got a double trauma.
not_available Long as you are here
not_available I'm not here.
not_available The meeting got changed to 3:30.
not_available What? 
not_available That's why I've been paging you.
not_available I just worked all night.
not_available I can't stay till 3:30.
not_available "Rubba
not_available ducks"? Rubadoux, Sylvie.
not_available How long will this take? Tenyear
not_available old chart? Could be a while.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available Certainly thinks highly of you.
not_available Well, that's very flattering coming from him.
not_available Oh, and don't get me wrong.
not_available He was brilliant.
not_available But he drove us crazy.
not_available Made us do a full workup on every single sniffle.
not_available Well, that's my Dr.
not_available Obermeyer.
not_available Nothing if not thorough.
not_available Dilated left ventricle, gradient's 86.
not_available Those calcifications? I'm listening to the doctor, please.
not_available Ejection fraction's only 45, but seeing as he presented with both syncope and failure, there's really only one option.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux, you have critical aortic stenosis.
not_available One of the valves in your heart is narrowed.
not_available We have to operate to open that valve.
not_available Operate? When? 
not_available Well, as soon as possible.
not_available Your heart's not generating enough force to push blood through that constriction.
not_available And you can do something about that? Well, we have to run a few tests.
not_available But, yes, we can.
not_available I'll talk to Anspaugh.
not_available You check his BUN, creatinine, order PFTs.
not_available Hang in there, Mr.
not_available Rubadoux.
not_available Call me Ruby.
not_available Ruby.
not_available Hey, pretty lucky, huh? Same school as my doc.
not_available Nothing personal but they both have a little bit more water under the bridge 
not_available if you know what I mean.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available Did you understand everything he said? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I need a heart operation.
not_available Do you have any questions? 
not_available Heart surgery's a big deal.
not_available I know that.
not_available What, am I an idiot? Well, do you also know that, given your age the risks of surgery are higher? What risks? 
not_available Complications.
not_available I mean, I need to get some more information on your lung function and your kidneys.
not_available Something wrong with my kidneys? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, why don't you come back when you're less confused.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux, I just want you to understand that this surgery is very serious.
not_available And that we don't know yet if you're even a good candidate.
not_available And that it's important you consider all of your options.
not_available Listen, doll can you fix my heart? No.
not_available Then I'm going with the guy who can.
not_available All right? Bye.
not_available Prior Ml, marginal ventricular function, and his creatinine's 2.3.
not_available He's 85.
not_available He has significant coronary
not_available artery disease renal insufficiency and a history of COPD.
not_available What do you think about his lungs? 
not_available We can check his PFTs, but he's old.
not_available They're not gonna be perfect.
not_available Anything else you want? Send coags.
not_available Have him typed and crossed.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry, but don't you think, just maybe open
not_available heart surgery might not be such a good idea for this man? Don't you think just maybe that's the surgeon's call? Actually, no.
not_available I think it's the patient's call.
not_available He could spend the rest of his life on a beach in Miami 
not_available or hooked up to a ventilator.
not_available He wants the surgery.
not_available She's trying to advocate on behalf of her patient.
not_available CICU's full and Mr.
not_available Rubadoux needs a bed.
not_available She could advocate for him there.
not_available Anspaugh's on his way down.
not_available What? So how's it going in there? I'll take a 12yearold gangster over a domestic
not_available violence case any day.
not_available She said she was from West Garfield.
not_available I figured I should give you a call.
not_available But I wasn't sure if this was a Ceasefire kind of thing.
not_available Every shooting is a Ceasefire thing.
not_available If she gets out of this mess, there's a lot we could do for her.
not_available I don't know.
not_available She seems pretty far gone to me.
not_available How do you stay so optimistic? 
not_available How do you? What? Stay optimistic? I don't.
not_available Three years in this place, I'm jaded as hell.
not_available You just saw a drunk, battered woman who shot her abusive husband 
not_available and saw some hope in the situation.
not_available I did? You wouldn't have called me if you didn't think I could help.
not_available I see right through you, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Is that right? We'll follow up with her after she's discharged.
not_available So that's it? You're done? 
not_available For now.
not_available Shouldn't you stick around? She's bound to have questions 
not_available once sedation wears off.
not_available You can handle it.
not_available But I don't know too much about domestic
not_available violence counseling.
not_available I would love to give you a lengthy tutorial 
not_available but I'm out of time.
not_available How about later? You can school me over dinner.
not_available Pick me up at the office at 7.
not_available Is this gonna take long? 
not_available We've already been here quite a while.
not_available We'll need to be going soon.
not_available You had a low
not_available grade temperature when the nurse took it earlier.
not_available Beautiful girl.
not_available Caramel skin.
not_available Like a young June Allyson.
not_available Maureen O'Sullivan.
not_available Susan Hayward.
not_available Ava Gardner.
not_available Myrna Loy.
not_available Sophia Loren.
not_available Sophia Loren? Okay.
not_available I heard some crackles on the right side.
not_available Could be a sign of a lung infection.
not_available You'll need to have a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Crackles? 
not_available The other doctor didn't mention crackles.
not_available No.
not_available That's right.
not_available You were in here over a week ago.
not_available You saw Dr.
not_available Lockhart? Lovely woman.
not_available Like a young Patty Duke.
not_available Now, your aortic valve right here is stiff and stuck shut.
not_available What we're going to do is cut out all of the stenotic material and replace it with a porcine valve.
not_available So it's definite he's having surgery? It is.
not_available Isn't it? I mean, it'sIt's the only way to go, right? We could treat you with digoxin and diuretics, but that would be short
not_available term.
not_available At this stage, surgery's the only definitive treatment.
not_available Just so you know, Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, his FEV 1 is only 53 percent.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Make him NPO after midnight.
not_available And don't his decreased lung capacity and renal insufficiency strongly con
not_available ? What I mean is, shouldn't we be discussing the risks? Yeah.
not_available But we talked about all that.
not_available The risk, the complications, the kidneys.
not_available We're going to talk about them again, Mr.
not_available Rubadoux.
not_available Call me Ruby.
not_available Will you excuse me for just a minute? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available I take it you have a problem with Mr.
not_available Rubadoux's decision to have surgery.
not_available I'm concerned it's not an informed decision, yes.
not_available And is that because you failed to adequately explain the risks? Do you think I would operate on this man if he didn't understand the consequences? Why would I do that? Because I have nothing better to do? 
not_available No, certainly.
not_available If you have concerns you ask the consulting doctor to step outside.
not_available You do not, in front of a patient, attempt to subtly disagree with the senior cardiologist and the chief of surgery.
not_available That kind of behavior is helpful to no one.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I have concerns.
not_available Knowing you as well as I do I'm gonna guess you really hate it when people do this.
not_available The comefrombehindandputyourhandsoverthe
not_available eyes thing? Yeah.
not_available Words cannot express exactly how much I hate it.
not_available Pretty cool that I knew that, don't you think? Bad timing? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Want to talk about it? 
not_available No.
not_available So I'm back.
not_available Oh, my God, Jake.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available How was San Francisco? Amazing faculty.
not_available Lots of O.R.
not_available time.
not_available I thought Boston was first until I saw UCSF 
not_available but it's a long shot.
not_available They wouldn't have invited you if they weren't interested.
not_available Where's Carter? 
not_available MRI.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So UCSF, huh? Yes.
not_available I liked it.
not_available But, you know, I still could match right here.
not_available Yup.
not_available What would happen if I did that? Well, Jake, then you'd be working at County.
not_available Dirk Harmon, 14.
not_available Crashed headfirst into a retaining wall 
not_available while luging down Sheridan Road.
not_available Luging? Street luge.
not_available Don't you watch those guys on ESPN? When do you watch ESPN? 
not_available Pulse, 72.
not_available BP, 112/65.
not_available Sats 100.
not_available I'm Dr.

not_available All right.

not_available Just noticed it.
not_available Pratt, hold the C
not_available spine.
not_available Let's move him carefully.
not_available Hey.
not_available I need to talk to you about the Rubadoux thing.
not_available Birdy Chaddock, 72yearold female with cough and low
not_available grade temp.
not_available Sats fine.
not_available No shortness of breath, right middle lobe infiltrate on the film.
not_available She was your patient last week so perhaps for continuity of care In with the same thing? 
not_available No.
not_available Had facial contusions.
not_available Her sister was with her? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available She's here this time too.
not_available She's got family support.
not_available Treat her like an outpatient, send her home.
not_available They're panhandlers.
not_available Both.
not_available Everybody's gotta make a living.
not_available What is wrong with you? 
not_available She won't get better on the streets.
not_available Call Social Services 
not_available hook her up with elder assistance.
not_available They did express interest in leaving soon.
not_available Call Social Services.
not_available Okay, about Mr.
not_available Rubadoux.
not_available Nobody is painting him a clear picture.
not_available Surgery is a lousy choice.
not_available His choice.
not_available He does not have an objective view.
not_available Seventeenyear
not_available old, avulsed finger.
not_available Sign so we can treat without the parents.
not_available How'd he do it? 
not_available Slammed his hand in the car door.
not_available Somebody needs to talk to him.

not_available You're the Attending.
not_available He's old school.
not_available He needs to hear it from a guy.

not_available Girl Scout cookies.
not_available I'm feeling the pressure.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll find you later, all right? Just 
not_available Okay.
not_available What is going on with you? Why keep blowing this off? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available You tried to stop our conversation to buy Girl Scout cookies.
not_available Talk to this guy.
not_available I'm not the one to do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't know exactly what went on between you and him, but right now
not_available Look.
not_available Once in a while you're gonna find these old guys that would rather be treated by a gray
not_available haired guy with a white coat.
not_available Figure out a way of getting to him.
not_available Been trying for an hour.
not_available He's a wall.
not_available Well, then you did your job.
not_available Move on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available Yes, Jerry.

not_available I didn't wanna just yank the helmet off.
not_available Pretty cool, huh? Dude, one move, they'll slice through your head.
not_available Shut up, man.
not_available This is gnarly.
not_available Compared to the Gravity Games, this is nothing, man.
not_available Except for a little cord compression.
not_available Anybody seen Carter? He's probably at the meeting where Luka and I are supposed to be.
not_available Anspaugh wants a central line on our aortic
not_available stenosis patient.
not_available Pratt, go help Abby.
not_available I'll finish that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sterile 9s and prep for a cordis.
not_available Nice suit, Morris.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's important for the Chief Resident to project a certain professionalism.
not_available And I must say, life in the ER doesn't offer enough opportunity to dress up.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available You haven't missed anything.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, if you don't mind.
not_available The lights, please.
not_available "CHIEF RESIDENT" The Chief Resident in a busy, urban ER must wear many 
hats Teacher, mentor, counselor, friend.
not_available SCHEDULING TASK MASTER Over the course of the next hour Hour? I will review my proposed strategy for making the Residents' schedule and address how the new ACGME/RRC work
not_available hour mandates apply.
not_available I will also identify common stumbling blocks that may affect the schedule and present my patented win
not_available win approach to problems and changes.
not_available Next slide.
not_available You can't just leave.
not_available Oh, yes, at our age we can.
not_available I'm sorry Social Services is backed up but we need them to see you before you go.
not_available We saw them the last time we were here.
not_available Lovely woman.
not_available Oh, a regular young
not_available No, no.
not_available God, no, please.
not_available Please, just
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett, we are grateful.
not_available And we're gonna do the best we can.
not_available But it's important that we leave now.
not_available We cannot miss the rush hour at the El.
not_available And if it gets you in any kind of trouble, I'm so sorry.
not_available We could write you a note.
not_available A note? It's not gonna be good enough.
not_available You see last week, two of my other patients, they left on me.
not_available And my boss is really unhappy with me.
not_available He says if this happens again, they're gonna send me toAway? 
not_available Well, to the morgue.
not_available The morgue? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's a big demotion.
not_available He's clever.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available You gotta give him that.
not_available Page me from MRl.
not_available I wanna see the scan.
not_available Sam, what's going on? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'm cleaning up and restocking.
not_available Is this about the luge boy? 
not_available You were encouraging him.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available Pratt and Ray, that I can understand.
not_available Sam, I wasn't.
not_available And you're overreacting.
not_available A little bit? I'm just having a bad day.
not_available I have a headache.
not_available Just
not_available Hey, just tell them you wanna leave early.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available No, really.
not_available Tell them you wanna go home.
not_available If there are any complaints, they can talk to me.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Okay, aim your needle inferiorly.
not_available And watch the screen as you enter the vein.
not_available How are we doing, Mr.
not_available Rubadoux? I don't know.
not_available You tell me.
not_available Doing just great.
not_available Got a flash.
not_available Guidewire.
not_available What is that? What's going on? 
not_available It's okay, Mr.
not_available Rubadoux.
not_available Throwing PVCs.
not_available Pull back.
not_available Run of V
not_available tach.
not_available Pull back.
not_available Yeah, I am.
not_available I'm nowhere near the myocardium.
not_available I don't feel right.
not_available V
not_available tach again.
not_available All right, I'm coming out.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Hang in there.
not_available A hundred of lido.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux? Mr.
not_available Rubadoux? All right, let's get him into a trauma room now.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available With the Morris
not_available modified circadian scheduling system we can build needed flexibility into the program.
not_available A sample sequence might go like 
this Three days, two off, three evenings, two off, three nights, two off
not_available 911.
not_available It's the ER.
not_available Liar.
not_available Morris, I apologize.
not_available I'll put a hard copy in your box.
not_available That would be great.
not_available Get on with it, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Three nights, two off, and repeat until the end of the block.
not_available Next slide.
not_available Good news.
not_available Social Services is
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is our niece, Shelley.
not_available I just found out they were here.
not_available Thank you for taking care of them.
not_available We wanted to leave, didn't we, doctor? Yes, we did try, right? You made
not_available You made us stay.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available So now Shelley's here, we can go with her.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You have to wait
not_available Could we talk? Oh, yes.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available Listen, we're waiting on Social Services to come down here.
not_available Yes.
not_available And they're wonderful.
not_available They've been so helpful.
not_available But, you know, it's been a long day and they're both 
not_available They're really getting tired.
not_available It shouldn't be too much longer.
not_available They're both so stubborn those two.
not_available I
not_available I've been trying to get them to move in with me.
not_available You know, they just
not_available They want their independence.
not_available So they can panhandle.
not_available Isn't that unbelievable? Yeah.
not_available I told them that I could get them right home, into a hot bath.
not_available Our oldest moved in with her boyfriend.
not_available We've got the extra bedroom now.
not_available I just
not_available I've tried everything.
not_available I don't know what else to do.
not_available I don't know how to make them accept some family support.
not_available Okay, let me talk to them, all right? Okay.
not_available Birdy? Rebecca? Still V
not_available tach.
not_available All right, another epi.
not_available Chase it with lido.
not_available All right, switch out.
not_available Set up to intubate.
not_available What happened? 
not_available A central line.
not_available It was fine until he started having runs of V
not_available tach.
not_available Must have an irritable myocardium.
not_available Three
not_available sixty.
not_available Clear.
not_available No change.
not_available Why is Anspaugh opening this guy up? 
not_available Critical AS.
not_available Epi's in.
not_available Move that.
not_available Man can't tolerate a central line, he isn't gonna do well in the O.R.
not_available He wants the surgery.
not_available So what? 
not_available So we're giving it to him.
not_available Those guys got nothing better to do? Damn it.
not_available I think I broke his rib.
not_available All right, clear.
not_available Normal sinus.
not_available That's what I'm talking about.
not_available The Chief Resident position is 90 percent administrative.
not_available Morris can handle that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But even the med students think he's a joke.
not_available We should get someone from the outside.
not_available It's very difficult on the staff.
not_available You came from the outside.
not_available How did the Morris meeting go? 
not_available You missed a fascinating lecture on circadian scheduling.
not_available We're not giving it to him though, right? 
not_available Considering it.
not_available You out of your mind? If you don't show up
not_available I was in a trauma.
not_available What did Carter say? We should vote.
not_available You can't.
not_available You weren't there.
not_available I don't care.
not_available On 36 hours.
not_available I have to go.
not_available And I'm late.
not_available John.
not_available What happened on the meeting? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I left.
not_available Kerry's leaning towards him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, okay.
not_available "Well, okay"? We've had worse.
not_available Don't think so.
not_available Then maybe she won't give it to him.
not_available Hey, Frank, can you come and find me when the labs are back on Gase in 2? Yeah.
not_available Got it.
not_available You were gonna take that haggard mom, five kids, Exam 3.
not_available Rubadoux's back, complaining about his tube and telling the nurses no Jell
not_available O.
not_available Good.
not_available I told Kayson and Anspaugh about the ribs and the resultant pneumothorax.
not_available What about the surgery? 
not_available Not right away.
not_available They're going to stabilize him in CICU for a few days, let the pneumo resolve.
not_available But everyone remains hopeful.
not_available We're just waiting on a bed.
not_available DON'T SHOOT.
not_available I WANT TO GROW UP.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available How you doing? Looking for Olivia Evans.
not_available I'm supposed to meet her.
not_available She's in the back.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Three grandmothers reclaimed 78th and Hermitage by opening a bakery.
not_available Turned one of the roughest corners in our city into a coffee klatch.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, just in time.
not_available Everyone, this is Greg Pratt.
not_available He's an ER doc at County.
not_available Hello.
not_available How y'all doing? Dr.
not_available Pratt gets to see how senseless shootings are overwhelming our city's hospitals.
not_available And we were just talking about various job opportunities in the neighborhood.
not_available So maybe you'd like to say something about jobs in health care? 
not_available Felix, get back here.
not_available This is for Tasha's ear infection.
not_available Twice a day for a week.
not_available Holly's the one with the ear.
not_available Right.
not_available Tasha has the eczema.
not_available Apply to the affected area three times a day for a week.
not_available Just like the ears.
not_available No.
not_available Ears twice a day.
not_available Rash, three.
not_available Found him.
not_available He was running off with your hammer.
not_available Thanks, Chuny.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available I'm gonna go.
not_available Good night.
not_available I could use a little help here.
not_available One, two, three, four, five.
not_available I'm off.
not_available I'll be home by 8.
not_available You wanna grab a dinner? I'm kind of beat.
not_available Maybe stay in tonight.
not_available Okay.
not_available See you later.
not_available Good night.
not_available Coffee? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry to hear it.
not_available Really awful this time of night.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available "EMERGENCY" When I was a student on my surgical rotation, Rubadoux's wife was very sick.
not_available She was part of this research study.
not_available When her results
not_available When she wasn't useful, there was pressure to get her out.
not_available So I did.
not_available I dumped her into a nursing home.
not_available Did she belong in one? We all figured she'd end up back in the hospital.
not_available But she'd be on the Medical Service and not ours.
not_available So Surgery dumps another patient on Medicine.
not_available Happens every day.
not_available I told Rubadoux that she was gonna get better.
not_available I told him that her situation was gonna improve.
not_available I told him what he wanted to hear.
not_available You know, when you're a student you're so desperate for approval.
not_available You want patients to like you, their families to like you.
not_available You gotta be efficient too, though.
not_available You gotta impress your superiors.
not_available You don't have to tell me.
not_available I'm still on the bottom rung of the ladder.
not_available When the Chief of Surgery says, "Get rid of her," you do.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And then she came back about three days later and she died and Rubadoux was so surprised.
not_available Ultimately, it was the Attending's call.
not_available Wasn't my responsibility.
not_available You wanna help with this? 
not_available All right.
not_available Take it easy, man.
not_available You too, man.
not_available Right.
not_available One of my guys has a real thing for science.
not_available I could bring him to County, have you show him around.
not_available Sure.
not_available Never been out of the neighborhood.
not_available Don't realize there's a city.
not_available I know.
not_available I was 10 before I saw Lake Michigan.
not_available You from Chicago? Any relation to Charlie Pratt? Charlie Pratt who works for Parks and Recs over on Lamont? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The older fellow.
not_available I don't know him.
not_available Hey, that was a really nice meeting tonight.
not_available I gotta run.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's nice meeting you.
not_available You too.
not_available You're still speaking to me.
not_available Yeah, I think so.
not_available I'm not sorry.
not_available I want you to see what we do.
not_available You'd never come on your own.
not_available And I'm not apologizing about the tuna casserole.
not_available But since you're being such a good sport, I'm willing to buy dessert.
not_available So ice cream or keylime pie? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What? 
not_available Dessert? Past your bedtime? No, no.
not_available It's just that I have this patient I have to check back on in the ER.
not_available Well, then, I guess
not_available I guess you'd better be going.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available "PREGNANCY TEST" Fifteen ninety
not_available five.
not_available Where you going, Ray? Look, I know I'm on for another half
not_available hour, but I have taken care of everything.
not_available Filled in Abby on all my cases.
not_available Is Abby your Attending? Right.
not_available Ulnar fracture up getting casted in Ortho.
not_available Malignant otitis admitted to ENT.
not_available Tongue lac wants a vasectomy, you know, as long as he's here.
not_available Gonna follow that up with Urology.
not_available Oh, and the Olsen twins.
not_available They decided to leave with their niece and a Z
not_available PAK.
not_available Follow
not_available up in a week.
not_available What did Social Services say? They actually didn't make it down.
not_available I mean, in time.
not_available But you released them anyway? I felt they had a strong family support system.
not_available These are the panhandlers, right? You felt comfortable releasing them to a family member who obviously hasn't been much help so far.
not_available Their niece, yes.
not_available She admitted it's been hard getting them to accept help.
not_available They are moving in with her now.
not_available Is Social Services going to follow up? I mean, seeing as how you prevented them from doing their job today.
not_available I will make those arrangements.
not_available I need to know everything.
not_available I need to know the status of every 
one How they are, where they are, where they're going, why they're going You're still an intern, Ray.
not_available I'm the Attending.
not_available I'm responsible.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hernia guy's HMO is refusing to cover.
not_available He's not stable.
not_available I'm not discharging.
not_available You wanna tell them? 
not_available I'll call.
not_available Sedation for Mr.
not_available Garrity.
not_available Kovac was there.
not_available He can sign them.
not_available Okay.
not_available Won't believe this.
not_available Your tibial fracture's 
not_available requesting an organic cast.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux? I'm not feeling well.
not_available So if you don't mind.
not_available I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
not_available I couldn't believe it when I saw you.
not_available You're still here.
not_available Been 10 years since my My Silvie's gone and you're still here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you didn't even remember.
not_available Oh, well.
not_available They gave me six other doctors so I won't need you this time.
not_available I made a mistake with your wife.
not_available And I made a mistake with you.
not_available You don't think I know that? You don't think I regret ever bringing my poor Silvie down to this damn place? You and your fancy tests.
not_available "We'll put her through this.
not_available We'll put her through that." "Oh, Sylvie? Oh, she'll practically be back onstage dancing again." 
not_available Well, we did try.
not_available You tried? You tried? It became a very complicated situation.
not_available And I didn't have the experience to handle it properly.
not_available All you had to be was a human being.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available And I believed you.
not_available My Silvie.
not_available My Silvie.
not_available She was really something.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux what you have wrong with you, aortic stenosis can oftentimes be corrected with surgery.
not_available But that doesn't mean that that's the right thing for you to do.
not_available You're 85 years old.
not_available You have chronic respiratory problems.
not_available The chances of you coming through surgery and getting back to the shape that you're in right 
now Pretty slim.
not_available If you go ahead with it, there is a good chance that you will never leave this hospital again.
not_available You'll be connected to a ventilator and you will live out the remainder of your life in the Intensive Care Unit.
not_available Now, without the surgery, it's true, you're not gonna get any better.
not_available But I believe that you will leave this hospital under your own power.
not_available And you will have more time with the people that you love.
not_available You will have more time being the person that you are today.
not_available And, yes 10 years ago I lied to you about your wife.
not_available But I am not lying to you right now.
