not_available just in case.
not_available Just in case what?.
not_available Got your back, Johnny.
not_available First you can't trust a GPS, then it's your parents.
not_available Then it's the government.
not_available It's a slippery slope.
not_available You're losing me.
not_available We're not ashamed of it.
not_available If more people were like us, the world would be a better place.
not_available But there'd definitely be a lot more cars at the bottom of Lake Michigan.

DAWN OR's ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell them we'll be there after the decompression.
not_available Load with Solumedrol before we take him in.
not_available Solumedrol is no longer
not_available I know the debate.
not_available With respect, whether a patient needs surgery needs to be left to the surgeon.
not_available Neela, with equal due respect, I remember what it was like to be you.
not_available T o be me?.
CARTER When you're a surgical intern you feel like surgeons are the only real doctors.
not_available That approach can be a little narrow.

not_available Protecting his brain is our highest priority, doctor.
not_available You'll thank me later.
not_available Marisol, can you get Lucien on the phone now?.

not_available Sounds like a good plan.
not_available How is her carbon monoxide level?.
not_available Not stable enough for hyperbaric.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Neither is Carter's patient.
not_available So can you please explain to me why he won't listen to reason?.
GRADY Get the rapid infuser.
not_available Sometimes reason doesn't get you anywhere.
not_available Excuse me?.
not_available We have four kids who could be orphaned despite all reasonable efforts.
not_available Part of the deal.
not_available Doesn't mean we can start abandoning protocol.
not_available Carter was in the field.
not_available Without the technology, you only listen to your gut.
not_available Systolic's down to 82.
not_available Can't say I blame him.
not_available Looks like reason's having a bad day.
not_available He's hypoventilating.
not_available You don't want to tube him?.
not_available No, he'll wake up in the chamber.
not_available Why did you roll over on this?.
not_available Something about reason having a bad day.
not_available This robs him of any chance of walking.
not_available You're being dramatic.
not_available Ask any neurosurgeon.
not_available We're making a mistake.
not_available Neurosurgeons are biased.
not_available And by the way, so are we.
not_available We see every case through the haze of our own experience, our own expertise.
not_available Sometimes a fresh set of eyes is a valuable thing.
not_available This is crap.
not_available Hey.
not_available You okay?.
not_available No, I'm having a horrible day.
not_available We're blowing this case, which nobody
not_available Frank, any messages for me?.
FRANK Nothing.
not_available You were saying?.

not_available It's not gonna be for much longer.
not_available Okay.
ELAlNE Hey, Lucy, how's she doing today?.

not_available I'm, uh, curious, how it's going?.
not_available Excuse me?.
not_available At home with Lucy.
not_available Did she say something?.
not_available She seems a little uncomfortable with Stan.
not_available I tried ringing, but
not_available Everyone's uncomfortable with Stan.
not_available He's my husband and I love him, but he's weird.
not_available Okay?.
not_available Weird is not a qualification for being a foster parent.
not_available We got two of our own and three foster kids in our apartment.
not_available He's great with them.
not_available It's me he's not so great with.
not_available Laid off in October, he still won't get off his ass and find a job.
not_available Look, I really gotta get going.
KELLY You know, she was fine at first.
not_available And then she started having trouble breathing and not making sense.
SAM I wouldn't even recognize her.
not_available It's been a really long time.
not_available It's hard to believe how easy it could be just to shut stuff off.
not_available Looks like your mom has right
not_available middle lobe pneumonia.
not_available IV antibiotics?.
not_available Y eah, but her sats aren't too bad though.
not_available What's that mean?.
not_available We could probably buff her up.
not_available She'll be back in the home in a few hours.
not_available That's good.
not_available She's gonna be more comfortable there.
KELLY Gotta change my flight.
not_available Can I use the phone at the desk?.
not_available Use the Break Room.
not_available You remember where that is.
not_available Yes.
not_available Looks like the O2 is working.
not_available Yeah, she'll be coming around.
not_available I don't even know what to say to her.
not_available I'm sure you'll figure it out.
not_available Yeah I just hope it's not something like, 
um ""Why did you have to be such a crappy mom?.
not_available "" Or ""Why couldn't you just stay in Dallas and die?.
not_available "" Oh, I'm guessing you'll come up with something better.
not_available Where is my
not_available ?.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available It's me, Sammy.
not_available You're in Chicago.

not_available Do I know you?.
not_available Have we met before?.
not_available Thanks for waiting.
not_available We can do this inside.
not_available Eh, I need my nicotine fix anyway.
not_available The baby's sleeping.
not_available I gotta take the trash out.
BRENNER I left a message for you on your answering machine.
not_available I don't know how to work that thing.
not_available My wife's the one who checks it.
not_available Right, well, I was just, uh, wondering how it's all going with Lucy.
not_available She's a good kid.
not_available Been through a lot.
not_available Well, she, um.
not_available She says she feels uncomfortable here.
not_available That's natural, right?.
not_available I mean, new place, new people, and she is a little bit of an odd duck.
not_available They're my favorites.
not_available Not the most adaptable, but in the end
not_available She says you make her feel, uh, uncomfortable.
not_available What's that supposed to mean?.
not_available Look, I got a really narrow tolerance for the way people treat kids.
not_available That's a personal foible of mine.
not_available What the hell's a foible?.
not_available Are you crossing the line with her?.
not_available You come here for this?.
not_available My wife and I love these kids.
not_available All of them.
not_available You're gonna accuse me of some cra
not_available ?.
BRENNER Shut up! Shut up.
not_available Just stop talking.
not_available I don't know what's wrong with you if you're nuts or just got the wrong idea somehow.
not_available You walk around naked.
not_available What?.
not_available Or is she lying?.
not_available Is she lying?.
not_available She came home early one day, I got out of the shower in my towel.
not_available I'm not some pervert, man.
not_available I'm not some freak.
not_available What, you think I get off on kids?.
not_available Is that what you think?.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, we don't have a lot of dough.
BRENNER I'm sorry.
not_available And maybe I look like a loser to you.
not_available But I don't need some rich doctor coming here accusing me of terrible things that I would never, never do.
not_available They spiked your soda?.
not_available lt was like a diuretic or something.
not_available And nailed up a stuffed animal by your desk?.
not_available It's hazing.
not_available It'll stop eventually.
not_available Think this has to do with what happened?.
not_available Same difference.
not_available Either way, I'm gonna ride it out.
not_available lf this goes on too long
not_available I gotta stop it.
not_available This time I'll deal with it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I can take care of myself, Archie, really.
not_available I know.
not_available I gotta admit, I do like that you worry about me.
not_available Here's my partner to pick me up.
not_available Archie, this is my new partner, Ed Bernstein.
not_available Archie Morris.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available You're looking out for her.
not_available She looks out for herself.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I left my phone inside.
not_available You're the doctor friend, huh?.
not_available The outfit gives me away every time, ha.
not_available How long you been on the job?.

TlLDlE He'll be all right, won't he?.
not_available Yes, but you two really have to get control of yourselves.
not_available You're the one who said to tear the mattress tag.
not_available Tear the what?.
not_available No, it was a metaphor for living fully, taking chances.
not_available A metaphor?.
not_available Why didn't you tell me she was so altered?.
not_available Well, she's not always like this, you know.
not_available When she's home and everything's okay, she's pretty clear but the plane really tipped her over.
not_available All right, she can stay here tonight and we'll move her tomorrow.
not_available You can stay with me if you want.
not_available Uh, actually, I can't.
not_available But I'll check in with you when I get to Tokyo.
not_available What?.
not_available You're going?.
not_available Sammy, I have to, l
not_available You said you were gonna stay until we got her settled into the nursing home.

not_available tach every time we try to move her.
BANFlELD James, understand what's going on?.
not_available Is she gonna die?.
BANFlELD What are you doing?.
not_available Find the source of the bleeding.
not_available She's got a shot.
not_available Gonna do an ex

not_available Ten blade.
JAMES I don't understand.
not_available You're gonna cut her open?.

GATES You think we should tell Surgery we're doing this, at least?.
not_available No.
not_available Hey, how is Mrs.
not_available D and the kids doing?.
not_available I'll try and get an update for you.
not_available Hang in there, Norman.
not_available When you're an attending, you'll get it.
not_available Get what?.
not_available How the subtle administrative political nuances become a big part of your job.
not_available I don't get how you let that trump the care of a patient.
not_available The right course of action was frankly a little unclear.
not_available He has a spinal fracture and paralysis.
not_available Seems clear he needs the OR.
not_available We'll see.
not_available You never take my opinion seriously.
not_available Not true.
not_available You don't view me as an equal.
not_available I have 1 5 years of experience on you, so no, I don't.
not_available Then how's that ever gonna change?.
not_available Neela.
not_available You might wanna call Neurosurge.
not_available He's moving his toes.
not_available What you did in there
not_available Had a really good chance of working.
not_available It did, so spare me.
not_available It was smart and gutsy.
not_available Thought she was gonna make it.
not_available Almost doesn't really count, does it?.
SAM Guy in the hyperbaric chamber 
not_available is moving his legs.
not_available Really?.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Neurosurgery is up there now.
not_available Would you tell her I'm upstairs, if she's looking for me?.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know, this has been one incredibly weird day.
not_available I read in the paper that Mars is transitioning from Capricorn to Aquarius.
not_available That must be it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Blast injuries can force air from the lungs into blood.
not_available An embolus is likely lodged in his spinal cord, causing transient paralysis.
not_available Chamber shrank the embolus?.
not_available lt forced it into solution.
not_available lt was carried to the lungs.
not_available You think the spinal fracture is stable 
not_available no cord injury?.
not_available T oo soon to know.
not_available We need to look.
not_available Call me when you get to the unit.
not_available Okay.
not_available Y es.
not_available Y es, yes.

not_available Do you wanna come out of there?.
NORMAN Yes.
not_available Please.
not_available Man, this is like the pod from the Planet of the Apes.
not_available The original one.
not_available You're a very lucky man, Mr.
not_available Chapman.
not_available That's what I've been trying to tell you, ha, ha.
not_available I am indestructible.
not_available Hey, how is Mrs.
not_available D and the kids doing?.
not_available The kids are stable.
not_available They've all been admitted.
not_available But Mrs.
not_available Dixon had very serious injuries to her liver and spleen.
not_available And she died.
NORMAN What?.
not_available We did everything that we possibly could.
not_available We couldn't control the bleeding.
not_available No, no.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available Mrs.
not_available D can't be dead.
not_available That doesn't make any sense.
not_available You saved those children.
not_available Don't forget that.
not_available We have to take you to the OR now, make sure you're not bleeding internally.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available This last year was like I've been under a magic spell or something.
not_available I guess I got kind of hooked on it.
not_available But I guess it's pretty much over now.
not_available What's over?.
not_available The era where everything works out.
not_available Make sure to tap the pseudo
not_available tumor girl.
not_available Brenner was supposed to and never got to it.
not_available What happened to him anyway?.
not_available Went home sick.
not_available Seemed fine this morning.
not_available Hello, everybody.
not_available You here already?.
not_available I don't get off till 7.
not_available I know, but my hand's feeling a little worse for wear.
not_available I thought someone could take a look.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Please, ignore my advice.
not_available You were doing fine without me.
not_available Just don't rely too much on the GPS system, okay?.
BURT Okay.
not_available No more running with scissors?.
MORRlS I think not.
not_available No more sex in the
not_available ?.
not_available Definitely not.
TlLDlE Oh.
not_available Well, it was fun while it lasted.
not_available Wow, I feel like I just drowned their puppy.
not_available That's what you get for telling them to tear the tags off.
not_available Grady, set my husband up in Curtain 2.
not_available We might have to do a hand series.
GRADY Sure thing.
not_available Here.
not_available After you're done, get the other stuff.
not_available I'm leaving soon.
not_available Right this way, Mr.
not_available Banfield.
not_available Russell's fine, I'm not an old man.
not_available So, uh, how's it going with the cop?.
not_available Good.
not_available Very good.
not_available In fact, I kind of want things to move forward, but I'm not sure how.
not_available You know what I just did for the old lady as a romantic gesture?.
not_available Adjoining burial sites.
not_available She cried and cried.
not_available I'll keep that in mind, Frank.
not_available How does, uh, Claudia feel about things?.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available I can't tell.
not_available That's what's making me nervous.
not_available You know, I don't like to get into all this personal stuff you people drag around here.
not_available But I'm gonna offer you a bit of wisdom I heard on the street.
not_available Sometimes you just gotta cut the mattress tag.
not_available Mattress tag?.
not_available I'm telling you, Dan and Rose's Shared Plots and Cremation Urns.
not_available I got the number in my phone.
not_available Well, I suppose I could tell you that I cut myself with a scalpel or that I slipped in the snow or make up some other stupid excuse but why bother?.
not_available A shunt.
not_available Y eah.
not_available It's for dialysis.
not_available I had it revised yesterday, but it seems to be oozing a bit.
not_available I'd call that more than a bit.
not_available Why are you on dialysis?.
not_available Oh.
not_available Bad luck, really.
not_available Some years ago, I lost function in my left kidney after an incident here.
not_available I, uh.
not_available I got stabbed by a patient and a med student was killed.
not_available And then when I was in Africa, I developed amyloidosis secondary to schistosomiasis, which took care of the other one.
not_available Wow.
not_available That is bad luck.
not_available For a while, I kind of had this idea that it would all magically disappear but a week in a Nairobi hospital cured me of that.
not_available So I need a kidney.
not_available And I came back to the States to get on the list.
not_available I'll, uh, keep my fingers crossed.
not_available Actually, as it turns out, you and I have the same blood type and minor antigens group.
not_available Really?.
not_available In fact, the truth is that I wanted to work here so that I could to meet you and try to convince you to donate one of your kidneys to me.
not_available What do you say?.
not_available I' m just kidding.
not_available I have no idea what your blood type you are.
not_available Oh, so serious, Cate.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You gonna wanna do a resection or a primary repair?.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Depends on what we find when we get in there.
not_available Right.
not_available Neela, you know the main reason that you and I fight is that you're one of the only people around here that I actually find worthy of arguing with.
not_available I don't like these new brushes.
not_available Which is another way of saying that I respect you and look forward to working together as colleagues.
not_available The committee's announcing appointments at the end of the week.
not_available I think you're gonna be very happy.
not_available Lucien, I've, um, withdrawn my application.
not_available I'm not staying at County.
BANFlELD Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available This morning at the agency, I was acting crazy.
not_available You and me both.
not_available No.
not_available You were just defending my honor.
not_available Still.
not_available Heh.
not_available When was the last time I hit a guy?.
not_available Do you think our erratic behavior was some sort of sign?.
not_available Sign of what?.
not_available That maybe adoption isn't the right thing for us.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Me either.
not_available Being there, thinking about being a father again what that would mean, it was harder than I thought.
not_available Still, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it.
not_available It doesn't?.
not_available Let's just sit with it a while.
not_available See how we feel down the line.
BANFlELD Hmm.
not_available Can I get you anything?.
not_available Oh.
not_available We're still waiting on your x
not_available ray.
not_available Soup.
not_available I need soup.
BRENNER Neela.
NEELA Simon.
not_available Oh.
not_available Baby, I've missed you.
NEELA Are you drunk?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, no, just a little.
not_available Where have you been?.
not_available I've been calling.
not_available Yeah, well, I had the ringer on my phone turned down, so
not_available Well, I bet my day was worse than yours.
not_available Wanna play the who'smore
not_available miserable game?.
not_available Oh, that sounds fun.
NEELA I went out on a limb against the ER, all by myself and Dubenko wouldn't back me up.
not_available I mean, I knew I was right, I absolutely knew it.
not_available But you know what?.
not_available Turns out I wasn't.
not_available Neela, just let it go.
not_available That's it?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You were wrong.
not_available There's no point in getting upset about it.
not_available Well, how can you say that?.
not_available Okay, how about
not_available ?.
not_available How about you take your aggression out on me?.
NEELA What
not_available ?.
not_available Simon.
not_available Please.
not_available Why do you do this every time
not_available I try to talk about something that matters?.
not_available Okay.
not_available You shoot away.
not_available What do you wanna talk about?.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know, stuff.
not_available You.
not_available The things you think about, the things you want.
not_available Talk about the real stuff.
not_available The hard stuff.
not_available That's what being together is.
not_available I had a bad day too, Neela.
not_available I did something stupid.
not_available I did something really stupid, really messed up but I don't have a neurotic urge to come here and burden you
not_available Bore you with some ridiculous little tale of woe! 
not_available Do you need to get that?.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I mean no.
not_available You go ahead.
not_available Ray.
not_available Yeah, hi.
CARTER Hey.
not_available Hey.
CARTER Sorry I left the, uh, frostbite guy in Curtain 3.
not_available There's a homeless shelter that's supposed to come by and talk to him.
not_available It's okay.
not_available When's your shift over?.
not_available Uh, Tminus
not_available six.
CARTER Hours or minutes?.
not_available Minutes.
not_available But I'm gonna stay until my mom gets a bed.
not_available It's hard seeing your parents age.
not_available Mm.
not_available Seems like yesterday she was a tough broad.
not_available And now she's a terrified old lady.
not_available How do you get from there to here?.
not_available That's the million
not_available dollar question.
not_available It's nice to have you back.
not_available Brought you something to eat.
not_available Why won't they let me go?.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available We gotta get you healthy first.
not_available They're lying to you.
not_available I don't belong here.
not_available You're confused.
not_available Things'll be clearer soon.
not_available You just gotta eat something.
not_available I don't know that I can trust you.
not_available Can l?.
not_available Can I trust you?.
not_available Are you scared?.
not_available I understand.
not_available You know, when I was really little, I used to have trouble sleeping.
not_available My mom used to sing to me to calm me down.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I wish I had a daughter like you.
WARREN See you next time, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available See you then.
MARQUEZ Good job today, like you never left.
not_available Yeah, almost.
