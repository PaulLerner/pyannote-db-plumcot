
not_available ER Previously on ER No one has ever gotten me a real diamond before, Mark.
not_available How dare you accuse me of manipulation! I deserve better than that! Here's the deal.
not_available Let me shadow you.
not_available Throw in a few procedures.
not_available A couple of stitches here and there.
not_available And I'll make your little lawsuit vanish.
not_available It's Carol.
not_available What? Carol Hathaway.
not_available Now, you are sworn to secrecy.
not_available I didn't mean to mislead you about my family.
not_available It's really not that big a deal.
not_available You told me we had to cut P.A.s.
not_available Why don't you give Kerry and me another day to recheck our figures? I love you, Carol.
not_available "Obstruction of Justice" Hey.
not_available I didn't hear you get up.
not_available I didn't want to wake you.
not_available Where are you going? I gotta go sign some papers.
not_available Your last day was yesterday, wasn't it? That's for unemployment.
not_available Did you take a look at the want ads? What's the point? We've been back for four days.
not_available All you've done is look at the sports page.
not_available Don't start, okay? This This Atlanta high
not_available rise job, it's gonna come through.
not_available I can feel it.
not_available I left some chicken in the fridge for lunch.
not_available I don't know how long I'll be.
not_available Good morning, Kerry.
not_available Hey, Don.
not_available What is all this? It's computer equipment Dr.
not_available West is setting up thank you for the Synergix Attending coverage.
not_available Well, your trial period's a good idea.
not_available Letting them show their stuff.
not_available Listen, any further rumblings from Jeanie Boulet? Yesterday was her last day.
not_available She left without a word.
not_available I think her threats came out of the heat of the moment.
not_available We don't need a P.A.
not_available alleging that she was fired because she was HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Jeanie knows she was fired for financial reasons.
not_available If anyone questions that, they can look at the budget.
not_available Hold that elevator! You handled a difficult situation very well, Kerry.
not_available Thank you, Don.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available Boy, were you ever snoring when I left this morning! Oh, poor baby.
not_available You have a hangover? I don't think I should've had that fourth margarita.
not_available I went to put your present on and when I came back 
not_available you were out like a light.
not_available I missed the grand finale? I think I need a B
not_available 12 shot to keep up with you.
not_available You know what? I got just what the doctor ordered.
not_available Get up.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Easy.
not_available I could hurl.
not_available Just keep your eyes closed.
not_available Why? Just do as I say.
not_available Don't be a pooper.
not_available Stand there.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Just don't turn around.
not_available And keep your eyes closed.

not_available Thanks.
not_available I gotta get to work.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Would you like a cup of coffee? Decaf? 
not_available Always.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle said you were fired because you're HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Is that true? Yes.
not_available I believe it's true.
not_available I was reprimanded for doing a lifesaving procedure in a body cavity.
not_available A few weeks later I was fired.
not_available The hospital claims it's budgetary reasons.
not_available They always give other reasons.
not_available Were you ever disciplined before? 
not_available No, never.
not_available Actually, I was October's employee of the month.
not_available Good.
not_available Did you keep a log of what was said? No.
not_available Is it too late to do anything? 
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available We'll outline a protocol for you to follow.
not_available I warn you, it might get ugly.
not_available I want my job back.
not_available Hey, can I borrow a buck? No.

not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Keep the change.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Scooter! 
not_available Chase? What are you doing here? I came to see the good doctor.
not_available Anna? 
not_available This is my cousin Chase.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Anna Del Amico.
not_available We intern together.
not_available I see why you got into medicine.
not_available Come on, gang.
not_available We're behind on sutures.
not_available Anna, could you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll get started on these, Scooter.
not_available Nice.
not_available So, what's up? I escaped to the Vineyard for Thanksgiving.
not_available I was hauling firewood when a spider got me.
not_available Oh, man! Dr.
not_available Greene, hello.
not_available Ellis West.
not_available I'm an SPG doctor.
not_available Synergix Physicians Group.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Listen.
not_available Whatever your misgivings when the SPG Attendings start backing you up next week we'll make your job a lot easier.
not_available You're preaching to the choir.
not_available Less work is fine with me.
not_available Good.
not_available Then I'll just set up and stay out of your way.
not_available Kerry.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available West.
not_available Hi.
not_available We know each other.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Good.
not_available What's all this? 
not_available This is the Wertz dictation system.
not_available Dictate on the fly, it gives you verbal prompts.
not_available Here.
not_available This you put on your belt.
not_available It puts everything on a floppy.
not_available And this is the earpiece? 
not_available The earpiece and the microphone.
not_available I don't know how my mom ever kept these things straight.
not_available Cynthia, this is awkward for me.
not_available But it's my job to tell you.
not_available Some people find certain things in the workplace inappropriate.
not_available Like sex in the lounge.
not_available So We didn't have sex in the lounge.
not_available I was just trying to cheer up three of the seven dwarfs.
not_available What? 
not_available Grumpy, Sleepy and Doc.
not_available Mark's all three.
not_available Just a little more discretion, okay? What's the matter with you? You should be happy that he's happy.
not_available Jeanie? I thought your last day was yesterday.
not_available No.
not_available I'm gonna keep working here.
not_available Didn't Weaver lay you off? I'm not accepting it.
not_available You go ahead, girl.
not_available Hello! That smarts.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We missed you at Thanksgiving dinner at least until that third round of martinis.
not_available Was Gramps after you? 
not_available About what? He's back trolling the gene pool for a successor.
not_available We've been through this, Chase.
not_available You're done.
not_available You'll need IV antibiotics.
not_available You're still his first choice.
not_available Elliot's in Thailand, A.C.'s lazy, Barbara's 
not_available Barbara.
not_available Barbara.
not_available What about you? You're already an exec with the company.
not_available He knows your work.
not_available That's why he wants you.
not_available Why can't anybody just accept the fact that I'm a doctor? It's like my photography or A.C.'s summer stock.
not_available Gramps just sees them as phases.
not_available All the little chickens will come home to roost.
not_available Not me.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available What's the problem? I'm having a sickle cell crisis.
not_available And somebody stole my Percodans at the bus station.
not_available Where's your pain? 
not_available It's like having a migraine all over.
not_available He says the pain is 10 out of 10.
not_available Pulse and temp are normal.
not_available My pulse and temperature don't usually go up.
not_available I need 250 of Demerol as soon as possible.
not_available That's a big dose.
not_available I know me! I need to break the cycle now.
not_available BP's normal.
not_available 130/80.
not_available Let's run in two liters of saline.
not_available O
not_available 2, six liters.
not_available Draw a CBC with a retic count.
not_available And give him 60 of Toradol.
not_available I'm allergic to it.
not_available Two of Stadol then.
not_available That too! Demerol's all I can take.
not_available Okay? Who's your doctor? I go to the Pontiac Clinic.
not_available Okay.
not_available Give him 50 of Demerol, IV.
not_available Repeat once in 15 minutes, PRN.
not_available Give the medication a chance, Mr.
not_available Jackson.
not_available I need 250! Let's call the clinic and see.

not_available CBC, type and cross for four.
not_available Chest, C
not_available spine, pelvis and left femur.
not_available Don't touch my leg! 
not_available Get some pressure on it! We wear trauma gear in the trenches now.
not_available Too late.
not_available Leg's pulseless, massive bone and tissue loss.
not_available Probably have to amputate.
not_available Is my mom okay? 
not_available Sounds like a larynx fracture.
not_available Does your neck hurt? 
not_available Think you're right.
not_available All right.
not_available What do we got? 
not_available Make room for the cavalry.
not_available Thanks for your help.
not_available Rollover TC.
not_available She's hypotensive, an open femur and a possible larynx fracture.
not_available Her mom's in 2.
not_available Are you having trouble breathing? Am I gonna die? 
not_available We're not gonna let that happen.
not_available Set up for intubation.
not_available Mind if I take her? 
not_available Sure.
not_available You take this.
not_available I'll check next door.
not_available Hook her to the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available How's she doing? Allison? 
not_available DPL's grossly positive, 2.
not_available I'm losing a pulse.
not_available She's arresting! Here's more Oneg!

not_available clamp the aorta.
not_available Thoracotomy tray.
not_available Hang two more and bag her.
not_available Get an abdominal CT and finish the x
not_available rays upstairs.
not_available If we hurry, maybe we can save her leg.
not_available Do they need me in 2? 
not_available No.
not_available There are three docs in there.
not_available Stat page Dr.
not_available Romano to the O.R.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available I'm glad you reconsidered the P.A.
not_available cutbacks.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available Jeanie, she just clocked in.
not_available Sickle cell guy's had 100 of Demerol.
not_available Says it hasn't helped.
not_available Did you call the Pontiac Clinic? 
not_available I tried.
not_available Number's not in service.
not_available Why am I not surprised.
not_available Crit and retic count okay.
not_available White count's normal.
not_available What is the problem with you people? I need more Demerol.
not_available Run the rest of the saline, four tabs of codeine to go and street him.
not_available This should be interesting.
not_available What? 
not_available Look.
not_available May I speak with you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Just keep taking deep breaths.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm working.
not_available You've been terminated, you're off payroll and you're not covered by malpractice insurance.
not_available All right.
not_available I won't see any more patients.
not_available But I'm staying.
not_available Don't humiliate yourself by being forcibly removed from the premises.
not_available You do what you need to do.
not_available I'll do what I need to do.
not_available Time of death, 12:07.
not_available We have to tell her daughter.
not_available She went right from CT to O.R.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available She was so worried about her daughter.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available How're you doing? Today's the day we save some lives.
not_available I'm very excited.
not_available Where's my scrubs? Listen, we gotta be low
not_available key about this.
not_available If anybody asks I'm your attorney, okay? I'm here to research your work so I can prepare a proper defense.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available Calm down.
not_available I'm not expecting anything big.
not_available A couple of sutures here and there.
not_available I cannot let you practice medicine.
not_available What are you talking about? We had a deal.
not_available I defend you in the civil rights suit against you.
not_available In exchange, I play doctor for a day.
not_available We'll see.
not_available How's my case going? 
not_available Where's my scrubs? I'll get you your scrubs.
not_available Just try and do it low
not_available profile.
not_available Right.
not_available Don't worry about your case.
not_available It's gonna vanish into thin air.
not_available You made quite a deal for yourself.
not_available Have Dr.
not_available Anspaugh call me as soon as he's free.
not_available It's very important.
not_available Hi, guys.
not_available How'd it go? Marquis de Sade's got nothing on Scooter.
not_available Don't call me that at work.
not_available Marquis de Sade or Scooter? 
not_available That's funny.
not_available Want to go to lunch at Shaw's? 
not_available I can't, I'm on duty.
not_available Blow it off.
not_available It's my job.
not_available I can't just blow it off.
not_available Okay, Dr.
not_available Schweitzer.
not_available Just asking.
not_available My family thinks I'm just dabbling in medicine till I come to my senses.
not_available That sounds like fun.
not_available Eddie, you bastard! You're trying to kill me! Shut up, Darlene.
not_available See? You're ganging up on me.
not_available I can see the appeal.
not_available Come by the house sometime.
not_available We'll all party.
not_available Ciao.
not_available Like that'll happen.
not_available A couple winners.
not_available Wife says hubby tried to beat her up.
not_available Complains of pain.
not_available Vitals and mental status normal.
not_available Never mind being plastered.
not_available You're going to jail, Darlene! Let me up! I gotta pee.
not_available ETOH, bump on the head, contusions and abrasions.
not_available No pain.
not_available The woman tried to run him over.
not_available No LOC, vitals normal oriented times three.
not_available GCS, 15.
not_available You'll be all right, Eddie.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll take him.
not_available You take her.
not_available Why the cuffs? She's under arrest for assault with a deadly weapon, pick
not_available up truck.
not_available I was just trying to get away.
not_available This son of a bitch was chasing me! He's on Eddie's side because he works with the police motor pool.
not_available You want to uncuff her so I can examine her? 
not_available While she's here, she's my patient.
not_available No matter where she is, she's my perp.
not_available You'd interfere with the care of a woman with critical injuries? For God's sake! Were you trying to kill yourself? 
not_available No.
not_available I was just mad at Eddie is all.
not_available Take any drugs? 
not_available Me? Never.
not_available I want a blood alcohol and a drug screen.
not_available Would you excuse us? 
not_available I want the tests.
not_available I need to evaluate her.
not_available Wait outside while I examine her.
not_available With the extrication, there's been two hours of pulseless warm ischemia.
not_available She's got massive crush injury to the leg.
not_available Her abdominal CT is normal.
not_available Her vitals are stable.
not_available But with contamination, bony loss, protracted shock an abovethe
not_available knee amputation is indicated.
not_available I say we save Allison's leg with a vascularized free fibular transfer.
not_available That's four hours of anesthesia on a limb that's too far gone.
not_available Look, face it.
not_available At this point, a long surgery is too risky.
not_available Know how to do a fibular transfer? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available You think I shouldn't do it? 
not_available Have you done one? No.
not_available But she's a good candidate for an aggressive approach.
not_available You mean she's a good guinea pig for practice.
not_available Don't be so dramatic.
not_available She is young.
not_available She deserves a chance to keep her leg.
not_available Got a hot one, Lizzie? Couldn't ask for a better candidate for a free fib transfer.
not_available Wait till you see her in action, Peter.
not_available You worked something out with Jeanie? No.
not_available She's fired, but she's protesting it.
not_available I'm trying to get Legal to deal with it.
not_available But Anspaugh's in a meeting.
not_available Man, I'm glad I don't have your job! No! We'll go to trial.
not_available Irv, my client's willing to lose 100 G's rather than settle, okay? No, no, no.
not_available It's your move, Irv.
not_available Oh, baby! What's this about 100 grand? 
not_available It's not about you.
not_available Could you give me some specifics on how you'll defend me? Where do we change from? 
not_available This way.
not_available Tell me about my defense.
not_available What's there to tell? We're gonna kill them! We'll go for assault with a deadly weapon.
not_available But no caving this time.
not_available Go for it, Billy.
not_available Kill the bitch.
not_available Right.
not_available Sounds like you boys have it all worked out.
not_available Stick to the medicine.
not_available I'll handle the law enforcement.
not_available Your x
not_available rays are normal.
not_available You'll be back to battering in no time.
not_available What, "battering"? We scuffled is all.
not_available Did your wife lose consciousness at any time after she was assaulted? Hey, she tried to kill me! No.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available Get off of me! Come on, nurse.
not_available Just draw the blood.
not_available Nobody's drawing her blood without her permission.
not_available This is permissible search.
not_available Delay will result in loss of evidence.
not_available She's bradying down.
not_available Pulse, 39.
not_available Darlene? She might have taken drugs and been afraid to tell us.
not_available She wouldn't lie.
not_available Let's give her 0.5 of atropine.
not_available Let's pump her stomach.
not_available Ewald tube.
not_available I want those tests.
not_available Get a warrant.
not_available You got one coming, okay? Get Greene to back us up.
not_available I don't need any backup.
not_available I know my rights and hers.
not_available Darlene, I want you to try and swallow this tube.
not_available Afternoon.
not_available Hey, hello, doctor.
not_available Herb Spivak.
not_available Maggie Doyle.
not_available Are you a Synergix Attending? What do we have here? A partial extensor tendon laceration.
not_available You best treat that with irrigation and débridement.
not_available Give it a couple of loose sutures and a splint and you'll be fine.
not_available Why don't you come with me? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available How did you know that? I hired a doctor for a couple of weeks from an ER for $100 an hour.
not_available He told me everything.
not_available Blood gases, chest tubes, peritoneal gavage.
not_available Lavage.
not_available Peritoneal lavage.
not_available Oui.
not_available Oui.
not_available Lavage.
not_available Oui.
not_available Why don't you sit down? What's that? 
not_available Practice your suturing on this.
not_available A pig's foot? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Which ones? Running, vertical, interrupted, deep dermal? Why don't you try all of them? 
not_available This won't be but a moment.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Hey, welcome back.
not_available How'd it go? It's a long drive from Flagstaff in an old Cadillac, but it was nice to be alone.
not_available Where's Carol? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Are we glad to see you! Otitis, rhinitis, and gastroenteritis.
not_available It's nice to be loved.
not_available Hey, Doug! Hello.
not_available How are you? Good.
not_available I'll get right to work on these.
not_available It's good to see all of you.
not_available Hi.
not_available You all done? Yeah.
not_available System's up.
not_available I usually don't get so hands
not_available on with patients anymore.
not_available I'd prefer blood on my shirt to a staff mutiny any day.
not_available It sounds like you could use a little R and R.
not_available How does a week in St.
not_available Barth sound? 
not_available St.
not_available Barth's? In the Caribbean? Synergix conference is there next week.
not_available You could give a paper on inner
not_available city ER management.
not_available We'd take care of your expenses.
not_available Why? A doctor with leadership qualities is a very valuable asset.
not_available It's a real offer.
not_available You think about it.
not_available I will.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll be at the Ritz
not_available Carlton.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available How was it meeting your father's in
not_available laws? I'm glad I did it.
not_available But it was hard.
not_available Sherry's death hit them really bad.
not_available That was her name, Sherry.
not_available I'd like you to see a depressed anhedonic girl complaining of loss of appetite and insomnia.
not_available She's in Exam Room 3.
not_available Did Psych look at her? 
not_available I'd like you to evaluate her first.
not_available Good to see you, doc.
not_available I feel like I never left.
not_available Hey.
not_available What? Mark Greene.
not_available Come here, you.
not_available So you've had a loss of appetite and insomnia because of me? 
not_available I'm surprised I lived.
not_available Oh, it sounds serious.
not_available Shut up and kiss me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Carol, do I collate these clinic charts
not_available ? Oops! Excuse me.
not_available Doc, what do you think? Hey, not bad.
not_available I love that running stitch.
not_available That looks good.
not_available If the police need evidence, like a blood test and the patient refuses to give it, what do I do? Medical personnel can decline to collect physical evidence where the subject is unconscious or indicates his or her refusal to consent to the procedure.
not_available The People versus O' Neal, 1993.
not_available Herb Spivak.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Spivak.
not_available You need a consult? 
not_available He doesn't.
not_available Herb, that was not very low
not_available profile.
not_available I was being a lawyer.
not_available Big deal.
not_available Offering a consult? Why don't you start practicing your
not_available I'm ready! Jeanie.
not_available If Yosh needs a doctor, he can ask for one.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available I cannot allow this.
not_available Okay.
not_available What are you doing? I'm logging the fact that at 2:30 I was prohibited from treating an ankle injury.
not_available Chuny, call Security.
not_available It's Anspaugh.
not_available Finally! No.
not_available It's not for you.
not_available He wants to talk to Jeanie.
not_available Yes? All right.
not_available I'll be right up.
not_available I'm gonna take this tube out now.
not_available Blood alcohol's pretty high, 270.
not_available Is she coming around? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's perking up.
not_available Since she puked.
not_available Let's see.
not_available No pill fragments, though.
not_available Here comes that cop.
not_available Here's your warrant.
not_available Now, draw the blood.
not_available Let me read it first.
not_available I want her stomach contents too.
not_available Does that warrant specify stomach contents? 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Give it here.
not_available Oh, no, you don't.
not_available That's destroying evidence, pal.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available You can't arrest me.
not_available What? You can't arrest him.
not_available Watch me.
not_available You have the right to remain silent.
not_available Where are you taking him? 
not_available Jail.
not_available You have the right to an attorney.
not_available Carter's getting arrested.
not_available Anything you say
not_available For what? For protecting the doctor/patient privilege.
not_available If you can't afford
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter's an inexperienced intern.
not_available If he did anything rashly
not_available Carter, what did you do? I stood up for my patient's civil liberties.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available This'll be taken care of in no time.
not_available So, what's the charge? Obstruction of justice.
not_available Head.
not_available Her HIV status defines Miss Boulet as a person in a protected class.
not_available And her firing constitutes an adverse action by the hospital.
not_available Her layoff was budgetary.
not_available We would argue that was pretext.
not_available And ignoring your progressive disciplinary policy and firing an exemplary employee after one incident proves discriminatory intent.
