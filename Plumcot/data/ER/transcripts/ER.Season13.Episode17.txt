not_available Not mine.
not_available Well, churches are beautiful.
not_available And a little bit creepy.
not_available I don't hear you making any suggestions.
not_available Well, the only thing I know for sure is that I don't want it 
not_available To even remotely resemble my first wedding.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where was your first wedding? In his parents' backyard.
not_available You? A church.

not_available There's a problem with his heart.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Charlie, baby, Mommy will be right back.
not_available Your husband's heart has stopped from being too cold.
not_available We need to perform a thoracotomy.
not_available What is that? It's a procedure where we cut open his chest and pour warm water directly onto his heart.
not_available That sounds dangerous.
not_available Is there another way? It's not standard, but it's the fastest way to get his temperature up.
not_available That's why we need your consent.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I Maybe we could wait until he wakes up and then The risk of dying from hypothermia could probably be greater.
not_available Well, I can't do this.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Paxon.
not_available We cannot do this without your permission.
not_available What would your husband want? Is he a fighter? Yes.

not_available Okay, the first liter's going in.
not_available What are they doing to my dad? Pouring warm water in his heart.
not_available It can help him fight off the cold.
not_available This is all my mom's fault.
not_available You were in an accident.
not_available It's nobody's fault.
not_available She was driving and they were fighting.
not_available Families fight, it doesn't mean that she 
not_available It's because she cheated.
not_available That's why they're getting a divorce.
not_available Oh, thank goodness.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I came back out and she was gone.
not_available Come on, sweetie.

not_available No.
not_available This is a good teaching case for Mae Lee.
not_available Stay down and finish your consults.
MORRIS What's going on? He wanted to talk to his son.
not_available I was giving them a few minutes.
not_available The police wanna know if they can talk to the boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
not_available Hey, we ain't finished yet.
not_available Police need to talk to your son.
not_available What for? They found him at the scene.
not_available He might be involved.
not_available Don't say nothing.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right.
not_available Damn, man, stop calling me that, man.
MORRIS We still gotta wait for the CT but so far looks like just a mild concussion.
not_available My guess is he's fine.
not_available So did he tell you what happened today? Fell down some stairs.
not_available He fell? That's it? That's it.
SCANALONl You're only making it harder on yourself.

not_available So check this out.
not_available I got this O.G.
not_available With a GSW.
not_available Just confessed to shooting some kid from a rival gang.
not_available But it doesn't add up.
not_available I don't think he did it.
not_available First he says he had nothing to do with it.
not_available Then he confesses.
not_available I mean, if he did it, why would he confess? If he didn't do it, why would he confess? How would I know? Did you ask him? 
not_available I thought maybe you could talk to him.
not_available Did you ask Kovac? Why would I do that? 
not_available Let me think.
not_available Chief of the ER, great with people, years of experience.
not_available Yeah, but you know, this is kind of more in your wheelhouse.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available And exactly what wheelhouse is that? You want me to talk to this dude because I'm black.
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available I mean, you are black, aren't you? That's wrong, Morris.
not_available What? We do this all the time.
not_available If I had a pregnant girl, I might get Abby.
not_available Big Croatian, Kovac.
not_available I didn't come to you with my autistic Irish kid.
not_available You could've.
not_available You should've.
not_available Hey, what is the big deal? You know that I love the black man.
not_available You don't wanna get into this with me.
not_available Look, I got a black guy from the inner city confessing to a crime I don't think he committed.
not_available You were a black guy from the inner city.
not_available I thought you could relate on a level that I can't.
not_available You think that just because we both grew up black and poor we somehow magically relate.
not_available Well, there's nothing magical about it.
not_available Black isn't just one thing.
not_available We don't all share some sort of collective consciousness.
not_available I know you may think we all look alike, but we're not.
not_available Thanks for making a coffee run.
not_available Yeah, no problem.
not_available There's sugar too.
not_available Aargh.
not_available Where is my darn stethoscope? It's the third one I've lost.
not_available I knew it! What? 
not_available You're getting married.
not_available Am not.
not_available Why are you looking at wedding mags? 
not_available They're, uh, there.
not_available Why were you asking wedding
not_available cake questions earlier? I was, uh, curious.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Look me in the eye and tell me you're not getting married.
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Because that's stupid.
not_available I 
not_available I am not getting married.
not_available You looked away.
not_available I knew it, I knew it! Oh, God, ah, this one would look so pretty on you.
not_available Luka asked if we could keep this quiet It's in your eyes, you have the glow.
not_available I can't wait for the glow.
not_available I can't wait to try on wedding dresses 
not_available Hope! If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.
not_available Do you hear me? Kill you, as in dead.
not_available Got it? What's up, bro? Mr.
not_available Dunston, I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available I'll go get his next dose of Ancef.
not_available All right.
not_available Looks like your bleeding has slowed down.
not_available Your lung should heal in a few days with the chest tube.
not_available Yeah, that's what the other dude told me.
not_available Y'all changing shifts? No.
not_available No, not exactly.
not_available Just thought maybe you'd wanna talk to somebody.
not_available What, you like a shrink? No.
not_available I'm not a shrink.
not_available For some reason, Dr.
not_available Morris thinks you didn't commit the crime you confessed.
not_available Oh.
not_available So this is like a black thing.
not_available Hey, excuse me, nurse.
not_available I'm sorry, you might wanna step out.
not_available We about to have a black
not_available man talk.
not_available Ain't that right, doc? I'm trying to help you.
not_available Hey, go on ahead, break it down.
not_available Why don't you tell me what kind of help you think I need, doc? You know what? Forget it.
not_available That's right.
not_available We ain't got nothing to talk about.
not_available You don't know me, fool.
not_available No, I don't know you.
not_available I know I work on a parade of dudes just like you every day.
not_available Where you from, Dr.
not_available Pratt? You one of them North Shore brothers? No.
not_available I'm from right here.
not_available So you think because you got your little doctor degree you got out the ghetto, you can judge me? Nobody's judging you.
