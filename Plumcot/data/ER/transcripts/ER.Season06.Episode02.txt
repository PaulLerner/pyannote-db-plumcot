not_available She's been out of it for the last month.
not_available Her oncologist feels it's due to the brain mets or liver failure.
not_available I see.
not_available Let's get a chest x
not_available ray, CBC, PT, PTT.
not_available Look, you should know something.
not_available She doesn't want to go back to the ICU.
not_available She has a "do not resuscitate" order? I just brought her in because her breathing and pain seemed to worsen.

not_available See, there's a separate form for each chief complaint.
not_available Multiplechoice medicine? 
not_available Yeah, sort of.

not_available What's all this about, Robert? What? No "Thank you I'm honored" no "I hope I don't dissapoint? Everyone thinks you're serious.
not_available That's because I am serious, Lizzie.

not_available Besides, I knew you'd take it.
not_available I haven't taken it.
not_available Oh, is that a "no"? I didn't think so.
not_available As much as you may view me as a loathsome toad I know your pragmatic and more predictable your ambitious nature will prevail.

not_available The point is, I'm handing it to you.
not_available A fast
not_available track career.

not_available Loves him? 
not_available Why are we talking about Roger.
not_available Who cares? 
not_available This is about me, Reece and Carla.

not_available Sort of.
not_available I hope it works out for you.
not_available I'm sorry? In the end it doesn't help much.

not_available What? 
not_available I'll take him home.
not_available You're a licensed foster parent? No, but I can become one.
not_available That's nice of you, but I'm affraid is not very realistic.
not_available Why not? 
not_available You have to be screened and trained.
not_available I can do all of that and take care of him in the mean time.
not_available It has to be better than Intake.
not_available He needs a mom.
not_available You have children? 
not_available No.
not_available I can focus on him.
not_available Support system? 
not_available I can do it.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's not policy.
not_available Maybe it'll be a good solution until I find a foster parent.
not_available Or until I get licensed.
not_available Let me look into it.
not_available No promises.
not_available Hey, Reece.
not_available How are you doing? Hey, Carla.

not_available Okay.

not_available It's gonna take a while for it to sink in for him.
not_available And you? I don't know.
not_available I did hear a vicious rumor about you.
not_available Really? Which one? It was actually more of an announcement.
not_available It was a shock to me as anyone.
not_available What is he up to? 
not_available Robert has to be dramatic.
not_available Yeah, but why'd he pick you? I don't know.
not_available Perhaps he thinks I'm a talented surgeon.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available You won't take it, will you? 
not_available I was considering it.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available So, I'm going to have to deal with Romano.
not_available He's a small price to pay for such an advancement.
not_available If you say so.
not_available Stop it.
not_available If you feel the need to express an opinion at least articulate it.
not_available Fine.
not_available You can't trust that guy.
not_available He screwed you in the past.
not_available He's not going to hesitate to do it again.
not_available But I think you know that.
not_available Yes and it's my problem, isn't it? I think it will be.
not_available You're on soup and milk shakes for a couple of days.
not_available Stitches come out in five.

not_available She asked me to.
not_available She wouldn't do that! You have the papers with you? 
not_available I'll get them.
not_available You should.
not_available Now that your daughter's intubated, it gets a little complicated.

not_available Why? I got doctors to do it for me.
not_available Go back to work.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available You two, hold on! Hold on! Get back here! Can we tell you what happened? I heard what happened.
not_available Do you have a brain between you? Dr Weaver, we called them
not_available No! No! I talk, you listen! You work in this hospital, not in the street.
not_available You are not trained for it.
not_available You are not covered for it.
not_available And you have patients here who need your attention.
not_available One of them might have coded.
not_available Or we might have been hit with other traumas while you where out playing paramedics.
not_available Were you? Don't even start, Dr.
not_available Malucci.
not_available I'm only cutting this much slack because you're new here.
not_available And you Carter, you should know better.
not_available You're emergency Residents, not paramedics.
not_available Is that understood? Is it understood? That was great, Dave.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available We document all consents in the chart.
not_available Is there a problem? You didn't tell me you tested the baby for HIV.
not_available I told you he was positive.
not_available I thought you were assuming.
not_available I didn't know you tested him without the mother's consent.
not_available The mother was comatose.
not_available We had to get him started in the antiviral drugs.
not_available Who authorized it? I did.
not_available I was looking out for the baby.
not_available We gained 10 days of treatment.
not_available You broke the law.
not_available Will this affect your decision about foster care? 
not_available I'll have to explain this.
not_available Will it? No.
not_available You obviously care about the child.
not_available But? 
not_available It's not gonna work.
not_available Why not? The director won't approve.
not_available I'm sorry, Jeanie.
not_available I said I'd look into it.
not_available I did.
not_available Is it because I'm black? What? 
not_available I'm black.
not_available The baby's Hispanic.
not_available What do you take me for? 
not_available I'm not really sure.
not_available Because you'd rather put him in a facility.
not_available You're not qualified.
not_available It's simple.
not_available Is it because of my HIV status? It doesn't help.
not_available Look, I'm healthy.
not_available There's no reason to think that I won't continue to be healthy.
not_available What about when the child is 5? When he's 10? Can you say that then? Can anyone say that? Look, I don't know how to tell you no any other way.
not_available I know his needs.
not_available I'd be better
not_available It's no, Miss Boulet.
not_available The answer is no.
not_available Lavage is negative.
not_available Lost a few liters from the popliteal artery.
not_available What's the tibia look like? Fracture in 20 pieces.
not_available It's a mess.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Shirley cleared O.R.
not_available 1.
not_available Thanks for buffing him up, Peter.
not_available But Lizzie can take it from here.
not_available Yes, but he's a trauma patient.
not_available Indeed he is and this trauma fellowship of yours is through the ER, correct? Yeah? So? 
not_available So that's an O.R.
not_available That's for surgeons.
not_available Yeah but I've been operating the last three weeks as a trauma fellow.
not_available Yes I know.
not_available But now as chieff of staff I have to be concerned with credentials.
not_available You chose this.
not_available Not me.
not_available Elizabeth, I leave up to you.
not_available Under no circumstances is that man to go into that operating room.
not_available Call security if you have to and enjoy your first solo surgery.
not_available Solo? Yes, an associate chief can operate by herself.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Peter? Hey, you okay? This case.

not_available Weaver
not_available Forget it.
not_available Mark, maybe you should take a few days off.
not_available I just had a week off.
not_available That wasn't a vacation, Mark.
not_available Losing a parent is stressful.
not_available I gotta get back to work.
not_available Why isn't he here? Vanessa? I'm sorry? Is who coming? The priest? Why isn't he here? 
not_available No.
not_available You told me not to.
not_available I don't want to go alone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available He'll be here.
not_available Jeanie, I didn't know you were considering becoming a foster parent.
not_available Robert Martin called me asking for a referral.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Unfortunately it's not gonna work out.
not_available Why not? I didn't get a clear answer.
not_available I guess too many things stacked against me.
not_available Is there anything I can do? 
not_available No.
not_available Thanks, Kerry.
not_available Some things aren't meant to be.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Next time wait till they stop swinging at the piñata before you dive for the candy.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mark.
not_available Mr.
not_available Stehly's making a lot of noise.
not_available I need a detailed record about his daughter.
not_available Your new charting system should help.
not_available This is serious, Mark.
not_available You know the position we're in? I followed my patient's wishes.
not_available She's over 18.
not_available She signed a DNR and gave her father power of attorney.
not_available She has rights.
not_available She's throwing PVCs.
not_available How many? 
not_available 10 to 12.
not_available Give her lidocaine? Not yet.
not_available I wanted to make sure.
not_available So she's no longer DNR? If she codes? 
not_available Resuscitate her.
not_available No, don't! Kerry, she's my patient! You can't ignore a standing DNR! She revoked it! 
not_available She can't! Not with altered mental status! Did you see her CT? That girl has mets all over her brain.
not_available She's on morphine.
not_available Probably hypopsic.
not_available I talked to her.
not_available She was conscious and alert.
not_available I didn't see that.
not_available You have to trust me.
not_available I'm not sure you're being objective.
not_available Kerry 
not_available I should take over.
not_available I've got it covered.
not_available Mark, I'm taking this patient.
not_available You're gonna have to fire me first.
not_available So, what do I do if she codes? Nothing, Carter.
not_available You do nothing.
not_available If she codes, call me, Carter.
not_available Randy, are you sure this list is right? I paged Father Erps twice.
not_available There's a junior Jesuit substituting for him.
not_available Where's his number? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's around here somewhere.
not_available Find it! Randy.
not_available She doesn't have much time.
not_available Lucy, where's Malucci? 
not_available Think him first as Dr.
not_available Dave.
not_available Whatever, where is he? I don't know.
not_available Try the Coast Guard.

not_available That day when you proposed to me most of me wanted to scream "Yes!" and run to the courthouse and do it right then.
not_available Most of you? 
not_available But the rest of me was scared.
not_available I knew that I loved you.
not_available I've just been with this little baby who needed a mother.
not_available I knew instantly that I wanted to be that mother.
not_available I didn't want to say yes for the wrong reason.

not_available I know that now.
not_available Do you still want to marry me?

not_available It was her faith.
not_available That's what's important.
not_available So how did you know what to say?

not_available Roger can get another job.

not_available And then there was you.
