not_available Have you seen my case of Groovitas? 
not_available I don't know, ask Frank.
not_available No, that's exactly what he wants me to do.

not_available Have my first can at the start of my shift, second one midway through my shift.
not_available Uhhh.
not_available I can't do this.
not_available I can't.
not_available I cannot work under these conditions.

not_available This is war.
not_available What great war wasn't fought with tape? I don't know.
not_available Maybe you misdialed.
not_available I called twice, both times it was wrong.
not_available So do you have an aunt or not? Look, all you're doing is asking stupid questions.
not_available So fix him up and let us go home! 
not_available That is not gonna happen soon.
not_available His x
not_available rays show he's been beaten.
not_available We need to figure out who's doing this.
not_available You don't know what you're talking about.
not_available When you fight, does it get physical? 
not_available Sam.
not_available Do you lose temper, throw punches? 
not_available We don't fight.
not_available Come on, now.
not_available It's you that's hurting your dad, isn't it? Just wait.
not_available Stupid bitch.
not_available Hey, what the hell was that? 
not_available I'm just doing my job.
not_available By berating the kid in the middle of the ER.
not_available Something's going on.
not_available I'm trying to figure what the story is.
not_available You do not storm into the hallway making accusations.
not_available If you have a problem, you discuss it calmly.
not_available Or just run it by me.
not_available Somebody has to take the initiative.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? While you moved on to the next patient, I'm the one who's in the trenches.
not_available I deal with the family follow up to make sure we didn't miss anything.
not_available And now, I'm the one trying to figure out what's wrong with this guy.
not_available You learn that in chief camp? Might wanna ask for your money back.
not_available All right, back to work.
not_available Mind if I sit down? First of all, Nurse Taggart, she had no right to accuse you.
not_available She overstepped her bounds and I'm sorry.
not_available But some of what you told us, it just doesn't add up.
not_available Look, the last thing any of us want is for your dad to come back here in a month with more broken bones.
not_available Lf you know anyone who could have 
not_available Look, no one hit him.
not_available You know that for a fact? Yeah.
not_available He fell in the kitchen, all right? 
not_available I'm the one who called 911.
not_available Paramedics said it was anonymous.
not_available Yeah, well, I disguised my voice, tried to sound older.
not_available Why would you do that? Okay, about two years ago, my dad was in a car accident and they made me stay with a foster family.
not_available I'm not going again.
not_available So there's no aunt.
not_available I was hoping if you thought I had someone you'd just leave me alone.
not_available And you say your dad was just standing there and then fell? Yeah.
not_available You gotta give me something more.
not_available Look, I don't know, all right? I guess he has been acting kind of weird lately.
not_available He's fallen a couple of times.
not_available Today was definitely the worst.
not_available Look, he was making a sandwich in the kitchen I hear a thud, I look over and he's on the floor.
not_available Just let me run a few more tests and see what I can come up with.
not_available Hey, wait a second.
not_available You're not gonna snitch to Social Services? Let's just see what I can figure out about your dad first, okay? You had to tube him? 
not_available Dropped his sats in Radiology.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available We're helping your husband breathe.
not_available They read the scan? 
not_available Big clot in the SMA.
not_available Hank? Hank? 
not_available No, we had to sedate him for the CT.
not_available The scan shows a large clot blocking the main artery to his intestines.
not_available What do you do? 
not_available We need to Dr.
not_available Morris? We need to restore blood flow to his bowels.
not_available That means surgery.
not_available Surgery? Today? 
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available What about TPA? No, I don't think that's the best option here.
not_available What's TPA? It's a clot
not_available busting medicine that could help.
not_available But if it doesn't, we've delayed an inevitable operation.
not_available That could cause a stroke or MI.
not_available Surgery is the best option here.
not_available If that's what you think.
not_available Page Neela.
not_available I want a hematology consult too.
not_available You are wasting time.
not_available Not if it prevents Stop it.
not_available Just stop.
not_available I want coags, serial crits and neurovascular checks q
not_available hour.
not_available Got it.
not_available And stay on the vent.
not_available Acidosis is the last thing she needs.
not_available Got it.
not_available Why neurovascular checks? To make sure she's perfusing her extremities distal to the graft.
not_available Still haven't forgotten what you said about Pedes.
not_available I'll talk to Lucien soon.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available The Pedes ward.
not_available Sabotage your career.
not_available He's not You need 10 months of surgical electives.
not_available There isn't time to fool around.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available You won't graduate on time.
not_available When you're looking for jobs, you'll be behind I'm not taking it as an elective.
not_available I'm switching specialties.
not_available What are you talking about? I don't wanna be a surgeon.
not_available What did he say to you? Dr.
not_available Dubenko's been very supportive about this.
not_available I told him I would work with you, mentor you, and for what? So he could eventually squeeze you out.
not_available Damn, it's the ER.
not_available Stay here and call me with Sheryl's next crit.
not_available Don't worry, I'll handle this.
not_available I'm not worried.
not_available Harold Zelinsky, you will be a great surgeon.
not_available You're supposed to be.
not_available I'm not gonna let one person get in the way of that.
not_available Is that for Hank? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available His K's 3.2, so Morris wants 40 in the bag.
not_available You okay? Yeah, just, he's not the best surgical "candidate " " but" I can't get Becky to listen to me.
not_available Well, you know what your problem is.
not_available You don't know how to talk to women.
not_available Yeah, that's my problem.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Well, I'd teach you, but it's gonna take a really long time.
not_available I'll put this up.
not_available Onset of pain was an hour ago.
not_available He's infarcting everything from the duodenum to the transverse colon.
not_available We have to correct this.
not_available With surgery? Well, we were discussing TPA as an alternative.
not_available I'm talking about local TPA.
not_available Well, it's a good idea in theory.
not_available It might not work? And we would lose valuable time.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Riley, if we get Radiology here, you can get another opinion.
not_available If they have a good record with TPA with catheter it might be worth considering.
not_available But if we wait too long and his bowel dies, he's at risk for sepsis.
not_available What's sepsis? It's an infection.
not_available I just wanna do what's best for Hank.
not_available Why don't we talk to Radiology? Enough, why won't you listen? 
not_available Surgery is not the best You'll never change.
not_available You can't ever let someone else be right.
not_available Let's do a liter of saline an hour for two hours.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Hey.
not_available Any news? His hormone's causing too much calcium in his blood.
not_available That made his bones break.
not_available His bones are brittle.
not_available It doesn't take much to fracture.
not_available This is just gonna keep happening? 
not_available No.
not_available He can have surgery to remove some glands and his bones will be strong again.
not_available How long is he gonna be in the hospital? 
not_available About a week.
not_available I really don't wanna stay with a foster family.
not_available All right, tell me something.
not_available How do you get to school? My friend's mom.
not_available She picks me up.
not_available What do you do after school?

not_available I feel hurt.
not_available Because Archie had a party and he invited everyone but me.
not_available That's very good, Frank.
not_available Can I go again? I feel like Frank is hypocritical, because he told me he hated sushi and karaoke.

not_available I could've grabbed a burger on the way over there.
not_available What about the karaoke? 
not_available I don't wanna do it.

not_available I don't "care " how many babies people have or how many dates you miss.
not_available Very few people could have done what you did today.
not_available Hey.
not_available You have a gift, Neela.
not_available You have a gift.
not_available The minute you start comparing yourself to others is the minute that you forget you're doing exactly what you were meant to do.

not_available He kept beating me, anyway.
not_available Thanks, Neela.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available I get a colonoscopy, and every year, it's fine.
not_available I guess I was starting to believe that it wasn't gonna happen.
not_available Which is ridiculous, because in my family it's not a question of if, but when.
not_available If you get the surgery, you'll have no chance of getting colon cancer.
not_available So you'll be okay, everything will be fine.
not_available Until I develop a post
not_available op desmoid or hepatablastoma.
not_available Or thyroid cancer.
not_available Oh, you don't know that.
not_available I was born with a defective tumor
not_available suppressor gene.
not_available Colon cancer is just the beginning.

not_available I knew you weren't cut out for this.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Really? You wanna change my colostomy bag? That's touching, but I don't think so.
not_available Look, maybe in the past You weren't a hundred percent committed when things were easy.
not_available So don't try to tell me now all of a sudden that you can handle it.
not_available I don't need your pity.
not_available It's not pity.
not_available You shouldn't go through this alone.
not_available It was my choice to end our relationship.
not_available You don't have to call, don't have to check on me.
not_available This is not your problem, Greg.
not_available Bettina.
not_available I'm letting you off the hook.
not_available I got you some food.
not_available I figured you and Sarah must be hungry for dinner, huh? Oh, thank you.
not_available Listen, Hank is gonna be here for a week.
not_available So until then, I think Sarah would love it if you would stay with us.
not_available Thank you, that's very generous.
not_available I'm sorry for how I treated you.
not_available It's been a stressful day.

not_available Listen, about what you said, me dating Sam.
not_available Yeah, um, about that.

not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, Mayday.
