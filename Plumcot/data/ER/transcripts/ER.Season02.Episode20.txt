not_available Oh, it's a gift from the old man.
not_available 10 to 1 it's dirty.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available You're dumping me? 
not_available And I feel good about it.
not_available Chloe is the mother and, as far as I can see, she presents no danger to her child.
not_available Do you really think you can be a good mother to this little girl? Yes.
not_available More than anything, that's what I wanna be.
not_available "Fevers Of Uknown Origin" There's a blown water heater at a residential location.
not_available Southeast corner of Gaze and Throup.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Unit 47 will respond in about five.
not_available All right, everyone wears rubber boots.
not_available Find Carol an extra pair.
not_available I thought the idea was that you guys respond to emergencies 
not_available not cause them.
not_available Hang on, hang on.
not_available We gotta pay you nurses back.
not_available When an MICN rides along, we get double the calls.
not_available Come on, Reilly, you're gonna jinx us.
not_available Shep! 
not_available This is unit 47 en route.
not_available Copy, 47.
not_available This is Ross.

not_available Here.
not_available Hello? Hello? Anybody there? This is Karen Hines.
not_available Oh, hi, Andy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How are the marlin running? No kidding.
not_available I thought you had fished out every key south of Largo.
not_available So, Andy, Ray isn't there with you? Oh, well, I guess he must have gotten distracted in the Caymans.
not_available That's nice.
not_available Yeah, just tell him that he's gotta call Chicago when he gets in.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, we miss him up here.
not_available You are a good liar.
not_available I wasn't lying.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available I do miss Ray.
not_available He's a kick.
not_available He's a dying breed.
not_available Oh, man, this is really perverse.
not_available Hey, it's not like your dad and I are going steady, so let's minimize this oedipal stuff.
not_available You wanna call in sick? Rent a Jackie Chan movie? 
not_available No, it doesn't work that way.
not_available You could meet me for a late lunch around 4:00, is what you could do.
not_available I hate hospitals.
not_available How do you feel about diners? There's one across the street.
not_available You could meet me there.
not_available A real diner? 
not_available Meatloaf, ketchup on the table.
not_available You've seduced women before, haven't you? She's down here somewhere! It just blew up! Becky girl! Water heater was here? Your daughter's bed was there? 
not_available Oh, my God! Please, sir! Please, you have to step away.
not_available You shouldn't be down here with bare feet! Please! That's still standing water! I told you we needed a new one! 
not_available We couldn't afford it.
not_available But we can afford bourbon every week! Would you just shut up? 
not_available Reilly, go get backup.
not_available I got it.
not_available We're so weak.
not_available I told you! Why don't you shut up! Look, all right, listen, just take it easy! What color pajamas is she wearing? 
not_available Pink.
not_available Look for the color.
not_available When was the explosion? 
not_available It was 10 minutes ago.
not_available Backup's on the way! I found a foot! All right! Yeah, here! All right, take it easy! There she is! Oh, my God! 
not_available Not too close, not too close! Easy! Find her head! Gently! All right, let's go! Gently, all right? Let's roll her, get the board.
not_available Right.
not_available Oh, God! Weak pulse.
not_available Breath sounds? Oh, my God! She's not breathing! Reilly, get an ET tube! You with us? Yeah! Yeah! Come on, come on! Come on! Shoot! For crying out loud! I got another one! 
not_available Come on! Here, here! She's got it.
not_available Thank God! 
not_available Good breath sounds bilaterally.
not_available Okay, darling, you're gonna be just fine.
not_available Let's wrap her up.
not_available Let's get her up.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need the oxygen mask.
not_available Okay, sweetie, this is gonna help you breathe.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Are you taking her to the hospital? 
not_available County.
not_available Is she gonna be okay? 
not_available We're gonna make sure at the hospital.
not_available I'm coming too.
not_available I'll get dressed.
not_available Gotta find your own transport.
not_available The ambulance is full.
not_available We can make room.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I'm not letting these idiots into my rig.
not_available It's the girl's mother.
not_available Yeah, you heard her.
not_available They knew the heater was a hazard.
not_available And they got a kid living near it, they're too drunk to notice.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stupid people shouldn't breed.
not_available Morning.
not_available Oh, morning.
not_available How's it going? Going.
not_available Man, did you see all that traffic this morning? I took the El today, as usual.
not_available I didn't think you were working today.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Well, I got called in.
not_available It's just as well.
not_available And last night? I was thinking about you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I got your message.
not_available I'll fill you in later.
not_available Susan.
not_available Glad you could fill in on such short notice.
not_available No problem.
not_available You'll be able to go home by 4.
not_available I can do a full 12.
not_available Okay, let's get a CBC, Chem7, aHeel
not_available stick of glucose.
not_available I said that already? 
not_available Twice.
not_available Lip lac in 3.
not_available Looks like stitches.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Sure you can handle another? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Mark, were you looking for me? 
not_available Morgenstern wants to see us upstairs.
not_available Did he say why? 
not_available Something wrong? No, but it's May the 2nd, so it could be the announcement.
not_available Announcement? 
not_available Resident of the Year.
not_available Not that I'm expecting it.
not_available Emergency medicine always gets overlooked.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Resident of the Year.
not_available Did I remember to put your name in? I did.
not_available Isn't the announcement in June? 
not_available First of May.
not_available So do you think you're gonna need me today? The reason I'm asking is, if there's nothing on the schedule Simon got me in to assist on a breast reconstruction at 10.
not_available Which is a procedure that I haven't done yet.
not_available Somebody page me? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, Trauma 1.
not_available You're doing an OB rotation at Parkland? 
not_available I fly to Dallas on Friday.
not_available Talk to me before you leave, okay? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available Where's Ross? 
not_available Meeting the paramedics.
not_available Got a little girl in bad shape.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, a lot of surgeons have said that an elective in plastics can't hurt.
not_available Oh, plastics.
not_available The beautiful people's specialty.
not_available I thought I'd check it out.
not_available Well, go on.
not_available You sure? Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got your page.
not_available Yep.
not_available On this lovely May morning we have a 6year
not_available old girl exhumed from rubble.
not_available Respiratory arrest.
not_available Resuscitated on the scene.
not_available BP, 90/60.
not_available Thanks for calling me early.
not_available Just protecting myself.
not_available If we' re working together, I'll make sure you're onboard from the very beginning.
not_available He must have been wearing a big ring.
not_available This could take a few stitches.
not_available Will there be a scar? There could be at the vermilion border, where the lip meets the skin.
not_available Do you want me to call a plastic surgeon? Not that I'll be staring in the mirror, but my boyfriend says I have a pretty face.
not_available You do.
not_available Somebody's mighty low to mug you.
not_available Honey, three times in two years.
not_available They think the blind are an easy target.
not_available Well, I think you set this one straight.
not_available That self
not_available defense course was worth every penny.
not_available The cane worked like a charm.
not_available Radared in on his balls.
not_available Bam! Bull'seye! He let go of your purse, did he? Wouldn't you? 
not_available What's that, Ms.
not_available Crandell? 
not_available Tip of his pinkie.
not_available You bit his finger off? If the police don't need it for evidence, I want it for a souvenir.
not_available I want Mommy! 
not_available She'll be here in a minute, sweetie.
not_available C
not_available spine is clear.
not_available Let's get that collar off.
not_available No pneumo.
not_available All right.
not_available DPL's negative.
not_available Crit's normal.
not_available No internal bleeding.
not_available Becky, you're one lucky little girl.
not_available Good work in the field, 47.
not_available Lucky Carol was with us.
not_available It was very scary, but you are a brave little girl.
not_available Where's my mommy? 
not_available She'll be here any minute.
not_available Wait, hold on.
not_available She's got a bulge in the groin.
not_available Where? 
not_available There.
not_available Reducible hernia? Incarcerated.
not_available Probably caused by increased intra
not_available abdominal pressure.
not_available From the trauma? 
not_available Let's get her up to Surgery.
not_available Tell you what, you're gonna be fine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton here is gonna fix you right up.
not_available As soon as your mommy and daddy get here, I'm gonna bring them up to see you.
not_available Gosh, no.
not_available Sorry to disappoint.
not_available Don't they announce that in June? First of May.
not_available Doesn't matter, it was a long shot.
not_available I called you two up to start a conversation on next year's Chief Resident.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Hope you don't mind that Kerry's here? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available She's one of the strongest chiefs we've had in years.
not_available You did a fine job for us also, Mark.
not_available I thought Kerry and you could make this a mutual decision.
not_available Susan Lewis would be my first choice.
not_available Before we discuss candidates, we ought to brainstorm about what qualities 
not_available we'd see in an ideal chief.
not_available Makes sense.
not_available Our chief needs to be focused in crisis.
not_available Exactly.
not_available A leader in the ER needs to cut to the chase, assume the worst.
not_available Right, don't you think Susan Lewis has that quality? I think Kerry's right.
not_available Let's not try to solve this today, just start the ball rolling.
not_available Carter, glad I caught you.
not_available Yes, I was just about to assist 
not_available on my first breast reconstruction.
not_available I'm afraid you aren't.
not_available Why? Did you call the registrar requesting a review of your transcript? To verify I'm graduating with honors.
not_available They discovered that you're deficient in ambulatory medicine.
not_available What? You can't graduate without seeing the required number of Pedes patients.
not_available What? Luckily, Doug Ross is taking you on for the next four weeks.
not_available I was hoping for an elective in plastics.
not_available If you start this morning, you have the time to complete this remedial work and graduate with the rest of your class.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross is expecting you.
not_available Yeah, and I want that consult down here stat.
not_available Susan, did you just say "stat"? 
not_available Yeah, and I mean it.
not_available Look who's here! Isn't she precious? Oh, she looks just like her mommy.
not_available Will she let me hold her? 
not_available I hope so, my arms are about to fall off.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello, baby.
not_available So tiny.
not_available Hello.
not_available Nice outfit.
not_available I think so.
not_available Hey, it's RandiWear, right? Susan? 
not_available What do you got? A woman passed out in the crosswalk.
not_available GCS, 10 in the field.
not_available She's coming around.
not_available Okay, Trauma 1.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Ma'am, do you know where you are? All right, let's move her on a count of three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Get a glucose.
not_available She's hypertensive, 170/120.
not_available Titrate a Nipride drip to a diastolic of 100.
not_available Do you have a history of high blood pressure? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Not again.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Try and relax.
not_available Her name is Joanne Bairos.
not_available We'll try to lower your blood pressure.
not_available Has it happened before? 
not_available I don't wanna lose this baby.
not_available Not again! You're pregnant? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How far along? Twenty.
not_available No, no.
not_available Twenty
not_available one weeks.
not_available Okay, cancel the Nipride, give her 10 of hydralazine.
not_available Call OB.
not_available You lost an earlier baby? 
not_available Last year.
not_available In the sixth month.
not_available Oh, God, I can't live through this again.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hook her up to a fetal monitor and an EKG.
not_available Did you have preeclampsia before? Do you remember? They said it was high blood pressure.
not_available It made my placenta tear, and if they didn't take the baby out, I'd die.
not_available I see.
not_available My baby was too little.
not_available She couldn't live.
not_available BP's rising, 180/130.
not_available Add propranolol.
not_available Who's on call for OB? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Croix.
not_available But it's not the baby's fault! Your hypertension is probably related to the pregnancy.
not_available No, no.
not_available But I've been dizzy sometimes in between the pregnancies.
not_available You have? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What's the fetal heart rate? 
not_available 145.
not_available Good variability.
not_available Don't let them take her.
not_available Susan, shouldn't we be moving her up? 
not_available No, I'm gonna do an ultrasound first.
not_available Her BP's 190/140.
not_available The fetus isn't in distress.
not_available I want an ultrasound first.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Trying to save your baby.
not_available I don't know, I'll check it out.
not_available Yeah, I heard you.
not_available I'll check it out.
not_available Told you they were mad.
not_available Haleh, is that ultrasound for the hypertensive patient OB's been screaming at me about? 
not_available Who ordered that? I'll take care of it.
not_available Bring me up to speed.
not_available Hypertensive woman in her 21 st week.
not_available Fetal heart tones normal.
not_available She responded to hydralazine and propranolol.
not_available What's the BP? 
not_available 130/100.
not_available She's stable for transfer.
not_available Any contractions? 
not_available Some cramping, nothing on the monitor.
not_available It's preeclampsia.
not_available Get her up to OB.
not_available It's Susan's patient, Kerry.
not_available Patient lost a 22
not_available week fetus last year to preeclampsia.
not_available For goodness' sake.
not_available Complains of dizzy spells and possible hypertension between pregnancies.
not_available Any protein in the urine? Susan, if we've learned anything
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available There! Right there! Mass in the adrenal gland.
not_available Call the O.R.
not_available to schedule a room.
not_available You're right.
not_available Looks like Conn syndrome.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available You have a tumor in your adrenal gland producing a hormone which is making your blood pressure rise.
not_available It's very serious.
not_available You'll probably need surgery to remove the mass.
not_available But the baby? 
not_available Should be okay.
not_available Cancel OB, we're going to Surgery.
not_available Good call, we would've missed that.
not_available They could've done the ultrasound in OB.
not_available They aborted her last time.
not_available Let Surgery know we're on the way.
not_available Well, I think we've earned ourselves a doughnut.
not_available Anyone want a Dinkles? 
not_available They've got some inside.
not_available Help yourself.
not_available Could you bring me back one? 
not_available Yeah, you bet.
not_available He's trying.
not_available Now I'm supposed to eat doughnuts with the guy? It's not his fault Raul died, Shep.
not_available It's not your fault either.
not_available I know.
not_available I know whose fault it is.
not_available It's the fine, upstanding, druggedout, meth
not_available burning citizens we're here to serve.
not_available That's who Raul died for.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available That's what I heard.
not_available Resident of the Year.
not_available I guess it isn't a personality contest.
not_available Do we have to go to the party? 
not_available There's gonna be cake.
not_available Anyone seen Dr.
not_available Ross? 
not_available Check the lounge.
not_available Ted, you're an attorney.
not_available Never say, "Trust me.
not_available " The divorce wasn't slow and complicated enough with two parties and two lawyers.
not_available Now we have to get a mediator involved.
not_available I don't believe in divorce.
not_available I always suspected you were an old
not_available fashioned girl.
not_available Don't believe in marriage either.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, your highness, Dr.
not_available Bradley was looking for you.
not_available When? 
not_available Just now.
not_available He said it was regarding your letter to the Ethics Committee.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm gonna need some help! Loretta? Loretta, I got you.
not_available I got you.
not_available Clear Curtain Area 2.
not_available I got you.
not_available So I don't pretend to be happy about the situation, but I'll do my best for you.
not_available And I'm available at any hour.
not_available She's not falling for the amnesia guy.
not_available Is she? 
not_available No, she's faking.
not_available Ever since she got possessed, it's completed changed her personality.
not_available So do you need me for anything right now? Well, we'll see what comes in.
not_available You're a fourth year, so you're not gonna need a lot of handholding.
not_available You'll get me out on time, which works for me.
not_available Just show up and you'll get an A.
not_available Something tells me that it will change our lives forever.
not_available What ever happened to his brain tumor? 
not_available Cured when he was struck by lightning.
not_available It was not.
not_available Watch out, he's gonna drug her.
not_available Ready? 
not_available I promise you you will not be disappointed.
not_available BP's 70/50.
not_available Okay, let's get that EKG.
not_available Does your father have heart problems? 
not_available Not before a few weeks ago.
not_available He was having trouble breathing, so he went to the clinic.
not_available They said my heart wasn't pumping hard enough.
not_available Did they give you any medications? 
not_available Yeah, they did.
not_available Here they are.
not_available Danny, honey, no! I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available What have we got? Mr.
not_available Dellanova's complaining of nausea and blurred vision.
not_available Why don't you show them to the waiting room.
not_available When did he get this medicine? 
not_available On the 18th.
not_available How's that EKG, Kerry? Sinus Brady with 2nd degree AV block? 
not_available How'd you guess? Took too many tablets.
not_available You should have a lot left.
not_available Malik, get a dig level.
not_available What is it? Your father overdosed on digoxin.
not_available Is that serious? 
not_available It can be, but we caught it in time.
not_available Stand by with Digibind.
not_available Or do you want a lavage? It's all yours.
not_available Dr.
not_available Bradley, you were looking for me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm sorry it took so long to respond to your letter.
not_available Well, I know you're a busy man.
not_available I gather you are too.
not_available Your letter was dated April 23rd but you left Dr.
not_available Vucelich's study in early February? 
not_available That's true.
not_available So it took three months to report on what you yourself 
called "An alarming disregard for research study protocol"? Well, I was hesitant to make accusations against Dr.
not_available Vucelich.
not_available I mean, a man of his stature
not_available I believe that caution is warranted.
not_available Let me return your letter to you now.
not_available These claims are accurate.
not_available Oh, I have no doubt.
not_available Since they are reported in the addendum to Vucelich's study.
not_available He's owning up to it? Apparently it was always intended to be part of the published article.
not_available When did Dr.
not_available Vucelich add the addendum? Before or after I sent the letter? I wouldn't be able to answer that.
not_available Feeling better? 
not_available Some.
not_available What happened? 
not_available You were dehydrated.
not_available I couldn't keep anything down.
not_available Did your oncologist prescribe Compazine? 
not_available No.
not_available Did you tell him about your symptoms? 
not_available I tried, but he's pretty busy.
not_available I called about the burns, and he never got back to me.
not_available Radiation burns.
not_available I thought it was supposed to happen but another woman in the waiting room says I shouldn't be getting burned.
not_available What's your oncologist's name again? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lyle Howard.
not_available Look, my kids are at a neighbor's.
not_available Can they spend the night? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're being admitted.
not_available I'll stop back.
not_available Mark, Susan just had an interesting case but I can't convince her to present it to the students.
not_available There's not much to present.
not_available Sure there is.
not_available Have you all met my new student, John Carter? You're doing a Pedes rotation? 
not_available Never too late.
not_available You're mighty chipper today.
not_available Yes, I am, thank you.
not_available So I was trying to explain that Susan needs to think like a teacher.
not_available Explain how she arrived at her diagnosis.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It just occurred to me he took too many pills.
not_available It's freezing in here.
not_available I'm trying to impress on Susan the importance of recognizing a good opportunity to augment her teaching files.
not_available How did the patient present? 
not_available Elderly man, late 70s.
not_available Disoriented, short of breath, blurred vision Goddamn it.
not_available Where are you? Susan? Susan, what do you think? I've got patients waiting.
not_available I gotta get back to work.
not_available Okay, buddy.
not_available You're not feeling so great, huh? What's his temperature? 
not_available 103.
not_available Okay, Carter, this is a good place for you to start.
not_available Come and present your findings.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'm gonna listen to your chest.
not_available Okay, take a deep breath for me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, someone named Karen called for you.
not_available Any message? 
not_available Confirming lunch.
not_available So Karen's her name, huh? Where'd you meet? We have a mutual acquaintance.
not_available Did you ever get ahold of that oncologist, Howard? His secretary said he'd be tied up all afternoon.
not_available Where is he? Upstairs.
not_available Number 701.
not_available Mark? Do you have a second? This is Jennifer, my Soontobe ex
not_available wife.
not_available Hi.
not_available Randi.
not_available You have a great soontobe ex
not_available husband.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Where is Jerry? Oh, he's off today.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available No, I was just in town to see my lawyer.
not_available You know, I don't know.
not_available About an hour into the meeting I realized I'd spent $250.
not_available It just seems so ridiculous.
not_available We've been making decisions together for 15 years.
not_available I just thought we could get together and cut to the chase.
not_available My shift ends at 8.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll swing by then.
not_available OUT OF ORDER 
not_available Great.
not_available Now what? 
not_available Has anyone called for paramedics? Hello? My brother is shot.
not_available This way.
not_available Stay close.
not_available Whore! One more word and your pal can bleed to death right where he is.
not_available We're sorry.
not_available Please! She's a nurse and she works every day saving your asses! 
not_available I'm okay, Shep.
not_available I wish you would've stayed in the rig.
not_available I've spotted our customer.
not_available Stand back, stand back! He's barely breathing.
not_available Time to practice again, Reilly! Got it! 
not_available Weak pulse.
not_available I'm gonna start an IV.
not_available My God, how many times was he shot? 
not_available Is he dying? Don't let him die.
not_available Step back! Just let me work! 
not_available Reilly, go get the board.
not_available We need it.
not_available Got it.
not_available All right.
not_available IV's in, wide open.
not_available You okay? Yeah, I'm good.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Back off! Take a deep breath.
not_available You're doing fine.
not_available Help him, man! Come on! You've got to step back! Help him! Come on, man, help him! Stay off! Hey, take it easy, man! Easy! Hey, what happened? 
not_available He wouldn't back off.
not_available He's out cold.
not_available Good.
not_available Maybe now I can work.
not_available So that's your diagnosis.
not_available The kid has the flu? Viral syndrome.
not_available I prescribed fever
not_available control measures and fluids.
not_available A rash, conjunctivitis, swollen glands.
not_available How long has he had the fever? His mom said about a week.
not_available Fever of unknown origin for seven days.
not_available Did I miss something? What color's his tongue? 
not_available Pink.
not_available Not strawberry? Maybe.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Did you notice his chapped lips? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Give him an aspirin and order an echocardiogram.
not_available But you never give aspirin to a child.

not_available She seemed unprepared for the side effects.
not_available If she complains again, I'll prescribe Compazine.
not_available She tried to bring up a few things.
not_available I think she feels overwhelmed and confused.

not_available That Reilly.
not_available Punk! He put in a freaking incident report against me! What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He said I used excessive force with that guy, that banger with the busted jaw.
not_available He made it sound like I went off or something.
not_available The guy's supposed to be my partner.
not_available Why would he say that? He's green.
not_available He was amped, we were all amped.
not_available You saw it, I barely shoved that guy.
not_available Come on, it's been a long day.
not_available So we'll say every Wednesday, every other weekend and we'll rotate summers and holidays.
not_available That should work.
not_available It will include the stipulation that we have to stay in the Chicago, Milwaukee area until Rachel graduates from high school.
not_available Can you even imagine? 
not_available No.
not_available That was easy.
not_available So should we split up the stock portfolios? Sure.
not_available I'll split a piece of pie with you.

not_available Slice of rhubarb.
not_available All right.
not_available Two forks.

not_available Why don't you wait over there? 
not_available Okay.
not_available So, Mr.

not_available Yeah, I cut my finger.
not_available I was making a sandwich.
not_available The kitchen can be a dangerous place.

not_available We'll need to irrigate that.
not_available Are you right
not_available handed, Mr.
not_available Johnson? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then how did you manage to cut the tip of your right pinkie off? Yeah, wouldn't you cut your left hand? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available And what about your other injury? Fell back on my chair and landed on the leg.
not_available All right, you wanna lie back so I can look at that? Oh, yeah, that's one mean testicular contusion.
not_available We'll do an ultrasound of his pelvis.
not_available Immobilize his leg.
not_available You're gonna need to lie very still.
not_available So did you bring the tip of your finger in? We can graft it back on.
not_available No, I couldn't find it.
not_available Lost in the kitchen, huh? Well, it doesn't matter.
not_available We can probably make this one fit.
not_available Hey! Let me up! Let me up! 
not_available That was fun.
not_available Made my day.
not_available I can't believe we just did that.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Oh, God! What am I going to tell Craig? You've handled that one before.
not_available Is that what this was? Revenge? A parting shot? No, no, no.
not_available It was just a bad idea.
not_available Yes, it was.
not_available This okay? Right here, okay? Well, I don't think we should sit until we dance.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Getting shy on me? 
not_available Shy? What, are you kidding me? I was gonna complain because it's not big enough out here.
not_available Not big enough for you? Well, well.
