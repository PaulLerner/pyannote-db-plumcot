not_available But I stayed so I could finish putting together this robot for him.
not_available You know, so I made her go.
not_available From the street I hear a thud.
not_available This scream.
not_available And I go to the window to look out.
not_available And she's lying there like she's asleep on the street.
not_available And icecream cakeIce
not_available cream cake was all around her on the pavement.
not_available Five syringes.
not_available So there I am.
not_available There I am with this little boy to raise.
not_available And what do I do? I start drinking.
not_available I get high.
not_available I can't keep it together.
not_available I can't keep it together.
not_available Then I stab some guy at a bar.
not_available Just for
not_available Just for nothing.
not_available For nothing.
not_available Because he looked at me wrong.
not_available This one's good.
not_available We can go up to 750 for hemostasis.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ready, Mr.
not_available Metcalf? So where was your son after that? With my wife's folks.
not_available Listen for bowel sounds.
not_available At first they would bring him by on visiting days but after a while that stopped.
not_available Then the letters started coming back unopened.
not_available You know what? I don't feel good.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available BUN, 74.
not_available Creatinine, 8.2.
not_available Okay.
not_available Call Renal and throw in a Foley.
not_available Hey.
not_available We should think about TIPS.
not_available What's that? TIPS stands for Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt.
not_available It
not_available We put a catheter from your neck to your belly.
not_available By bridging the two vessels, we bypass the liver and slow down the bleeding.
not_available How much time would that give me? 
not_available It's hard to say.
not_available No urine output.
not_available Hepatorenal syndrome.
not_available Your kidneys are not working.
not_available He needs dialysis.
not_available I'll make the call.
not_available Okay.
not_available GSW to the belly.
not_available Not here, Chuny.
not_available There's nowhere else.
not_available Okay.
not_available Move him over and keep traction on the Linton.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Okay, go ahead.
not_available Okay, let's transfer him.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available No meds, no allergies, no past history.
not_available NG, Foley, and a portable chest.
not_available Bastard shot me for stealing my spliff.
not_available I need another nurse.
not_available Said it was his, but it was mine.
not_available Rolled it this morning.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available They need to stabilize him.
not_available I want my own damn room! Get the hell out of here, man.
not_available Screw you, jerk
not_available off.
not_available Okay.
not_available Doctors only talking now.
not_available Damn, that's hard.
not_available Even a gunshot in the belly don't buy a man some privacy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Two grams of cefoxitin, IV piggyback.
not_available It's a house we rented one summer.
not_available There's a lake there by it.
not_available I took Bobby fishing there.
not_available Periumbilical GSW with intestinal prolapse.
not_available All right.
not_available What about the ondeck batter? 
not_available We're waiting for a TIPS and IR.
not_available That sounds bad.
not_available Let's get him up for an ex
not_available lap.
not_available Portable monitor.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What about xrays? 
not_available Get them upstairs.
not_available T minus 11 minutes on those pizzas.
not_available IR's already on the floor.
not_available Renal's on the way.
not_available Luka, he's getting tremulous.
not_available I haven't had a drink since last night.
not_available It's alcohol withdrawal.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt? 
not_available Yeah, that would be me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Ramirez, Nephrology.
not_available Who's this guy? 
not_available We're gonna need central access.
not_available He's got a subclavian.
not_available That's great.
not_available Let's consent him and start the run.
not_available What? What is he talking about? He's here for the dialysis that we discussed.
not_available I never discussed it.
not_available You discussed it.
not_available I never discussed it.
not_available Alfonso, how are you? 
not_available Is this a TIPS patient? Yeah.
not_available And we should go first.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available That's what's gonna prolong his life.
not_available Without the dialysis he'll bleed out the minute you spike his liver.
not_available What? What? Spike my liver? Will his pressure even tolerate dialysis if the varices bleed? 
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What? 
not_available I can support his pressure.
not_available The Linton is supporting his pressure.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? Well, he's gonna need dialysis three times a week.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available For the rest of his life.
not_available TIPS is not a cure.
not_available It's a bridge to a liver transplant.
not_available We know that's not gonna happen.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Now, you can't fix my kidneys? You're gonna need dialysis three times a week.
not_available And what about my liver problem and the bleeding? 
not_available The TIPS is a temporary measure.
not_available Your best hope is for a liver transplant.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What are the odds of that? Based on your history of drinking, not good.
not_available Is there any chance that I'm gonna be walking out of here? With the dialysis and the TIPS
not_available I mean, today.
not_available What are the chances that I'm gonna walk out of here today? None.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available I don't want anything, then.
not_available If you don't have the TIPS procedure, we can't control the bleeding.
not_available You'll die.
not_available Yeah, I get it.
not_available I get it.
not_available Just stop everything.
not_available No blood transfusions? No breathing? 
not_available No, it's over.
not_available No CPR? 
not_available No.
not_available I need it to be very clear, Charlie.
not_available If we don't continue with the treatment, do you understand what could happen? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Metcalf is a DNR.

not_available Hey, hey, he's not competent.
not_available Come on.
not_available That's what he wants, Pratt.
not_available Can you? Can you do something for this? Hey, could we put him on an alcohol drip? You're gonna get me drunk? 
not_available Just enough to stop tremors, Charlie.
not_available Charlie, let us do the procedure.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Call Try Bobby again.
not_available Try my boy.
not_available Get him on the phone.
not_available If he knows it's really over, he'll come.

not_available You won't be alone.

not_available That's good.
not_available Someone will stay with you.
not_available Sam, you get this? Could you touch me? Sorry? My face? Please? Maybe we should anchor.
not_available What? 
not_available Do you think we should keep going? I don't know, Charlie.
not_available Well, what about him? What do you think he wants? I don't know.
not_available I don't think he knows.
not_available Is it too late? Not if you don't want it to be, Charlie.
