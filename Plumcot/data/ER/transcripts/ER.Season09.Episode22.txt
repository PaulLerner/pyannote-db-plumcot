not_available Fever and a cough is pneumonia.
not_available Use cotrimoxazole.
not_available Fever and watery diarrhea is cholera.
not_available Rehydrate and use doxy.
not_available If the patient has a fever without sores, assume malaria and treat it with Fansidar.
not_available If they have recurrent infections and are wasting away, it's AIDS.
not_available So prepare the family for death.
not_available What drugs do you have on hand? Amoxicillin, doxycycline, Fansidar 
not_available metronidazole, chloramphenicol.
not_available You still use chloramphenicol? 
not_available It's cheap.

not_available But the patient's family members do most of the work.
not_available What? Nurses back home always complain about patient loads.
not_available It's usually about eight.
not_available Yeah, but I wouldn't use the conditions here as a positive example of anything.
not_available What ward is this? 
not_available This? This is Admitting.
not_available Temp's 104.
not_available Mom says she's got a headache.
not_available No diarrhea or coughing.

not_available That all you're having? I've had the food before.

not_available So where are you from?

not_available Luka? What's he like at home? I should get back to work.
not_available Luka took an immunization team out to Matenda three days ago.

not_available How are you finding it here? 
not_available Busy.
not_available No insurance forms, no triple
not_available charting.
not_available I love that.
not_available No healthcare system.
not_available I wouldn't mind filling out a few insurance forms if it meant I could have an ultrasound.
not_available Charles! Boy up front has a gunshot wound to the left upper quadrant.
not_available This one is a machete wound to the right thigh.

not_available Where are the gloves? 
not_available In the basin.
not_available Right over there.

not_available How do you stabilize the neck? 
not_available Sandbags.
not_available Who's he? 
not_available Says that he's the brother.
not_available He wouldn't let us leave without him.
not_available Give me a 7.5 ET tube.
not_available We don't have ET tubes.
not_available I can bag him.
not_available Great.
not_available Ask him what happened.
not_available I don't see any blood.

not_available Bag him on 15 liters.
not_available Make it two liters, or we'll run out of oxygen.

not_available A Dragunov rifle.
not_available His pressure's holding.
not_available Dragunov's muzzle velocity is 830 meters per second.
not_available It can kill from over half a mile away.
not_available Closer, it does more internal damage.
not_available So we're just gonna let him die? If I take him, he'll need five hours to stabilize.
not_available He'll probably die anyway.
not_available I have four hours of generator fuel and three injured boys I can't fix before the power goes out.
not_available Keep him stabilized.
not_available If the lights are still on when I'm finished, I'll come back.

not_available Looked like you did it before.
not_available I have.
not_available In the beginning, there's a lot of talk of national pride and patriotic speeches but after a few weeks, it becomes this.

not_available These people just want what everyone else wants.
not_available Their kids to have something to eat, to see them grow up laughing, happy.
not_available They don't care where the border is or who gets to call themselves president.
not_available Just want this to stop.
not_available I don't even begin to try to understand the politics here.
not_available You're an American, Carter.
not_available You believe if people are given the chance to convert to democracy 
not_available the world would be a better place.
not_available What's the alternative? Military dictatorships? You fight wars from the sky with bombs and missiles.
not_available Then your planes land back on the aircraft carrier and the pilots watch Drew Carey on satellite TV.
not_available Hey, American soldiers died in Iraq.
not_available Yeah, but your children don't starve to death while your men fight.
not_available Your women aren't raped.

not_available You're not staying.
not_available It's not your decision.
not_available You're getting into that truck and going.
