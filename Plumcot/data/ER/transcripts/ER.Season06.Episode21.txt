not_available Can someone take care of pain medication? It's clearly what she wants.
not_available She's dying.
not_available She doesn't know what she wants.
not_available I think she does.
not_available She was very clear.
not_available Doesn't she deserve to die where she wants to? With her family? In her own bed? Good.
not_available Why don't you tell her? It'll help calm her down.
not_available I really didn't need this today.
not_available Call Social Services.
not_available Maybe we should admit her.

not_available She'd go home eventually.
not_available She wants to go.
not_available We can't keep her here.
not_available She wants to die.
not_available We have to respect her wishes.
not_available She's in excruciating pain.

not_available What happened? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Somebody hit the call button.
not_available I did.
not_available What? She could hardly breathe! What happened? 
not_available She complained of hives.
not_available I gave her a subcu epi.
not_available Where's the blood from? 
not_available She must've pulled out her IV.
not_available Why would she? How would I know that? Start another line.
not_available Give her 50 of Benadryl, You nodded off for a second.
not_available Good pulse and respirations.
not_available Want any fluids? 
not_available How about a liter over an hour? This won't be pretty.
not_available Why was a critical patient discharged? She wasn't critical then.
not_available Her vitals were stable.
not_available You didn't appreciate the mass? 
not_available No.
not_available Who supervised? Dr.
not_available Malucci? Didn't you appreciate anything? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available What were you wearing? Oven mitts? Dr.
not_available Malucci never had a chance to examine the patient.
not_available Get your stories straight.
not_available I never called him in.
not_available Have you recently graduated from med school? I thought my OB/GYN experience qualified me.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available So you discharged a patient examined and treated by a student? She could've died! You're years from the experience for these decisions.
not_available I know.
not_available Oh, good! I'd like to speak with Dr.
not_available Malucci.
not_available Can I say something? Your cause is better served by keeping your mouth shut.
not_available When Residents arrive here, we size you up.
not_available We have great hopes for you.
not_available We want you to succeed.
not_available Gradually, through interaction, we form opinions.
not_available Do you want to know the staff's opinion of you? You're lazy, sloppy.
not_available Your careless attitude as a physician endangers patients' lives, as witnessed today.
not_available None of us thinks you're much of a doctor.
not_available Emotionally, he's depressed one moment, elated the next.
not_available Have you talked to him? 
not_available I tried to ask him how he's doing.
not_available He's not forthcoming.
not_available Is he seeing anyone? 
not_available Let's get out of the hallway.
not_available Can you give us a minute? 
not_available A therapist? I don't know.
not_available Shouldn't he? 
not_available I'm not a psychiatrist.
not_available You think it's none of my business.
not_available The DMS IV
not_available You're a shrink? He has violent mood swings.
not_available He's deeply depressed or he's manic.
not_available You're suggesting he's bipolar.
not_available Is there a family history? He was almost killed.
not_available He feels guilty about Lucy's death.
not_available I'd be moody too.
not_available But are you sure that's all it is? I may be wrong, but what if I'm right? If we care, don't we owe it to him to try and find out? How's she doing? 
not_available Breathing's agonal.
not_available Resps are seven.
not_available So she's not getting any better? 
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available We're trying to rehydrate her.
not_available and we called Social Services to help set up the hospice care.
not_available Where are your daughters? Down in the cafeteria, getting something to eat with some of the nurses.
not_available She's been sleeping so peacefully.
not_available You should have seen her two years ago.
not_available She was so beautiful.
not_available Alive and vibrant.
not_available Always laughing.
not_available I wish I could have it back.
not_available The time I missed with her.
not_available Traveling for work, late nights at the office.
not_available All the weekends I was prepping for trial.
not_available And when she was first diagnosed I kept working.
not_available Can you believe that? Instead of spending time with her, I kept working.
not_available I'm gonna call Social Services again.
not_available See what's keeping them.
not_available Thanks.
not_available She's not breathing.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Shelagh? Please, the girls aren't here.
not_available I didn't think it would happen this fast.
not_available Connie, can you help me? 
not_available She's a DNR.
not_available We can stimulate her breathing.
not_available They didn't say goodbye.
not_available I'll get Weaver.
not_available No, I want you to go and get Kovac.
not_available Tell him I need him, then go downstairs and get the daughters.
not_available Come on, Shelagh.
not_available Shelagh.
not_available Come on.
not_available Please, God.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Please.
not_available What happened? End
not_available stage ovarian cancer.
not_available She stopped breathing.
not_available Why are you baggin her.
not_available Let's intubate.
not_available We can't.
not_available She's a DNR.
not_available Then let her go.
not_available Her daughters haven't said goodbye yet.
not_available Please.
not_available I thought we had more time.
not_available Can we use a nasal trumpet? The children haven't had a chance to say goodbye to her dying mother.
not_available It's not a ventilator.
not_available Please? Where are the trumpets? 
not_available I'll get it.
not_available I'm in.
not_available She's breathing.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available We put in a nasal trumpet.
not_available She's DNR.
not_available We didn't intubate.
not_available We're helping the airway
not_available You resuscitated her.
not_available She's your patient? 
not_available Yes, she's my patient.
not_available Her daughters didn't say goodbye.
not_available Will you excuse us for a moment? 
not_available You violated a patient's wishes.
not_available I did what I thought best.
not_available That's not your decision! 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Damn right! You're a senior staff member.
not_available We discussed this earlier.
not_available I told you exactly what I wanted done! Respect my authority or don't work here! If she codes again, neither of you are to touch her.
not_available Is that clear? I'm sorry, Luka.
not_available Luka, don't just walk
not_available You're here? I thought you'd be upstairs all day.
not_available I saw Kerry about Malucci.
not_available What did he do? I just discussed it.
not_available Can I tell you later? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Get your dad sorted out? Where is he now? 
not_available Actually, in the trunk of my car.
not_available I had no time to go home.
not_available Where's Rachel? 
not_available With Jen's parents, being spoiled.
not_available You might like these back.
not_available I shouldn't keep them.
not_available My father gave them to you.
not_available It was very sweet.
not_available But I just think it's a bad idea.
not_available Rachel should have them.
not_available I was Don't read too much into this.
not_available Do I do that? 
not_available You do it regularly.
not_available An acute Ml is coming in.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Are you still coming by tonight? Where will Rachel sleep? 
not_available In the living room.
not_available I'm not off till 12.

not_available You put me in a bad position.
not_available I know.
not_available She's my superior.
not_available I can't lose my job.
not_available You've every reason to be mad.
not_available You took advantage of our relationship.
not_available I did what I thought was right.
not_available Damn the consequences.
not_available In this case yes.
not_available You can make that decision for yourself, but not for me.
not_available You're really mad.
not_available Yes, I am! Why are you smiling? 
not_available I thought I was immune.
not_available Well, you're not! Luka, I'm sorry.
not_available Really.
not_available It will never happen again.

not_available And thank you.
not_available For what? For helping her.

not_available There's the mouse.
not_available Guys, your mom's ready to see you now.
not_available Could you take Jennifer? Sure.
not_available We'll be in in a minute.
not_available Don't you want to see your mom? She's going to die, isn't she? It's not fair.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I don't want to only have a dad.
not_available I want to be a family, like we used to be.
not_available Come on.
not_available We should go.
not_available You ready? Hi, Mommy.
