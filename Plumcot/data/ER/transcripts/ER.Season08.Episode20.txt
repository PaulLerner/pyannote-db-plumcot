not_available We're starting breakfast.
not_available You want anything? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Two mimosas, please.
not_available Excuse me? No, we're fine.
not_available It started on my birthday.
not_available What? I didn't start drinking when Brian hit me.
not_available I started drinking before that.
not_available And I probably wouldn't have been stupid enough to open the door if I hadn't been.
not_available Self
not_available pity excuse.
not_available Well, it's one of my better ones.
not_available What time is it? Oh, God.
not_available It's almost 6:00.

not_available Then I have got just enough time to drop you off at a meeting.
not_available No.
not_available I have to go to bed.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Nope.
not_available But if you quit bugging me, I promise I'll go later.
not_available When? Before my shift.
not_available Good, you're here.
not_available I was gonna page you, but Jerry said you were on at 7.
not_available You're on at 7? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've done it before.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's your homeless guy.
not_available Six
not_available beat run of ectopy.
not_available How long has that been going on? Almost an hour.
not_available I needed to start lido but I couldn't get a directive in his chart, and he won't tell me.
not_available She don't listen.
not_available and then start a drip at two per minute.
not_available Wait.
not_available So he's full code? 
not_available There he goes again.
not_available I don't know.
not_available He was Greene's private patient or something.
not_available Yeah, we lost his pressure.

not_available Tough old bird.
not_available Okay, 20 of etomidate, eight of Pav.
not_available Wait, wait, wait.
not_available Carter, I think he's trying to talk.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available No.
not_available What? No tubes.
not_available No shocks.
not_available What did he say? He said no more.
not_available Thanks for destroying my night.
not_available Did you get it? She bled like stink.
not_available Control was nearly impossible around the rib cage.
not_available I was inside and outside the chest simultaneously.
not_available Did you get it? 
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available Resected fully.
not_available Margins are clear.
not_available How's Daddy? 
not_available Breathing over the vent.
not_available Reflexes fully intact.
not_available Should be extubated by this afternoon.

not_available I'll tell Mom.
not_available You should get some sleep.
not_available You look like crap.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, are you sure you got it? I got it.
not_available The only thing he's been consistent about is not wanting any treatment.
not_available If he discussed this with Dr.
not_available Greene, then there should be a note in the charts.
not_available Well, maybe Dr.
not_available Greene expected to be here.
not_available Fine.
not_available He's your patient.
not_available I have no idea what you're saying.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Should someone save him? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What's the problem, Pratt? 
not_available I don't speak Portuguese.
not_available That's Italian.
not_available That either.
not_available Grandma was babysitting, and he woke up with this rash.
not_available She can't tell me if he's got any allergies, and I can't find the parents.
not_available Strawberry.
not_available What? 
not_available Strawberry.
not_available Jelly, jam, maybe cereal.
not_available Probably eating it before he went to sleep.
not_available Hey, you know anybody at Northwestern? 
not_available Yeah, I know a few.
not_available Could you do me a favor? Tell them they made a mistake, that they should take me.
not_available No.
not_available I'd have to believe that.
not_available Come on, you know I'm good.
not_available Too good to be wasted at County? 
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Look, we're an under
not_available serviced community, and we need doctors.
not_available For better or for worse, we drew you.
not_available Blood sugar over 400.
not_available Good pick
not_available up.
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available I shouldn't have sat down.
not_available If I don't sit down, I won't cry.
not_available Well, you have to sit down eventually.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can't I just pretend he moved to the South Pacific and lived happily ever after? In a way, he did.
not_available A girl and her father are hit by a cement truck on the way to ballet class.
not_available A malignant tumor invades her chest, and we find it by happenstance.
not_available She'll walk out of here in a week with not a care in the world.
not_available Mark walked the halls of a hospital every day and didn't know about his tumor till he presented with symptoms.
not_available Well, we save who we can, right? It has to make more sense than that.
not_available You're looking for a reason? I miss him already.
not_available Me too.
not_available I went away for five years.
not_available I thought of him on occasion.
not_available Talked to him sporadically.
not_available But I miss him.
not_available I thought he'd always, always be here.
not_available Well, it's good to miss him.
not_available It's missing him that keeps him here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You should write for Hallmark.
not_available I have hidden talents.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I have to get back to work.
not_available I have a pilonidal cyst in 5 waiting to be lanced.
not_available Give it to Pratt.
not_available He needs the humility.
not_available That will be cathartic.
not_available Where did you get that? What? 
not_available Combination.
not_available Personnel.
not_available Pratt matched at County.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available He keeps bitching about it.
not_available He needs a locker.
not_available Thought I'd spare Elizabeth the chore.
not_available Heard you had some trouble with Romano yesterday.
not_available He was right.
not_available I took too long making a decision.
not_available You don't have that luxury anymore.
not_available I never really thought I did.
not_available Mark's gone.
not_available That means you've been here longer than any other doctor.
not_available People will look to you to step in and fill the void.
not_available Big void.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I can't do this.
not_available Will you do this? Thank you.
not_available Shotgun to the face.
not_available This is gonna be fun, huh? Cheaper than plastic surgery.
not_available How's the bite? I'm not howling at the moon.
not_available There is no moon.
not_available How did it go? 
not_available What? The meeting.
not_available It was boring.
not_available You went? Yeah.
not_available I just said it was boring, didn't I? Sorry, they didn't give me a card.
not_available You went for you or because you promised me you would? Is this guy gonna look like hamburger? More like ground chuck.
not_available I went for you.
not_available You're gonna need some more people.
not_available Why? Come on, hard restraints! No IV? 
not_available 20 of morphine before he pulled out.
not_available Sir, we need you to hold still.
not_available Come on, Gallant, keep him on the table.
not_available 100 of fent, two of Ativan.
not_available Page Surgery, Plastics, Head and Neck.
not_available Could be PCP.
not_available Or the gunshot wound.
not_available Sir, we're gonna help you.
not_available But you gotta hold still 
not_available while we get the morphine into you.
not_available Okay, pressure 100/80.
not_available Pulse, 150.
not_available Get access.
not_available We need to sedate him.

not_available He's settling down.
not_available Betadine.
not_available 20 of etomidate.
not_available Wait, are we tubing him or criking him? 
not_available Criking.
not_available Look at his face.
not_available Just taking a peek.
not_available All right, bradying down.
not_available Yeah, he aspirated too much blood.
not_available Open the crash cart.
not_available Gallant, unroof his jaw and hold it out of the way.
not_available I need to see the epiglottis.
not_available Mg of atropine.
not_available Susan, hook your finger under his tongue.
not_available I can't do it.

not_available Okay, full trauma panel.
not_available C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available Gallant, why don't you go get yourself some air? Want a facial CT? Yeah, good idea.
not_available Why don't we get a full head series? Call RT.
not_available Let's get a vent.
not_available Give him four of Ativan, seven of Pav.
not_available Nice work, John.
not_available Bet that was a new one.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I just thought I was gonna be sick.
not_available It's better if you keep your head down.
not_available It'll be okay.
not_available It just caught me by surprise, you know? Relax.
not_available Take a minute.
not_available You know, sometimes I don't think I can do this.
not_available You know, there's two kinds of doctors.
not_available There's the kind that get rid of their feelings and the kind that hold on to them.
not_available If you're gonna hold on to your feelings, you're gonna get sick once in a while.
not_available It's part of it.
not_available You know, people come in here and they're sick and they're bleeding sometimes they're dying and they need our help.
not_available And helping them is more important than how we feel.
not_available Hell, I've been doing this eight years.
not_available I still get sick.
not_available Take another minute.
not_available Did he go up? 
not_available OMFS, ENT and Plastics all in.
not_available Both carotids and IJ's intact.
not_available He must have turned right when the blast hit him.
not_available Good.
not_available How's he doing? Oh, he'll be all right.
not_available How are you? Ask me tomorrow.
not_available Good night.

not_available He might need some fluids soon.
not_available No.
not_available Morphine boluses of 10.
not_available I heard you were gone.
not_available No, I'm still here.
not_available Good.
not_available You know I don't like nobody else helping me.
not_available I know.
not_available You've always treated me like a man.
not_available Just try and relax.
not_available What is that? That monitor's just a little sensitive, that's all.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available There's no reason to be.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available I could have been a better person.
not_available I could have done more.
not_available You did enough.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available It won't be much longer.
not_available I'll stay right here.
not_available Let me see.
not_available I think I singed my eyebrow.
not_available I need to see.
