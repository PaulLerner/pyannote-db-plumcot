not_available Did you get tomorrow off? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Did you get tonight off? 
not_available No, I owe too many shifts.
not_available Christmas Eve will cost me double.
not_available This is so unfair.
not_available Well, flex your muscle.
not_available You make the nursing schedule.
not_available Yeah, which is why I get stuck with it.
not_available "Carol can work Christmas, she has no life.
not_available " They don't even feel guilty.
not_available Make them feel guilty about it.
not_available Now, that's the Christmas spirit.
not_available Tell them about us.
not_available This is stupid.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available You know that.

not_available Very believable.
not_available Any papers I need to sign? Some formalities.
not_available I'll send them over.
not_available You're done.
not_available That's it? 
not_available The Law family wanted an apology.
not_available An apology? From me? "No possibility," I said.
not_available You're all done.
not_available You're clear.
not_available I want a picture with you.
not_available Chris, one more.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I made the lawsuit disappear.

not_available Damn it! On second thought, yeah.

not_available Don't get discouraged if he ends up playing with all the boxes.
not_available Are those for the Christmas party? They're pizzelles.
not_available Italian Christmas cookies.
not_available My mom bakes them.
not_available I thought I'd give it a try since I won't get home.

not_available My eyes.
not_available I can see! Sir, try not to move.

not_available If xrays are normal, send for a non

not_available Wait! What's your name? What's his scam? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But that guy was never blind.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Lydia, can you cover for me tomorrow night? I'm cooking Christmas dinner for Al's family, all 25.
not_available You're lucky you're working.
not_available You gotta plug in a string, then separate it one at a time.
not_available Oh, really? Then why don't you show me.
not_available Carter, would your grandparents like any food or anything? For what? They're coming to see the clinic today.
not_available Their annual pilgrimage to their worthy causes.
not_available It's that bad? 
not_available No.
not_available But the clinic won't be the only thing being checked out.
not_available Henry! Something wrong? No.
not_available I feel much better.
not_available Why? You're on time.
not_available I suppose I deserve that.
not_available I still have to pass this clerkship.
not_available No one's pulling for you more than me.
not_available A gram of Ancef for our friend in 2? 
not_available Sure thing.
not_available That's good.
not_available Because I figure the only thing that I really haven't done is a major emergency procedure.
not_available That's a matter of opinion.
not_available So why don't you give me an LP or an intubation or something and then you can ship me off with a clear conscience.
not_available I brought my own gloves.
not_available Look, please.
not_available I
not_available Merry Christmas to you too! Who was that? I hit my limit on my credit so they froze my card.
not_available Can you believe it? Christmas Eve and I had your present picked out! How much do you owe? 
not_available $600.
not_available And I was making a dent in it, but with the holidays and everything
not_available Listen, I haven't gotten your present yet either.
not_available So why don't I pay your balance as a Christmas present? 
not_available No, I can't let you do that.
not_available Sure, you can.
not_available But you have to promise not to go and spend it on me.
not_available Really? Anybody home? Carol! What happened?

not_available No.
not_available Six ET tube.
not_available The soot he inhaled can cause tracheal edema.
not_available Swelling makes it harder to intubate.
not_available So we intubate now? 
not_available Right.
not_available Jonathan, we're gonna put you to sleep.
not_available Then we're gonna put a tube in your windpipe to help you breathe.
not_available Can I try it? Kids are tough.
not_available This isn't really a teaching case.
not_available Next time, Henry.
not_available Jeanie, you're working today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I didn't see you scheduled.
not_available I'm volunteering at the clinic.
not_available What are the needles for? A man with hepatitis B is sharing with friends.
not_available You're giving them to him? 
not_available I'll replace them.
not_available That's not my concern.
not_available It's against the law.
not_available Do you want him to pass it on or get something worse? Just be careful.
not_available Know who you're dealing with.
not_available The patient won't report me, Kerry.
not_available Will you? Hey, Saint Peter.
not_available I heard about your miracle.
not_available Some of us have the touch.
not_available Where's the blind guy? 
not_available He's not blind.
not_available He's not here either.
not_available He and his dog left 10 minutes ago.
not_available Said he won't hang around a hospital when there's a whole world to see.
not_available He just wanted some attention.
not_available Don't sell yourself short.
not_available You're gonna work a shift? 
not_available I've practiced medicine on occasion.

not_available It's cold outside.
not_available Okay, I'll wait in Chairs.
not_available Feliz Navidad.
not_available Feliz Navidad, Pablo.
not_available Thank you, Kerry.
not_available I'm curious.
not_available Who pays for those? The vouchers? Us.
not_available Why? 
not_available Get a cab company to comp them.
not_available How? Good PR, promise to call for paying customers.
not_available No one thought of that before? 
not_available We do it at other ERs.
not_available We'll try it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you have a scrub top I could borrow? Greg Powell.
not_available Paramedic who brought the boy in the chimney.
not_available I didn't recognize you.
not_available You clean up well.
not_available Thank you.
not_available A scrub top won't keep you warm.
not_available I'll get a coat from Goodwill.
not_available It's clean? And very fashionable.
not_available Follow me.

not_available Sorry.
not_available It had to be done fast.
not_available He was coding.
not_available Do you want to try it now? He's dead.
not_available So? You're not gonna hurt him, right? I'll get a death kit.
not_available Are you sure we can do this? 
not_available You want to pass, don't you? Try a 7.5.
not_available Okay.
not_available Insert it laterally sweeping the tongue out of the way and placing the tip of the blade on the vallecula.
not_available You see it? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Gently, man! Come on.
not_available Easy.

not_available Allison has a few left, I'd say.
not_available You know, worries.
not_available Kerry, can we talk privately?

not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I left my meds at home, and I'm on a strict regimen.
not_available What do you need?

not_available Eight hundred milligrams.
not_available That's 150 of 3TC, 200 AZT? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What do we tell them? What we would've had to tell them anyway.

not_available We applied every lifesaving measure at our disposal but were unsuccessful.
not_available No.
not_available I'm afraid he didn't make it.
not_available No! I'm sorry.
not_available You should know that his last thoughts were of you.
not_available What did he say? "I love you, Maria.
not_available " Maria? I'm Angela.
not_available Maria is Joey's wife.
not_available Maria? 
not_available That bastard! Mrs.
not_available Larkin, I'm gonna use a solvent to get the rest of the tape off.
not_available It may sting a little.
not_available Nurse Hathaway's gonna ask some questions.
not_available They may be difficult to answer, but they're important in catching and prosecuting whoever did this.
not_available And in helping us treat you medically, Mrs.
not_available Larkin.
not_available Okay? My name's Carol.
not_available To your knowledge, did penetration occur vaginally? Yes.
not_available By a penis? Yes.
not_available By anything else? Any foreign object, Mrs.
not_available Larkin? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Did ejaculation occur? I don't think so.
not_available It happened so fast.
not_available He grabbed me from behind and threw me on the floor.
not_available Then he hit me.
not_available He hit me and kicked me again and again.
not_available He broke my glasses.
not_available Did you see his face? 
not_available I don't remember it.
not_available Just the tape.
not_available And the Can you finish this, Carol? Nurse Hathaway's going to collect some samples.
not_available If she needs a sedative, Valium, five milligrams, PO.
not_available Hey, Peter? Guess what? I was curious about your miracle, so I looked him up.
not_available Bart Pariotte.
not_available He was in last year.
not_available The chart says he's blind.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Take a look for yourself.
not_available Nothing indicates he was faking it? No.
not_available He came in with a minor leg lac that he got falling out of a dumpster.
not_available Doesn't look like they did a visual acuity test.
not_available I wonder what's his angle.
not_available Who knows? The Lord works in mysterious ways.
not_available Are you Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tommy Gruger.
not_available I'm a friend of Bart's.
not_available I saw him playing with his dog.
not_available He can see.
not_available He says you did it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He's mistaken.
not_available Please, help me.
not_available I want to walk again.
not_available Why won't you cure me? I'll believe whatever you say.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available There's nothing to believe.
not_available I'm gonna take your picture now, okay? Broken nose, fractured ankle, multiple lacerations and contusions.
not_available Duct tape used on her mouth.
not_available Vaginal penetration, possible foreign object.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, they wrote on her.
not_available The word "whore" in black Magic Marker.
not_available Does that suggest something? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Do the injuries seem consistent with her story? You think she might have made this up? A victim isn't always accurate.
not_available It's hard to take notes while being bludgeoned.
not_available Give her a break.
not_available She's been through a lot.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll take care if it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No problem.
not_available Your taxi's waiting.
not_available Great.
not_available Was Allison Beaumont moved from Recovery? 
not_available She's just coming out of anesthesia.
not_available No, not this one.
not_available She's in a coma.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Tell the cab to wait.
not_available Allison, can you hear me? Don't try to speak.
not_available Just squeeze my hand if you hear me.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Elizabeth Corday.
not_available Do you know where you are? You're in hospital.
not_available You were involved in a very serious automobile accident 10 days ago.
not_available Do you understand? Are you in any pain? What is it? MOM? I'm afraid she didn't survive.
not_available Your mom died.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hey, what's that? Hey.
not_available Oh, nothing.
not_available This guy dropped this off for you.
not_available I think it's more lawyer stuff.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's good news.
not_available What is it? Is that for me? No.
not_available Mark, don't.
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available What'd you get? Who's the heavy artillery for? 
not_available A friend of mine.
not_available Her son.
not_available I wish they had this stuff when I was a kid.
not_available Mark, I finished Mrs.
not_available Larkin's rape form.
not_available Did you want to review it before I gave it to the cops? 
not_available I'll give her a minute, then see her.
not_available All right.
not_available That was a lie.
not_available This is for my son.
not_available He's 5.
not_available You have a son? Yeah.
not_available I haven't seen him since he was 2.
not_available But I talked to him on the phone a few times.
not_available You've never said anything.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's really complicated.
not_available His father and I broke up when he was born.
not_available I wasn't really together back then.
not_available So I decided to let Joe's parents take care of him.
not_available He lives in a trailer park right outside Kankakee.
not_available I'll seal the rape kit now.
not_available All right? Yeah, sure.
not_available I know that this is the best thing for Jason.
not_available Although I miss him, you know? Sure.
not_available I can only imagine.
not_available But at least this year for Christmas I can send him some nice things.
not_available Sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What kind of sicko would rape an old lady? I can't count the times I've done this.
not_available It never gets any easier.
not_available I'd worry if it did.
not_available Would you work for me tomorrow? You'd get time and a half.
not_available Sorry, I'm going skiing with Alex.
not_available Just the slopes, snow and a hot tub for two.
not_available Sounds great.
not_available Carol, some old lady with Santa Claus is looking for you.
not_available She's early.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available As policy, I don't give to panhandlers.
not_available I recommend the Lakeshore Shelter at 1 Oth and Wacker.
not_available Two bucks.
not_available Give it a rest.
not_available Up yours, Santa.
not_available Wait over there.
not_available Someone'll be with you.
not_available I don't want someone.
not_available I want the miracle man.
not_available I'm so sorry about this.
not_available Thank you so much for coming.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available This is another of my grandsons, Chase, John's cousin.
not_available Hi.
not_available Carol Hathaway.
not_available Do you smell smoke? Oh, my God! Cynthia, get the fire extinguisher! Hey, look out! Quick! Do you know how to use it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Nice job! It's been a little crazy around here today.
not_available Oh, man! All the lights need to come down.
not_available They're too old.
not_available Even Rudolph? I just bought him.
not_available Rudolph can stay.
not_available Carol, we need to talk.
not_available In a minute.
not_available So this is where the clinic patients wait before they're seen.
not_available Yeah, I've been here over an hour.
not_available We're still working out a few kinks.
not_available Sharing space with the ER is it's confusing.
not_available Merry Christmas, Gamma! 
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available I was giving her the tour.
not_available Great.
not_available Where's Gramps? He overdid it playing squash at the club.
not_available Thought it best to stay home.
not_available Bad enough to keep him out of the Santa suit.
not_available We have an excellent substitute.
not_available Yes.
not_available Hi, Scooter.
not_available Very sharp.
not_available Is this the new and improved? Changing of the guard? 
not_available I sure hope not.
not_available Chase is executive heir apparent.
not_available We can't all be doctors.
not_available Would you like to see an exam room? 
not_available Hey, Nat.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Just fine, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available How are you? Can't complain.
not_available Having a little trouble? Yeah.
not_available She's 15 years old.
not_available Bound to die on me sometimes.
not_available How's your baby? Loud.
not_available Actually, I'm looking forward to his first Christmas.
not_available Soon you'll be begging him to come home.
not_available Enjoy him while he still wants to hang with his old man.
not_available I'll do that.
not_available Merry Christmas, Nat.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Hey, look at that! She's working! 
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Hi.
not_available You know if we have any decaf? 
not_available Decaf? What's the point? Carter's grandmother's asking for it.
not_available Listen, did you catch that? What Cynthia said? What? 
not_available She has a kid.
not_available Fiveyear
not_available old boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Living with her ex
not_available boyfriend's parents.
not_available Is this the first you've heard of it? 
not_available Bad sign? You're asking me? Doug warned me not to get involved.
not_available If she's expecting something of you you're not willing to give you're not helping by dragging it out.
not_available I'm not dragging anything out.
not_available Cynthia's great.
not_available I thought you were flying home.
not_available I postponed to the red
not_available eye.
not_available Allison Beaumont came out of her coma.
not_available What's the prognosis? Neurologically she looks good.
not_available We did the fibular transfer on her leg this morning.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Good work.
not_available Part of me wants to run in there and confess.
not_available Tell her my enthusiasm for the procedure put her in a coma in a first place.
not_available Look, you saved her leg.
not_available She's out of danger and better off.
not_available That's it, isn't it? Purging my guilt will help me to feel better.
not_available It certainly won't help her.
not_available Bad things happen to people.
not_available But you did your job.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Do you know what happened? A guy jumped her at her door.
not_available It wasn't a secure building.
not_available You have any leads? She wasn't much help.
not_available It's still a blur.
not_available Does the writing make it personal? Look, Dr? 
not_available Greene.
not_available We can't discuss an investigation.
not_available But we appreciate your concern.
not_available We'll handle it from here, okay? Sure, you will.
not_available What, did she liquidate a toy store? You know Gamma Mill never comes empty
not_available handed.
not_available Who are you handing these to? Who cares? 
not_available As long as it makes her feel good.
not_available We could try Pediatrics.
not_available So did Gramps really overdo it or does he just have an aversion to hospitals? All men over 70 have an aversion to hospitals.
not_available Don't take it personally.
not_available No, it's a relief.
not_available I don't have to defend my wasted life in medicine.
not_available Don't think Gamma will report back? It's a stay of execution, then.
not_available Probably just wants to wait and get me on his home turf.
not_available He still thinks you're a surgeon.
not_available Yeah, I'm a coward.
not_available You're braver than I am.
not_available John, this Mel Sauderback, headache, fever, malaise.
not_available He needs a spinal tap to rule out meningitis.
not_available Thought I might do it.
not_available He has diarrhea? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available It's the stomach flu, Henry.
not_available Honestly, continuity of care is hard to measure.
not_available Sometimes you're part caregiver, part social worker even part parent sometimes.
not_available Jeanie? I'd like you to meet Millicent Carter.
not_available I'm Jeanie Boulet.
not_available Jeanie's a physician assistant helping out in the clinic.
not_available Can we scrub the writing off Mrs.
not_available Larkin? 
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Don't let me keep you.
not_available Jeanie, could Mrs.
not_available Carter follow you while you see patients? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Only if they're comfortable.
not_available No problem.
not_available Great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available PCO
not_available 230, pH 7.4.
not_available All good news.
not_available How would you like to take that tube out of your throat? I thought you might.
not_available All right.
not_available When I tell you, I want you to take a deep breath in and blow out hard as I pull out the tube.
not_available Can you do that for me? Okay.
not_available Breathe in and blow.
not_available Great.
not_available Great.
not_available That's better.
not_available No, don't try to speak.
not_available Tube's been in for over a week.
not_available Your throat needs to adjust.
not_available Let me get you some ice chips.
not_available Can you ring the head neck surgeon on call, please? Is it an emergency? It's Christmas Eve.
not_available Just do it, okay? Gina, have you been tested for HIV? 
not_available No.
not_available You should.
not_available The boys are all in high school.
not_available They don't have AIDS.
not_available That's not true.
not_available With your history of chlamydia, you're at greater risk.
not_available I gotta get home.
not_available I can draw some blood.
not_available No.
not_available I'm cool.
not_available Gina, look, if you are HIV
not_available positive and you decide to have this child you'll want to protect it against infection.
not_available Drugs will help reduce the chances of passing the virus to your baby.
not_available Look, I don't have AIDS.
not_available I don't sleep with gay guys or druggies.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available You have AIDS? I'm HIV
not_available positive.
not_available How long will the test take? Chuny, someone page me for a consult? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available He wouldn't calm down until I called you.
not_available What? 
not_available You won't believe this.
not_available He's blind again.
not_available No nystagmus with opticokinetic drum.
not_available Is that him? Is that Dr.
not_available Benton? What's his name again? 
not_available Bart.
not_available I can't see no more, doc.
not_available You have to touch me again.
not_available Look straight ahead, Bart.
not_available You have to touch me, doc.
not_available Please? Do like you done before.
not_available Touch me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Try again.
not_available Okay, let's get him up for a CT.
not_available One more time, doc! Try it again, please! One more time.
not_available I'll dress this.
not_available An orthopedist will look at your ankle and we'll admit you for observation.
not_available They'll be so disappointed.
not_available I'm sorry? I play the organ at church.
not_available They always have an organ for Christmas Mass.
not_available I'm sure they'll understand.
not_available Probably too late to find a substitute.
not_available You have to stop worrying about Mass.
not_available You've been through something horrible.
not_available I don't want to talk about that.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available It's so hard.
not_available I'm so angry.
not_available I hate him, whoever he is.
not_available There's nothing wrong with that.
not_available I can't be like that.
not_available I have to forgive.
not_available You don't have to forgive anybody.
not_available He did this.
not_available Not you.
not_available Hating him won't make this go away.
not_available I'm afraid nothing'll make it go away.
not_available Can you cover my last half
not_available hour? I gotta do something.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I covered for you this morning.
not_available And you have that attending from Synergix to help.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'd be happy to.
not_available Okay.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Hey, you leaving? I gotta do this thing.
not_available Can you take the El home? To your home, right? I don't know.
not_available I'm gonna have to call you later, okay? Okay.
not_available I'm sorry I've been so busy.
not_available Did you see anything interesting? It's been a very enlightening experience.
not_available Anything else you'd like to see? 
not_available I've seen everything I needed to.
not_available May I use your phone? 
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available There's a potluck dinner if you'd like to stay.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Is she upset? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Oh, John.
not_available I'm ready to leave.
not_available Where's your cousin? Maybe he's still handing out gifts.
not_available Talking about Santa? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He went out for some fresh air.
not_available Santa, you in there? What is this? 
not_available It's nothing.
not_available Nothing? 
not_available Shut the door.
not_available Are you crazy? What do you think you're doing? It's a little stocking stuffer.
not_available This isn't funny.
not_available How long you been doing this? 
not_available John, just chill out.
not_available I'm not an addict.
not_available I just do it when I'm bored, okay? I cannot believe how stupid I was! A spider bite.
not_available That was from skin popping.
not_available You lied to me? Can you blame me? 
not_available Come on, you're smarter than this.
not_available I got it under control.
not_available So does every street junkie coming through here.
not_available I am not a street junkie.
not_available And I buy pure stuff.
not_available You know, I don't care how pure it is.
not_available Thank you for the medical advice, doctor.
not_available But I'd prefer it if you were just my cousin.
not_available Taken to hiding out in cars, have we? Filling in for Grandfather doesn't entitle you to his bad habits.
not_available I had some work I had to do.
not_available Or his excuses.
not_available Something the matter? No.
not_available I had better get back.
not_available Come early tonight.
not_available Your grandfather wants to talk to you.
not_available I'll try.
not_available That is one nasty
not_available looking craniopharyngioma.
not_available Right here, compressing against the optic chiasm.
not_available That explains the blindness.
not_available From its size, it's been growing for years.
not_available How do you account for temporary sight? 
not_available Sometimes the mind plays tricks.
not_available Head trauma could've caused it? Or maybe it triggered some visual memory.
not_available No, he could see.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I was there.
not_available I saw it.
not_available I don't know what to tell you.
not_available From the evidence in front of me there's no way he's seen anything for five or six years.
not_available Lizzie? I thought you'd be over the Atlantic.
not_available Slight change of plans.
not_available Did I make you miss your flight? No, I just decided on spending Christmas in Chicago after all.
not_available Awesome.
not_available I'm on my way to a party.
not_available A friend is renting out the entire top floor of the Prudential Building.
not_available You want to come along? Thank you, but no.
not_available I'm waiting on a headand
not_available neck consult.
not_available The Beaumont girl.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm afraid her vocal cords might be paralyzed.
not_available Well, don't hold your breath, on the consult, that is.
not_available He's probably on his way to a party somewhere himself.
not_available Just the same.
not_available Maybe New Year's Eve.
not_available Lovely.
not_available Three things to 
say Gladys Knight, Atlantic City, fourth row.
not_available What do you want? My friend has tickets for New Year's.
not_available You gotta get someone to cover for me.
not_available What're you doing tomorrow? Is there a Carol Hathaway? 
not_available I'm her.
not_available Holiday Design.
not_available Delivery for you.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available Outside.
not_available Bring it in.
not_available It won't fit.
not_available That's a tree! 
not_available Gorgeous.
not_available I can't believe they got it in here.
not_available Sign here.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Merry Christmas to you too.
not_available Who is this from? "Happy Holidays from the Carter Family Foundation.
not_available " Oh, my God! What? 
not_available It's a check.
not_available A hundred and fifty grand! Oh, my God! 
not_available I guess she liked it here! Hi, I'm Mark Greene.
not_available I'm the doctor
not_available I know who you are.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm very sorry for your loss.
not_available It's Christmas Eve, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I know.
not_available What the hell you doing here? 
not_available I came to apologize.
not_available I thought you was above all that.
not_available Your uptown lawyer, he blew us off.
not_available He was wrong.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available I can't tell you if my assumption about your brother was racism or experience.
not_available Probably both.
not_available I can tell you that I used you.
not_available It wasn't you.
not_available No.
not_available Feel better now? Maybe.
not_available Can't front though.
not_available I was glad when I heard you got beat down.
not_available I wanted you to hurt.
not_available But whether you get messed up or we get a million dollars my brother's still dead.
not_available Some punk dealer shot him.
not_available And there's no meaning in that.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? Yeah.
not_available How'd you know? Your shoes squeak.
not_available You've come to give me the bad news? You have a very large brain tumor.
not_available It's what caused the blindness.
not_available It's operable, but because of the place and size it's difficult to completely remove.
not_available However, with a little radiation, there is a good chance of survival.
not_available So I'll be able to see again? Well, once the tumor is extracted, it's possible but highly unlikely.
not_available It was highly unlikely I'd see today.
not_available Medically, that was impossible.
not_available I spent all afternoon in the park, you know? Just watching.
not_available Santos playing in the snow and steam coming up off the water and the way snow falls lightly on the trees.
not_available It's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah.
not_available I guess so.
not_available Trust me it's beautiful.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey! Good day? It ended good.
not_available Guess who got tomorrow off? Flexed a little muscle? 
not_available I had to give up New Year's.
not_available But it's worth it.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available What? I volunteered to work for Anna tomorrow.
not_available She's an intern.
not_available I just thought maybe we'd spend more time together.
not_available You didn't! 
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available That's a lie.
not_available Romantic though, wasn't it? 
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available You're looking at what? Come here.
not_available Can I have your attention, everybody? Can I have your attention, please? I have an announcement to make.
not_available Turn down that music.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've kept this a secret far too long.
not_available Doug Ross and I are seeing each other again.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available And we're very happy.
not_available Okay, pay up, pay up.
not_available I was a week too late.
not_available I thought New Year's.
not_available I'm surprised they kept it a secret this long.
not_available You knew? 
not_available Please, it was obvious.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Me either.
not_available Maybe something that you guys didn't know is that we've been seeing each other for a little while now, again and I think it would be great if she were to marry me.
not_available Help me talk her into it.
not_available To Carol and Doug.
not_available Get it right this time.
not_available Congratulations! Yeah, hear, hear! 
not_available You always have to outdo me.
not_available I had the opportunity and I took it.
not_available Congratulations, I'm happy for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's move this party outside.
not_available You gonna stay till I get off work? 
not_available Hell, no.
not_available Meet me at the airport or I'll take you myself.
not_available I didn't pack my bathing suit.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I know a private beach.
not_available Merry Christmas, Kerry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You too.
not_available So you got plans tonight? 
not_available Yeah, I plan to be alone.
not_available You want some company? Don't you have a family obligation? I've had enough family for one day.
not_available John? Listen, I got the blood gas on the asthmatic in 3.
not_available Only took me two sticks.
not_available Put it on ice and run it up to the lab.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Henry! 
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available John, I didn't get you anything.
not_available It's your evaluation.
not_available Congratulations! You just passed Emergency Medicine.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Do me a favor? Stick to brain research.
not_available I promise.
not_available I will.
not_available Thank you, John.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Henry.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
