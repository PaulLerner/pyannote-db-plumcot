not_available There were witnesses.

not_available Other doctor already saw it.
not_available Well, I'm the supervisor, so I have to check it out anyway.

not_available And this? What's this? 
not_available Commercial space.
not_available We're already taking bids.
not_available It'll probably go to some fast
not_available food joint.
not_available What? 
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available Kerry sends her apologies but she had an appropriations meeting.
not_available So, what do you think? 
not_available Very impressive.
not_available Well, listen.
not_available Public Affairs is working on a press release about the Carter Foundation
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh I thought that comprehensive HIV care would be very much a part of all this.
not_available We cannot get into subspecialties yet.
not_available We struggled getting family med to come.
not_available Primary care docs can staff the HIV clinic.
not_available There is no space for that.
not_available Maybe we should pitch a tent in the sculpture garden.
not_available Maybe we could stake out a few tables in the burger joint.
not_available The clinic was your idea.
not_available We are trying to make it happen.
not_available Primary care and comprehensive HIV treatment.
not_available Not Architectural Digest and super
not_available sized meals.

not_available How do you know about sats? 
not_available I heard her say it on the radio.
not_available Got two of morphine en route.
not_available Mom's on her way in.
not_available It's a weird trajectory for a GSW.
not_available Who shot you, Victor? 
not_available Nobody.
not_available It just went off.
not_available You shot yourself? 
not_available No.
not_available It was in my pocket.
not_available What's a kid like you doing with a gun? Protecting myself.
not_available Michael, I don't know if you're checking this cell phone.
not_available Are you in town? I'm a bit confused.
not_available Call me back at the hospital, okay? I'll be here for another hour or so.
not_available You ran away from your back
not_available pain guy.
not_available But he's waiting for you.
not_available He can wait.
not_available I heard Michael was here.
not_available Did you know he was coming? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available You didn't mention it.
not_available Didn't I? He didn't stop by? I guess he just didn't want to go over everything.
not_available Should I continue being oblivious or do you want to explain why you're bleeding from your cuticles? I'm not crazy, am I? 
not_available Crazy? How did I manage to build up feelings for someone I've spoken to once in the past year? Well, you exchanged letters.
not_available Letters? What are letters? You can think, feel, say whatever the hell you want in a letter to someone thousands of miles away.
not_available It's all speculative, imagined.
not_available It doesn't mean anything.
not_available It's just on a piece of paper.
not_available It's okay if you're mad at him.
not_available Mad? More like furious.
not_available I'm furious that he didn't tell me he was coming.
not_available I'm furious that he could just walk away like that.
not_available I'm ridiculously desperate to see him none of which is based on anything more substantial than the inner workings of my neurotic brain.
not_available You know, I was ready to bestow my sage wisdom but I think you got it covered.
not_available Am I so pathetic that I have to concoct a love life out of nothing? That's not fair.
not_available You and Michael were very close.
not_available It's not so crazy you're having these feelings.
not_available Graze wound to the right testicle.
not_available It's just superficial.
not_available Victor, you're a lucky man.
not_available GSW to the right thigh.
not_available No exit.
not_available Belly's soft.
not_available What happened here? I got hurt last summer.
not_available Victor, you got shot before? Some kid at school.
not_available I'm not that popular.
not_available Victor? 
not_available Hey, Mom.
not_available Thank God you're all right.
not_available What happened? Well, your 12year
not_available old son had a 9mm pistol in his pocket.
not_available He did? Do you know where he got it?

not_available Oh, Neela.
not_available I'm sorry, Dr.

not_available I was gonna ask if you've seen Gallant.
not_available No, sorry.
not_available Patient's waiting.
not_available Can you sign off on an order of Ancef for Victor Hopkins? The prepubescent gangbanger?

not_available Get Social Services down.
not_available And, Sam

not_available He's got a thing for me.
not_available You want me to alert Security? No, no.
not_available It's nothing like that.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Really.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Oh, a patient wants me on the phone.

not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Allergic to nuts and accidentally ate an almond in someone's birthday cake.
not_available That's awful.
not_available So, after she passed, I bought the suit and I wear it under my clothes on the really bad days.
not_available And, I don't know, it makes me feel better.
not_available You weren't wearing it yesterday.
not_available Oh, yesterday was a good day.
not_available You think I'm crazy.
not_available Well, I wouldn't say that.
not_available No, you think I'm crazy.
not_available No, I think I think I can examine you over your suit.
not_available I wasn't sure what the calls were until Alex told me about the letter.
not_available So he's here.
not_available I guess so.
not_available What do you want to do? I'm not gonna run away again, especially not now.

not_available Okay.
not_available Chuck and I have basically been hibernating for a year with Cosmo.
not_available And I'm trying to get us to reenter the social world.
not_available I was thinking maybe you and Wendall could come over sometime for dinner if you don't mind talking over a baby monitor.
not_available That's a really nice offer.
not_available Yeah, I'd love to.
not_available But things with Wendall didn't work out.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's weird.
not_available She's actually not really even speaking to me.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm good.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I just Just what? I don't know.
not_available I just feel like lately I've fallen off the tracks.
not_available It's taking me a little while to figure out how to get back on.
not_available Will you call the office and let me know how Victor's doing? 
not_available You got it.
not_available After he's discharged we'll set up a schedule to walk Victor to school.
not_available You weren't serious about that.
not_available I'm serious about everything I say.
not_available I'm kind of busy.
not_available We're all busy, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available You're gonna stamp out violence in Chicago one kid at a time? That's the plan.
not_available It's like any other epidemic.
not_available How do you contain TB? Knock on doors and give out meds.
not_available You stop the flu by giving vaccine shots on street corners.
not_available It's the same thing.
not_available But there's no meds and no vaccine.
not_available The kids with guns, you can't talk them out of it.
not_available We react to every shooting, even if no one gets hurt.
not_available We mobilize a neighborhood response every time someone fires a gun.
not_available Stigmatize violence and death rates will drop.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available It's working.
not_available Come by and see for yourself.
not_available The address is on the card.
not_available It looks like a frat house.
not_available Yeah, it's definitely lived
not_available in.
not_available Well, that's what you get for rooming with a rock 'n' roll resident.
not_available Where are you staying tonight? A buddy of mine took over my old lease.
not_available So I'm probably gonna sack out there.
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available Are you? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, definitely.
not_available Well, I'll just go and get changed then.
not_available Me too.
not_available I could use walking around in some civvies for a while.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, I'll be back in a minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available What are you craving? What's that? What kind of food do you want? Chinese, deepdish, burgers? Deep
not_available dish sounds good.
not_available Or Thai.
not_available There's this great place on Indiana.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available You know, whatever you think is good.
not_available I'm just picking up some of my stuff.
not_available You broke into our apartment? 
not_available Alex let me in.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Upstairs.
not_available Where's the babysitter? I sent her home.
not_available Okay, put it all back.
not_available What? It doesn't belong to you.
not_available You see this? I gave her this.
not_available Okay? What about the TV and the stereo? 
not_available You keep whatever you want.
not_available I'm gonna go check on Alex.
not_available Alex is fine.
not_available I'll go see.
not_available No.
not_available You don't wanna do that.
not_available Luka.
not_available It's nothing, kiddo.
not_available Just a little disagreement.
not_available What's all that for? We're going to Florida.
not_available My dad's got a place by the beach.
not_available We can watch whales migrate.
not_available Mom said it was okay.
not_available Alex, go back up.
not_available No.
not_available Alex, now! Easy, hoss.
not_available Not your kid.
not_available Listen, you can take whatever you want.
not_available I don't care.
not_available But he's not going anywhere with you.
not_available Think about it.
not_available You really want to get him into all that? Hey.
not_available We'll catch the whales in the fall, kiddo.
not_available I'm going the other direction.
not_available What? 
not_available Come on, now.
not_available Don't be upset.
not_available You said we
not_available You said we're gonna go to Florida.
not_available You can't miss that much school.
not_available Doc here's got a point.
not_available We'll do it next time.
not_available Come on, buddy.
not_available Don't make this harder on me.
not_available That's my buddy.
not_available If that's your deepdish
not_available pizza outfit, I'm glad I didn't say French food.
not_available Let me just turn off the light.
not_available It's pretty.
not_available Can't sleep? No.
not_available Does it hurt? No, not really.
not_available What happened? There was a
not_available A patient brought in.
not_available He was a part of a unit that got caught in a firefight.
not_available They had men down and needed help getting them out alive.
not_available Get him out of here quick! Let's go, let's go! I never thought I'd be in the middle of it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We'll cover you! Get going! But there I was.
not_available And all I cared about was getting us both the hell out of there.
not_available Three of our men died there that day.
not_available I don't know how many Iraqis.
not_available It's funny what you were saying earlier about wanting to be someone different.
not_available I keep wishing I could go back to who I was.
not_available All we can do is keep moving forward.
not_available Wish you didn't have to go back.
not_available It won't be too long before I'm home for good.
not_available They're in 3L? Yeah, burn unit.

not_available It's the ER.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I'll be a minute.

not_available But you and me and Luka, we're a team now.
not_available Right? We're in this together.
not_available And last night, he had to make a decision.
not_available And what he did, he did because it was best for you.
not_available And that was the right thing, whether or not you like it or
not_available I have to pee.
