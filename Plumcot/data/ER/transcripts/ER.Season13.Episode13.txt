not_available up.
not_available This i 't going to help.
not_available Pretty much wrecked his snowmobile.
not_available Ow! All right,left lower quadrant.
not_available Call Surgery.
not_available Not so fast.
not_available It's not a contusion.
not_available It's an abrasion.
not_available He's guarding.
not_available Do you have to keep doing that? I'm sorry.
not_available He's hemodynamically stable,and his crit's good.
not_available Let's get a CT of his belly,and if it's normal, then we won't have to waste a surgeon's time.
not_available Well,I'm going to have to disagree with your assessment.
not_available Ah,okay.
not_available Let's run it by Kovac.
not_available Let's not.
not_available I decide when we present to an attending.
not_available No lung sliding.
not_available What the hell is lung sliding anyway? Normally there's lung movement on ultrasound.
not_available If i s not there,then the lung must be partially deflated.
not_available Showoff.
not_available Okay,chest tube tray to Abby.
not_available What? You don't want to do it now? I wanted to do it 15 minutes ago.
not_available Well,it looks like Abby was right and Luka confirmed the diagnosis radiographically.
not_available Good work,team.
not_available What the hell do I have to do to get someone to come down here? Dr.
not_available Gates from the E.R.
not_available That's with an "E" for "emergency.
not_available " You called for a consult? Actually,I dialed the Hot Surgeons chat line.
not_available Which room? What's the matter? No,"Hey,how you doing? You look sexy in that white suit"? Hey,what's wrong? You mean besides the fact the last time I saw youthe woman that you liv with practically assaulted me and her daughter called me a whore? I told you I was sorry.
not_available I don't live with her anymore.Not for long,anyway.
not_available How's Sarah? We're working through it.
not_available No blood out.
not_available It's not the chest.Xeroform and the thoroseal.
not_available Could be cardiac contusion.
not_available Get a 12
not_available lead and hold off on the blooduntil the troponin's back.
not_available CT's ready.I'll take him up.
not_available I'll take him.
not_available You sure? Yeah,in case he crashes.
not_available Well,that wasn't awkward.
not_available Further proof workplace romance,bad idea.
not_available Is that so? Uh,yeah.

not_available Um,he doesn't need a co ult.
not_available Oh,well,I'm here nowand I'm almost finished.
not_available Okay,fine,then can you explain to him why Actually,I'm suggesting weadmit him for observation.
not_available Why? His kidneys look good.His liver and spleen appear to be normal.
not_available Did I miss something on the CT? Well,an occult injurycould take time to declare itself.
not_available He's right.
not_available No,he's not.
not_available The surgeon concurs with my assessment.
not_available Hey,don't worry,boss.I'm not one of those "I told you so" kids.
not_available Can I speak to you outside? Certainly.
not_available Okay.
not_available Not you.

not_available He gets cuter every time I see him.
not_available Ben.

not_available Trust me,Sammy,I know.
not_available All the women in our family are the same
not_available very fertile,allergic to chestnuts, prone to bladder infections And we all have that damn gene that predi oses us to bad boys.
not_available Chestnuts? Sammy,life is short.
not_available You deserve to be happy.
not_available You deserve a good man.
not_available If you like this guy,go for it.
not_available Okay,the least you can do is give mean honest and professional opinion.
not_available I did.
not_available No,you didn't.
not_available Well,how would you know?You're not a surgeon.
not_available Neither are you.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry,look 
not_available No,you look.
not_available I came down,I assessedWe established You shouldn't have come down 
not_available I made a professional call.
not_available Ifyou disagree with my opinion it's personal,just like your visit.
not_available fine,tha s your prerogative.
not_available What you can't do The reasonwhy you're siding with Gates is because you're screwing him.
not_available is accuse me of being I can't believe you just said that.
not_available So it's true? No.
not_available And even if it were,it'snone of your damn business.
not_available And it certainly hasnothing to do with this case.
not_available It does if it's clouding your judgment.
not_available Hey,maybe we should get anattending to weigh in on this.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey.

not_available Gates wanted a surgical consult, I said we didn't need one, but hedecided to call Neela down here anyway.
not_available Better safe than sorry,right? Wrong.It wasn't your call to make.
not_available Ray's above you.
not_available Now if you have a problem with yourresident or you disagree with his judgment, then you call an attending.
not_available I wanted to present to Kovac.
not_available And I didn't.He was busy with another trauma anyway.
not_available And now they've taken thehospital's last surgical bed.
not_available That kid needs 24
not_available hour observation.
not_available You cannot give up the last surgical bed.
not_available I need to follow serial exams.
not_available Then do it down here.
not_available You're already full up.
not_available Th send him home and have him come backin 12 hours for a re
not_available exam.
not_available Exactly.
not_available You know,I'm trying to help you guys here.

not_available His pulse ox is down to 88.
not_available Okay,he needs an airway.Pratt,you want a piece of this? sure.
not_available How come they didn't bring Clarke back? They probably moved him to another bedto free up the trauma room.
not_available And that can be a good sign,so Your stepfather hasn't come by,huh? No.
not_available Why didn't you ell him youweren't the one who was driving? What's the point? I don't know,maybe so that he knows you didn't do this.
not_available He'd still find a way to blame me.
not_available At least now he can't get mad at Clarke,too.
not_available You o are close? Yeah,I guess.

not_available It's the wrong place,thewrong time,but,uh Why didn't somebody page me? We handled it.
not_available What happened? Seems like your patienthas a perforated viscus.
not_available Really? Good thing we didn'tsend him home,huh,Rock Star? Looks like h needed observation after all.
not_available It's not small bowel perforation,okay,Tony? This has nothing to dowith the seat belt sign.

not_available Maybe Ishould have called his mother.
not_available Hey,y e gut line.
not_available ithe one them would even be(inhere if Denni wasn't scre ng aro T/ Denn w n't en iving.
not_available Clark was.
not_available That's nkt true.
not_available Ye it is.
not_available But did you even ther to ask him?No,you just blamed him from the get
not_available go.
not_available Why didn't he say something? Would you have believed h ? He was trying toprotect his little brother.
not_available Dennis is older.
not_available Heshould have known better.
not_available He's 15.
not_available Do you know that he carried Clarkealmost mile to the road to get help? So instead of busting his balls, maybe you should be thanking him.He probably saved your son's life.
not_available Hey,you know,I don'tthink I like your attitude.
not_available Really? I n't thin I likethe way you treat your kid.
not_available ere do you get offtalking to me like this? Where's your supervisor? You don't know a damnthing about me or my family.
not_available No,no,no,that's wrong.
not_available 'Cause I know that Dennis is a good kid, and I know that you are an asshole.
not_available Yeah,and if I were you,I'd probablystart to treat him a little better.
not_available Because in a couple years he'sprobably going to be bigger than you, and he is going to rememberevery single time you treated him like crap, and one day he is goingto kick your ass,okay? You got a valid medical license,Dr.
