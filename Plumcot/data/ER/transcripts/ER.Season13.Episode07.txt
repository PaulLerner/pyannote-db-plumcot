not_available What, you get lost? Seems to be a little problem with your heart.
not_available That from the flu? Normal heart's about the size of a fist.
not_available Yours is twice that big.
not_available I don't think you have flu.
not_available Your congestion, shortness of breath, definitely because of your heart.

not_available A what? 
SAM Fluid around your heart.
not_available Restricts blood flow, makes it hard for you to breathe.
not_available IV, two of Ativan, set up for pericardiocentesis.
not_available Hang on.

not_available It's no big deal.
not_available What? 
not_available No.
not_available No way.
not_available You need this procedure.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available You could die.
not_available No.
not_available No, not a chance.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Where'd you get the doctor degree, through the mail? Hey, get out while you can before Kevorkian starts sticking you.

not_available Wong.

not_available OTD in 45 minutes.
not_available It's a first shift in a month he hasn't killed anybody.
not_available My case is more complicated.
not_available He have an abnormal neural exam? I just have a clinical hunch, okay? Takes years to develop.
SAM CT results from Radiology.
RAY That for your vertigo guy? It's normal, isn't it? And we can all sleep a bit better tonight, can't we? Sam, could you get something from the drug
not_available sample closet? There's limited samples.
not_available Ask an Attending to Dr.
not_available Weaver asked me to get it for one of her patients.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available No, yeah, it's Batista.
not_available BATlST
not_available A.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available That TV news girl, Courtney Brown, called again.
not_available Whoa, Channel 5 Courtney Brown? What did she want? She offered me a job as a reporter.
not_available What, you? Of course you.
not_available What did you say? I turned it down.
not_available Turned down a chance to be the next Sanjay Gupta? Are you insane, woman? I have no interest in fluff pieces about sunburns and bee stings.
not_available What's wrong? Half the patients that come are fluff.
not_available I'm the king of fluff.
not_available You're the best fluffer in town.
not_available Hey, Hope, you ready for the fecal impaction? 
HOPE Sure am.
not_available Ha.
not_available This is an extremely uncommon error.
not_available Our personnel were clearly distracted by the ongoing debate.
not_available Reason why ER docs should remain in the ER.
not_available I know ER sounds a lot like O.R., but it's not.
not_available Our guys were there trying to keep you from making mistakes.
not_available Based on the information, our decision to operate was correct.
not_available You know what, you didn't have sufficient information because you didn't allow us to complete an evaluation.
not_available This isn't a witch
not_available hunt.
not_available We're here to learn from our mistakes and improve.
not_available You mean, their mistakes.
not_available Okay, let's not forget that we're on the same team here.
DUBENKO Oh, Dr.
not_available Gates, come on in.
not_available You missed the case presentation.
not_available Sorry, I had a patient.
not_available You know, sorry.
not_available I just gotta No, that's okay.
not_available Timely enough, Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available No need to sit.
not_available Come on down.
not_available Why don't you tell us what the differential diagnosis was when this patient presented? Um Triple A was on the top of our list but there were other possibilities.
not_available Should have stayed a Resident.
not_available No responsibilities, just heal them and deal them.
not_available That was the life.
not_available Morris? Can I tell you something as a friend? 
not_available Hmm.
not_available Sometimes you are such a little bitch.
not_available You make three times as much as I do.
not_available And for what? To give orders instead of take them? Boo
not_available hoo for you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Batista.
not_available We got a double coming.
not_available Might wanna jump on.
not_available I'll be right there, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Mr.
not_available Batista, wait.
not_available I called the Family Care Center.
not_available They can't take you for a month.
not_available I'm very sorry about all that.
not_available The system's Well, it needs work.
not_available Lovastatin.
not_available Thirty pills, 20 milligrams each.
not_available Shh.
not_available This should hold you till your next appointment.
not_available Thanks a lot.
HARMS I got a present for you.
not_available This is us, Hope.
not_available Unidentified male, early 20s, altercation on a bus blunt trauma to the chest and face.
not_available Ray, Malik, you take this.
not_available Trauma 2 is open.
not_available Sam, Hope, you're with me.
not_available He's tachy in the 120s, resps in the 30s, BP, 104/56.
not_available CBC, IV, type and cross.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Fred Douglas, 38, blunt trauma to the face with epistaxis.
not_available Son of a bitch broke my nose.
not_available Keep pressure.
not_available He was yelling at some lady.
not_available I tell him to shut up, next thing you know, he's throwing punches.
not_available How you doing in there, Ray? 
RAY I'm doing good.
MALIK Could probably use a hand when you're done.
not_available Guy I got in a fight with, I didn't hurt him bad, did I? 
SAM HemoCue's 12.8.
not_available First, we look for an obvious source of bleeding that can be cauterized.
not_available Is it broken, doc? It sure fee 
not_available Ugh.
not_available God bless you.
not_available Snuck up on me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You need a definitive triple A diagnosis 
not_available before committing an unstable patient to major surgery.
not_available Mortality ruptured triple A, 
not_available We don't have time for tests.
not_available Ultrasound can be done at the bedside.
not_available Theoretically.
not_available Not in this ER.
not_available Every textbook and print says this patient Ultrasound in ER is new, not in every textbook.
not_available Studies show it's very accurate.
not_available Ignore experience because a new toy? People die with delays.
not_available Valentine paper, 1993 found that most patients without triple A's still need surgery for one thing Most, not all.
not_available With severe heart failure, surgery can be fatal.
not_available Guy's lucky all you did was torch him.
not_available You could've killed him.
not_available Okay.
not_available What is your experience in the ER with bedside ultrasound? It's been going on for a few years.
not_available He's cute, but I hear he lives with somebody.
not_available Really? I think he has a kid.
not_available With final radiology interpretation, no significant clinical disagreements.
not_available What about for a triple A, specifically? Uh Heh.
not_available I don't know, exactly.
not_available Though finding a gallstone is one thing, ruptured aneurysm, quite another.
not_available Well, if we'd seen a normal aorta with an enlarged liver we would've saved the guy the risk of surgery.
not_available You couldn't do it in a reasonable time.
not_available We weren't given a reasonable time.
not_available He was unstable, surgery was necessary.
not_available Lighting the guy on fire was necessary? 
not_available A Bovie wasn't grounded.
not_available Whose fault? 
not_available Yours.
not_available Shouldn't even been in O.R.
not_available You were there being a pain in the ass.
not_available We have protocols.
not_available You interfered.
not_available Our duty doesn't end.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available That's enough.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available I think we can all see what the real problem is here.
not_available Providing the best care requires communicating openly.
not_available And when we fail to do that, lives are lost.
not_available I think that's something we can all learn from today's M and M.
ABBY Crenshaw is such a little prick.
not_available You know what? I bet I could take him too.
not_available I definitely think I could take him, and you could kick his ass.
ANGELA Luka.
not_available You're scaring me.
not_available I was looking for you.
not_available Sorry I didn't get back earlier.
not_available Angela, you remember Abby? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Nice to see you back at work.
not_available Nice to be back.
not_available So I probably should have warned you Curtis Ames was coming in.
not_available Okay, what's all this about settlement? There is no settlement.
not_available We agreed to the meeting as a show of good faith in case we went back to trial.
not_available But don't worry, the appeal's never gonna happen.
not_available Ames can't even find a lawyer to take the case.
not_available We're not settling.
not_available It's over.
not_available Good.
not_available All right, what do we got? Okay, hypotensive secondary to what looks like a traumatic pericardial effusion.
not_available Wow, guy's got a lot of fluid around his heart.
not_available Looks like I'm gonna do a pericardiocentesis.
not_available BP's still dropping, 88/52.
not_available So weird, I had one this morning.
not_available Okay, Malik, set me up.
not_available How's your guy? 
MORRIS Just a bloody nose.
not_available You say there's something wrong with my heart? 
MALIK He's awake.
not_available Sir, I'm Dr.
not_available Morris, Attending physician.
not_available Wait a minute, it's you, from this morning.
RAY You know him? 
not_available Yeah No, no.
not_available You were here earlier? 
WILLIS No, I wasn't.
not_available Hey, Sam? 
not_available Yeah? 
MORRIS He's our AMA patient from this morning, right? Yeah, the flu jerk.
not_available I don't know what you people are talking about.
not_available I don't have the flu.
not_available And I've never been here before.
not_available Joe.
not_available Hey, what's it gonna be? Good
not_available Iooking Brazilian or big mean Russian? Ooh.
not_available Joe 
KOVAC Okay.
not_available Go home.
ABBY Say bye.
KOVAC Bye.
RAY We use an ultrasound to see while we insert the needle into the pericardial sac to drain the blood.
not_available You use sound to see? That's fascinating.
not_available Just like bats and dolphins.
not_available It'll release the pressure on your heart, make it easier to breathe.
not_available And I won't feel a thing? Not a thing.
not_available Can I watch? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Okay, cool.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available This morning, batsand
not_available dolphins here was ready to rip my head off.
not_available What are you trying to pull, buddy? 
not_available Why is he so angry? Prep his chest, have two of Versed ready.
not_available Mr.
not_available Payton, we'll be right back.
not_available Morris, can we talk? Morris.
not_available I don't know what his game is His game is he's kooky from a blow to his head.
not_available He could be amnestic.
not_available He's gotta be on something.
not_available He's different.
not_available Give the guy a break.
not_available He got his ass kicked.
not_available He didn't want that procedure this morning.
not_available Maybe he's really pissed off at you, Archie.
not_available Wouldn't be the first time.
not_available Now, I know this may sound a little corny but I always catch more flies with honey, you know what I mean? That's good.
not_available That's good, Ray.
not_available I like that approach.
not_available You'll make a great Attending someday, my man.
not_available I'm sorry, I know my wallet's in here somewhere.
not_available Damn it.
AMES I got that.
not_available And can I get a Polish please? 
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I insist, really.
not_available It's not necessary, really.
not_available Well, you got your hands full.
not_available It's the least I could do.
not_available It's just a hot dog.
not_available My mama taught me random acts of kindness make the world a better place.
not_available Well, I can't argue with that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What is he, about 6 months? 
not_available Five and a half.
not_available He's really cute.
not_available He's got pipes you wouldn't believe.
not_available Are you driving your mom crazy? No, no.
not_available Hoo.
not_available Hoo.
not_available Frog.
not_available Ribbit.
not_available This one yours? Here you go.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Something is weighing on my heart and I just can't take it anymore.
not_available What's the problem? I gave Oscar Batista Lovastatin samples.
not_available That sweet, hardworking man, I was afraid he would stop taking pills and come back here with a heart attack or stroke 
not_available Hope.
not_available That little boy.
not_available Reminded me how moved I was by your piece.
not_available Thought some act of kindness might 
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available And please forgive me, doctor 
not_available Okay, okay, stop.
not_available You did a good thing.
not_available Really.
not_available There might be hope for you, Hope.
not_available You told me those drug samples were for Dr.
not_available Weaver's patient.
not_available Well, they were, technically.
not_available Well, technically, you lied to me.
not_available There are rules for breaking the rules, and rule number one is that you never, ever lie to the nurses, you got me? I'm so sorry.
AMES Fell off a ladder at work.
not_available Dude wasn't paying attention, so I had to pay the price.
not_available Oh, sounds like a dangerous job.
not_available No, carpenter.
not_available It's tough doing it with one arm, though.
not_available Well, sprains heal pretty quickly.
not_available Yeah, that's what they told me at the hospital.
not_available Uh I'm headed for the red line.
not_available Oh, I'm headed this way.
not_available Well 
not_available Nice to meet you.

not_available Catch you later, Joe.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Hey, any messages for me yet, Frank? No, Morris, the TV
not_available producer lady has not called back yet.
not_available You ask me one more time, I'm gonna slap you so hard you turn brunette.
not_available Have you got that? 
not_available Position's been filled.
not_available What position? Stop calling the station.
not_available I'm getting complaints.
not_available Oh, that position, right.
not_available They filled it, huh? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Who did they find so fast? 
not_available Me.
not_available You? I thought you turned it down.
not_available Yeah, well, I changed my mind.
not_available Figured it was about time someone put something worthwhile on television.
not_available So, Smitty, how long you had the rash? About two weeks now.
not_available Got any food allergies? 
not_available No.
not_available You on any medications? Just my blood
not_available pressure pills.
not_available All right, come on.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available What kind of pills? 
not_available Right.
not_available Oh, you see, that's the problem.
not_available Rash is a common reaction to enalapril.
not_available Who prescribed these? Doc up at the clinic put me on them about 10 years ago.
not_available This and something else.
not_available Ten years ago? Who gave you these? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available See, my man, T
not_available bone.
not_available You know T.
not_available Smitty, you can't take other people's medications, man.

not_available exchange program.
not_available You come up there sometime, man gives a powerful Okay, hold on, hold on.
not_available He does a drug
not_available exchange program? Hell, yeah.
not_available I ain't got insurance.
not_available You know how much this stuff costs? 
not_available You can't possibly think ultrasound was contraindicated.
not_available I do if it can't be done immediately.
not_available Could've told me before M and M.
not_available Didn't realize I had to point out the obvious.
not_available I can't win with you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Finally, we agree on something.
not_available Finally.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Don't take piss out of me.
not_available Piss? Piss? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yup, you've got a nice fluid pocket.
not_available This is gonna be a snap.
not_available Sam, draw up some 1 percent lido.
not_available Whoa.
MARQUEZ You're gonna feel a pinch.
not_available Okay, before I start, just a few things.
not_available BO 
Y I don't want a shot.
not_available Main risks here, bleeding and infection.
not_available You could infect my heart? 
not_available Sterile technique makes it unlikely.
MOM Mickey, calm down.
not_available BO 
Y No.
not_available Aah.
not_available Look, what about bleeding? I have trepidation about bleeding.
not_available Well, it's only a minor risk, because we're using such a small needle.
not_available Well, not so small, but thin.
not_available And you'll be all numbed up so you won't feel a thing.
MARQUEZ Relax.
not_available BO 
Y No, no.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Okey
not_available dokey, let's do this.
not_available Get that thing away from me, you clown.
not_available I told you, I don't want that.
not_available You agreed to the procedure.
not_available Screw that.
not_available Mr.
not_available Payton.
not_available And stop calling me that.
not_available My name's Clyde Sandberg.
not_available You people got shortterm memory loss or something? Huh? 
not_available You ambushed me.
not_available You were spewing absurdities.
not_available Do you not like me? 
not_available You're a wanker.
not_available A wanker.
not_available Ouch.
not_available Yeah, you're cocky, arrogant.
not_available And you're not smooth as you think.
not_available I'm not? 
not_available No, you're not.
not_available I never said I was.
not_available Mm.
not_available Mm.
not_available I called the other night and a woman answered.
not_available Yeah, I can explain that.
not_available Now would be a good time.
not_available Here, here, batsand
not_available dolphins guy, I figured it out.
not_available It's DID.
not_available What? Dissociative Identity Disorder.
not_available Multiple personalities? Psych make that diagnosis? No, I paged them.
not_available They haven't come.
not_available So this is based off of what? Your extensive psychiatric expertise? No, he's a classic presentation.
not_available Old abuse injuries, keeps changing his name.
not_available Maybe it's you that needs a psych evaluation.
not_available No, I'm serious, Ray.
not_available We have to double
not_available doctor this guy.
not_available Listen, he keeps refusing treatment, that effusion will kill him.
not_available Who knows how long Psych will take? By the time their Resident sees him they present to the Attending, could be hours.
not_available Double
not_available doctoring, that's a big deal.
not_available Can't we treat with NSAIDs and steroids? He's refusing vital treatment.
not_available And that is grounds for a double
not_available doctor.
not_available Come on, get with me here.
not_available What, so I'm back on the case now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Huh.
not_available Look, I'll tell you what.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available I'll try and get some sort of read, but maybe you should hang back.
not_available You already pissed him off enough today.
not_available So I have a few questions for you.
not_available Can you tell me what day it is? 
not_available Thursday.
not_available Month and year? You know, they got this new thing out called a calendar.
not_available My freaking God.
not_available November, 2006.
not_available Do you know where you are? What is this, Romper Room? I see stupid and retard and jerk
not_available off.
not_available I'm at County General Hospital.
RAY I'm not double
not_available doctoring.
not_available He's gonna get worse.
not_available He's hypotensive with reduced cardiac output.
not_available He hates doctors, especially you.
not_available You wanna tie him, stick a needle in his chest? 
not_available Lf it'll save his life, hell, yeah.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available I am out, Archie.
not_available Fine, I'll get somebody else.
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Hasta la bye
not_available bye.
not_available Pratt, I need you to sign off on a double
not_available doctor.
not_available Got a foster kid? 
not_available No, he's a competent adult.
not_available Got pericardial effusion and doesn't want treatment.
not_available Morris wants to get medieval because he thinks 
not_available I think he's DID.
not_available Multiple personalities.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available What did Psych say? They're MIA.
not_available You know that multiple personality Dissociative Identity Disorder.
not_available Yeah, some docs don't think it exists.
not_available There's ton of literature to support it.
not_available Okay, his vitals? 
not_available Systolic's holding in the 90s.
not_available And mental status? 
not_available Alert and oriented.
not_available Tox screen and CT? Clear.
not_available Gotta treat him conservatively.
not_available Wait for Psych, it's their call.
not_available You want me to be thorough.
not_available That's what I'm doing.
not_available Pratt, listen to me for one second.
not_available Pratt.
NEELA If patient presents within a week of surgery, it's considered bounce
not_available back.
not_available Make sure bounce
not_available backs Hey, can I speak to you for a sec? Wound seroma.
not_available Removing the staples and packing the dermis.
not_available I wasn't actually talking to you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Um Okay, go ahead.
not_available I'll just get started.
not_available So how's Surgery treating you? Like a stepchild.
not_available Radiology's looking better every day.
not_available It'll be over soon enough.
not_available I hated my surgical rotation, anyway.
not_available So do you like hockey? Tonsil or ice? 
not_available Ice.
not_available Oh.
not_available Mm.
not_available Too bad.
not_available But, yeah, I'll settle for a Hawks game.
not_available He's still refusing treatment? Last BP was 84/50 and he's developed pulsus paradoxus.
not_available I found his old file.
not_available Willis Payton is his real name, probably be the host personality.
not_available This Clyde character must be one of his alters.
not_available He was here a bunch of times between '88 and '96.
not_available Foster kid, abuse
not_available related injuries, some bad ones too.
not_available It's classic DID history.
not_available Psych's still a no
not_available show? 
not_available I know everybody down here thinks I'm a joke.
not_available You know, if Pratt said DID, he'd be a genius.
not_available But I know that I'm right about this.
not_available And all I can do is suck on it and watch this guy die.
not_available You did what you could.
not_available And you're not a joke, Archie.
not_available You're an Attending.
not_available Thank you.
MAN Was a time when that mountain seemed so high like it stretched up to the pearly gates themselves.
not_available Promised land seemed like an idea, like no matter how hard we worked it was only sand between our fingers.
not_available But we're still here.
not_available Proud and strong, Lord have mercy, we're still here.
not_available But we got a whole lot of work to do.
not_available Because the more things change, the more they stay the same.
not_available Young brother in the back.

not_available Stand up and introduce yourself.
not_available No, no, you.

not_available Welcome, brother Pratt.
not_available Come up front.
not_available Nice to see young folk in the evening service, ain't it? 
not_available Your heart's getting worse, you know.
not_available Here we go again.
not_available No.
not_available You need me to spell it? If you keep refusing treatment, it's gonna go down one of two ways.
not_available One, doctors are gonna come in here, tie you down and do the procedure.
not_available They can't touch me, I got rights.
not_available Or two, we get to watch you die.
not_available Fun for you.
not_available There's a third option.
not_available You give consent, we fix your heart and you go home.
not_available All we wanna do is help.
not_available Yeah, you've been loads of help so far.
not_available I know you're scared.
not_available No, I ain't scared of nothing.
not_available I know you've been hurt a lot.
not_available But you are safe here.
not_available I know you don't wanna trust us, but you can.
not_available I promise.
not_available I was Was Was I sleeping? No.
not_available I lost time.
not_available I lost time again.
not_available Willis? Yeah? Clyde's been giving us a hard time.
not_available Oh.
not_available I thought he was gone.
not_available You know about Clyde? Yeah.
not_available My friends told me about him.
not_available He's very negative.
not_available Well, Clyde doesn't want us to help you.
not_available So all we could do was give you some medicine but that's not working too well.
not_available Um Wha? Can you? Can you still fix me? Willis, I need Clyde's permission.
not_available I can't make him do anything.
not_available I can't.
not_available We can't start and stop again.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available No.
not_available Willis.
not_available Damn it, let me talk to Clyde right now.
not_available Do not make me hurt you.
not_available Let me talk to Clyde.
not_available How many times I gotta tell you to get off me, bitch? Huh? How many times? Huh? I saw Willis.
not_available He's letting us do the procedure.
not_available He's a pansy.
not_available Yeah, well, he's brave enough to let us stick a needle in his heart.
not_available Piss off, bitch.
not_available Fine.
not_available You be a tough guy all the way to your funeral.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Hey.
not_available You stick my heart, that means I get out of here, right? Yup.
not_available Do it.
not_available I told you, I ain't scared of nothing.
not_available The drug
not_available exchange program is only for people who have prescriptions but can't afford the drugs.
not_available Smitty's prescription was 10 years old, and he had enalapril.
not_available Enalapril is not the first drug of choice for black folks with high blood pressure.
not_available Look, I suggest that you start an exercise program.
not_available Get your congregation to stop eating salt and fried foods and start exercising.
not_available Trust me, you'll do a whole lot more good.
not_available We don't just help people with high blood pressure.
not_available We have diabetics, asthmatics, you name it.
not_available Look, what you're doing is dangerous, okay? Not to mention illegal.
not_available I have an obligation to this community, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available These people are shackled by a system over which they have no control.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The one thing I will not do is nothing.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Morris? Can I ask your advice on something? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I lied to Samantha about something, and now she's really steamed.
not_available Oh, bad move.
not_available Piss one nurse off, piss them all off, like the Mafia.
not_available You know, whenever I'm in a precarious situation I always ask myself, "What would Jesus do?" Right.
not_available What would Jesus do if the nurses hated him? Well, he would do the right thing, of course.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available See, I thought I was doing the right thing.
not_available I guess I just did it the wrong way.
not_available Hey, the story of my life.
not_available You know, sometimes it doesn't matter how much we kick and scream.
not_available Even when we're right.
not_available The prophet is without honor in his own land.
not_available Matthew 13:54.
not_available Oh, I love that one.
not_available Big Matthew fan.
not_available You have a good night, Dr.
not_available Morris.

not_available So you're doing great.
not_available You got my glasses? Let me check.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available That kid gonna be okay? Who? 
MORRIS Yeah.
not_available I'm sure he is.

not_available He was racing a Hot Wheels.
not_available His mom, she was mean.
not_available Um Willis? 
not_available My name's Andre.
not_available I like Hot Wheels.
not_available I wish his mom wasn't so mean.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Don't tell my dad I'm here, okay? He can be pretty mean too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Your secret's safe with me.

not_available You'll have to give one to me.
not_available I don't think I have mine anymore.
not_available Okay, I'll give it to you.
not_available What else did you have?
