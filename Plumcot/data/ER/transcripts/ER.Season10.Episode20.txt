not_available Where'd she go? 
not_available Kisangani.

not_available Mom, guess what.
not_available Dad's here.
not_available Oh, I failed my boards.
not_available What? You're gonna be with Yuri and me.
not_available Looking at the effects of ketamine on cerebral ischemia and tissue damage in mice.
not_available What's happening to her? 
not_available She's gonna be okay.
not_available Give the medicine a chance to work.
not_available That wasn't a real seizure.
not_available The EEG doesn't lie.

not_available Kerry.
not_available Get me another day.
not_available Until the court determines a permanent arrangement you get two weekends a month 
not_available It's not enough.
not_available at the discretion of the Lopezes.
not_available I get to see my son at their discretion.
not_available Does that make sense? The worst thing would be to violate the judge's order just as we're about to go into a custody hearing.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Lopez will pick him up here at noon.
not_available This isn't right.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available But you'll get him back in two weeks.
not_available Until then, you have to find a way to live with it.
not_available Okay? Welcome to Chicago.
not_available Please do not leave any personal belongings unattended at any time.
not_available Thank you and enjoy your stay.
not_available Daddy! Daddy! John? What if Watson had listened? Where would we be? No double helix, no genome theory.
not_available The other way around, I believe.
not_available Watson was a skeptic.
not_available She's right.
not_available Just get another ELISA cooking.
not_available I've got one here.
not_available Is this the right antibody? What are you doing? 
not_available Starting over a new setup.
not_available Just what we need, another med student with OCD.
not_available We've checked all the reagents and run this how many times.
not_available Seventeen.
not_available Seventeen times.
not_available Eighteen's my lucky number.
not_available Why are you using a human antiXIAP antibody with a murine substrate? Your protocol says to use antiMXIAP, but this Eppendorf says anti
not_available H.
not_available You sure this is the right reagent? Do you have a boyfriend? What's that? 
not_available Mnemonics.
not_available I'm studying for the boards.
not_available You haven't taken them yet? 
not_available I liked them, so I figured I'd do it again.
not_available Always go with TB.
not_available If TB's an answer option, it's usually right.
not_available Looks like they're ready for you in there.
not_available Morning, dear.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Okay, Stanley's here.
not_available George is here.
not_available Hey, hey, who is he?

not_available George was referred by the ER.
not_available He has a problem with
not_available Exhibitionism.
not_available Let's see it.
not_available I was over

not_available I'm traveling with a baby.
not_available Do you have a row with an empty middle seat? Do I need to book that right now? Okay.
not_available Just hold on.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.
not_available I kept getting the machine.
not_available I forgot to check the messages.
not_available I have Ella's baby things.
not_available Come in.
not_available I took out all the girlie clothes.
not_available There are some bibs, hats, pants, bootees.
not_available My parents went mad for bootees after Ella was born.
not_available Oh, this is one of my personal favorites.
not_available Are you going somewhere? I have a friend in Seattle.
not_available It's a cardiologist that I met in med school and she's just dying to meet Henry.
not_available Wow.
not_available You need a passport to fly to Seattle now? Yeah, I lost my license.
not_available Thank you for dropping these off.
not_available Are you all right? I'm fine.
not_available Well, how long will you be gone? When will you be back? I'm not sure.
not_available Kerry, don't do anything that you might regret later.
not_available Thanks for the clothes.
not_available What were you doing walking down Michigan Avenue with a sword? There were no buses.
not_available Okay, I was more interested in the sword part.
not_available The enemy is coming, but I will overwhelm him.
not_available When he'sWhat happened with the blood? 
not_available Ask him.
not_available Attack like the sea.
not_available What happened with the blood? 
not_available I was practicing for the battle royale.
not_available On yourself? 
not_available No, my guinea pig.
not_available His name was Cookie.
not_available Thank you for clearing that up.
not_available I'd recommend taking him upstairs.
not_available Gee, you think? 
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Twentynineyearold woman with tonic
not_available clonic activity.
not_available This isn't the first time.
not_available Pulse ox, 98.
not_available Gave her two of Ativan en route.
not_available Did she hit her head? 
not_available No, nothing like that.
not_available Another two of Ativan
not_available Wait.
not_available Hold it.
not_available Hold it.
not_available She doesn't need Ativan.
not_available Abby, she's in status.
not_available Did we see you last time? I tried to talk to your wife, Mr? 
not_available Dunn.
not_available Dunn.
not_available Haleh, take them to Trauma 1.
not_available We'll be right there.
not_available She's having factitious seizures.
not_available Come again? She came in the same way last week and the EEG was negative.
not_available She's faking? 
not_available No.
not_available It's a conversion disorder.
not_available Was she hospitalized? 
not_available No, they took off.
not_available Can I try the husband? 
not_available We'll up the oxygen, run some saline.
not_available BP's 120 palp.
not_available It's okay, Caroline.

not_available All right.
not_available Let's up the O2 to five liters and run in 500 cc's of saline.
not_available Saline? 
not_available Let's see if it helps.
not_available Is this the first seizure since last week? 
not_available No.
not_available She's been having three or four a day.
not_available They usually stop, but not this time.
not_available Pupils equal and reactive.
not_available Mr.
not_available Dunn, can we speak outside? Jordan.
not_available Jordan, squeeze my hand.
not_available It's stopping.
not_available Is she okay now? 
not_available For now, yeah.
not_available She needs a neurologist.
not_available Your wife's condition is not neurological.
not_available She's having pseudo
not_available seizures.
not_available We've been through this.
not_available Did that look fake? I'm not saying that.
not_available But last time Jordan was here, she had a normal CT and EEG.
not_available Are you a psychiatrist or an ER doc? 
not_available I'm a med student, actually.
not_available Could I talk to a real live doctor? 
not_available Of course you can.
not_available But any doctor's gonna tell you the same thing I'm telling you.
not_available If you want your wife to get better she's gonna need to be hospitalized in the Psych Ward.
not_available Abby, do you have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hi.
not_available Dr.
not_available Nelson, please.
not_available Have you spoken with Kerry lately? She was in this morning pretty quickly.
not_available I'm concerned, and frankly, I don't know who else to talk to about it.
not_available Is something wrong? Hi, could you ask him to come down to the ER? Lockhart.
not_available I'm admitting a patient.
not_available Thanks.
not_available She seems extremely distressed.
not_available Well, she's in mourning.
not_available I know but I'm worried she's thinking of running off with him.
not_available Henry? 
not_available Maybe you should call her.
not_available Me? I tried talking to her, couldn't get through.
not_available Well, I'm sympathetic, but maybe we should ask someone 
not_available who's, you know, a closer friend.
not_available Right.
not_available Like who? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available How's Alex? He wants to know if you got that plasma screen.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Sorry I haven't called but I've just been, you know, trying to figure stuff out with Steve.
not_available Sure.
not_available I don't think he's gonna be staying too much longer.
not_available We're not together, you know, me and Steve.
not_available He sleeps on the couch.
not_available There's a woman in 1 admitted for seizing.
not_available Could you let me know if her husband's looking for me? See you later? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Never better.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What did you do? Oh, not much, some painting, redid the paneling.
not_available I hung up those art
not_available deco light fixtures that you liked from Marshall Fields.
not_available Wait till you see the nursery.
not_available Did you operate the screwdriver yourself, Mr.
not_available FixIt? Oh, hey, I'm a nesting fatherto
not_available be.
not_available I'll go to any lengths.
not_available So this is our home.
not_available I wasn't sure if you were coming in or not.
not_available Neither was I.
not_available Henry's grandmother is coming to pick him up.
not_available I just Why don't you wait here, and I'll come and get you when she shows up.
not_available No, you have your Psych rotation.
not_available Yeah, but I'm waiting on my supervisor, so I'm gonna be down here for a while.
not_available I'm not sure I can do this.
not_available Kerry, I know this part sucks, but he's gonna end up with you.
not_available You're saying I'm not really sick? No, what we're saying is we believe the cause of your illness may be psychological.
not_available I've never had trouble.
not_available I've never been to a shrink.
not_available That's what I told her.
not_available If you continue to have seizures
not_available I don't wanna go to the Psych Ward.
not_available I'm not crazy.
not_available No one's saying that.
not_available But you'll be safe up there until we can figure this thing out.
not_available And then after that, you can go wherever you need to go to get healthy.
not_available Look, you can go home and risk injuring yourself or your baby or you can come upstairs.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be back to take you up.
not_available Perception of a psychiatrist, bedside manner of an ER doc empathetic eyes of an overworked nurse.
not_available I'm the whole package.
not_available All I have to do is actually pass my boards.
not_available Are you Abby? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be right up.
not_available Are you going to get my grandson for me? 
not_available Yes, I'll tell Dr.
not_available Weaver you're here.
not_available No, they asked me to look for you.
not_available I thought Kerry's trying to avoid us.
not_available No, she's expecting you.
not_available Well, then shall we follow you? Can you just wait right here? Why, is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available We're here on time.
not_available She'll be right out.
not_available Is she here? Where is Henry? 
not_available I asked you to wait outside.
not_available And I asked, where is she? 
not_available You're going to have to wait outside.
not_available If that baby's not in our custody Weaver will be in breach of a court
not_available ordered agreement.
not_available Jerry, where's Weaver? 
not_available I haven't seen her.
not_available Why are you telling me this? If you're doing anything to help her, I'll come back here with an officer.
not_available Shut up.
not_available That's my boy.
not_available That's my boy.
not_available Kerry.
not_available He likes to be held up to the sky.
not_available That's my baby.
not_available What is that? It's from the ER.
not_available I was hoping for a puppy.
not_available But I don't see any air holes.
not_available It's big.
not_available And heavy.
not_available No.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's another crib.
not_available Hey, are we having twins? 
not_available You saw the sonogram.
not_available All right.
not_available I gotta get going.
not_available Where? 
not_available I got a board meeting.
not_available I told you.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Here, let me.
not_available Oh, my God, John.
not_available We're having a boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think you mentioned that.
not_available What is this? What? You having a little prenatal jitters? Well, you don't think that maybe we? What? 
not_available We rushed into this.
not_available Of course we did.
not_available But we didn't overanalyze it.
not_available We didn't reexamine it.
not_available We didn't overthink it.
not_available We just did it because it felt right.
not_available This is a life that we're responsible for.
not_available You and me.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Are you ready? Hey, you wanna come with me, see the house one last time? 
not_available I don't think I need that.
not_available You can see me ruffle a few feathers.
not_available I don't think I need that either.
not_available You could meet my father.
not_available Your father? Jordan, Nick, this is Ken Sung.
not_available He's the social worker I told you about.
not_available Another expert.
not_available He's here to talk to you about how things were going at home.
not_available I understand you had a baby recently.
not_available Caroline.
not_available That can be a hard transition.
not_available How have you been getting along? I've answered that about 20 times.
not_available We're good.
not_available I'm self
not_available employed right now so I'm home to help with the diapers and everything.
not_available I think he would nurse her if he could.
not_available Any financial stress? We hired a nanny, but that's getting a little too expensive.
not_available Our neighbor Frances gives us a hand.
not_available Jordan, are you concerned about your ability to look after Caroline? What do you think? As long as I'm sick, I can't hold her.
not_available I can't take care of her.
not_available So you do wanna get better? 
not_available What kind of question is that? Sometimes patients get sick, and they feel safer or more protected in a hospital environment.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available She wants to get better.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's all I think about.
not_available You're just another person who thinks I'm faking, aren't you? That's what you all think.
not_available It's not true.
not_available Then how come you can't fix it? She can be treated as an outpatient, but that's where things get dicey.
not_available If she doesn't get better, I have to file a report.
not_available You're gonna make everything worse.
not_available There's a potential danger to the baby.
not_available What if she has a seizure while carrying it down stairs? 
not_available She's not a child abuser.
not_available My job is to protect the baby.
not_available Is that how you'd approach it if she had epilepsy? If she wasn't compliant with the treatment.
not_available Okay.
not_available What if I could get her condition under control before she leaves? She stops having seizures? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then there's no more danger.
not_available And nothing for me to worry about.
not_available Kem, this is my father.
not_available Hello.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available It's so nice to finally meet you.
not_available Well, yes.
not_available Me too.
not_available Well, we'd better get in there, John.
not_available Here.
not_available Hello, everyone.
not_available This is Makemba Likasu.
not_available She's going to be sitting in.
not_available Makemba.
not_available I apologize.
not_available I don't know all of your names.
not_available And introductions would take all day, so First item on the agenda.
not_available Northwestern has agreed to take over the management of the property for use as an institute of advanced health studies.
not_available You're selling Mother's house? Donating it.
not_available It will serve as a conference center for various public health issues and housing for visiting scholars and experts on foundation fellowships.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Which part? This foundation was expressly created by your grandfather to support arts and cultural institutions.
not_available And that's what we've been doing for almost 50 years.
not_available Well, time for a change, then.
not_available You're going to unilaterally overturn the legacy your grandparents left behind? I'm not overturning anything.
not_available I'm simply redirecting some resources into other worthy causes.
not_available What gives you the right? 
not_available My grandmother's will gives me the right.
not_available But if you don't believe in what I'm doing here maybe it's time you stepped aside.
not_available Next.
not_available Millicent dies, you run off halfway around the world.
not_available Disappear for months only to come back like some sort of avenging angel 
not_available with a pregnant African girl in tow.
not_available Her name is Kem.
not_available You back using drugs? Hey, I made lunch.
not_available Thank you, but I have to be going.
not_available Oh, Dad, stay a while.
not_available Come on.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I can't.
not_available She left the money to me.
not_available She left the house to me.
not_available She trusted me to make the right decisions.
not_available I doubt she'd agree that's what you're doing now.
not_available Pleasure meeting you.
not_available I look forward to getting the wedding announcement.
not_available Are you glad I came? It really smoothed out those rough edges, huh? 
not_available Soda machine stole my money.
not_available Sorry, George.
not_available What are you gonna do about it? Hello, I'm here to see the Dunns.
not_available I'm their neighbor, Frances Burkett.
not_available Hi.
not_available They're in Jordan's room.
not_available It's right through here on the left.
not_available Can you believe a dollar for a soda and then no soda? Do we have to keep having the same conversation, George? Kirkland is all set in 2.
not_available Young's getting his IV meds in the Treatment Room.
not_available Do you have a hammer? 
not_available Why don't you watch TV for a while.
not_available I don't wanna watch TV.
not_available In one hour of TV
not_available Mr.
not_available Dunn is in with Jordan? Yeah, and the neighbor brought the baby by for a visit.
not_available How's the studying going? 
not_available Microcytic anemias.
not_available Dr.
not_available Nelson.
not_available Please, we need some help in here! 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh, no, no, no.
not_available I got you.
not_available I got you.
not_available That's it.
not_available I'm signing her out.
not_available Calm down.
not_available I want you to call different doctors.
not_available I want a neurologist right now.
not_available No! 
not_available Your frustration could be exacerbating the seizure.
not_available Wait in the hall.
not_available It's okay, Jordan.
not_available Jordan, it's okay.
not_available When was her last one? 
not_available Two days ago, also while he was visiting.
not_available Looking for a stressor, maybe he's right over there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She was fine yesterday when he was here.
not_available So, what's the difference between now and then? The baby.
not_available We need to get her talking about her past, her childhood.
not_available Why won't it stop? I just want it to stop.
not_available I was doing some patties and started to space out.
not_available Got my feet tangled up and started to slip.
not_available Caught myself by putting my hands on the grill.
not_available At home? 
not_available No, I work at a burger joint.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt's on the way.
not_available Does he need an IV? Just 50 of Benadryl, 6 of I.
not_available M.
not_available morphine and Thermazine dressings.
not_available If you patch me up I can finish my shift.
not_available I don't think that's gonna happen.
not_available I need that job.
not_available All right, what do we got? Elgin Gibbs, 17, burned his hands on a grill.
not_available Elgin, what's popping? What's up, doc? 
not_available No bullae or charred areas.
not_available Nothing circumferential.
not_available That good? 
not_available You're golden.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Whoa.
not_available If your BP were your IQ, you'd be a genius.
not_available Too high? 
not_available Pulse is normal, it can't be from pain.
not_available And you're too young to have high blood pressure, E.
not_available So, what's the deal? I don't know.
not_available You using something? Meth, coke, ephedrine? No way.
not_available There's no cops.
not_available I'm just trying to get you fixed up.
not_available I don't do that stuff.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be right back.
not_available Add a tox screen.
not_available I bet you it comes back positive.
not_available I've gotta run to the lab.
not_available I shouldn't be more than 20 minutes.
not_available What? 
not_available I've got mouse brain defatting in ethanol that have to be removed in three hours for cresyl violet staining.
not_available We've got a sick kid here.
not_available Those mice are already dead.
not_available Experiments are time
not_available sensitive.
not_available Hey, are you an ER doc or not? Last time I checked, but you're not the first one to ask.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available Are you off? Are you on? 
not_available I've been meaning to call you.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available I'll try you tomorrow? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You should deal with your slides and go home.
not_available I'm working in the ER.
not_available Then get back down there fast.
not_available Yuri, say something.
not_available Three minutes, total silence.
not_available Maybe I need to up the dose.
not_available Talk to me, man.
not_available You're always so nonverbal.
not_available Colin, is he okay? He's more than okay.
not_available Where did you get that monitor? 
not_available Dog lab.
not_available Dude, she should leave.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's all good.
not_available It's not all good.
not_available What's going on? It's a supplemental study we're working on.
not_available Ketamine has a lot of potential applications.
not_available Like for getting high.
not_available I've heard of that.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available We're psychonauts, astronauts of the mind.
not_available We're explorers.
not_available Ketamine disrupts downstream GABAergic connections gives us access to places we don't normally have access to.
not_available It leads to hallucinations and dysphoria.
not_available We control the dose.
not_available One of us stays sober to record vitals observational data, subjective experiences.
not_available The unconscious is the final frontier.
not_available So it gets under the external inhibitors.
not_available Yep, that's right.
not_available No more ego overlay.
not_available The real you.
not_available The real me? Can I trust you? Of course you can.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available What if I don't get better, if I can never hold my baby again? Jordan, I know this is difficult, but you just have to try very hard.
not_available You have to
not_available I told you I am trying.
not_available You keep pushing.
not_available I don't know what you want from me.
not_available Well Okay, at some level, we're all the same.
not_available We all have things we hide, things we keep buried.
not_available Like what? What do you keep buried? 
not_available This is not about me.
not_available You want me to tell you things, to trust you, but you don't have to say anything? Is that fair? Don't you trust me? Okay.
not_available I can't follow through.
not_available On what? On anything.
not_available Once something gets in my way, it's like a chemical reaction.
not_available I just shut down and I give up.
not_available I'm just looking for an excuse to stop because in the end it's easier to do that than to risk being hurt or disappointed again.
not_available You mean with men? Men my career, my family.
not_available Pick your poison.
not_available So that's me.
not_available Well, your family must be proud that you're becoming a doctor.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, that's enough for today.
not_available Well, you don't have to go.
not_available Well, we can talk some more tomorrow.
not_available I
not_available I had a baby eight years ago.
not_available His name was Charlie.
not_available You have another child? I did before I met Nick.
not_available When Charlie was 2 months old, he stopped breathing.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available The paramedics came and worked on him, and the ER doctors but they couldn't do anything.
not_available He died the same night.
not_available What caused it? They said it was SIDS.
not_available Why didn't you mention this before? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Don't you see the relevance? No.
not_available That was just a terrible thing that happened a long time ago.
not_available I love you, Neela.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available You rock.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available You're curious, aren't you? I can tell.
not_available I prefer to leave the real me buried under my inhibitors for the time being.
not_available You're the coolest med student we've had up here all year.
not_available Tachycardia.
not_available Mild side effect.
not_available It'll resolve soon.
not_available Don't.
not_available He should've normalized by now.
not_available Do you feel all right? Heart's pumping a bit, but I'm okay.
not_available P
not_available waves.
not_available Do you see any Pwaves? P
not_available waves? Narrow complex.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Why? 
not_available Get on the floor.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available Don't skip all the foreplay now.
not_available He's fine.
not_available He's in SVT.
not_available What? 
not_available Supraventricular tachycardia.
not_available Do you have any chest pains, dizziness? 
not_available No.
not_available Any medical conditions? WPW, but it's no biggie.
not_available It's just a short circuit through my heart.
not_available You idiot! 
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available You're making a big deal out of nothing.
not_available His BP's 95/60.
not_available No response to carotid sinus massage.
not_available Okay, we're going to the ER.
not_available Bear down.
not_available You were gonna be 20 minutes.
not_available I was.
not_available That was an hour ago.
not_available I know.
not_available Take the bleeder.
not_available We're jammed up and I need to push charts.
not_available We need the monitored bed.
not_available What's with the IV and the monitor? It's not working.
not_available I can still feel it.
not_available Somebody tell me what's going on.
not_available In SVT.
not_available Won't break vagal maneuvers.
not_available Need a bed.
not_available We were gonna keep this quiet.
not_available Who is he? Who are you? 
not_available It started up in the lab.
not_available History of WPW.
not_available Up in the lab.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We have special projects on the side.
not_available You boys doing experiments on human subjects now? 
not_available It's really starting to hurt.
not_available 90/55.
not_available Adenosine? What's that do? 
not_available Blocks the AV node.
not_available Can lead to V
not_available fib if there's anterograde conduction.
not_available Six of adenosine going in.
not_available Jam in the flush.
not_available Still SVT.
not_available Go again.
not_available Double the dose.
not_available I got the paddles.
not_available You gonna shock him? 
not_available Hopefully not.
not_available Charge to 50.
not_available Twelve mgs.
not_available Mother of God! Did his heart stop? 
not_available Just a glitch in his conduction system.
not_available Normal sinus.
not_available Feel better? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think.
not_available Tox screen back on Elgin Gibbs, burned
not_available hand kid in 2.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Get him registered and start a chart.
not_available Exam 4 is open.
not_available He doesn't need a chart or anything.
not_available We'll just get out of your way.
not_available You could revert back to SVT any time.
not_available Neela
not_available You didn't say anything about registering.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Whatever you geeks were doing up there was strictly illegal.
not_available No, it's legitimate science.
not_available Word.
not_available Did you just say "word" to me? 
not_available Well, it wasn't exactly authorized.
not_available We're saving lives and you're playing Jekyll and Hyde.
not_available You wanna tell me what it was? Just
not_available We don't wanna get kicked out.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Just hang down here for 20 minutes then get back to wiring electrodes to your nuts for all I care.
not_available Thanks, man.
not_available Sorry about all this.
not_available Hey, what's up, E? What's up, doc? How you doing? 
not_available About the same.
not_available Well, we got some good news.
not_available Your tox screen came back negative.
not_available I told you it would.
not_available Yeah, you did.
not_available I'm gonna give you something for the pain.
not_available Just take one if you can't sleep.
not_available Otherwise, stick with the Tylenol and leave that dressing alone till you come back for a check.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, do you have a minute? 
not_available Maybe in a minute I might.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hello again.
not_available Elgin.
not_available Right.
not_available Why don't you recheck his BP.
not_available You think I could go back to work? Not for a few days.
not_available Somebody coming to pick you up? Probably my mom, but most likely she'll bring along the kids.
not_available Oh, you got brothers and sisters? 
not_available Four of them.
not_available I'm the oldest.
not_available My mother works graveyard so she can be with the little ones in the day and I work nights to do what I can.
not_available What about your pops? 
not_available Never met him.
not_available So your siblings, their fathers
not_available You know how it is, two fathers.
not_available Either one of them help out? 
not_available C.
not_available C.
not_available used to, but he went away and I never met the other guy.
not_available BP's still high, 162/94.
not_available Well, at least you're consistent, E.
not_available Maybe it's just white coat fever.
not_available What's that? Fear of doctors.
not_available I even get it myself from time to time.
not_available We'll recheck it when you come back.
not_available All right, doc.
not_available You ever seen hypertension in a kid that age? What do you care? You've got mice to impregnate.
not_available Have I done something wrong? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available Gallant's in a war zone and you're playing Madame Curie.
not_available I never asked Michael to cover for me, and I feel terrible.
not_available Oh, yeah? I think he feels worse.
not_available Look, I don't think it's right for you to hold me responsible.
not_available Look, my friend took a hit and he's gone.
not_available But you're running around doing everything under the sun except ER medicine.
not_available Now, if that's how it's gonna be, then fine.
not_available But hurry up and decide.
not_available You're taking up space.
not_available Pudding and tea.
not_available Yum.
not_available I don't like that tapioca they give us.
not_available Well, I'll put a special request in.
not_available From now on, nothing but chocolate.
not_available I'd like to talk some more about Charlie.
not_available Come on.
not_available I told you what happened.
not_available But you didn't tell me how you felt 
not_available how you reacted to losing him.
not_available How would you react? I think I would need to talk to somebody.
not_available Did you get any counseling? I didn't need someone to tell me how to cry.
not_available If you can't talk, you won't get past it.
not_available I'm already past it.
not_available Well, the mind is very complicated, and I think yours is playing a trick on you.
not_available That I'm sick because of something that happened eight years ago? I think there's a lot more going on in there than you realize.
not_available And there is a medication I can give you that can help us learn more about what you're feeling and thinking.
not_available You mean bourbon? It's called Amytal.
not_available It's given intravenously.
not_available It makes you kind of sleepy, but it opens you up.
not_available Once you reach that drowsy state, I'd ask you questions and we'll see if we can learn something we don't already know.
not_available Would you be willing to do that? How long has he been in there? About half an hour.
not_available Do you have an extra P
not_available 20? Yuri's this close to his Ph.
not_available D., you know.
not_available He's author on a paper coming out in Stroke next month.
not_available Maybe he'll just get reprimanded.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Maybe this'll teach you to cut that out.
not_available Shut up, man.
not_available It's a laboratory, not a playground.
not_available He's an idiot.
not_available He doesn't get it.
not_available The NMDA receptor is the key to understanding the neuropsychiatric filters 
not_available that separate us from our unconscious.
not_available I didn't say anything.
not_available It's cutting
not_available edge stuff.
not_available I don't think anyone downstairs did either.
not_available I like you guys.
not_available I really do.
not_available I like working up here.
not_available It's weird, but in some ways I'm much more comfortable here.
not_available Social Work is talking about placing restrictions on her access to the baby and her insurance coverage runs out.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available Conventional therapy with Jordan could take months.
not_available Sodium amobarbital is a way to jump
not_available start the process try to get to the core issue of her reaction.
not_available I'm glad to see you're prepared for the boards, but this isn't the standard.
not_available It's not a cure.
not_available Like getting a girl when she's plastered.
not_available That's an interesting analogy.
not_available Maybe we could talk about that another time.
not_available Plenty of mothers of SIDS babies don't have a disorder.
not_available Exactly.
not_available There's gotta be something more going on that she can't access.
not_available Which is why we should use the drug.
not_available It's hocus
not_available pocus.
not_available Abby, even if it works, it could destroy the therapeutic bond you've established.
not_available She wants to do it.
not_available Did you tell her it's not safe that there are risks if the dose is not correct? She knows, and we'll have an anesthesiologist there.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not signing off.
not_available You have to find another way.
not_available I kind of already did.
not_available Dr.
not_available Henriksen approved it.
not_available Henriksen? What is he, 80 years old? He'd sign off on a lobotomy.
not_available He was also in the Army where he saw Amytal used successfully a number of times in severe cases of combat stress reaction.
not_available Is it better to let them take her kid away? Another 25 q.
not_available five to 10 minutes.
not_available How are you feeling, Jordan? Like I'm floating.
not_available What do you wanna talk about? How'd you meet Nick? I couldn't find a token for the El and he offered me one if I gave him my number.
not_available So as this gets going, she may say things which will surprise you or upset you.
not_available It won't hurt her, will it? We won't let that happen.
not_available Two years.
not_available He's a great guy.
not_available He is.
not_available How about you? Ever been married? 
not_available I'm divorced.
not_available Kids? 
not_available No.
not_available And what about you? You just have the one, right? Yeah, Caroline.
not_available Charlie's gone.
not_available That must've been hard.
not_available The doctors, the paramedics they kept saying it wasn't my fault.
not_available It wasn't my fault.
not_available Jordan, can you tell me about the moment you realized there was something wrong with Charlie? Jordan? Is she breathing? Jordan, you all right? Do we have to stop? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I was holding him.
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available Jake worked all night at the bar and we had a fight that morning.
not_available And he said that I couldn't do anything right that I was a lousy lay.
not_available I couldn't cook.
not_available I couldn't keep the baby quiet.
not_available Did Jake hurt you? He hit me.
not_available He hit me a lot.
not_available And what about that morning? He was asleep in the bedroom.
not_available And the baby started crying.
not_available And I was scared what Jake would do if he woke up.
not_available So
not_available Were you trying to keep the baby quiet? He kept crying.
not_available I bounced him.
not_available I held him.
not_available I gave him my breast, but he kept crying.
not_available And then Jake
not_available Jake started yelling and throwing things, and he said he was gonna come out and kill us both.
not_available And so I held Charlie tight.
not_available He was wrapped in a blanket and I held him tight for a long time.
not_available I just kept saying, " Baby, you gotta be quiet now." Until he fell asleep.
not_available I thought he was asleep.
not_available I thought he was just sleeping.
not_available It's okay, Jordan.
not_available You were afraid.
not_available But I held him.
not_available I held him too tight.
not_available And you're afraid you're gonna do that again? Hey, we 're not in right now but leave a message for Kerry, Sandy or Henry after the beep.
not_available Kerry, it's Elizabeth.
not_available You haven't been in to work and I wanted to run the monthly morbidity stats.
not_available Oh, damn.
not_available Kerry, how are you? Look, I know how dreadful it is when someone you love isn't there.
not_available So if there's anything I can do, anything at all please, please call me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available I hope this is gonna work out, Abby.
not_available I think it will.
not_available What do you mean? The seizures are gonna stop.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available She's responsible for the death of a child.
not_available I can't just ignore it.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available YouYou said
not_available If she posed no further potential harm, there'd be nothing to file.
not_available But I can't in good conscience say that right now.
not_available She was a battered woman, Ken.
not_available It's not gonna happen again.
not_available She's a good mother.
not_available I'll monitor the family, I'll keep CPS apprised, and we'll see how it goes.
not_available How's the husband? It's a shock to him, but I think he's relieved.
not_available What you did was good medicine.
not_available It might've been better if I just left it alone.
not_available It was a tough situation, but you got to the truth.
not_available That's always good.
not_available Well, too bad the truth is so messed up.
not_available You know, the cafeteria's still open if you're hungry.
not_available I could drill you on developmental milestones, that kind of stuff.
not_available The boards are laced with it.
not_available Too late.
not_available Too late? Why? 
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Lockhart, Abby.
not_available Candidate identification number.
not_available Keep it with you at all times during the examination.
not_available You must enter your CID in order to begin.
not_available Once you start a test block, you may not take a break until the block is completed.
