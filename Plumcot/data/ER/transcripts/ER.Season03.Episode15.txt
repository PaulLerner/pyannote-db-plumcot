
not_available Previously on ER I gave him the wrong blood! 
not_available We should go out again.
not_available That's not a good idea.
not_available We may forego an investigation.
not_available I don't want any special favors.
not_available Intubate him.
not_available He doesn't want that.
not_available He'll die if we don't tube him.
not_available I should tell the Sun
not_available Times myself.
not_available That it wasn't the sickout.
not_available Then what happens? I'll lose my job? We'll take good care of you.
not_available Whenever you have an urge to date three women at once, snap it! Hello? Who's this? And why are you calling at 7 a.m.? It's just a day off.

not_available Just listen to me.

not_available Come here.
not_available Please! We need a doctor for him! I said get over here!

not_available Shut up! Lady, what are we supposed to do? Stop your yapping now! Wait! I'm a nurse.
not_available And maybe I can help him, and then she'll be quiet.
not_available Won't you, Mrs.
not_available Novotny? 
not_available This is a bit of luck.
not_available A nurse! 
not_available Get her over here.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Carol.
not_available Maybe you can help my cousin.
not_available Her husband is worse off.
not_available Take a look at my cousin first, or he'll be really pissed off.
not_available Go on.
not_available You go with her, Robert.
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available He's just a little boy.
not_available He shouldn't see things like that.
not_available No one should! Now go on.
not_available You go with her.
not_available Go on! 
not_available I think I'm gonna throw up.
not_available Don't look, Robert.
not_available Robert, don't look.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Don't point that at me.

not_available Stay where I can see you.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available The police's outside.
not_available I need to take your pulse.
not_available Jesus! I must take the pulse in your neck! Should we get that? 
not_available Just let it ring.
not_available Help us! What's the matter with the old boy? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I think he hurt his wrist.
not_available God! You'd think I shot everyone.
not_available You look fairly strong, but remember I've got the gun.
not_available I'm not doing anything! 
not_available You should answer the phone.
not_available Please! We need a doctor for him! Get him some help! Please! Please! 
not_available Maybe we should get that.
not_available I need a minute to think.
not_available Maybe it's not for you.
not_available The wound's serious.
not_available The bullet may have hit your kidney or spleen.
not_available Just stop the bleeding.
not_available We need a doctor.
not_available We're not getting anyone.
not_available Do it yourself! I don't have the supplies! 
not_available Look around, got a whole store full.
not_available Okay.
not_available He stays with me.
not_available Let her go.
not_available She's looking for some stuff.
not_available Your friend 
not_available My cousin.
not_available If he doesn't get to a hospital, he'll bleed to death.
not_available Help him! Please! Get an ambulance.
not_available Please help us! Please! Get an ambulance! Carol! Duncan, get something in front of the door.
not_available You, come with me.
not_available Up.
not_available Go around there.
not_available We're gonna move this over there, okay? Kind of a heavy sucker, huh? 
not_available I just stocked it.
not_available I love America! Everyone has a job here.
not_available You! Do you have a job? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I teach school.
not_available What? 
not_available I teach school.
not_available First grade.
not_available Good.
not_available If you get them young, you can teach them right.
not_available I guess no one got to you, huh? 
not_available She has a mouth.
not_available Stop chatting! Get down there! 
not_available This will stop it for now.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll come back and change it in a while.
not_available Do you need me? For what? 
not_available I'll just check on the old man.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Pray for us sinners now.
not_available Oh, Lord, blessed art Thou Mrs.
not_available Novotny? Mrs.
not_available Novotny, I need you! I'm gonna do five compressions in a row.
not_available And on the fifth I want you to hold his nose and blow into his mouth.
not_available The cops are moving the cars back.
not_available One, two, three, four, five.
not_available I need help.
not_available She's helping.
not_available Why do they do that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You're the American! I can't do this! I need medical supplies, IV fluid, monitors! Shut her up! 
not_available Someone must do CPR.
not_available I can do it! You don't move! 
not_available You sit there and say nothing.
not_available Listen, Duncan! You do not want this man to die.
not_available Those cops consider that a much bigger deal.
not_available Now, I need some help! Can you do this CPR thing? We just wanna know if everyone's a// right.
not_available If anyone needs help.
not_available Answer the phone I got straws, but I couldn't find 
not_available Rubbing alcohol.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Get me any kind of liquor.
not_available Grain alcohol is the strongest.
not_available Does anyone need a doctor or other help? That's a// we need to know.
not_available You got that? 
not_available We've gotta think what to tell them.
not_available Tell them anything.
not_available We need you to talk with us.
not_available Let us know what's going on.
not_available I should just keep going, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can move back now, Mrs.
not_available Novotny.
not_available You can move back now.
not_available Marita.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Robert, pour some on the straw.
not_available Robert! 
not_available I'll do it.
not_available We need to get out of here.
not_available I know.
not_available I just need to think.
not_available You weren't thinking at all.
not_available So it's all my fault? It was your bloody idea! Is that it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's breathing.
not_available He's got a pulse.
not_available Stop the compressions.
not_available Good.
not_available That means you've got it.
not_available Quiet, I'm trying to listen.
not_available He's breathing, but he looks blue.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available We're gonna do this! What is it? Is he all right? 
not_available I need an ice pick.
not_available By the freezer.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available No, stay there.
not_available I'll get the ice pick.
not_available I need a tiny straw.
not_available This is too big.
not_available We don't have that.
not_available The cardboard juices have straws.
not_available Robert, get those! Robert, now! 
not_available How long is this gonna take? Have you got someplace to go? I shot the man.
not_available If he pops off, it's my ass.
not_available Like I'm gonna get probation.
not_available Should I start again? 
not_available No.
not_available We need to know how many people are there and if they're a// right.
not_available Are you guys a// right? Get on the phone.
not_available If you need help, we can work something out.
not_available What are we doing now? 
not_available He needs a chest tube.
not_available Do it.
not_available It's not what I do.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available We need supplies.
not_available You've gotta send in a doctor.
not_available They'd love that chance.
not_available Please.
not_available You have to help him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Third, no, fifth intercostal neurovascular bundle above the rib.
not_available Screwdriver.
not_available Pour liquor on it, open the tampons and pull out the tube.
not_available Cut me a piece of tape.
not_available Give me the tampon.
not_available All right, tape.
not_available More tape.
not_available Great.
not_available Okay, blow into his trach tube.
not_available We've lost his pulse.
not_available Should I start CPR? 
not_available No, I've got it.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Angie.
not_available I've got it from now, Angie.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on! You can't do it, can you? Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Your cousin's losing more blood.
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available We'll get out of this.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Shut up and keep dragging.
not_available I have to go to the bathroom.
not_available He goes nowhere.
not_available He's just a kid! You don't want him throwing up here.
not_available It's okay.
not_available There's no way out of the bathroom.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come on.
not_available Guys, /isten to me.
not_available I don't need to talk to both of you.
not_available Just figure out who wants to get on the phone and start working with us.
not_available Duncan, you've gotta help your cousin.
not_available He's gotta get to a hospital.
not_available And I have to go to one of your fine prisons.
not_available They'll go easier on you.
not_available You've never killed before.
not_available How do you know that? 
not_available You haven't, have you? Duncan, what the hell's taking so long? Come on.
not_available You've got to start working with me.
not_available Hey! It's me, Javier.
not_available Quiet, quiet.
not_available There's a door behind me, but it's locked.
not_available I've got a baseball bat.
not_available No! They'll shoot you.
not_available Stay right there.
not_available I'll try to get the keys.
not_available Hang on! Don't move! What are you gonna tell them? 
not_available I'll ask for a truck or a van.
not_available Tell them to send medical supplies.
not_available Like what? What medical stuff do we need? 
not_available Don't be stupid.
not_available Four units of O
not_available negative blood, IVs, saline.
not_available So she'll fix me up and we'll leave? 
not_available Maybe! They'll send in the supplies with a cop.
not_available Now look what you did! I don't like the big guy.
not_available Tape him up.
not_available What? 
not_available Tape him up.
not_available I don't like him.
not_available I don't like her moving around.
not_available She's trying to help.
not_available Put this on.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This wouldn't be necessary if you hadn't shot the coffeepot.
not_available Don't talk back to them.
not_available Shoot the cold drinks next time.
not_available There won't be a next time! What did I do? You don't rob a shop with customers! 
not_available I was shot by the owner.
not_available You wouldn't listen! Listen to you? Where are the keys? 
not_available The keys? To the door off the storeroom.
not_available Javier's hiding in there.
not_available He could get out.
not_available First shelf under the counter.
not_available I'll try to get there.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's taking that kid so long? 
not_available He's throwing up.
not_available Give him a break! I want to talk to the hostages now! I want everyone to know Don't they ever shut up? 
not_available We're a// gonna stay calm.
not_available We'// solve this quietly.
not_available You have a fracture dislocation.
not_available I should reduce it, but that'll hurt.
not_available Take a drink of that liquor.
not_available I couldn't do that.
not_available I'm an alcoholic.
not_available Can you get us some aspirin? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, I can do it.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available To get some aspirin.
not_available I saw them over there.
not_available Try not to shoot it.
not_available Angie.
not_available Try not to shoot the aspirin.
not_available That's not funny.
not_available Maybe the old man will toss up his AlkaSeltzer for some target practice? 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Shoot the row of dishwashing liquid.
not_available That's not funny! 
not_available Shoot the lights while you're at it.
not_available You can shoot 
not_available Wasn't my husband enough? He shot him here and here.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Novotny.
not_available He could only bleed and bleed.
not_available He couldn't move, he couldn't breathe, he couldn't talk.
not_available He couldn't say goodbye.
not_available He couldn't say how much he loved me.
not_available I wanted to hear him say that just one more time! You see? I shot her old man! I killed her husband! And a good job I did too, before he shot you again.
not_available You didn't thank me for that! Where's the flipping kid? 
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available He's been in there half my life! 
not_available Lf he's sick, he might need me.
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available Hey, kid! Kid, are you still in there? Come out! You can't throw up forever! We're all eating free hot dogs.
not_available Don't you want one? Stupid thing to say if he's chucking up.
not_available You try.
not_available Robert, come out now! It's me, Carol! 
not_available It's Miss Hathaway.
not_available Miss Hathaway? That's very sweet.
not_available Come in.
not_available It'// go a /ot easier on you.
not_available We're gonna stay here Do you feel any better? Hm? That's good.
not_available We can go back out now.
not_available Duncan doesn't like me.
not_available Well Duncan doesn't like any of us.
not_available But you're gonna be okay.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available There are a lot of police out there who are gonna come in here and help us.
not_available Duncan will shoot them like he shot Mr.
not_available Novotny.
not_available He can't shoot them all.
not_available Are there 80 of them or something? 
not_available Or something.
not_available What if they don't shoot at the same time? Then we'll have to duck.
not_available Why did you take your shoes off? 
not_available My feet were hot.
not_available Put them back on so we can join the others, okay? I suppose you see a lot of dead people in your line of work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is just the way it is.
not_available Yes.
not_available I guess you sort of get used to it.
not_available Not really.
not_available Hey! There you go! Hey! What are you? Robert, come out! Robert! Duncan, what did you do? Come here! Get away from me! You can't catch a kid? 
not_available You're not helping.
not_available I'm not coming out! Leave him! Who cares? Come out now! Get away from me! Come here! Let go! Don't hurt him! 
not_available I'm not gonna hurt him.
not_available I'm just gonna kill him.
not_available James, answer the fucking phone! You're coming with me.
not_available Sit in the corner.
not_available Get down and stay there! No.
not_available Better still, I want you feeding quarters into that thing.
not_available Both hands on it at all times! I'm gonna answer that phone! I wanna hear "ping, ping, ping" coming from this direction.
not_available If I don't hear it, I'll probably turn around and shoot.
not_available Okay? Ping, ping, ping! We all know I shot the coffeepot, so I'm not afraid of shooting this or anything in the way of this thing! Get down! Bread man, down! Miss Hathaway, tend to my poor cousin, James! He's so weak, he can't even pick up the phone.
not_available What do you want? We're fine.
not_available It's sweet of you to ask! We don't want anything except a van or a truck.
not_available Or how about a tank? We don't need medical help.
not_available Nurse Hathaway can handle it herself.
not_available They don't think you can handle this.
not_available They want to send in a doctor.
not_available I think she resents the implications of that.
not_available We all do.
not_available Hey, come down from there! Get away from me! Leave me alone! Let go! Get away from me! There are dead cats up there.
not_available Do you want dead cats in your face? Let go! Get away! Hey! Hey, hey.
not_available That's what I need you to do now.
not_available We need to start, Duncan.
not_available God, how long does that go on for? I'm gonna start now, okay? 
not_available We know everyone's okay.
not_available That's our only concern.
not_available Robert's told them all about us by now.
not_available "The Scottish one, he killed the old man burnt the teacher and stole my shoe." What are we gonna do? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I need time to think.
not_available He's bleeding badly.
not_available I don't know how much time he has left if we don't get him to a hospital.
not_available I can keep changing his bandages, but it's not gonna matter.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Don't talk to me like that.
not_available I'm just trying to help him.
not_available Do you have any glue? 
not_available Yes, on the shelf behind the counter.
not_available I know.
not_available Ask for a chopper to fly us to a boat on Lake Michigan.
not_available The lake is frozen.
not_available We'll get an ice sailing boat.
not_available I did that once a couple of winters ago up in Lake Geneva.
not_available It was incredible.
not_available They're really fast, right? 
not_available 60 miles an hour.
not_available Felt like 100.
not_available They wouldn't catch us at that speed.
not_available We'd be home free.
not_available Sure, home free.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available The cut's too deep, I can't close it.
not_available Unless you want needle and thread.
not_available No, glue's fine.
not_available You weren't lying about his bleeding, were you? You have to give up now, Duncan.
not_available Duncan, maybe we should go to that place you told me about.
not_available Fifth of something.
not_available Firth of Clyde.
not_available We can take a ferry.
not_available Yeah, to the island of Great Cumbrae.
not_available And then sneak a boat to Little Cumbrae because it's privately owned.
not_available You can get caught.
not_available It's worth it if the sun's out and the Firth is blue.
not_available The big, purple mountains of Arran jut up in the background.
not_available Sounds beautiful.
not_available I've never been there.
not_available Never seen the Firth.
not_available I should have pledged at Hogmanay to go to Little Cumbrae.
not_available A clean break with the past.
not_available A fresh start.
not_available But I came to America instead to stay with my cousin.
not_available My father thought I was crazy.
not_available He works on the shipyards in Glasgow.
not_available Thirty years loading on and off.
not_available Got me the same job when I was 19.
not_available I was laid off by 20.
not_available It's a good job, but I wanted something else.
not_available I wanted to be something more.
not_available I have too.
not_available With all you can do? Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available So then I end up in here.
not_available Duncan Stuart comes to America, and one morning he comes in here.
not_available We just needed the money.
not_available But look what we got! Look! You're a bloody mess, and I don't know what to do.
not_available But you're all right.
not_available I'm not all right! I killed a man! I killed a man! Do you know what that feels like? Do you know what that feels like? Do you? 
not_available I do.
not_available I killed a man.
not_available I gave him the wrong blood.
not_available You didn't mean to kill him.
not_available You didn't mean to kill Mr.
not_available Novotny.
not_available How many of those cops will care about that? It's all right, James.
not_available I'll get us out of this somehow.
not_available I have to think of something, I don't know what.
not_available Something.
not_available Maybe Robert had the right idea.
not_available Maybe that's the way out if we stack the crates high enough to support the ceiling.
not_available Duncan, behind you! 
not_available Don't, Duncan! You already know what it feels like, but now you'll mean it.
not_available Don't! Don't! Where were you? Where the hell were you?! Where were you?! 
not_available In the storeroom by the door.
not_available You're saying there's a door? Here! Just take them! Take the keys, Duncan.
not_available We're gonna wait for him to get here because he wants to talk to you Where does it go? 
not_available It's a fire escape.
not_available The ladder leads up to the apartment building behind us.
not_available There's a building behind us? 
not_available You're coming with me.
not_available Don't move your wrists.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available I hope it's you who'll be fine.
not_available James, I have to go.
not_available There's a way out.
not_available I have to go.
not_available I don't want to leave you, but 
not_available We should've waited.
not_available They'll take good care of you.
not_available I know they will.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Go on.
not_available We'll take the long way around.
not_available We did it, Miss Hathaway.
not_available We did it.
not_available When we get to the end of the alley, I want you to let me go.
not_available Sure.
not_available I wouldn't want you to slow me down.
not_available Hold it right there.
not_available Stop right there, please.
not_available Stop! Is that one of them? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Don't run, Duncan! Stop or I'll shoot! Don't run! Call the paramedics! Unit 24
not_available 18.
not_available I'm in the alley behind 3312 Wolcott.
not_available I've got one offender down.
not_available I need a wagon or an ambulance.
not_available What about the other suspect? The other suspect! Internal bleeding.
not_available He's still inside, probably passed out.
not_available Second suspect is inside, possibly unconscious.
not_available Come on! Get the paramedics! Clear Trauma 2! Are you all right? Are you hurt? 
not_available Clear Trauma 2! Duncan Stuart.
not_available Multiple GSW to chest and thigh.
not_available Two liters saline in.
not_available Gave high
not_available dose epi for P.E.A.
not_available James Roger.
