not_available How much of your brain did they cut out? He has a mild expressive aphasia.
not_available It's temporary.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available This is just gonna be between us, right? 
not_available Of course.
not_available The only reason you gave me that job is because I'm black.
not_available Lupus is very serious.
not_available I know what it does, Dr.

not_available Alien, you know? It's moving around under his skin and then, all of a sudden, it breaks its way through with its teeth.
not_available Amanda, stop it.
not_available You're scaring your mother.
not_available Amanda.
not_available So the baby's a girl today.
not_available Or Matthew, after my grandfather.
not_available I can't decide.
not_available Last day? Last day.
not_available What? It's okay.
not_available Hi.
not_available Did I wake you? I was trying to let you sleep.
not_available I should probably get home anyway.
not_available You should bring a few things over.
not_available I could clear out some closet space for you.
not_available Are you sure you can spare it? 
not_available I can find a couple of inches somewhere, maybe.
not_available I need to dry my hair.
not_available Are you gonna watch me again? Are you okay? And you? Penny for your thoughts.
not_available Pardon? 
not_available It means It means, "What are you thinking about? " Nothing, really.
not_available I was thinking about the bishop.

not_available I can take it.
not_available Welcome back! 
not_available Thanks.
not_available How are you feeling?

not_available Want me to tag along with you? 
not_available No.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Eight weeks.
not_available Could be some cobwebs.
not_available Thanks, anyway.
not_available Call me if she gets into any trouble.
not_available Okay.
not_available You look great.
not_available I still have a few pounds to drop.
not_available Can't tell.
not_available I should have gotten a coat.
not_available Grab one.
not_available No, I'm all right.
not_available Zack Woodman, 4 years old.
not_available Post grand mal seizure at preschool.

not_available Excuse me.
not_available Can somebody help me? Are you hurt? 
not_available It's not me.
not_available He's in the car.
not_available He's very weak.
not_available I don't think he can walk on his own.
not_available Abby? What's wrong? 
not_available He's having trouble breathing.
not_available Has he been ill? 
not_available Yes.
not_available When did this start? I don't know.
not_available A couple hours ago, I guess.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available Can you walk? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I need a septic workup, CBC, blood and urine cultures, chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Temp's 105.
not_available Sorry.
not_available The bishop's back.
not_available I need a weight.
not_available Blue zone, 20 kilos.
not_available Pulse ox, 82.
not_available Put him on a mask, 10 liters.
not_available Do you want to do a spinal tap? He could have meningitis.
not_available Or a febrile seizure, and he's gonna wake up.
not_available Why don't I get an LP tray? 
not_available I want to wait a few minutes.
not_available Give 900 of cefotaxime after the cultures.
not_available Well, I love what you've done with the place.
not_available Very Teutonic.
not_available No trappings of success to interfere with your performing your new duties.
not_available I requisitioned some furniture but the form's on your desk waiting for your signature.
not_available Well, you should see my in
not_available box.
not_available Must be 18 inches deep.
not_available Are those admissions folders? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I thought I'd familiarize myself with them.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available Kids are gonna toss out clich√©s about wanting to help people.
not_available You could ask their favorite color, or if they like cheese.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Step outside a minute, would you? He showed up whining about not getting an interview.
not_available You should shake his hand, since this falls under your purview before you have Security toss him out.
not_available Hey.
not_available That's your man.
not_available Dean Benton? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available William White.
not_available Thanks for finding time to see me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, what can I do for you? I got this letter.
not_available I applied to the medical school.
not_available But I didn't get an interview.
not_available Teacher doesn't have a signed emergency consent form.
not_available He's still not waking up.
not_available How long? 
not_available Forty minutes.
not_available Zack? Zack, can you hear me? 
not_available He needs an LP.
not_available We don't have parental consent.
not_available Get another doc to sign off the chart with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Get the tray set up.
not_available Frank, where's Carter? 
not_available In 4.
not_available Granny took a fall.
not_available Can I see you for a moment? Sure.
not_available I've got that 4year
not_available old with febrile seizure.
not_available He's still altered.
not_available I wanna do a spinal tap.
not_available The preschool doesn't have an emergency consent.
not_available Haven't been able to contact a parent.
not_available Any other signs? X
not_available ray looks like viral pneumonia.
not_available I can't assess for a stiff neck, but there is photophobia.
not_available Where do you want me to sign? Oxygen saturation's only 78.
not_available What should it be? 
not_available Hundred.
not_available Seventy
not_available eight sounds like a passing grade.
not_available Barely.
not_available Put him up to four liters.
not_available CBC, blood cultures, ABG, sed rate and a portable chest.
not_available Hang a gram of cefotaxime in case it's pneumonia.
not_available Pneumonia? I don't even feel like I have a fever.
not_available The steroids prevent you from having fevers.
not_available And push 125 of Solu
not_available Medrol.
not_available You're giving me more steroids? You could have a flare of the lupus with inflammation in the lung.
not_available There's also a chance that you are throwing blood clots.
not_available Lupus makes your blood coagulate more easily.
not_available Have you called your own doctor? No.
not_available I'll call him.
not_available No.
not_available Why? Because you think I'm easier to manipulate? I'm not nearly as Machiavellian as you imagine me to be.
not_available I came here because I prefer your care.
not_available How's it going? Easy tap when they're unconscious.
not_available Looks pretty clear.
not_available Cute kid.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Zack.
not_available Cell count, glucose, protein, Gram's stain and culture.
not_available He's got those shoes that light up when you walk.
not_available How do they do that? Want to roll him back over? What is that? What? 
not_available That.
not_available You didn't tell me he had a macular rash.
not_available It wasn't there half an hour ago.
not_available It must be a viral exanthem.
not_available It could be measles.
not_available Measles? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fever, altered mental status, pneumonia.
not_available More likely, he has a virus with pneumonia and had a febrile seizure from the high temperature.
not_available That is a classic measles rash.
not_available Abby, can you hand me a tongue depressor? Have you ever seen measles? 
not_available No.
not_available You? Of course not.
not_available Nobody's seen measles.
not_available Can you? He's got Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa.
not_available What? Or he bit the inside of his mouth when he was seizing.
not_available There's a Nelson's in the lounge.
not_available Can you grab it, please? Now.
not_available Is Zack all right? 
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available Woodman.
not_available I was in court.
not_available I have to turn off my cell in session.
not_available My God! I'm Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Your son had a seizure and a high temperature.
not_available We've done a spinal tap to rule out meningitis.
not_available Are Zack's immunizations uptodate? 
not_available No.
not_available Has he had the MMR? He hasn't had any immunizations.
not_available None of our children have.
not_available I got it.
not_available Abby, put a mask on Zack.
not_available What's the matter? What's happening? 
not_available Get him into the Laminar Flow Room.
not_available Call the school.
not_available Don't let anybody leave.
not_available What's the matter with my son? 
not_available Your son has measles.
not_available That's not too bad, right? One in 500 kids die from measles.
not_available Frank, I'm taking the Luiz kid up now.
not_available Please send along the films when you find them again, will you? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available So how'd it go? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine? That's it? I laid down, they shot a couple billion more rads into my skull, and then I left.
not_available And that's it.
not_available Hopefully, my irradiated head won't screw up any navigational equipment on our next flight.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Lunch? 
not_available If I can.
not_available Come find me.
not_available Okay.
not_available So did I hear right? You're done? Radiation treatment.
not_available Just two more weeks of immune therapy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Yeah? That's great.
not_available Did they give you the tumor back? When they took it out, did they give it back to you? Because my uncle Al, he's got his on a mantle in a jar.
not_available Guy over there wants to talk to you.
not_available You know, Dave, I don't really want a tumor on my mantle.
not_available Hi.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Can I help you? Robert Wilson.
not_available Is there some place we could talk? 
not_available Actually, I'm on duty.
not_available It'd be better if we had some privacy.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr 
not_available Dr.
not_available Wilson.
not_available Dr.
not_available Wilson.
not_available What is it? I work for the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation.
not_available We've been asked to evaluate your competency to continue practicing medicine.
not_available Where in the hell did he catch measles? 
not_available Europe, I think.
not_available Mom was in Paris two weeks ago, took the whole family.
not_available She some fringe lunatic thinks immunizations are a conspiracy between doctors and drug companies? I don't think so.
not_available Find out if there are other kids at home where the child's been, who he's had contact with over the last week.
not_available How is he? They won't let me back there.
not_available We moved him to a room with special ventilation so he doesn't contaminate the rest of the ER.
not_available Is he awake? 
not_available He's still unconscious.
not_available He has pneumonia.
not_available And, in all likelihood, encephalitis.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Inflammation around the brain.
not_available Did you call the preschool? 
not_available Yes.
not_available All the children are there.
not_available Make sure they've all been immunized.
not_available Their parents, their siblings, anyone they've been in contact with.
not_available There's a phone at the desk.
not_available Tell Frank that Dr.
not_available Carter said you could use it.
not_available Please.
not_available You have other children? A daughter.
not_available I called my husband.
not_available He's coming with her.
not_available And she hasn't been immunized either? No.
not_available Is Zack gonna be okay? Well, he's in grave condition with a highly contagious disease.
not_available I'm not an irresponsible parent.
not_available I read all the literature on the Internet, the parenting magazines.
not_available I discussed it with my pediatrician.
not_available He didn't recommend the MMR? Zack's immune system could have been weakened from vaccinations.
not_available The immune system is strengthened by vaccines.
not_available Kids are exposed to foreign antigens.
not_available Vaccines aren't completely safe.
not_available I'm sorry
not_available They aren't, and you know it.
not_available The connection between vaccinations and autism
not_available There is no connection.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, Zack dropped his sats.
not_available He's at 75 at 100 percent.
not_available He's getting cyanotic.
not_available I've already started the atropine.
not_available Etomidate and sux.
not_available I need a 5
not_available 0 uncuffed ET and a number 2 curved blade.
not_available What's going on? There's so much lung damage that oxygen can't get into his bloodstream.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Trying to get him more oxygen.
not_available He needs a machine to breathe? If we don't intubate him, he's gonna die.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Not on your first day back.
not_available Step out.
not_available What? 
not_available Step out! Give me some suction.
not_available He's throwing PVCs.
not_available Oh, my God! Come on.
not_available Okay, I got it.
not_available Good breath sounds bilaterally.
not_available Pulse ox up to 88.
not_available Tidal volume of 150, AC of 14.
not_available Let's keep him on 100 percent with three of PEEP.
not_available He's okay now? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available He's great.
not_available Is that the bishop's? 
not_available He says he's feeling better.
not_available The oxygen and the medication.
not_available So he'll be able to perform the ordination this afternoon? What? That's where we were headed when he became ill in the car.
not_available A kid that he baptized at his first parish is being ordained as a priest today.
not_available Where do you think you're going? I feel much better.
not_available Your ABG shows an oxygen level of 58.
not_available And your sed rate is 84.
not_available Eighty
not_available four.
not_available Is that good? No, it's not good! It's an indication of active lupus! Stop buttoning that damn shirt.
not_available Is Joe still outside? I think I'm gonna need help getting into these pants.
not_available You need to be admitted to the ICU for IV Cytoxan.
not_available Only a couple of hours.
not_available If the inflammation in your lungs continues you won't get enough oxygen to stay alive.
not_available If I skip the reception, I can be back here by 6.
not_available You'll be dead by 6! 
not_available It's in God's hands.
not_available God could give a damn! Is there something I should sign so I can go? You're kidding! Stephanie? 
not_available She just up and moved to Seattle.
not_available I thought she was living with Deborah.
not_available No.
not_available She met a stewardess.
not_available Another stewardess! Hey, we were just looking for you.
not_available This is Christy.
not_available Christy, Kerry.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available Christy and I were having coffee.
not_available I insisted that she bring me here.
not_available I'm sorry, but a bunch of us were beginning to question your existence.
not_available We were thinking about having dinner tonight.
not_available You game? I can't get off in time.
not_available But thank you for asking.
not_available I checked your schedule.
not_available You get off at 6.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Nobody bites.
not_available Chief, can I get you to sign off on this LOL? Head CT's clear.
not_available 7:30? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Great.
not_available We'll see you then.
not_available Bye.
not_available That Legaspi's girlfriend? I heard she's gay.
not_available I don't know.
not_available What I wouldn't pay to drop in on that little party, huh? You turned me in? A guy from the medical board's questioning my competency.
not_available Don't walk away! 
not_available I'm not.
not_available I don't wanna have this conversation in the lobby.
not_available He wants to see my medical records.
not_available He's planning on interviewing the staff to see if I'm fit to practice medicine.
not_available He can pull my license! I'm concerned about your personality changes since the surgery.
not_available I tried to talk to you, but you've chosen to ignore me.
not_available So you call in the licensing board? 
not_available Keep your voice down.
not_available They cut a tumor out of my head.
not_available I'm sorry if I seem a little different to you.
not_available I wouldn't come back to work if I couldn't do the job.
not_available What about the aphasia? 
not_available It's getting better.
not_available If you couldn't think of the name of the drug you wanted ordered the nurses ask questions while the patient dies? Nobody's dying! 
not_available You've been insensitive and argumentative.
not_available I have not! 
not_available You have been shooting from the hip.
not_available I'm not the only one who's expressed concern.
not_available For the safety of the patients I felt I had to call the board for an objective assessment.
not_available I want you to pass, so we can all get back to work confident in your abilities.
not_available Okay? Rich people think if poor kids are immunized, then they don't have to be.
not_available I thought it stopped snowing.
not_available If everybody stops getting vaccines then smallpox will be back, polio, measles.
not_available Then they'll be lined up begging us to stick a needle into little Annie's arm.
not_available Fiftyyearold male with non
not_available Hodgkin's lymphoma.
not_available Persistent nausea and vomiting despite Compazine.
not_available BP's 88/58.
not_available Pulse, 130.
not_available Mucous membranes very dry.
not_available Gave a liter of saline en route.
not_available He only finished the chemotherapy last week.
not_available Is the cancer back? No.
not_available He's probably having a reaction to the chemo.
not_available How's the boy? 
not_available Which one? The kid with the febrile seizure.
not_available You brought him in? 
not_available Couple hours ago.
not_available They didn't call you? 
not_available About? Measles.
not_available You drove an immunosuppressed patient in the same rig? What does that mean? Nobody told us! I'll need a CBC and a Chem
not_available 20.
not_available Watch your step.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I need to review a file of an applicant who wasn't given an interview.
not_available And you are? Peter Benton.
not_available I'm the new director of diversity.
not_available Lucky you.
not_available This year? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It'd be in the reject pile.
not_available What's the name? White.
not_available William White.
not_available We had over 3000 applications for 150 spots.
not_available Big pile.
not_available Director of diversity, huh? That position's a little quixotic around here these days.
not_available My David wouldn't be with Morgan Stanley without affirmative action.
not_available William Jackson White.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you keep files of past candidates that were accepted? I need to compare them.
not_available Compare to last year's acceptances.
not_available They're over there by graduating year.
not_available Student Affairs.
not_available Fax it over.
not_available I'll be looking for it.
not_available Student Affairs.
not_available What are you doing out here? Just getting some air.
not_available What's the matter? How's your bishop? 
not_available He just left.
not_available That's good, right? He's having an acute lupus flare.
not_available He left AMA.
not_available So go get him.
not_available Take some oxygen, make sure he's okay.
not_available He knew what he was doing.
not_available I'm not his keeper.
not_available So this is you, huh? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Could use a little something.
not_available What is that back there? My room with a view.
not_available Cafeteria kitchen.
not_available Vending machine only had turkey and egg salad.
not_available No veggie.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hear about our measles kid downstairs? Four years old, parents didn't vaccinate.
not_available What's all this? 
not_available Med school applications.
not_available Thinking about starting over? Is this your file? This black kid applied and didn't get an interview.
not_available I went to Records to find out why and found that.
not_available Yeah? Anything interesting? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My file wasn't with the rest.
not_available It was in the back with three others filed under AA.
not_available Affirmative Action.
not_available That surprised you? 
not_available Hell, yeah! Look, my grades were good.
not_available My MCAT scores were competitive.
not_available Yeah, but when I compared it to the other applicants that were accepted that year, I shouldn't have gotten in.
not_available You're an excellent physician.
not_available They were right to let you in.
not_available Yeah? This is the kid's file that didn't even get an interview this year.
not_available William White.
not_available His grades, his MCAT scores, they're better than mine were.
not_available Bishop Stewart? Damn it! I'm okay.
not_available How long have you been having trouble breathing? I'm just gathering my strength.
not_available You have to go to the hospital.
not_available It's pretty, isn't it? The snow.
not_available So much beauty.
not_available Where's the phone? I need to call an ambulance.
not_available No.
not_available Please, I only need a minute.
not_available You're dying.
not_available Evidently.
not_available As I was sitting here, I was reminded of the night I chose to become a priest.
not_available I'd been struggling with it for a long time.
not_available Several years.
not_available Anyway, that night, I couldn't sleep.
not_available So I got up and went out for a walk in the woods behind my father's house.
not_available It was snowing like it is now.
not_available I don't have any idea how long I walked.
not_available At a certain point, I suddenly realized I didn't know which way to go.
not_available I'd gotten lost.
not_available I was frightened.
not_available As I looked up into that dark night he came to me.
not_available I saw all those millions of snowflakes drifting down toward me.
not_available So still.
not_available So peaceful.
not_available Perfect.
not_available And I was filled with the love of our Lord Jesus Christ.
not_available Like pouring wine into an empty glass.
not_available I'm afraid I may have wasted my life.
not_available For some reason, I never accomplished the things I should have.
not_available What God wanted of me.
not_available And now I'm frightened.
not_available I'm afraid of dying.
not_available There.
not_available I said it.
not_available I am afraid to die.
not_available You have to go to the hospital.
not_available The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
not_available He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
not_available He leadeth me beside the still waters.
not_available Is he all right? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available The procession is forming.
not_available What should I tell them? Tell them I think I have to skip the processional.
not_available When did you lose your faith? I've found with most people, it comes and goes.
not_available Like intimacy in a relationship.
not_available Sometimes it's so strong, a passion, rapture.
not_available And then at other times it's impossible, distant, lost.
not_available But that's not God.
not_available That's us.
not_available We put up our own barriers with our egos and our pain.
not_available He's always there.
not_available No matter what.
not_available Bach.
not_available I love Bach.
not_available Well that's my cue.
not_available So, Kevin, why do you want to be a doctor? I've given that question a great deal of thought.
not_available I think it all boils down to one 
thing I really want to help people.
not_available My dad died of lung cancer and I was 12.
not_available I vowed I would work for a cure.
not_available My research in molecular biology has been very rewarding.
not_available We'll see gene therapy in our lifetime.
not_available I'm a people person.
not_available The bottom line is, I really want to help people.
not_available I volunteered for the Pediatrics ward.
not_available I'm very empathetic.
not_available When I saw my kitty suffering like that, I knew that I had a calling.
not_available To help people in their time of need.
not_available You have to combine humanistic skills
not_available With a passion for making a difference.
not_available I really just wanna help people.
not_available I just wanna help people.
not_available I wanna help people.
not_available Help people.
not_available How dare you? Damn it, Kerry! They sawed off half his skull.
not_available They inserted high
not_available dosage chemotherapy wafers into the empty cavity.
not_available It caused temporary swelling right next to Broca's.
not_available Of course he had a little aphasia.
not_available But that was six weeks ago.
not_available The swelling's gone down, and he's back to normal.
not_available If anything, I find his honesty rather refreshing.
not_available We could all do with more candor here.
not_available Candidly speaking then, are you sure that you can be objective about this? Of course I'm not objective! I've been with him every moment, and I can tell you he's making remarkable progress and is no danger to anyone.
not_available Except perhaps easily threatened, minor demigods.
