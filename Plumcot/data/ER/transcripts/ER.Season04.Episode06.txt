not_available But I talked to Tommy Styles.
not_available Tommy? I thought he moved to Atlanta.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's a general manager of a construction company down there and got some contracts during the Olympics.

not_available Better job opportunities.
not_available Better weather.
not_available We already know Tommy.
not_available My sister's down there.

not_available Sounds great.
not_available But? But we're not kids anymore.
not_available We can't just start over.
not_available Why not? Why can't we just wipe the slate clean? Because we have a mortgage and I have a job.
not_available But I don't.
not_available I'm being frozen out up here.
not_available And after that fight with Bill, I can't just hang out watch a football game with the guys.
not_available My life is over up here.
not_available In Atlanta, we wouldn't have to tell anybody.
not_available Nobody would know.
not_available Hey, how many patients do you think we see every year? Too many.
not_available Could you be a little more specific? It's for my grant proposal.
not_available Tonight's the Carter Family Foundation night.
not_available You nervous? No, the worst she'll say is no, and I'm back to clueless and penniless.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Hey.
not_available You in a good mood? The hospital settled the Kenny Law malpractice suit.
not_available No more process servers.
not_available No more depositions.
not_available And after today, no more work because I've got three days of vacation time before me.
not_available Any plans? Sleep, sleep and sleep.
not_available Mark, how many patients do we see here every year? Would that be real patients or turkeys? Forget I asked.
not_available Your count will be about 95 percent higher if you count all the wackos.
not_available It's a little harsh.
not_available All right, I'll make you a wager.
not_available A wager on the turkeyto
not_available patient ratio over the next 12 hours.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Two
not_available 1 odds.
not_available Can I get a doctor quickly? Help, please! Anyone! See? Here's a real patient now.

not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available I'm running late.
not_available Sorry.

not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Make yourself comfortable.
not_available I'm gonna go get dressed.
not_available This is a nice place.

not_available I like them cold.
not_available Me too.
not_available Really? Damn landlord won't fumigate the place.
not_available I write letters, call the management office.
not_available Bet he doesn't have roaches around his fat
not_available cat estates.
not_available Report him to the health department.
not_available Roaches are a health hazard.
not_available Really? That works? You tried it? Yeah.
not_available I never would have pegged you for a guy who knew slumlord politics.
not_available You seem so milkfed middle
not_available class.
not_available You know, my family always had enough to get by.
not_available Never went hungry or anything.

not_available What happened? A performance piece
not_available I did "William Tell," taking the risk that the average Philistine wouldn't.
not_available All this idiot had to do was shoot the apple from in between my legs.
not_available Lucky he didn't aim higher.
not_available It makes it even edgier.
not_available You shed blood for your work.
not_available Are you Max Prole? No.
not_available It's just, the blood on the gallery wall made a bold splatterDo I look like Jackson Pollock? 
not_available I'm sorry, sir.

not_available Hey, what's going on? 
not_available Finishing up my note.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks changed her surgery? She made rounds for Dr.
not_available Sloman.
not_available You weren't here yet.
not_available Why wasn't I called? 
not_available I didn't want to disturb you.
not_available That was my gastroplasty.
not_available I know.
not_available But you have limited time with your family, so Is that what you told Dr.
not_available Hicks? Peter, I thought I was doing you a favor.
not_available If you think I wanted this
not_available Hey, did you? Look, why don't you take my ischemic bowel at 11, and we'll call it a trade.
not_available Okay, yeah.
not_available Why don't we do that.
not_available Good.
not_available You smell like talcum powder.
not_available That's so sweet.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Your husband called.
not_available Did he leave a message? 
not_available Yeah, I wrote it down.
not_available "Mint juleps, night
not_available blooming jasmine and warm southern breezes.
not_available " That was it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He sounds like a real romantic.
not_available Sometimes I wish he wasn't as much of a romantic.
not_available You don't like being swept off your feet? 
not_available It's the landing that's a problem.
not_available This Synergix Group Its balanced budget's deeper in the red than ours.
not_available I've made real progress.
not_available That's laudable.
not_available But hear what they have to say.
not_available What if I don't like it? I'd plan on liking it.
not_available Or you can explain to the board of directors the ER's massive deficit.
not_available They're looking for scapegoats.
not_available Don't be one.
not_available It was a complete accident.
not_available Mr.
not_available Prole made me do it.
not_available This is your guy.
not_available A couple of questions.
not_available I was a bad shot.
not_available He wouldn't listen! 
not_available Gotta love the crackpots.
not_available Can you cover me for a few hours? Anspaugh's sending me to some dogand
not_available pony show for these ER management groups.
not_available If I have to.
not_available He just zeroed in on the budget.
not_available Said we're overstaffed, ordering too many tests.
not_available He wants it turned around.
not_available Sounds bad.
not_available There's no money.
not_available Resources are stretched as it is.
not_available He still wants me to lose another 98,000.
not_available Something's gotta give.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just don't know what or who.
not_available Let me know when you're back.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available Matthew Lindermulder.
not_available His spotter at the gym dropped a free
not_available weight bar on his head.
not_available Now I know why I let my gym membership lapse.
not_available BP's 120/80.
not_available Pulse 88.
not_available Pupils equal, round and reactive.
not_available Babinski's down
not_available going.
not_available He withdraws to pain.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get a CBC, crosstable Cspine, and a non
not_available contrast head CT.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available What's that? It's a Klan tattoo.
not_available Can you hear me? How long was he seizing? His cellmates screamed for us an hour ago.
not_available All the way here.
not_available It stopped as we pulled up.
not_available BP's 100/70.
not_available Pulse 100.
not_available Has he been here before? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Wet himself in the van on the way.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you not use those cuffs? 
not_available Okay, but I gotta stay with him.
not_available He's waking up! I hear it ringing.
not_available Any history of epilepsy? 
not_available No.
not_available I smell rubber.
not_available How are you feeling there? I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Hang on.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Hang on.
not_available He's bit his tongue.
not_available Get a head CT and a tox screen.
not_available Can I talk to you outside? Sure.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Textbook seizure symptoms.
not_available A little too textbook.
not_available A convincing performance.
not_available I've seen Oscar
not_available winning performances for a "Get out of Jail Free" card.
not_available Maybe Mark Greene's rubbing off on us.
not_available He's seizing again.
not_available The labs are back on that weird guy in 1.
not_available Anna, weird guy in 1.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks again for breakfast.
not_available Sure.
not_available Could you wrap up a patient for me? 
not_available Is he stinky? No.
not_available A straightforward concussion.
not_available Just makes me uncomfortable.
not_available You're passing him off because he makes you feel uncomfortable? Dr.
not_available Carter? It's the lab.
not_available He's a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
not_available Did he make any remarks? No.
not_available He's unconscious.
not_available But I noticed he had a KKK tattoo.
not_available If we all waited for the perfect patient, the lounge would be standing
not_available room only.
not_available Any problem, call security.
not_available Until then, try and remember Hippocrates.
not_available No pupil dilation.
not_available Oral mucosa's intact.
not_available Lucky landing.
not_available Sorry, officer, it doesn't look good.
not_available Will you prepare the H20
not_available Na treatment, please? Doctor, that's experimental.
not_available What doesn't look good? 
not_available Well, it's our only hope.
not_available Officer, do you have the name of Mr.
not_available Steiff's next of kin? Either he'll snap out of it, or he'll be forced into an irreversible coma.
not_available Coma? Wait a few seconds.
not_available If it doesn't work, call the coma team.
not_available What? What? Who? 
not_available Amazing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Saltwater.
not_available Where am I? Right now, you're in a hospital but you'll soon be on a bus headed for prison in very wet pants.
not_available We got your Gram's stain back, Mr.
not_available La Fontaine.
not_available Please, for you, Vinnie.
not_available Okay, Vinnie.
not_available You have gonorrhea.
not_available From your chart, you're familiar with the protocol.
not_available Occupational hazard.
not_available Price of being a player.
not_available You sing? 
not_available No.
not_available That's a damn shame because I've been in the entertainment industry for numerous years.
not_available And with a face like yours, you could sell a lot of platters.
not_available This is a single dose of Floxin and Zithromax.
not_available They do the same thing as the antibiotics you're used to.
not_available I remember when it used to be an elephant gun of penicillin in the ass.
not_available Have you been tested recently for HIV or syphilis? Oh, yeah, I get tested at Southside Clinic.
not_available I am clean and pristine.
not_available Is the coast clear? 
not_available What? Fake seizure kid.
not_available I'd rather Dr.
not_available Greene not see him.
not_available Not a patient I should bring up to your grandmother, right? Oh, jeez! Your clinic proposal.
not_available That's tonight, isn't it? Yeah, Oak Park, 7:00.
not_available That's what we said.
not_available Yeah, we did.
not_available I just spaced it.
not_available I made plans with Anna.
not_available I can change them.
not_available Plans with Anna? 
not_available Yeah, Journal Club.
not_available So it's a colleague kind of thing? 
not_available So far.
not_available You got all your facts and figures? Gamma loves those.
not_available Just waiting for census numbers.
not_available That's cool.
not_available You'll do fine.
not_available Don't talk politics or religion and you'll stay on her good side.
not_available Politics, religion.
not_available Or baseball.
not_available She's pissed off over that inter
not_available league play.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available You're a natural.
not_available How long has your wrist hurt? About two weeks.
not_available Think it might be
not_available I'll take a look.
not_available Can you hold this? I'll just set it down
not_available Consider yourself served.
not_available Excuse me? If you have questions 
not_available an attorney's number is inside.
not_available Too late, bud.
not_available This case was settled.
not_available But I have a suggestion of where to stick this.
not_available Another process server? 
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available Impersonating a patient.
not_available That's gotta be illegal.
not_available They should get their story straight.
not_available Mark, it's not a malpractice summons.
not_available It's a civil suit.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Chris Law's claiming you violated his brother's civil rights.
not_available He's not suing the hospital.
not_available He's suing you.
not_available So I think the facts speak for themselves.
not_available When you partner with Synergix Physicians' Group we will increase revenues streamline management and cut costs making your department a center of excellence.
not_available I'm sure that some of you have questions.
not_available So
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Eric Norris, director of St.
not_available Joseph's ER
not_available The principal author on thrombolytics and pulmonary embolism in the September Annals.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Yes.
not_available What are your billing charges? Now, that is the beauty of the SPG system.
not_available Collective billing of 125 facilities enables us to keep billing costs down below 5 percent.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I have a few questions.
not_available The first
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available And you are? Kerry Weaver, Chief of Emergency Services at County General.
not_available Five percent is an impressive number.
not_available But what's the actual percentage Synergix retains in management fees? We retain the current physicians' salaries.
not_available We balance your budget by maximizing reimbursement and cutting costs.
not_available I'm sure you've heard of the Pentagon and the $5,000 hammer
not_available Yeah, I'm not talking about hammers.
not_available And you haven't answered my question, Mr.
not_available West.
not_available Well, it's Dr.
not_available West.
not_available But please call me Ellis.
not_available The number you're looking for is dependent upon a multitude of factors.
not_available Payer mix, daily census, physician reimbursement, just to name a few.
not_available But we should talk about this later.
not_available Right now I'd like to answer a few more questions, if I may.
not_available Yes? In the back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Lizzie, just the person I wanted to see.
not_available Someone will be limping for a while.
not_available Some wacky artist got shot.
not_available Completely imploded his cartilage.
not_available There's a cylindrical defect to the femoral condyle.
not_available You called it.
not_available Perfect candidate for your research.
not_available He's all yours if you got the time.
not_available I have, but we'd need to get his consent, look for a donor femur.
not_available Consent's taken care of.
not_available And I trolled the morgue.
not_available Found a femur that matches.
not_available All you need to do is grow culture cells.
not_available An osteochondral allograft.
not_available I didn't think I'd ever get to do one.
not_available I'll start the cultures right away.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Who looks out for you, huh? I talked to Ivan Sheldon.
not_available Remember him? A night court judge from Evanston with a 6 handicap.
not_available He gave me the name of a good attorney.
not_available He defended the civil
not_available rights case against the Kallenback Meatpacking Company.
not_available You're discussing my legal problems with golfing buddies? Sheldon is a judge.
not_available I didn't ask you to save my ass, or whatever it is you're trying to do.
not_available I'm trying to be your friend, which is tougher to do these days.
not_available Mark, that environmental
not_available allergy woman is waiting.
not_available And why is that? You've been in a bad mood.
not_available I don't know how to talk to you.
not_available Then don't.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's the statute of limitations on posttraumatic stress? Cut him some slack.
not_available We've all cut him plenty.
not_available He needs some help.
not_available He needs friends who are supportive.
not_available He's not gonna have any friends if he keeps this up.
not_available Your guy is back from CT.
not_available The grand wizard.
not_available He's regained consciousness.
not_available Needs a scalp and shoulder suture.
not_available He'll be cross
not_available burning in no time.
not_available I hate to say it, but he's actually very polite.
not_available You're gonna need sutures.
not_available Now you're gonna make me look like Frankenstein's monster, huh? First your shoulder.
not_available Please lower your gown.
not_available Could the nurse do them? That little blond lady who was in here before? It's not her job.
not_available You'll have to settle for me.
not_available It's no offense.
not_available It's just Go ahead.
not_available I gotta hand it to you people.
not_available "You people"? Paramedics, nurses, physicians' assistants.
not_available A dumb ox like me gets a barbell dropped on his head and I get the best care on Earth.
not_available Well, we treat everybody here.
not_available Have you been saved, Miss? 
not_available Boulet.
not_available Do you walk with the Lord? What's that tattoo have to do with the Lord? I'm sorry you had to see it.
not_available That's why I asked for the nurse.
not_available It's a reminder of what I left behind.
not_available Intolerance, ignorance, hate.
not_available I was reborn through the love of Jesus Christ.
not_available I've built a new life.
not_available You don't believe that's possible, do you? Sure I do.
not_available We didn't finish our discussion.
not_available I think I heard everything I need to hear.
not_available But I haven't.
not_available Listen, Kerry, I'm surrounded by number
not_available crunchers all day long.
not_available When an intelligent and attractive woman walks in 
not_available I must ask her to lunch.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have to get back to work.
not_available I'll tell Chicago not to get sick for an hour.
not_available We'll go to the Oak Room, and I'll tell you my dirty management secrets.
not_available and the Japanese strain of staph is resistant to the most powerful antibiotics.
not_available Scary stuff.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available There are germs, doctor.
not_available You can put that away now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene is very sanitary.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll be the judge of that.
not_available Take off the mask.
not_available This is a charcoal
not_available filter mask.
not_available 20 percent of people get sicker in the hospital.
not_available I don't wanna become another statistic.
not_available You're complaining of fatigue, dry mouth, shortness of breath.
not_available Heart rate's 130.
not_available Resps 32.
not_available You've been here before for anxiety attacks.
not_available This is not an anxiety attack.
not_available I'm allergic to my apartment building.
not_available Why don't you move? 
not_available Is that your medical opinion, doctor? I have environmentally based allergies! Or you're looking for a little attention.
not_available Mark.
not_available Why don't you get a blood gas and call me with the results.
not_available I see Dr.
not_available Corday handed you off one nasty ileum.
not_available I'm just helping her out.
not_available I'm glad that you two have some camaraderie.
not_available It will come in handy with Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Excuse me? He's looking for another surgeon for his team and I recommended you.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available But
not_available Stapler.
not_available Thanks but what? I'm more interested in working with surgeons who challenge my skills 
not_available than dazzle me with technology.
not_available Technology is the new technique.
not_available And if you don't master it, somebody else will.
not_available When I saw how the flaws in the system trickled down and affected the daytoday operations of an ER 
not_available I knew I should be in management.
not_available Then you got your MBA.
not_available And then up the corporate ladder.
not_available Blah, blah, blah.
not_available I didn't kidnap you out of that conference to tell you my life story.
not_available I wanna find out more about you.
not_available Pick your brain a little bit.
not_available Grapevine says you're doing great things.
not_available I don't know about great.
not_available My spies tell me about your waste
not_available reduction program.
not_available Yeah, well, saving a syringe and some gauze is not the dent my bosses are looking for.
not_available Sounds serious.
not_available You wanna bend my ear? Maybe I can help.
not_available The board is convening at the end of the week.
not_available That's tomorrow.
not_available Don't remind me.
not_available They need to cut 10 percent of the budget.
not_available We're already to the bone.
not_available Are they making suggestions or handing you the ax? They figure I can chop 8 percent by firing half of the physicians' assistants.
not_available That's not a bad idea.
not_available On paper maybe.
not_available Not so great if you have to fire a friend.
not_available So this is about more than just the bottom line.
not_available Well, it's never easy letting people go, Kerry.
not_available But there are ways to make it less painful and sometimes less permanent.
not_available Shall we get some coffee? Sure.
not_available With what I have waiting for me, I'm in no rush to get back.
not_available Do you think people are capable of change? Starting their lives over? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I did.
not_available I used to have deadbeat jobs and go out with loser guys.
not_available Now look at me.
not_available Did the blood gas come up on that germ lady? Yeah.
not_available In Curtain 2.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, she seemed a little upset when she left.
not_available Wanted to get out of here.
not_available She left before the test results? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She made a quick call, sprayed the phone with disinfectant and walked out.
not_available She left AMA.
not_available Why would she do that? Maybe because Mark was rude, dismissive and patronizing.
not_available I'm sure that's not true.
not_available Not my job to be their best friend.
not_available No.
not_available Just their caregiver.
not_available What's all the brouha? Dr.
not_available Romano and Dr.
not_available Corday are doing an osteochondral allograft.
not_available Well, hot damn.
not_available That's our first ever here at County.
not_available Even Channel Five News is here covering it for the sci
not_available tech segment.
not_available See what I mean, Peter? The future is now.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Vincent Scarletti, 82, found in his bathroom.
not_available He was in full arrest.
not_available We shocked him twice got a rhythm and a pulse.
not_available How long between the time you found your husband and the paramedics arrived? What? 
not_available She's hard of hearing.
not_available How long was he unconscious? Oh, I don't know.
not_available Ten minutes, 15 maybe.
not_available He was here two weeks ago.

not_available Those can slog on.
not_available You got something juicy? Yeah.
not_available Hernia repair.
not_available Mine's a hot appendix.
not_available They can't all be newsworthy, eh? Unlike your osteochondral allograft this afternoon, huh? You intentionally sidelined me for that.
not_available What? Handing me off to Anspaugh so you could be with Romano.
not_available That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.
not_available He called me in to consult.
not_available Not the other way around.
not_available If you say so.
not_available No.
not_available It's not just what I say.
not_available That's the way it was.
not_available When did Anspaugh start the Triple
not_available A? An hour ago.
not_available My patient's prepped.
not_available I hate to get backed up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You are busy today.
not_available Anspaugh wouldn't mind if I just started, would he? It's painting by numbers.
not_available I haven't seen him mind yet.
not_available So you're okay finding another ride? 
not_available I can still take you home.
not_available No problem.
not_available I just totally spaced it.
not_available I agreed to have dinner with my grandmother tonight.
not_available So this is just an appetizer? Well, her cooking's not exactly
not_available Carter, Anna, over here! Help me.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Hang on.
not_available I'm taking this off.
not_available No! It's for my allergies.
not_available I told the other doctor! 
not_available What other doctor? Let's get a gurney.
not_available Is that Mr.
not_available Scarletti? 
not_available Yup.
not_available Advanced lung cancer.
not_available Did you pull his records? He was in two weeks ago.
not_available They told him the cancer's inoperable.
not_available He never told his wife.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available What's her name? Margaret Scarletti.
not_available Do you want me to go talk to her? I'll do it.
not_available Mark, I apologize for being late.
not_available I had lunch with a rep from Synergix.
not_available He had interesting ideas.
not_available We're slammed hereThat crackhead in 3 is screaming
not_available Wait.
not_available I'd like to discuss the staffing situation since it affects us both.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Write it down in a memo.
not_available This woman collapsed outside.
not_available She said she saw you.
not_available Probably anaphylactic shock.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available The back pain wants more Demerol.
not_available In a minute.
not_available Can you sign off on this for me? 
not_available No.
not_available We could use the beds.
not_available What should I do about the back pain? 
not_available Ask Doyle.
not_available It's the hospital's insurance attorney.
not_available Take a message.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Scarletti, could you come with me? 
not_available My husband, will he be okay? Will he live? How is he? I don't think we should discuss this here.
not_available What did you say? Will he live? 
not_available We need to find a place to talk.
not_available I'm worried about Vincenzo.
not_available Please, can I go see him? No.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Not now.
not_available I just wanna see him.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Scarletti your husband has no chance for a meaningful recovery.
not_available He'll recover okay? Oh, thank you
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I said, your husband has no chance for a meaningful recovery.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What are you saying? I'm saying that your husband lied to you about his condition! He's going to die! Jeanie, can you explain it to her? Mark, come on.
not_available Let's talk for a second.
not_available Come here.
not_available Shouldn't somebody go after him? Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Heard you were elbowdeep in a rather dicey Triple
not_available A.
not_available I heard you were doing the appy.
not_available All finished.
not_available Twenty minutes and done.
not_available You operated without an Attending present? Just an appendicectomy.
not_available There weren't complications.
not_available The complication is that you disregarded hospital policy.
not_available With something as basic as this, I assumed there was leeway.
not_available You've been here several months.
not_available Have you seen any surgery performed without an Attending? No.
not_available I apologize.
not_available In Britain we do minor surgery without supervision.
not_available I was led to believe the same standards applied here.
not_available By whom? I was mistaken.
not_available That's all.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available Is it true he just walked out? 
not_available Cynthia hot on his heels.
not_available He seemed like such a sensitive guy.
not_available He is.
not_available Doesn't everybody have some work to do? Can't do anything until he does something for himself.
not_available I'm not gonna make it home to change.
not_available Big plans? I'm asking this foundation for a lot of money.
not_available I don't have anything to wear.
not_available I have a jacket you can borrow.
not_available It's from Goodwill, but it's decent.
not_available Thanks, that'd be great.
not_available Sure.
not_available From what Carter says, his grandma's tough.
not_available Carter, meaning John Carter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's called the Carter Family Foundation but she holds the purse strings with an iron claw.
not_available The Carter Family Foundation? 
not_available Yeah, they're loaded.
not_available Carter's real blue blood.
not_available It's this whole Upstairs, Downstairs thing.
not_available It might help you to take a doctor along with you to make your case.
not_available I wrote some Pedes clinic grants at CHOP.
not_available You sure? 
not_available I'd love to come along.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's like I can't breathe.
not_available It's like something inside of my head pushing, trying to get out.
not_available And I Every time I think I have things under control, it just goes south.
not_available I'm babbling.
not_available If you don't wanna talk about it
not_available A few months ago, I was attacked in the men's room in the ER by this gangbanger who blames me for his brother dying of a gunshot wound.
not_available Oh, my God! That's the creep who's suing you? They settled the malpractice suit for three million dollars.
not_available And now the bastard's suing me for violating his brother's civil rights.
not_available I mean, figure that one out.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available He attacked me from behind.
not_available I tried to fight back, but IHe could've had a gun or been on drugs or
not_available I didn't even think about that.
not_available My adrenaline was pumping so hard.
not_available You're right.
not_available People on PCP, they He could've killed you.
not_available Mark you're so used to handling everyone else's problems that you're not used to asking for help.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available Hi.
not_available These horse pills are the hardest to swallow.
not_available We should talk.
not_available I know, today's been insane.
not_available Heard from Mark? I've talked to Dr.
not_available Anspaugh about the ER budget.
not_available He's very concerned about our deficit.
not_available The overages can be contained with structural changes if we pursue industrial contracts
not_available Kerry, wait.
not_available What are you saying? I have to lay off some of the staff including two PAs.
not_available The fairest way to do that is to give preference to those with seniority.
not_available Are you firing me? Jeanie, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't have a choice.
not_available You were the last one hired.
not_available You can work to the end of the month.
not_available COBRA insurance will cover your meds.
not_available I've talked to Physical Therapy.
not_available They'll have an opening in the next few months.
not_available Except it pays about a third less than here.
not_available I want this to be short
not_available term.
not_available We're pursuing contracts.
not_available When the new system is up, I want you back.
not_available So I'm supposed to wait by the phone? Jeanie, you know I value you professionally and as a friend.
not_available And I'm going to try to work this out.
not_available No, please don't go to any more trouble.
not_available Do I look okay? You look great.
not_available Miss Hathaway and? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available Anna.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Carter will be a few moments.
not_available But she insists you have a cocktail.
not_available What may I bring you? 
not_available Spring water would be fine.
not_available Yes.
not_available And you, ma'am? What kind of beer do you have? Heineken, Grolsch, Amstel Light
not_available Just make that another spring water.
not_available Certainly.
not_available Will you follow me to the music room? Please.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available That's Mr.
not_available Carter in 1985.
not_available He and Marigold took home blue ribbons at Tempel Farms that year.
not_available Marigold? His thoroughbred.
not_available Please, make yourself comfortable.
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available Did you find the place okay? Hey, Carter.
not_available Nice place you have here.
not_available ER.
not_available Any word from Mark? No, but everybody else keeps calling.
not_available ER.
not_available Could you sign off on this? 
not_available Mark never got to it.
not_available Some day, huh? Yeah.
not_available Some day.
not_available This is a horrible job.
not_available When is that temp clerk coming? 
not_available ER.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I am out of here.
not_available Oh, Doug.
not_available It's for you.
not_available Tell them I already left.
not_available It's long
not_available distance, collect.
not_available Hello.
not_available This is Doug Ross.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available When? Okay.
not_available Are you sure? Is it
not_available ? Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Could you? Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is everything okay? 
not_available Everything is fine.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, I've seen it.
not_available I've seen what she's talking about.
not_available An ER is about emergent cases.
not_available It's about speed.
not_available Patients that need continuity of care tend to fall through the cracks.
not_available I had a diabetic
not_available I'm sure your diabetic is fascinating.
not_available But I'd like to speak to the lady.
not_available Sure, of course.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Alone.
not_available Right.
not_available Me too? 
not_available Give her a tour of the grounds.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, I'm changing.
not_available Shedding your skin, Dr.
not_available Snake? 
not_available I beg your pardon.
not_available You knew I wasn't permitted to perform that appy.
not_available But you let me walk right in there anyway.
not_available Like you knew I should have been notified this morning, right? You were home.
not_available Hicks wanted to go.
not_available Somebody needed to step in.
not_available Like you needed someone to step into the ischemic bowel so you'd be with Romano.
not_available How dare you accuse me of manipulation! I deserve better than that! Besides, if I had really wanted to you wouldn't even have been aware of it.
not_available All right.
not_available I suppose I could've called you.
not_available But with your being at home and my
not_available You are not the only one who likes to cut.
not_available But if I'm the only one here, then I won't be ashamed of doing it.
not_available Then I'll make sure you're not in that position again.
not_available Why, thank you, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I was wondering if you were still looking for an extra set of hands.
not_available Would those be Benton hands? Yes.
not_available You're thinking you like the looks of the 21 st century, is that it? He simply wants to keep an eye on me.
not_available Don't you, Dr.
not_available Benton? Someone needs to.
not_available I'll give it some thought.
not_available We'll talk more.
not_available You remember Weebles? Those little egg
not_available looking things? "Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down"? Gamma used to hate it.
not_available I'd take the Fabergé eggs, and I'd put them with my Weeble family as pets.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I should've said something.
not_available But you were so anti
not_available rich people.
not_available I'm even more anti
not_available liars.
not_available I wanted you to get to know me first.
not_available Okay.
not_available And meanwhile, I take you to my favorite thrift store give you a tour of Roach Manor this morning and you must have been laughing your head off.
not_available Not at all.
not_available I love that stuff.
not_available A little slumming, is that it? Before you knew all this, you saw me for what I am, a regular guy.
not_available "A regular guy" doesn't patronize people.
not_available You made me look like an idiot.
not_available Anna, I'm sorry.
not_available Forget it, Carter.
not_available So that's it? My family has a few bucks and everything changes? A few bucks? That's what it is to you? 
not_available It's a figure of speech.
not_available That's exactly what I'm talking about.
not_available To you, this is all a figure of speech.
not_available To me I'm just gonna go wait outside until Carol gets done.
not_available Mark? It's Doug.
not_available Hi.
not_available Cynthia, I'm looking for Mark.
not_available He might be asleep.
not_available But I'll check.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Come on in.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available What's going on? Might be a bad time.
not_available Yeah, yeah, kind of.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available We're all a little worried about you.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be taking a few days off.
not_available I got a call from California.
not_available My dad died.
not_available What? What happened? It was a car wreck or something.
not_available They weren't clear on the details.
not_available But I gotta go claim the body and stuff like that.
not_available So I'm sorry.
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available No.
not_available Come on in.
not_available That's okay.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Come on in.
not_available I'll make some coffee.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right.
not_available I looked him dead in the eye, and I said "That might fly with your Hollywood chippies, Mr.
not_available President but I am a lady.
not_available " What did he do? He took his hand off my rear and apologized.
not_available And that was it? Then I slept with him.
not_available May I freshen you up? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I have to drive.
not_available And it's getting late.
not_available Time for the fat lady to sing.
not_available I like you, Carol.
not_available You remind me of me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I think you might just possess the extreme bullheaded stubbornness to make this clinic thing work.
not_available How would you like some seed money to start you off? $75,000? You haven't even read my proposal.
not_available It's my foundation.
not_available Just don't tell my grandson.
not_available I have a stern, unapproachable image to keep up.
not_available Well, then, this meeting was hell from beginning to end.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Good, good.
not_available You're not too late.
not_available I wanted to get the celebration rolling.
not_available Celebration? I got a supersaver ticket to Atlanta.
not_available Tommy's introducing me to some people.
not_available And his sisterin
not_available law is a realtor.
not_available So you had a good day.
not_available No.
not_available Not just me.
not_available Tommy knows some doctors at the county hospital.
not_available Sounds too good to be true.
not_available We can make this happen.
not_available We can make this work.
not_available Hey what's wrong? Hi, Kerry.
not_available Ellis.
not_available I know this is strange.
not_available We just met and here I am calling you up to come have a drink.
not_available I hope you don't misunderstand.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available You saved me from having to watch the local news.
not_available I don't usually do this kind of thing.
not_available Sure.
not_available That's what they all say.
not_available What's on your mind? I had to lay off a pretty close friend this afternoon and she didn't appreciate my suggestions for getting through this.
not_available She just felt fired.
not_available Which is exactly what she was.
not_available That's right.
not_available When you try to get her job back, she won't appreciate that, either.
not_available Welcome to the wonderful world of management.
not_available Get you another drink? That'd be great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I wish you'd wait and leave tomorrow.
not_available I just want to get on with it.
not_available Let me take you to the airport.
not_available I'll just leave it in Parking.
not_available Pick Mark up too.
not_available I'm glad he's going with you.
not_available It's a good idea for him to get out of town for a while.
not_available I'm gonna miss you.
not_available I love you, Carol.
not_available I love you too.
