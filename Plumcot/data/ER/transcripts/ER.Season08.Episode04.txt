
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available Preciously on E.R.
not_available Marfan's is difficult to detect.
not_available Residents had never heard
not_available Which is why we have Attendings.
not_available You had the right information.
not_available You didn't bother to look at it.
not_available We paged you three times! You can't get rid of him just because you don't get along.
not_available They say you're not a real doctor until you've killed a few patients.
not_available You don't know a damn thing about me.
not_available I know you're fired.
not_available You're a sad, cold
not_available hearted bitch! Luka and I broke up a few days ago.
not_available Abby, I'm sorry if I hurt you.
not_available You didn't hurt me.
not_available It's gonna be a pain to loose Susan Willis.
not_available It's a big mistake for her.
not_available Bye! E.R.
not_available 8x04 "NEVER SAY NEVER" There you are.
not_available Change, lady? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Look out! Sorry.
not_available His buddies said he just passed out.
not_available There's rigor mortis and lividity.
not_available It was a crowded scene.
not_available It was easier to grab him.
not_available It's gonna be harder to dump him.
not_available Come on, doc.
not_available No.
not_available Look, I'm not tying up a room with a dead body.
not_available Take him to the morgue.
not_available You've got a morgue.
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available Load him up.
not_available We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
not_available This is a county hospital.
not_available Let me know when you start paying taxes and wearing clothes.
not_available This should be enough Elimite for everyone.
not_available Wash your bedding in hot water.
not_available And the dog too? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Why not? Make a follow
not_available up with your regular health care provider.
not_available This is our regular health care provider.
not_available Right.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm looking for Mark Greene.
not_available Talk to the clerk.
not_available Dude, it only takes, like, two minutes to freeze a wart off.
not_available Actually, less.
not_available But you still have to wait like everybody else.
not_available Hi, I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Fill this out and take a seat over there.
not_available I'm not a patient.
not_available We're having lunch.
not_available Chairs are that way.
not_available Okay.
not_available You'll tell him I'm here? 
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available You might wanna know my name.
not_available County General.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available My fault.
not_available Can you help me? I'm looking for Mark Greene.
not_available Yosh, labs back on the gallbladder on Exam 1? 
not_available Check the computer.
not_available He's a friend.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Have you still not forgiven me? 
not_available My angelfish died.
not_available I'll buy you another one.
not_available There were two.

not_available Can you help? I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Greene.

not_available Lewis! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Yes, hi.
not_available Ralph.
not_available Ralph? Ralph Binks.
not_available Six years ago, I was tapping the electrical main downstairs took 20 amps in the ass.
not_available You treated me, said I was gonna be just fine.
not_available Right.
not_available Right.
not_available Well, I wasn't.
not_available My life has been a living hell of static cling since then! So thanks, doc.
not_available Thanks for nothing.
not_available Bet I know what you came here for.
not_available Is that it? So she just got on a plane? Sent for the twins the next day, haven't seen her since.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac doesn't know what happened.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available A tall, hunky guy, dark hair.
not_available You can't miss him.
not_available And you don't want to.
not_available Can someone move Mr.
not_available Schnack before we have to hold the wake ourselves? She's still here? 
not_available Worse.
not_available She's in charge.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Ladies, we have patients breaking the eight
not_available hour mark.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't be a stranger.
not_available I won't.
not_available Susan? Hey, Kerry.
not_available What a surprise.
not_available Are you here for the ACEP assembly? No, I'm here on some interviews.
not_available In Chicago? 
not_available I'm meeting Mark for lunch.
not_available He's in with a bad GSW.
not_available Yeah, I finally got someone to talk to me.
not_available Where have you gone to? 
not_available What? Hospitals.
not_available Rush, Northwestern, a couple of privates.
not_available Looking for a staff position? 
not_available Well, good luck with that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nice to see you again.
not_available You too.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Sort of.
not_available You mind? I work here.
not_available Chest cavity's filled with clot.
not_available Sats are down to 60.
not_available Lap pad.
not_available Who's that? It's Susan Lewis.
not_available Your friend from Scottsdale? 
not_available Phoenix.
not_available Says Scottsdale on the phone bill.
not_available Metzenbaum scissors.
not_available She looks great, doesn't she? Pericardium's tense with blood.
not_available What's she doing here? 
not_available We're supposed to have lunch.
not_available There's a big bleeder underneath.
not_available You didn't say anything about lunch.
not_available I didn't? No.
not_available Can you feel the defect? I can't put my finger on it.
not_available You're here for a reason, Mrs.
not_available McDuffy.
not_available It's Miss.
not_available Miss McDuffy.
not_available Let's start with I'm tired, I'm depressed, I can't concentrate.
not_available I've got headaches and hives.
not_available And I'm bloated and constipated.
not_available And it hurts here too.
not_available Any chest pain? 
not_available Oh, that's the worst of all.
not_available I see.
not_available That just about covers everything.
not_available Abby? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can we get CBC, Chem20, TSH, Free T4 troponin, CK with MB, lipase, EKG, chest xray, urine and a culture? That it? 
not_available I've got a yeast infection too.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Wanna see it? Maybe later.
not_available Be a sport.
not_available Do the pelvic.
not_available That might just put me over the edge.
not_available Into what? Celibacy? 
not_available Into taking it.
not_available You're not taking it.
not_available I am.
not_available You like it here.
not_available I don't have a job here.
not_available Weaver offered you shifts.
not_available I can do shift work anywhere.
not_available Northwestern.
not_available There's a tenured track, clinical faculty position.
not_available You wanna be a professor now? It's better job security.
not_available Like you're in it for the money? And my money says they have yeast infections at Northwestern.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available If you really wanted it you would've taken it.
not_available I have to tell them.
not_available They clocked it.
not_available Clocked what? 
not_available I have to let them know by Friday.
not_available Tomorrow's Friday.
not_available I know.
not_available John, can you take the hypochondriac with a spider bite? Asking me or are you telling me? 
not_available Whatever gets you to do it.
not_available I told the creep all we had was traveler's checks.
not_available Wouldn't do him any good.
not_available Pretty brazen for a mugger to hit you in broad daylight.
not_available He didn't hit us.
not_available Stan tripped over a curb trying to get away.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available I'll have the nurse get you an ice pack.
not_available He doesn't need an MRl? 
not_available Not this time.
not_available Yesterday's positive list.
not_available Make sure Frank routes them correctly this time.
not_available Sure.
not_available Last week, the cafeteria ended up with our UTI sensitivities.
not_available Anything I should know about this meeting? What meeting? 
not_available With Romano.
not_available Risk Management called me, so I'm assuming it's about the Marfan's death.
not_available Has there been a wrongfuldeath suit filed? In
not_available house review is standard procedure in this kind of circumstance.
not_available It's not an M&amp;M.;
not_available These are lawyers, right? Their job is to protect you 
not_available and the hospital.
not_available And assess exposure.
not_available It's normal.
not_available Dave was fired.
not_available I just thought maybe
not_available Dr.
not_available Malucci's termination isn't reflective of anything.
not_available There were other concerns.
not_available Other issues involved.
not_available Am I in trouble here, Kerry? I found it in my slipper.
not_available I figured you'd need its antivenom.
not_available Actually, Chicago doesn't have any dangerous spiders.
not_available It doesn't? 
not_available Not native anyway.
not_available So this one hopped on a bus across the border.
not_available That bastard took a chunk out of my foot.
not_available It looks like a flea bite.
not_available A flea bite? I can feel the toxin 
not_available making its way to my heart.
not_available 1 % hydrocortisone cream Benadryl for the itching, and get yourself a flea bomb.
not_available That's it? 
not_available That's it.
not_available You've got this down.
not_available Why would you want to leave it? 
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Pardon, miss? What's your name again? 
not_available Abby.
not_available I'm Nicole.
not_available We met at the bar with Luka.
not_available I was your waitress.
not_available Right.
not_available What happened to your hand? I cut myself.
not_available Not bad, but I think it needs to be How do you say? Sutured? 
not_available Yeah, sutured.
not_available That man over there, he won't tell Luka I'm here.
not_available He's so rude.
not_available You want me to take a look at it? I was hoping Luka could look.
not_available Well, Dr.
not_available Carter's very good at suturing.
not_available Luka is not working today? 
not_available No, I think that he is.
not_available Isn't he, Abby? Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll get you a room.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, don't hurt him! What are you doing? 
not_available I'm letting him go.
not_available Why? You said he was innocent.
not_available Frank, I think I need Housekeeping in here.
not_available Funny, that's not how I remember you.
not_available Son of a bitch! That is.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis! What are you doing here? 
not_available Susan, Carter.
not_available Right.
not_available Susan, hey! 
not_available Hi.
not_available Would you believe I'm looking for work? In Chicago? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Never say never.
not_available Well, that's great.
not_available You look 
not_available different.
not_available Yeah? You look the same.
not_available Are you interviewing? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have a meeting at Northwestern.
not_available Northwestern? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Clinical faculty position? Yeah, why? 
not_available I was just offered that job.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available It's in the ER.
not_available I switched back to emergency medicine.
not_available Oh, when? 
not_available Forever ago.
not_available So you must be Chief Resident.
not_available No.
not_available That would be Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Deb Chen? It's Jing
not_available Mei now.
not_available Jing
not_available Mai now.
not_available Jing Frank, what is it? 
not_available I don't know what she calls herself.
not_available Yeah, so Hey.
not_available Robert.
not_available Hey, lurking around the men's room now? Changing teams again? You scheduled meetings with my Residents without telling me? Did you not get the memo? What memo? 
not_available The one saying I run the place.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen's my responsibility.
not_available I expect to be notified if she's to be questioned.
not_available Fair.
not_available Consider yourself notified.
not_available Good.
not_available I wanna be there.
not_available No.
not_available I don't even wanna be there.
not_available As chief of the department, I think it's appropriate.
not_available Don't interfere with Risk Management investigations.
not_available An investigation? 
not_available Information gathering, whatever.
not_available They have a few questions.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen approached me.
not_available She was scared.
not_available She wants me to come with her.
not_available She's a big girl.
not_available She talked about lawyers.
not_available Do you want it to escalate to that or you want me to come? Does she have something to hide? No.
not_available The truth is bad enough.
not_available We should be trying to protect her.
not_available You sure you don't have a thing for her? 
not_available Robert.
not_available Okay, fine, 
not_available Good femoral with compressions.
not_available Stop CPR.
not_available No pulse, no pressure.
not_available Your friend's back.
not_available What do you feel? 
not_available Probable entry wound, left ventricle.
not_available Feels ragged through the mitral valve.
not_available How big? 
not_available Too big.
not_available Nothing's organized on the monitor.
not_available He's gone.
not_available You wanna call it? 
not_available See if we can piece anything together.
not_available Okay, I'll be right back.
not_available 0 silk on a needle driver.
not_available Hey.
not_available Give me 10 minutes? 
not_available If there's still an express to Oak Park.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You look great.
not_available You look great too.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, we got a 6year
not_available old boy with vomiting and severe dehydration.
not_available Get Cleo.
not_available He's got a genetic disorder.
not_available Tachy at 120.
not_available BP's 90/60.
not_available You know what? I don't wanna be late.
not_available I'll just come back after my interview.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's great.
not_available Elizabeth, how are you doing? 
not_available Forget it.
not_available Go.
not_available Good to see things never change.
not_available Knock them dead.
not_available You too.
not_available How long's he been vomiting? 
not_available Three days.
not_available He's dry as a bone.
not_available And you waited till now to bring him in? His geneticist's at Mercy.
not_available Our insurance got messed up.
not_available They couldn't see us.
not_available Is he Down's? 
not_available No.
not_available Trisomy 18.
not_available I thought they didn't survive past age 1.
not_available They don't.
not_available He's special.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Belly's hard as a rock.
not_available Elizabeth, you better get in here! 
not_available Let's do a rectal temp.
not_available I can do that if you want.
not_available No, no.
not_available We'll let the nurse do it.
not_available She does it for him all the time.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Possible bowel obstruction.
not_available Sixyear
not_available old boy with Edwards syndrome.
not_available Six? I thought that was impossible.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available No luck with the IV.
not_available Prep a subclavian.
not_available It feels like a loop of bowel.
not_available I'll try to reduce.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's probably perfed.
not_available Surprised he doesn't have a fever.
not_available He will.
not_available Probably dead bowel in addition to the obstruction.
not_available Let's take him to O.R.
not_available He's vomiting.
not_available Let's roll him.
not_available Please.
not_available This has to stop.
not_available Once the line's in, we'll give Compazine.
not_available That's not what she's asking.
not_available Give him something for the pain.
not_available Titrate 6 of morphine.
not_available No, to end it.
not_available What? Please, just end it for him.
not_available I'll be upstairs.
not_available Have each Resident pick up at least two of the fast tracks when their sicker patients are tucked in.
not_available They don't listen to me.
not_available Make sure Mrs.
not_available Hertel 
not_available gets her gentamicin.
not_available Two per kilo? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you ready? What? 
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available Why? What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano assures me it's routine.
not_available Then why are you going? To represent the department, apparently.
not_available Haleh? 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei, no one is out to get anyone.
not_available You do this long enough, you make a serious mistake.
not_available It's true for everyone.
not_available That's encouraging.
not_available Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Schudy? He stopped vomiting? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We've given him morphine for the pain and antibiotics and fluids.
not_available You must think we're awful people.
not_available No.
not_available No, I think that when a child is this ill, emotions can escalate.
not_available And I don't think you really want what you asked for.
not_available No.
not_available No, of course we don't.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe we're both just too tired.
not_available Kenny needs roundthe
not_available clock care.
not_available I imagine he would.
not_available Just tell us what you need to do.
not_available Well, your son has an incarcerated inguinal hernia which we can repair.
not_available It's a simple procedure.
not_available But we will have to evaluate his internal organs.
not_available If he's been obstructed for a while, he may need a colostomy.
not_available How many has he had so far? 
not_available Four.
not_available Three laparotomies and a VSD repair.
not_available He's had more surgeries than birthdays.
not_available I was opening for lunch.
not_available The back gate gets stuck sometimes.
not_available It doesn't look deep enough to suture.
not_available Let's irrigate and give her some Keflex.
not_available My boss wanted me to finish my shift.
not_available He's such
not_available What do they say here? A capitalist? What did he want me to do, bleed on everybody's food? Good thing he let you off.
not_available You don't want it to get infected.
not_available He didn't let me.
not_available He fired me.
not_available After a year of working there seven nights a week.
not_available Abby, where's that irrigation kit? It's coming, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available What? I'll be right there.
not_available There might be a little scarring.
not_available Will you be able to find another job? I don't know.
not_available He kept saying he'd make problems with my visa.
not_available I think he can too.
not_available Is everything okay back there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Had you looked at the x
not_available ray would you have recognized the widened mediastinum? Yes, I think so.
not_available Well, how confident of that are you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Confident.
not_available Standard of care is to take a chest xray to rule out aortic dissection before ordering thrombolytics correct? 
not_available That's right.
not_available So why take one if you're not gonna look at it? Dr.
not_available Chen has already admitted to a critical error.
not_available No need to belabor the point.
not_available We're trying to understand what happened.
not_available The treating Resident told me the x
not_available ray was clear.
not_available He thought I meant hemothorax, I thought he meant signs of dissection.
not_available Dr.
not_available Malucci.
not_available He's been terminated since the incident.
not_available That helps, I suppose.
not_available In essence, the mistake was the result of a miscommunication during a time
not_available sensitive critical care situation.
not_available Except for the chainof
not_available command issue.
not_available What issue? How did you get involved in this case? Chief Residents or Attendings are called on to sign off on any use of thrombolytics.
not_available Chief Residents who are Attendings.
not_available I am an Attending.
not_available You are now, but at the time, you were five days from officially completing your Residency.
not_available My appointment started July 1.
not_available I was making up days from my maternity leave.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen was given the authority of an Attending while a Chief Resident.
not_available Prematurely.
not_available If she wasn't boardeligible, she wasn't officially authorized 
not_available to make this decision.
not_available I thought I was.
not_available Who was your Attending? What? Who was your Attending that night? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available We're talking five days.
not_available And where was Dr.
not_available Weaver? Excuse me.
not_available I'm sitting right here.
not_available You can ask me.
not_available You're here as a representative of the department.
not_available I'm interviewing Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available She was out of the hospital.
not_available I was right across the street.
not_available I was getting a meal with the understanding that Dr.
not_available Chen would page me for critical cases.
not_available And did you page her? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Before or after you authorized thrombolytics? 
not_available Before and after.
not_available I never received a page.
not_available Three times total.
not_available You could have come to get me.
not_available I didn't know where you were.
not_available Carter knew.
not_available He found me in time to stop you from cracking his chest.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, this is why I interview participants separately.
not_available The fact is, this is a systems error.
not_available The cafeteria isn't open at 2 a.
not_available m., so you need to leave the building to get a meal.
not_available You might consider brown
not_available bagging it next time.
not_available I'm done.
not_available All right.
not_available Well, this has been very enlightening.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available I'm sorry? 
not_available You're excused.
not_available Kerry, you stay.
not_available That's gotta be a record, Do you need something? They didn't pull you out of court, did they? Good.
not_available I thought you were taking a stool sample.
not_available I will, Miss McDuffy.
not_available But you have to go back and lie down.
not_available Because I have to go.
not_available I have a friend who's having trouble with her visa.
not_available I thought you could help her.
not_available Do you know anything? What? About my condition? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not until your labs come back.
not_available Work visa, French.
not_available Does my having bad B.O.
not_available mean anything? 
not_available That is possible.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll send her over.
not_available You have to lie down.
not_available Nicole.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I owe you.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available I thought she was going to protect me.
not_available She went to protect herself.
not_available What did you expect? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It never occurred to me that she had to protect her own ass.
not_available Maybe your asses aren't mutually exclusive.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's why she's still up there and I'm down here.
not_available Weaver's political, true.
not_available But she's smart enough to protect her own.
not_available I don't see it.
not_available What's it look like? What? 
not_available The spider.
not_available Nat, it's a big insect.
not_available Big, hairy.
not_available You're a reflection on her.
not_available You're her choice for Chief Resident.
not_available She'll defend you.
not_available If only to defend herself.
not_available How's your back? 
not_available Hurts like hell.
not_available 35yearold male, impaled 
not_available after a fall off a roof.
not_available How much blood loss? Not a lot.
not_available We packed around the wound and stabilized it.
not_available No KO.
not_available BP, 100/70.
not_available Don't touch me! 
not_available Hey.
not_available What was he doing? Wife said he was trying to get free cable.
not_available Where's my wife? Hi, baby.
not_available I can't believe you have to open him again.
not_available Want me to go over the procedure? 
not_available No.
not_available We know it by heart.
not_available Right.
not_available Then I just need you to sign the consent, then.
not_available It shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
not_available There's a waiting area just down the hall.
not_available Do you have a cafeteria? Yeah.
not_available Third floor.
not_available It's the only time my husband and I get to share a meal together when Kenny's in the hospital.
not_available I understand.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Any messages? Elsa Alcoran called, said she doesn't want the job.
not_available Did she say why? 
not_available No.
not_available No new nanny yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Not one that signs.
not_available Oh, yeah, right.
not_available That must be hard to find.
not_available You look tired.
not_available So do you.
not_available Parenting will do that to you.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Peter Benton.
not_available I got your message.
not_available I was hoping you would reconsider.
not_available If you could at least call me back, I would really appreciate it.
not_available Okay? Thank you very much.
not_available What do we got? 
not_available Fragments in the peritoneum.
not_available That's a hell of a fragment.
not_available BP's down to 70.
not_available Bolus 2 liters wide open.
not_available Central line kit.
not_available Take it out, it's killing him.
not_available We have to do it in O.R.
not_available He could bleed uncontrollably here.
not_available HemoCue is 10.
not_available You should take her outside.
not_available Two units O
not_available neg standing by.
not_available Can't you give him something? 
not_available We did.
not_available Melanie? 
not_available Full diaphragmatic rupture.
not_available Okay, let's red
not_available line him.
not_available Melanie! What? 
not_available I love you! No.
not_available No, shut up.
not_available You're not saying that.
not_available I do.
not_available Stop it.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available Where's the Oneg? 
not_available Waiting on Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Let's go! Let's move! You need some help? 
not_available No, no.
not_available I almost got it.
not_available Didn't she leave a guide wire in some poor schlub's chest? That was over six years ago.
not_available She was a medical student.
not_available But now there's a pattern.
not_available If we don't show we took corrective measures we could have real exposure if she kills anyone else.
not_available That's a little dramatic.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Can't get much more dramatic.
not_available There's no reason to think she'll kill anyone else.
not_available Can you guarantee that? 
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available And what happens the next time you take a 20
not_available minute break off campus? How much does the technicality in her status really factor in? You mean, can you end the blood trail with Chen? I wanna know what kind of support to expect.
not_available For you or the department? 
not_available For me.
not_available Well, I won't tell you what to do, it's your ER but I expect the family's gonna want accountability beyond Dr.

not_available Was this a suicide attempt? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, your niece called.
not_available Her car broke down.
not_available She can't pick up your son.
not_available It has to be an accident.
not_available Mr.

not_available What happened? 
not_available Don't stand there.
not_available Bag him.
not_available You want to tube him instead? 
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available I need to clamp the aorta.
not_available Here? The O.R.'s 20 feet away.
not_available We'll never make it.
not_available 10 blade! BP's 40 and dropping.
not_available Scissors and a rib spreader.
not_available We don't have them in Pre
not_available Op.
not_available I gotta go to O.R.
not_available and get a tray.
not_available Forget it! Help me pull this apart.
not_available What? 
not_available Just do it! Here we go.
not_available Got it.
not_available Let's get him in the O.R.

not_available Yes.
not_available I don't have time to listen to music anymore except at work.
not_available Up on the Bovie.
not_available Kids will do that to you.
not_available God, have you ever seen this many adhesions? Is it part of the disease? 
not_available That and heart defects mental retardation, multiple gut problems.
not_available Move to the right, Lizzie.
not_available What? Your hands.
not_available They're blocking his shot.
not_available Make sure you get the cecum.
not_available Robert, I'm in the middle of surgery! No, you're in the middle of an historic case.
not_available 6year
not_available old Trisomy 18.
not_available Has to be some kind of record.
not_available Hey, I said, stop it! We need closeups of the palmar creases and rocker
not_available bottom feet.
not_available I hope you have permission to do this.
not_available This is a teaching hospital.
not_available It's in the interest of science.
not_available For God's sake! Shirley, suction.
not_available How these parents can keep this kid alive in good conscience is beyond me.
not_available Get a shot of that! 
not_available Fistula end's nice and pink.

not_available I'm not gonna make it in time.
not_available I'm stuck in surgery.
not_available Jackie, if you 're there, pick up! Jackie! Check the ostomy output, cue six hours and change the dressing.
not_available You've got it, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available How did it go? 
not_available As well as it could, I suppose.
not_available Where are they? Who? 
not_available His parents.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't think they've been back since he went in.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available They never checked in with me.
not_available They can't still be eating.
not_available So you're not gonna take it? 
not_available Mark, he asked me out.
not_available Consider it a bonus.
not_available In the middle of the meeting.
not_available Was he good
not_available looking? He spits when he talks.
not_available So a little saliva's gonna hold you back? No big deal.
not_available I have three more interviews.
not_available Well, you can stop and come back here.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available No.
not_available We're looking for an Attending.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Seriously.
not_available You saw what it was like down there this morning.
not_available Weaver didn't mention anything.
not_available That surprise you? Thought it was cooler than a tattoo.
not_available You could have at least called me, you know.
not_available And say what? "Hey, how's it going? By the way, I have a brain tumor.
not_available " Or written a letter.
not_available Oh, like the one you wrote me telling me that you were engaged? It wasn't an engagement.
not_available And it's over.
not_available Is that why you're moving back? Or did you collapse from heat exhaustion? Well, after Chloe moved, there wasn't much reason to stay.
not_available I can't follow my sister's family around forever.
not_available And I'm not exactly Desert Girl.
not_available I just missed it here, you know? The city, the weather you.
not_available Hey, Mark have you seen the Schudys in here? Who? 
not_available The parents of the Trisomy boy.

not_available Combination stellate lac with elements of crush injury.
not_available I'd start pressors if there was something to press.

not_available Your son's upset.

not_available Let the doctors see your head.
not_available It hurts! 
not_available I know.
not_available We're gonna make it feel better.
not_available No! John, we're gonna give you a shot so your head will stop hurting.
not_available My name's John Thomas, and I don't want a shot! 
not_available Daddy told you not to climb on his boat.
not_available I wasn't climbing! 
not_available It's just gonna be a small pinch.
not_available I don't want a small pinch! 
not_available Stop crying and we'll go to McDonald's.
not_available I wanna go to Toys 'R' Us! 
not_available McDonald's.
not_available Toys 'R' Us! Hold still.
not_available Almost finished.
not_available Stop it or I'll tell Daddy you were climbing on his boat.
not_available I'll tell Grandma you were playing with Daddy's penis! 
not_available I think he's going to Toys 'R' Us.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available What? 
not_available I haven't seen you smile for a while.
not_available I forgot how pretty you were.

not_available I guess.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Find the big hairy spider on the loose.
not_available What? Cleo, have you seen Kenny Schudy's parents? Not since you sent him up to O.R.
not_available I can't find them.
not_available Did you try the chapel? Yes.
not_available And the bathroom and the snack areas.
not_available Maybe they went home.
not_available I don't know where home is.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available Be like you never left.
not_available Elizabeth, tell Susan what a great place this is to work.
not_available Haven't the time.
not_available Either she doesn't like me 
not_available or she's mad at you.
not_available No, she's just focused.
not_available Right.
not_available Have you eaten yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Let me buy you lunch.
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available I want you to know I went on record against this, but the administrationAm I being fired, Kerry? 
not_available No.
not_available No, no, of course not.
not_available You're on a year's probation and subject to a month's suspension without pay.
not_available I argued your case to the best of my ability.
not_available But Risk Management feels that given your history they needed to take corrective measures 
not_available to mitigate any further incidents.
not_available My history? The guide wire.
not_available God! You're gonna use that? You'll also have to resign your Chief Residency.
not_available What? I understand how upsetting this must
not_available What about you? Are you going to resign anything? My involvement, or lack thereof, is not at issue.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available You made sure of that.
not_available Look, this is only a temporary setback, after which you'll be back on track.
not_available Were you even wearing your pager that night? This isn't about me.
not_available Someone obviously misdialed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just blame everyone but yourself, Kerry.
not_available Look, I'm sorry that this had to happen.
not_available You are not sorry.
not_available Just relieved.
not_available JingMei, I
not_available Go to hell, Kerry.
not_available I quit.
not_available She wasn't terminated.
not_available She resigned.
not_available You needed to demote her? Risk Management thought there might be some liability issues involved.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available I bet.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available This is a teaching hospital.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And she was the one who was doing the teaching.
not_available Jeez, Kerry.
not_available Who are you cutting loose next? Look, I'm gonna miss her too.
not_available This saddens me too.
not_available It's easy for you to be upset and angry when you don't manage the situation.
not_available But guess what.
not_available I'm angry and upset, okay? I mean, I think it sucks.
not_available Only, I don't have anyone to complain to.
not_available You're asking me to feel sorry for you now? No.
not_available I just wanted you to know what was going on.
not_available Hopefully, this will be the last personnel change for a while.
not_available I wanna hire Susan.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you have a problem with that bring it up at the next staff meeting.
not_available We need doctors, Kerry.
not_available Mom and Dad stayed just long enough to give consent? It doesn't mean anything.
not_available The entire document is a lie.
not_available Fake phone numbers, phony addresses.
not_available I'm not even sure his real name is Kenny.
not_available God knows he can't tell us.
not_available $20,000 later and only his parents have any quality of life.
not_available Probably in the Bahamas by now.
not_available He requires an enormous amount of care.
not_available Obviously, it became more than they could handle after six years.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Boo
not_available hoo.
not_available Robert it had to be extremely draining on them physically, emotionally.
not_available You wanna be a parent? Shut up and do your job.
not_available Nice workout, Peter.
not_available Flogging a dead guy for an hour.
not_available Probably burned 1000 calories.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Warshaw.
not_available He lost his job six months ago.
not_available He said it was the worst that could happen to us.
not_available He lied.
not_available Your husband came in with severe injuries.
not_available We tried everything we could to save him, but he died.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available He never told me why he wanted cable so bad.
not_available We don't need cable.
not_available Any way to stop it from happening again? Get her to stop picking her nose.
not_available Honey.
not_available Did you order a beta on Karen McDuffy? The hairy woman? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available It's the only thing I didn't order.
not_available You should have.
not_available She's pregnant.
not_available What? Yep.
not_available I guess there really is someone for everyone.
not_available Hi, Abby.
not_available Is Luka still here? 
not_available No.
not_available I think he went home.
not_available Oh, that smells good.
not_available What is that? Chocolate chip cookies with a little oatmeal.
not_available I made them to thank him.
not_available He got his immigration lawyer to help me.
not_available That Luka.
not_available What a great guy.
not_available Do you want one? No.
not_available They're Luka's.
not_available I would never touch Luka's cookies.
not_available No, please.
not_available Have one.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available I've made plenty.
not_available Is he working tomorrow? I don't know.
not_available Is Luka working tomorrow? I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Can you make sure he gets them? 
not_available Sure.
not_available You better put these in your locker.
not_available These are good.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe the best I've ever tasted.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available I appreciate it, Abby.
not_available Anytime.
not_available Carter? 
not_available I need to speak with you.
not_available What is it? Privately.
not_available Is something wrong? There's not enough time for a nomination process and, practically speaking it'd be better to have someone who's familiar with both staff and procedure.
not_available You lost me.
not_available If you want the Chief Residency it's yours.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen resigned.
not_available Are you sure? I just talked to her.
not_available Twenty minutes ago.
not_available Is she serious? I don't assume it's something that she'd do lightly.
not_available She resigned the Chief Residency or altogether? 
not_available Altogether.
not_available What happened? Well, it's unfortunate.
not_available I can't talk to you about it.
not_available But it has to do with the Marfan syndrome death? I can't talk about it.
not_available But I want you to know that your circumstance aside I should've chosen you for the Chief Resident in the first place.
not_available The truth is, you've handled yourself and your recovery with grace and confidence.
not_available And I appreciate your professionalism.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So I assume it's a yes? Can I have some time to think about it? Well, sure.
not_available Find me in the morning.
not_available Get Housekeeping to clean that up.
not_available You call me for something important, but don't know where it is.
not_available I know where it is.
not_available It's just not there right now.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available Voilà.
not_available How come I have a feeling this could have waited till I finished unpacking? It's all about momentum.
not_available Open it up.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You saved this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, someone found it a couple years ago when they moved the laundry.
not_available I was gonna send it to you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Peeling paint, the frequent fliers.
not_available The lousy pay.
not_available You know you want it.
not_available This is very sweet.
not_available But you're not winning me over.
not_available I already told Kerry it's a done deal so if you pull out now, it'd make me look really stupid.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available I signed you up for Tuesday.
not_available It's mildewy.
not_available I'll dry
not_available clean it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available We played, had some spaghetti.
not_available Conked out about half an hour ago.
not_available Listen, Roger, I really appreciate this.
not_available No problem.
not_available It's nice.
not_available I miss him.
not_available So how are you doing? 
not_available You know, I miss Carla too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You want me to get him? 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I got it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Reece.
not_available Listen.
not_available Time to go home.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's late.
not_available No.
not_available We can't.
not_available We must go home.
not_available Reece, come on.
not_available He's half
not_available asleep, Peter.
not_available You should let him stay the night.
not_available I don't wanna bother you.
not_available It's no bother.
not_available Bye.
not_available I can drop him off in the morning.
not_available No, no.
not_available I'll come by.
not_available What time? 
not_available Nine.
not_available Sure.
not_available All right.
not_available I always knew she was capable of stuff like this.
not_available I guess I fooled myself into thinking that she wouldn't do it to me.
not_available Has she offered you the job yet? 
not_available I'm not sure that I want it.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available You've always wanted it.
not_available I'll pass if it means you'll stay.
not_available You should take it.
not_available I don't wanna be here anymore.
not_available Really.
not_available If it's not you, it'll be somebody else.
not_available And I'd rather it be you.
not_available You gonna try and stay in Chicago? I don't know.
not_available There's still a spot open at Northwestern.
not_available Promise me, John, that whatever sacrifice you make for this place you just make sure it's worth it.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Vodka, please.
not_available On the rocks? Neat.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Another round? 
not_available Yeah, four on the ice.
