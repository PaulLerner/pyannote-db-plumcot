not_available They're struggling right now.
not_available You're defending spousal abuse.
not_available I don't think that's what happened.
not_available The guy's an alcoholic.
not_available Yeah, well, so am I.
not_available I already reported it.
not_available The cops are on their way.
not_available Lucy Mothley criked for upper airway obstruction.
not_available What happened? I was doing a stand
not_available up in a middle school lunch room and she started choking.
not_available I know you probably think that I wanted to move in here because of this.
not_available You told me that you wanted to be closer to school.
not_available I did, and I thought maybe we could be brothers like we talked about last year.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh.
not_available So you, uh just didn't need a little bit more privacy than living with the family could get you, huh? It's not like that.
not_available You lied to me, and I'm not cool with that.
not_available I didn't lie.
not_available I'm not cool with it.
not_available So what, Greg? What, if I hadda told you the truth? Then you would have been cool with it? You think this is easy for me? It's not like this has been going on a long time.
not_available It's just, just something that happened.
not_available I don't know, man.
not_available It's like a phase or something.
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Mig of atropine.
not_available Where you been? 
not_available I was helping Dr.
not_available Pratt with something.
not_available Sorry Lost the pulse.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available I can do that.
not_available Call Kovac.
not_available Amp of epi.
not_available It's hard to bag.
not_available There's a lot of resistance.
not_available What's the rhythm? He's absent breath sounds on the left.
not_available Could have had a small pneumo that converted to tension with intubation.
not_available There's still no pulse.
not_available Looks like V
not_available fib.
not_available Charge of 360.
not_available The rabies can damage the conduction system of the heart.
not_available Charged.
not_available Clear! 
not_available No change.
not_available The virus is too advanced.
not_available Hundred of Lidocaine.
not_available I don't think he's going to make it.
not_available Hundred of Lidocaine.
not_available Paulie.
not_available Teller! Clear.
not_available Hey, wait! Come on, let's go! Stop it! Please! Let us help you! You both need medicine so you don't get sick like Paulie! I thought you were going to save him! It's not her, Teller.
not_available She's just a doctor.
not_available Tell him you're not the Blue Lady.
not_available Please! You could have what Paulie has! Please! Neela! We need you inside! We got him back! What? 
not_available The rabies kid.
not_available He's got a rhythm, a pulse and a BP.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available Tony put the pulse ox on his finger and the kid grabbed his hand.
not_available It's, it's like a miracle! Come on! Hey.
not_available You're still here.
not_available Oh, I wanted to make sure that she was okay, and I got permission from her parents to air what happened.
not_available Why? 
not_available Are you kidding me? If a male doctor pulled that off on TV, he'd have his own syndication deal.
not_available Yeah, well.
not_available No, seriously, Kerry.
not_available That was, that was pretty incredible.
not_available I'm, I'm still buzzing.
not_available How do you come down from something like that? Uh a glass of wine and a hot bath at the end of the day help.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Sounds good to me.
not_available All right.
not_available Ketamine is at two per kilo per hour.
not_available He's got spontaneous eye
not_available opening.
not_available That's a good sign, but we need to deepen his coma.
not_available Let's double up on the midazolam drip and I'll check back later.
not_available Boy, he's got goosebumps.
not_available I'll go get a warming blanket.
not_available He's putting up a fight.
not_available He still has a long way to go.
not_available Hope's right.
not_available It's a miracle he's alive.
not_available Maybe you are the Blue Lady after all.
not_available I mean, if I was those kids, I'd sure as hell want to believe that.
not_available If you believe in something hard enough What? Well I've talked myself into things that weren't true plenty of times.
not_available What sort of things? I don't know.
not_available Like, uh stuff about myself, my job, people in my life.
not_available Everything seems to be a lot clearer now, though.
not_available I have something to do.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow? 
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available You never told me what your secret name was.
not_available You're the one that gave it to me.
not_available Mayday? Well, Teller must have overheard you.
not_available You never told me what it means.
not_available She doesn't want to press charges, but the fact is he hit her.
not_available Can I talk to you for a sec? 
not_available Just a minute.
not_available That's still need to get a statement from the wife.
not_available That's fine.
not_available I'm going to Ike's to get some dinner.

not_available You okay, doc? What is it? It belongs to my son.
not_available It was sent to me here.
not_available See the initials? C.A.
not_available Curtis Ames.
not_available He was a patient of mine.
not_available I think he's trying to threaten us.
not_available Maybe he just wanted to return it.
not_available Look, he followed my wife and child to the park.
not_available I'd like you to go talk to him.
not_available Help me protect my family.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, well, give him four more ounces, and I'll be back in a half hour.
not_available All right, bye.
not_available Cell phones.
not_available How'd we ever survive without them? Sorry.
not_available That was my baby
not_available sitter.
not_available Aren't you a little old to need a babysitter? 
not_available It was for my baby.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, aren't you a little young to have one of those? Can I buy you a beer? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I never touch the stuff.
not_available So boy or girl? Boy.
not_available Uh, six months.
not_available Do you have kids? 
not_available Five.
not_available Five? Yep, a boy and girl of my own and three stepdaughters.
not_available Do you live in Chicago? 
not_available Texas.
not_available Texas? 
not_available Yep.
not_available You're a long way from home.
not_available Yep.
not_available What are you doing here? Well, I came up to see an old buddy of mine.
not_available In the hospital.
not_available But I walked into the lobby, I looked around, chickened out.
not_available Why? Well, you know, you know, I buried a few friends over the last couple of years.
not_available And hospitals make me queasy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, me, too.
not_available And I work in one.
not_available You're a nurse, huh? I used to be a nurse, but now I'm a doctor.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's so funny? 
not_available Ah, nothing.
not_available Why are you laughing? It's just, uh Well, the only doctors I ever met were white
not_available haired old guys with glasses and necks like turkeys.
not_available Well, I guess I've got that to look forward to.
not_available What do you do in Texas? 
not_available Oil.
not_available Tycoon? Don't I wish.
not_available No, I work the rigs
not_available machinist.
not_available Ever seen an oil fire? Seen one? Hell, I started one.
not_available Can we have our chips, please? What are you gonna eat in the movie? That's why we got licorice.
not_available Think fast, Horndog.
not_available Think fast.
not_available Good hands.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What do you think of this kid? 
not_available Seems okay.
not_available Kind of polite, quiet.
not_available Yeah, all the common traits of a serial killer.
not_available I can't believe she's gonna be dating soon.
not_available Listen, Meg, there's been something on my mind.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available Really? Yeah, I've been thinking about moving forward.
not_available I think Sarah's old enough to accept it now.
not_available In fact, I think it would make her happy.
not_available What would? Us making this permanent.
not_available We've danced around it long enough.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available Meg, I can't do this anymore.
not_available Us living together, but not really living together.
not_available Sleeping with each other when we need to.
not_available It's too easy, it's like a placeholder.
not_available I think it's stopping us from getting on with our lives.
not_available What are you talking about? This is our lives.
not_available I don't want it to be.
not_available We fell into this, Meg.
not_available I care about you and Sarah, but I have to do my own thing.
not_available What's her name? Come on, Meg.
not_available What? So you want to screw some other girl, it won't be the first time.
not_available They never last.
not_available It's more than that.
not_available You think you can keep what you want, and leave the rest? Be part of our lives, but not commit? 
not_available It doesn't work that way, Tony.
not_available I've committed fully for a long time, Meg, and you know that.
not_available We love you and you love us.
not_available I know you don't want to blow that.
not_available You know, Chicago winters can be pretty tough on asthma.
not_available You should get a flu shot.
not_available Nah, I hate needles.
not_available Just come by the E.R., I'll do it myself.
not_available I promise I'll be gentle.
not_available Luka, this is? 
not_available Eddie.
not_available Eddie.
not_available You the husband? 
not_available We're not married.
not_available Gotcha.
not_available You ready to go? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, Eddie, it was nice to meet you.
not_available And remember, flu shot.
not_available Thanks for the advice and the company.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available You, too.
not_available Do you want to talk about what's bugging you? No, you don't want to talk about it, or no, nothing's bugging you? Something was, but I took care of it now.
not_available Nothing to worry about.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra? I'm sorry.
not_available I must have nodded off.
not_available You've been working a lot, huh? It's coming up to 30 hours now.
not_available Do you want me to get you something? Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.
not_available How is he? He needs to be in a coma for two weeks, until increased levels of rabies antibodies appear in his cerebrospinal fluid.
not_available And then we'll wean him off sedation, see if any neurologic function returns.
not_available I prayed for him at church today.
not_available I heard that his friends have a whole story about demons and spirits.
not_available Who are we to judge, right? Everybody needs something to believe in.
not_available I will see you tomorrow, Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Good night, Hope.
