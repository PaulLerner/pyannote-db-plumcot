not_available That's one less thing for you to do.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You should try to get some rest.
not_available I can't.
not_available I lied.
not_available I don't sleep much at all.
not_available Really? Do you think that's weird? I don't even know anymore.
not_available I think I think with three kids it's pretty hard to do without some help.
not_available You have any help? A nanny? No.
not_available No, I mean, for energy.
not_available Are you taking anything or drinking anything to give you a little lift? Because, Franny, if you are taking something it could be doing serious damage to your heart.
not_available Another mom I know gives it to me.
not_available It's the only way that we can get things done.
not_available Please don't tell my husband.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available An hour and counting.
not_available Do you think the IRS flagged me because I worked in two states? 
not_available Soccer mom uses crystal meth.
not_available What? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available Did she just tell you out of the blue? 
not_available No, I asked.
not_available Someone help us! We were just here.
not_available What happened? He fell asleep and now he won't wake up.
not_available They came with an MVA this morning.
not_available They were discharged.
not_available Any vomiting? 
not_available No, no, but he's not right.
not_available You must have missed something.
not_available Pupils are equal and sluggish.
not_available He's hypertensive, 110/82.
not_available Miller two and a 4
not_available 0 ET tube.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Sir, we're trying to find out.
not_available Let's get a gram of mannitol.
not_available Did he get a CT? 
not_available No.
not_available Cricoid.
not_available Heart rate's 69.
not_available Tube.
not_available No CT after an MVA? He just flew out of the car seat.
not_available Okay.
not_available I I'm in.
not_available Did you check for a cranial hematoma for a stepoff? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I checked all of that.
not_available He was fine.
not_available Mannitol's running.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available He might've had some head trauma.
not_available It can cause bleeding in the brain.
not_available I'm sorry it wasn't caught earlier.
not_available Let's get him a CT.
not_available Unrestrained and no CT? Are you kidding, Abby? Hey.
not_available What did the CT show? Parietal skull fracture with subdural hematoma.
not_available Neurosurg has got him up in the OR now.
not_available How could I miss an intracranial bleed? 
not_available It happens.
not_available He seemed like a healthy baby to me.
not_available You had an Attending.
not_available If I can't trust my clinical skills, I should go home because the book stuff is not going that great either.
not_available When I get back, we'll pull the charts and the film and we'll just go over it stepby
not_available step and see what went wrong.
not_available It's how you learn.
not_available Need some help in here! Didn't they tell you she was septic? 
not_available Claimed they didn't know.
not_available Went apneic in the rig.
not_available Lost pulse when we pulled up.
not_available She's in PEA.
not_available Milligram of epi, atropine.
not_available What about your audit? Third atropine's in.
not_available Weak femoral pulse with compressions.
not_available The trip over did not help.
not_available She wasn't coding.
not_available She had a good pulse.
not_available Dopa's up to 20, don't have a pressure.
not_available They had no Pedes RTs, no equipment.
not_available It was dangerous to leave her.
not_available Yeah, they're a bunch of idiots.
not_available Why didn't you tube her? Stop compressions.
not_available Still PEA.
not_available She was breathing on her own.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, got your geriatric boyfriend 
not_available on the phone.
not_available It's important.
not_available I'll call back.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available Come on, Michelle.
not_available More epi.
not_available Where are the parents? 
not_available Coming from Geldin.
not_available Can they get here? 
not_available I think they're from Michigan.
not_available She's fixed and dilated.
not_available They better figure it out fast.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, your pancreatitis is a case of menstrual cramps.
not_available So perhaps in the future, before you call Surgery read Chapter 1 of Harrison's.
not_available Right.
not_available Can you make sure Amanda Knight gets 600 of ibuprofen? 
not_available Yes, doctor.
not_available I consulted on that man earlier.
not_available Why isn't he in bed? 
not_available He just signed in.
not_available Mr.
not_available Persky's back? Who let him go in the first place? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac let him go.
not_available Without the CT I ordered? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Persky, what happened? 
not_available He's febrile.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available It hurt for a while there, but it's much better now.
not_available Think he perfed? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Mr.
not_available Persky when the appendix bursts, it releases pressure, which abates the pain.
not_available Unfortunately, it releases fecal matter into the belly requiring us to operate on you.
not_available Like under anesthesia? 
not_available Yes.
not_available My mother died that way.
not_available No anesthesia.
not_available During your surgery? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Going under is what killed her.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay, well, let's take Mr.
not_available Persky upstairs and prep him 
not_available for surgery.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Where are you going? I'm gonna find Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Stop compressions.
not_available Asystole.
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available Should we try transcutaneous pacing? How long has she been down? Forty
not_available two minutes.
not_available Okay, Gallant.
not_available Gallant.
not_available Time of death, 15:37.
not_available There's only so much responsibility you can take.
not_available You didn't give her cancer.
not_available So how come that doesn't make me feel any better? Those the parents? Yeah.
not_available Gallant? 
not_available I'll tell them.
not_available Is it all right if I come in? Sorry it's taking so long.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt's been tied up.
not_available But then I suppose you don't mind the delay.
not_available Will you report what happened? 
not_available I never said anything did.
not_available Because maybe you could be transferred to another facility someplace safer for you.
not_available There's no shame in this.
not_available No one's going to think less of you for it, not me, not your girlfriend.
not_available I don't have one anymore.
not_available I'm the girl now.
not_available Jimmy 
not_available Can you leave me alone? No! It's gonna hurt my baby! Eloise, you have a broken leg.
not_available You need to settle down.
not_available No! No! 
not_available Give me five of Haldol.
not_available No! It's gonna hurt my baby! Please! No! No! No! I don'tI don't want my baby
not_available I don't want my baby to do drugs.
not_available Did you kill her? 
not_available No.
not_available Send her up to Ortho and make sure they cast her before she wakes up.
not_available Sorry you had to see that.
not_available Did you get scared? 
not_available Are you kidding? It was cool.
not_available So, what does this thing do, make you glow in the dark? Yeah, only after 1000 X
not_available rays.
not_available Want one? Can I have one of my head? Is it okay? Long as your department gets charged for it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Lay still, hold your breath.
not_available I understand you overrode my order for an abdominal CT on the appy patient.
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, he's since managed to perforate his appendix and is upstairs waiting for surgery.
not_available Instead of a quick laproscopic procedure, I'll perform an open laparotomy 
not_available with antiseptic washout.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available Your actions have made his life and mine much harder.
not_available You know he wants epidural anesthesia? 
not_available What do you want me to say? Neither a CBC or a CT would have been definitive.
not_available Sometimes the best test is time.
not_available You're serious? He was given discharge instructions and came back as directed.
not_available The system worked.
not_available Oh, for you, maybe but he'll have a riskier surgery and I'll miss dinner with my daughter.
not_available Score one for your bloody mission.
not_available Can you see Morris' crouper so we can discharge her? 
not_available Yeah, in a minute.
not_available I need consent for conscious sedation 
not_available for Carolyn Kinaire.
not_available Okay, hang on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available You have to present to Kovac or Romano.
not_available I have to call the IRS and beg not to be imprisoned.
not_available Kovac is not here and Romano's the reason why I need this.
not_available What did he do now? 
not_available Male rape victim who needs an exam and Napoleon's not too comfortable with the prospect.
not_available Homophobe.
not_available Fine, I'll do it.
not_available You're the best.
not_available Ready to go over this? 
not_available Yeah, I've denied my bladder this long.
not_available The Helen Keller of County.
not_available You missed a skull fracture today.
not_available You'll be back to code browns in no time.
not_available Hang on a second.
not_available Hey.
not_available You.
not_available What is it, Dr.
not_available Lewis? I'm a busy man.
not_available You're one less patient busy.
not_available I'm taking the rape case.
not_available Excuse me? Don't know if it's a gay thing, or whatWhat are you talking about? Pratt feels
not_available He's a rabid dog who should be shot before he infects the other staff.
not_available As for my abilities, I finish what I start.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Bang.
not_available Hey, Frank.
not_available Back from your little joyride? You seen my kid around? 
not_available Yeah, I saw him stalking Kovac earlier.
not_available Did the IRS call? Yes, said something about penalties back taxes, you owing them for their lost time 
not_available and that Hollander guy called again.
not_available Did he leave a number? Nope, just canceled dinner.
not_available I spoke with Mrs.
not_available Meyers.
not_available Who? Meth mom.
not_available She's agreed to seek counseling.
not_available Social Services will follow up.
not_available They don't wanna see her? I told them she's obviously devoted to her family, takes good care of them.
not_available Be harder when she dies of a drug
not_available induced heart attack.
not_available Well, I'm sure this scared her, enough to get the message, I'd think.
not_available Okay, go with your gut.
not_available Are you sure? Because it's a bit of a weakness on my part, not reading people well.
not_available Never occurred to me that a working wife and mother would be a meth user.
not_available People are capable of anything when put under the right stressors.
not_available Need help visualizing the fissure.
not_available Okay.
not_available You want to swab for sperm too? No, we have enough.
not_available Help me take this off.
not_available The bleeding's stopped.
not_available The tear will heal on its own.
not_available Is he good to go? 
not_available Back to the daddy tank as soon as his discharge papers are signed.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Romano, may I speak with you privately? You're already my favorite.
not_available You want people to talk? 
not_available His lab workup.
not_available Why you showing it to me? Dr.
not_available Pratt's on his way into a trauma.
not_available Some test results have come back.
not_available You're HIV
not_available positive with a CD4 count of less than 200.
not_available That means you have AIDS.
not_available Did you hear what I just said? Yeah, thanks.
not_available At least now I know it's not gonna be forever.
not_available That the guy who got punked out? 
not_available Shut up.
not_available He's had a bad day.
not_available Okay, this all looks well documented.
not_available Gee, thanks.
not_available Baby had a normal exam and the mechanism was borderline.
not_available I would've scanned the head, but Kovac might not.
not_available It's a judgment call.
not_available That's why I ordered a baby gram.
not_available When you read an Xray are you using the ABCD mnemonic? 
not_available Airway, Bones, Cardiac, Diaphragm.
not_available Wait, this is the wrong film.
not_available No, it's Colin Tranh, and I still don't see it.
not_available Is it more superior? Do you have the head CT? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, here's the fracture.
not_available And I still don't see it.
not_available It's not there.
not_available Get a social worker and find that boyfriend now.
not_available Trauma 1 's empty.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, GSW to the head.
not_available Went into V
not_available fib two minutes out.
not_available Robbery, homicide, both? Self
not_available inflicted.
not_available No time to transfer.
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available Why isn't he intubated? 
not_available Because he's a DNR.
not_available That's what I told him.
not_available Suicide is against the law.
not_available If he flinched, he only injured his cortex.
not_available Okay, let's do this.
not_available 8
not_available 0 tube.
not_available Come on, give me those.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available Stand by with epi.
not_available Still V
not_available fib, 360.
not_available Clear.
not_available Amp of epi.
not_available He used a gun.
not_available Charge to 360.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Clear.
not_available Stop it! I'm saving him.
not_available Hundred of lidocaine.
not_available She knows him.
not_available Just leave him.
not_available It's what he wanted.
not_available Is the baby out of surgery? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I spoke to the doctor.
not_available It went well.
not_available Where's his mother? 
not_available At work.
not_available I called.
not_available So he's going to be okay, right? 
not_available Yes, he will.
not_available This is Mr.
not_available Sung.
not_available He's a social worker.
not_available How you doing? Fine.
not_available What's this all about? 
not_available You mentioned that Colin cries a lot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So? Was he crying when you got home? 
not_available Why? It appears his skull was fractured after he left.
not_available What? 
not_available He didn't have a fracture when he was here earlier.
not_available Are you saying I hit him? 
not_available I don't know what you did.
not_available Did you slam his head against the wall? Or the floor? The crib railing? 
not_available I don't have to listen to this.
not_available I'll take it from here.
not_available Come with me.
not_available I didn't hit that kid.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You're nuts.
not_available Lady, you don't know what you're talking about! I didn't hit that stupid kid.
not_available Hey! Alex, this room is for families who need privacy.
not_available Come on.
not_available Super power punch.
not_available Quit knocking me off.
not_available Plus, it's time to go.

not_available He doesn't really have any family.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, wait, I forgot something.
not_available You finish your homework? 
not_available Yeah, but look.
not_available It's my head.
not_available Dr.

not_available He Xrayed your skull? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Night.
not_available Hi.
not_available You're going home then? Yeah, my family's here to pick me up.
not_available Listen, I just want to thank you for everything, okay? Hey.
not_available Do you guys want me to make spaghetti tonight for dinner? Neela, labs are back on my lupus patient.
not_available How do you calculate creatinine clearance? Weight in kilos times 140, minus age, divided by 72, times creatinine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available Abby, would you be interested in studying together some time? Sorry? 
not_available I'm good at the academic stuff.
not_available But you're good with everything else.
not_available Maybe we could help each other.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available What is it? The LOL in 2 is complaining of nausea.

not_available Did you send in a blood draw, check a dig.
not_available level? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The tube you sent was hemolyzed.
not_available They need another draw.

not_available Time's up.
not_available Where's my hand? 
not_available In the women's bathroom in the tampon machine.
not_available Get it yourself.
