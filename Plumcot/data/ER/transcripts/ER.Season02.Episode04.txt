not_available It could've been a Burrito Grande during Leno.
not_available She's a little freaked.
not_available My old man had a coronary.

not_available I know where it is, Carter.
not_available Well, it's great there's no fracture.

not_available The x
not_available rays looked good.
not_available I don't think it's broken.

not_available Lydia, why don't you see if Exam Room 4 is open? Doug, next time, make sure your patient's on the board.

not_available No, I don't understand.
not_available If you have three discharges and one admit, you should have two open beds.

not_available You're allowed to have a life.
not_available I'm waiting on some labs.
not_available Weaver has you playing her game.
not_available You think if you ace all the details, she's gonna stop nitpicking? Probably not.
not_available "You know, Susan, you didn't put your X's in the middle of the box.
not_available " "I know it's trivial, but could you say 'sahntimeter' instead of centimeter?" "Couldn't you second
not_available guess yourself sometimes instead of me always having to do it?" What does that mean, they "may" have a bed after 7? Are they building it? I called all the nursing homes.

not_available Come here! Did you shoot that kid? Did you? Huh? 
not_available Take him in, take him in! Got them both, got them both.
not_available Don't inhale this stuff.
not_available It'll mess you up.
not_available Susan, your babysitter is here.
not_available I sent her to the snack bar.
not_available Half an hour ago.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Lily, could you give 30 cc's of this to Mr.
not_available Perry in Curtain 3? 
not_available You bet.
not_available Go on.
not_available Go.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Right feels lucky.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available I'm Mark Greene, Attending in the ER.
not_available Maybe we spoke.
not_available Nothing in there.
not_available We're looking for a room.
not_available A bed would do.
not_available A room would be much better.
not_available You know the proper channels.
not_available I tried them, and this nice lady still had no room for the night.
not_available What do we have here? Hey, look, there's a bed.
not_available And it has an open window.
not_available This is perfect.
not_available We'll take it.
not_available Do you want me to call the supervisor? Not unless you wanna explain why you won't handle an admit 45 minutes before the end of your shift.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I think she likes it.
not_available Three hours a day would be perfect.
not_available That would help me so much.
not_available I just can't stand having Susie in daycare for so long.
not_available I know.
not_available I thought about putting Theresa in one for two minutes.
not_available Not my child.
not_available I'm sure the one here is very nice.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available It's great.
not_available She's still breast
not_available feeding.
not_available There's a lot of salt in those.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Well, where shall we start? I'm on days till Monday.
not_available Until Monday? 
not_available My shift changes every three weeks.
not_available Twelvehour days, 12
not_available hour nights.
not_available You'd need help at different times? 
not_available We can work it out in advance.
not_available I didn't understand that on the phone.
not_available When I'm on nights, I do expect to patchwork a little extra help.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I can't help.
not_available Theresa and I have a schedule.
not_available I thought I could work Susie in, but I can't reshuffle week to week.
not_available I understand.
not_available This is not a flexible time for us.
not_available You know babies.
not_available They're such little creatures of habit.
not_available They need their patterns to develop a sense of security.
not_available Hurry, hurry.
not_available It's his heart.
not_available I knew when I saw it.
not_available Did he drink this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The whole thing? We've gotta pump his stomach, now! 
not_available Whose patient is this? Hold still.
not_available You need this to inactivate any Donnatal left in your stomach.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Perry just had a gastric lavage.
not_available After ingesting 500 cc's of Maalox, lidocaine and Donnatal.
not_available He drank the whole bottle? 
not_available She gave it to us.
not_available I gave him an ounce.
not_available But you left the bottle in here? Poor physician instructions are not your responsibility.
not_available You don't know about my instructions.
not_available There was nothing on the chart.
not_available You were gone.
not_available He has respiratory arrest and you disappeared.
not_available I told Randi 
not_available It's not her job to keep track of staff.
not_available Kerry, Susan, outside.
not_available It would've made no difference if I had written a book on his chart.
not_available Obviously, I did not order him to guzzle a quart of GI cocktail.
not_available So your carelessness didn't matter.
not_available Shall we wait till someone dies? That's enough.
not_available When I'm finished, I'll see you both in the lounge.
not_available Still working? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I gotta cancel.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks wants me to monitor our gastroplasty in recovery.
not_available Wow.
not_available Grown
not_available up stuff.
not_available I was looking forward to tonight.
not_available Well, rain check.
not_available Those are really nice.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How do you get them so even? Just practice.
not_available You'll get there.
not_available Am I in your light? No, no.
not_available Anything wrong, doc? We'll do it soon.
not_available Doc? No, sir.
not_available No, everything is fine.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available What happened in front of that patient can't ever happen again.
not_available You two have to work together.
not_available I depend on both of you too much.
not_available I'm to blame for this situation.
not_available I haven't backed you up in the more unpleasant aspects of your job.
not_available And I may have left the impression that I don't support your work.
not_available So let me go on record.
not_available I am behind Kerry 100 percent.
not_available If you disagree with anything she's doing assume that she's acting with my approval.
not_available But if this department impedes any Resident from doing their best then as chief, you have to respond.
not_available Any questions? That's it.
not_available Kerry, hold on.
not_available Susan is one of the most gifted doctors I know.
not_available If she's having trouble working with you, it's a problem I expect you to solve.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll accept your criticism anytime, but not in front of a Resident.
not_available It undermines my authority and is completely inappropriate.
not_available That's how Susan felt when she was being critiqued in front of a patient.
not_available I'd like to apologize for what happened earlier today.
not_available It was inexcusable, and I am sorry.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available What happened earlier today? It was a misunderstanding.
not_available Having fun being where the buck stops? 
not_available Bring on the TV and beer.
not_available Well, no, actually Hope you don't mind a threesome.
not_available No problem.
not_available See you later.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Ortho concurred.
not_available No tendon damage.
not_available Keep the splint for 10 days and you shouldn't need a leave.
not_available That's good news.
not_available Get yourself a physical
not_available therapy regimen.
not_available You know Jeanie Boulet, right? 
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Multiple trauma just pulled up.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available I'll join you in 2.

not_available Some kind of a crusher.
not_available No distal pulse in that extremity.
not_available Hot date tonight? 
not_available Almost.
not_available When did her husband show up? 
not_available Half an hour ago.
not_available Social worker is on her way.
not_available I'm sorry, sweetheart.
not_available I didn't wanna send you away but I couldn't shampoo your hair the way you like it.
not_available Or get your pills straight.
not_available Or change the bed.
not_available I never thought the day would come when I couldn't pick you up.
not_available Even after the boys were gone, you were always a feather.
not_available I can't afford the kind of place that you should have.
not_available But I I thought it would be better for you here.
not_available I missed her too much.
not_available Damn it, we're losing the arm.
not_available Where's maintenance? Here.

not_available This place was a real dump.
not_available Recycled junk everywhere.
not_available A lot of old x
not_available ray cartridges.
not_available Blood gas shows decreased AV differential.
not_available Could be cyanide.
not_available Doesn't make sense.
not_available Why not? Stripping x
not_available rays, they could be using cyanide illegally.
not_available We need a pressure dressing here.
not_available How are those retinal veins? Bright red.
not_available Get a cyanide kit.
not_available Hang the thiosulfate, 50 cc's.
not_available Yeah, he's pinking up.

not_available Damn, we're an hour over.
not_available I had dinner plans.

not_available Can you call them? 
not_available You can go.
not_available I'll take him up to OR.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available I'll stay.
not_available Stay on top of it and see what the social worker comes up with.
not_available Carol, long day? 
not_available Yeah, for my day off.
not_available Is Susan still around? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available She had to get out early, picking up Little Susie and all.
not_available She spends a lot of time with that baby.
not_available Yeah, since Chloe flew the coop.
not_available Chloe's gone? 
not_available Where have you been? I gotta get that.

not_available You didn't.
not_available I thought I made you angry.
not_available You didn't.
not_available Let me just ask you.
not_available If you weren't mad were you maybe worried? About what? You running out in the middle of sniper fire or chasing an armed man through the ER? You were worried! I thought something was going on here.
not_available I thought maybe I was getting to you, and I know you're getting to me.
not_available That's great.
