
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available He shot me.
not_available They think I did it.
not_available Is there anyone who can back you up? Yeah.
not_available She's down there.
not_available You've been accepted into the surgical elective.
not_available Oh, my God, thank you.
not_available I write your evaluation.
not_available I'm the one you've got to impress.
not_available I need you to draw a blood alcohol for a suspected DUI.
not_available You gotta help me, Greg.
not_available His blood alcohol came back negative.
not_available It won't happen again, I promise.
not_available It won't because you're gonna stop drinking and get yourself in a program.
not_available Debbie's enlisted me to give a hand to a Sudanese doctor who's a bit short staffed right now.
not_available He works out of a camp called Dumtala, in Darfur.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 12x15 "DARFUR" Dr.
not_available Carter? It is Stephen.
not_available You startled me.
not_available You cough all night.
not_available I brought you some tea.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It is the dryness, you know.
not_available And the sand.
not_available It happens to everyone when they get here.
not_available It's good.
not_available Zahra, she made me that when I came.
not_available And I would drink it every night before I went to sleep.
not_available Debbie said you needed some help here.
not_available Yes.
not_available She's a good person.
not_available And your help will be appreciated.
not_available So you and Debbie are?.
not_available Yes.
not_available How long has that been going on? Well, she has been here two months, so seven and a half weeks.
not_available You know what? You should go back to bed.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, thank you.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Now we can all get some sleep.
not_available What's that? 
not_available It's the Janjaweed again.
not_available You'll learn to sleep through it.
not_available No, Bernie, no biting.
not_available Am I bleeding? Did he break the skin? I am so sorry.
not_available He's not usually like this.
not_available I'll get a nurse to give him the shot.
not_available Can somebody take a look at this wound? Yeah, we're a little short.
not_available Do it yourself.
not_available Hey, what's this? 
not_available That's for you and the little bastard.
not_available Thanks, Frank.
not_available Hey, congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It was supposed to be a secret.
not_available Everybody says you're puffy.
not_available I had to defend you.
not_available Am I getting puffy? 
not_available You're not.
not_available Are you on today? 
not_available No.
not_available Clemente will be here at 8.
not_available Damn it, I'm bleeding.
not_available You should get a hep panel and HIV on that kid.
not_available Clemente's back on the schedule? Isn't it a bit too soon after everything that happened? Which I hear is similar to what happened in Newark.
not_available What happened in Newark? 
not_available Nothing happened.
not_available The guy is a loose cannon.
not_available I mean, he's a suspected murderer.
not_available Look, Dr.
not_available Clemente is an excellent physician with some personal issues.
not_available That's nothing new around here.
not_available It's the fifth time you brought me in this week, man.
not_available Five times.
not_available Why don't you put it all down on this piece of paper and sign? Because if I shot her, then how did I get shot? Because she went for the gun, it went off, and it clipped you in the shoulder.
not_available Come on, man, her husband did it.
not_available Her husband did it, okay? He was working in Jersey.
not_available Then he's gotta have a twin because I saw a guy like him in my apartment.
not_available If that's true, why can't a neighbor back your story up? I don't know, maybe people hate me because I play my music loud.
not_available Because it's bull, Vic, and you know it.
not_available Now, we talked to the doctor and your girl ain't waking up.
not_available So if I were you, I'd get a lawyer.
not_available This is great.
not_available Just great.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available We'll be with you soon.
not_available Zahra, where's Stephen? 
not_available In the back.
not_available What's wrong? Everything.
not_available Good radial and ulnar pulses.
not_available You okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available The Janjaweed shot up the reservoir.
not_available There's a patch kit.
not_available Tell the engineer.
not_available Went to Khartoum.
not_available We can't wait.
not_available We have the boreholes.
not_available We need 15 liters per person per day.
not_available Cephalexin, Why are you being so calm? People are drinking sand.
not_available We've been through this.
not_available Drain the tank, patch the holes, re
not_available treat with chlorine.
not_available So, sweetheart, take two deep breaths and do your downtown dog.
not_available Downand
not_available out dog? It's not funny.
not_available We can't provide basic needs.
not_available What's new? Fine, yeah.
not_available Be like that.
not_available Oh, I have two more but I'll just save them for someone who is listening to me.
not_available Appreciates me.
not_available She was like this in the Congo? 
not_available Worse.
not_available At least in the Congo, we had television and beer.
not_available I'm not against anyone's religion but this place would drive anybody to drink.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, I need you in here.
not_available It's downward dog.
not_available IV is already in.
not_available Osman.
not_available Thought you're feeling better.
not_available They want to go home.
not_available Well, I'm gonna give him some medicine so we can release him.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available His brother, Khalid.
not_available An artist? Let me see.
not_available It's him and his father fighting the Janjaweed.
not_available Tell him it's good.
not_available Somebody needs to kick the Janjaweed's butt.
not_available Okay.
not_available Doxycycline, single dose, ORS is one cup after each loose stool.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available She's gonna take very good care of you.
not_available Is this for me? Dr.
not_available Clemente, how was jail? I didn't go to jail.
not_available Called the lawyer I left on your machine? I don't need a lawyer, Morris.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available So how did you survive without me? 
not_available Oh, we did our best.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available You okay? Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available Why? Are people talking about me? Well, they're concerned.
not_available They just wanna make sure you're all right.
not_available That's all.
not_available Well, tell them not to be so concerned about me.
not_available You didn't have to come back so soon.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? Yeah, well, before Morris or somebody starts a blog I wanna set the record straight.
not_available I didn't shoot Jodie.
not_available Okay.
not_available But how did you know about the blog? Oh, that bitch.
not_available Give bolus with a liter.
not_available Wait up.
not_available Hey, Kovac.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Hey, wait up, wait up.
not_available What have you got for me? Good to see you, but you're not on the schedule today.
not_available Weaver said I could come back.
not_available I'm head of the ER, not Weaver, and I don't think you're ready.
not_available What are you doing? Giving me the slow walk to the door? 
not_available I'm looking out for you.
not_available I can take care of myself.
not_available Thank you.
not_available More importantly, I'm looking out for patients in here.
not_available Patients don't need to be protected from me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, we've got a 14year
not_available old, auto versus peds coming in.
not_available Go home, Vic.
not_available I am home.
not_available You're not working today.
not_available Come on, put me back on the schedule.
not_available Kovac, come on.
not_available Fourteenyear
not_available old hit by car going 30 or 40.
not_available My leg.
not_available Distal deformity of the left lower extremity.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Jose Rodriguez.
not_available Jose, remember what happened? 
not_available I got hit.
not_available Let me guess? Flute.
not_available Tuba.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available LOC? 
not_available Nope.
not_available A and 0 times four.
not_available Vitals? Tachy in the 120s.
not_available Resps, 20s.
not_available BP, 110/78.
not_available Okay, Abby, you take the airway.
not_available Pratt, you run it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available So how long is your wife in Paris? I don't know.
not_available So how long are you with us? 
not_available How long do you need me? It's hard, huh? Keeping relationships going, doing what we do.
not_available I have a sweet lady friend in London named Grace.
not_available Whenever I'm in town, we fall in love.
not_available When I leave, we fall out.
not_available How does Debbie feel about that? She has the exact same relationship with some Spanish photojournalist.
not_available What happens in Darfur stays in Darfur.
not_available So when do you think these people will be able to go home? Who knows? The government funded the Arab militias to find and kill the rebels.
not_available So they burned the villages, killed the men, raped the women.
not_available Whoever survived wound up here.
not_available The Janjaweed have turned this place into the Wild, Wild West.
not_available Kofi Annan and Colin Powell, they called this genocide.
not_available And the Congress, they just went on holiday.
not_available I guess 300,000 dead and a million displaced persons aren't enough to get involved.
not_available Does not matter whether it is Somalia or Rwanda, Darfur, New Orleans.
not_available When the faces are black, the world moves slow.
not_available Is she doing what I think she's doing? Yes.
not_available She is quite a woman.
not_available Hey, how much for the yoga class? It's free.
not_available What happened? Is it a stomachache? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He also has diarrhea.
not_available Mother's gone to get wood.
not_available He doesn't know where his father is.
not_available Let's take him back to the tent for supervised rehydration.
not_available It's okay, we'll fix you up before your mom gets back.
not_available I'd let him keep it, but what happens when the battery dies? It becomes iTrash.
not_available Help, help.
not_available She needs a doctor.
not_available You bring a towel, I'll go get a stretcher.
not_available Tell Zahra to prep the procedure room.
not_available Janjaweed.
not_available She's tachy at 120.
not_available BP is 100/60.
not_available Two liters of saline wide open.
not_available She lost a lot of blood.
not_available Hope it's just from the lacerations.
not_available Looks like a nasal fracture probably an inferior orbit blowout as well.
not_available Chest is clear.
not_available Get these lacerations cleared, see what we're dealing here.
not_available Why did she leave camp? 
not_available To get firewood for their families.
not_available Why don't the men go? 
not_available The men would be killed.
not_available IV is in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get 2 of morphine.
not_available And I need two suture kits too, Gada, where's your husband? 
not_available We got a lot of blood down here.
not_available What is it? We have lacerations and contusions to the external genitalia and upper thigh.
not_available No.
not_available Enough.
not_available We need to examine her.
not_available Doesn't want to be examined by men.
not_available She needs
not_available I know! I know.
not_available For STIs and HIV.
not_available Okay, so get her husband in here.
not_available Do not tell him she's been shamed.
not_available Shamed? 
not_available Their word, not mine.
not_available Sudanese men sometimes disown their wives after rape.
not_available When Gada awakens, we'll let her tell him what she chooses.
not_available We're going to regionals.
not_available I miss practice, drum major will bench me.
not_available Hey, Pratt, Endocrine saw your IDDM kid, so he can go.
not_available KJ's dad is out here asking for you.
not_available Just got a little guarding here.
not_available Ultrasound and call Surgery to come take a look.
not_available Have them follow up tomorrow.
not_available Where's Darnell? 
not_available Right here.
not_available Take your time with discharge instructions.
not_available I always do.
not_available What happened this time? 
not_available I got in a fight, man.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Some cat at this restaurant.
not_available You been drinking again? Damn, man.
not_available I blew it, okay? We had a going
not_available away party for a buddy at work.
not_available I had a few.
not_available Next thing I knew, me and this kid got into it.
not_available But you're supposed to stay clean.
not_available You my sponsor now? No.
not_available I'm your boy who you promised you'd come clean to.
not_available Look, I'm not gonna kick this overnight.
not_available What I need from you right now is to fix me up before KJ gets down here.
not_available I don't want him to see me like this.
not_available Then stop coming in like this.
not_available Hey there.
not_available Jodes? How are you doing? Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been around much.
not_available I just I got a lot of problems.
not_available Things are really messed up, baby.
not_available Look, I can see you're mad at me.
not_available You been going to the meetings? 
not_available Hell, yeah.
not_available It's hard, man.
not_available What happened in there? Kid got hit by a truck.
not_available Come on, hold still.
not_available He gonna be all right? Who knows? Where is she? Your wife was attacked outside the second checkpoint.
not_available She okay? 
not_available She will be.
not_available Shamed? She was badly beaten.
not_available See her.
not_available I can see her now? Yes.
not_available Come with me.
not_available It's this way.
not_available Oh, Gada.
not_available There are bruises to her chest and to her abdomen but I don't think that there is any damage to her internal organs.
not_available She live? Yes, we gave her some medicine to help her sleep.
not_available She has many cuts but they're not so deep and I think the stitches need to stay for one week.
not_available She cut there? 
not_available Yes, but I think it will heal very well.
not_available There shouldn't be any scarring.
not_available Sir? Sir? Sir.
not_available Sir, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I brought him in to see her.
not_available Did he see the wound? Yeah.
not_available The slash on the thigh is the mark of rape.
not_available How the hell was I supposed to know that? Where are you going? 
not_available I'm gonna go get him.
not_available John! Chuny, what are his vitals? Pulse, 97.
not_available Resps, 20.
not_available BP, 102/58.
not_available A hundred percent on room air.
not_available Heart rate's a little high.
not_available There could be occult blood loss.
not_available What took you so long? 
not_available Our favorite surgeon has arrived.
not_available I was with the Crohn's girl.
not_available Why isn't Albright helping you? I was given strict instructions to handle ER so she can scrub in on ileoanal anastomosis.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available Tier one trauma.
not_available He should've been seen first.
not_available I heard he was stable.
not_available Thought I'd get the acute obstruction first.
not_available It's fine.
not_available No.
not_available He needs an ex
not_available lap, that takes time.
not_available Ex
not_available lap? The ultrasound was negative.
not_available What's an ex
not_available lap? Abdominal pain, tachycardia and a good mechanism.
not_available That's a bleed until proven otherwise.
not_available Guys, that's basic Trauma 101.
not_available Get Albright or Dubenko down here to evaluate.
not_available I'm sure they'll agree with me.
not_available Serial hemoglobin? 
not_available Thirteen to 11.6.
not_available Probably dilutional.
not_available Am I gonna have surgery? 
not_available We're not sure yet.
not_available This is the ER.
not_available I'm gonna need a CT of the chest and abdomen.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Get a portable, Chuny.
not_available Would you forget the scan? 
not_available It's a waste of time.
not_available I don't agree.
not_available CT shows a bleed, 
not_available he's going to the O.R.
not_available If it doesn't? 
not_available He's going to the O.R.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available We'll OBS.
not_available OBS? That doesn't sound good.
not_available What do you gain from the scan? Other than giving him radiation? 
not_available Pratt.
not_available A chance to spare him from an operation he doesn't need.
not_available Sense of what we're dealing.
not_available Surgeons don't like surprises.
not_available You're not a surgeon.
not_available Today, I am.
not_available Just give her a break, Pratt.
not_available Neela.
not_available Listen, I got a lot more experience with pediatric traumas than you do.
not_available Kids are tricky.
not_available They have a huge reserve.
not_available They maintain normal vitals for a while, but, believe me, when they crash, they crash hard.
not_available CT scan is part of a complete workup of the patient.
not_available It'll take 15 minutes.
not_available We got time.
not_available I don't think you do.
not_available It's my call, Pratt.
not_available Dad.
not_available Are you okay? You have to tell Monty I won't be able to play tonight.
not_available Don't worry about that, son.
not_available The officer wants to ask you some questions about the accident.
not_available Did you get a description? He was a black dude.
not_available Blue pickup.
not_available You see the license plate? All I remember is that the side door is smashed and the grill was crushed.
not_available Oh, and there was bumper stickers.
not_available Lots of Bears bumper stickers.
not_available Malik, take a break.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I need you to take a break.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available You still drive that old truck? Yeah, why? Because that kid you were so curious about, the one who got hit says the guy who hit him was a black dude, who drove a blue pickup.
not_available Million of brothers drive blue pickups.
not_available Not talking about a million brothers.
not_available I'm talking about you.
not_available Did you hit that kid? 
not_available Yo, Greg.
not_available Answer me.
not_available Did your drunk ass hit that kid? I didn't mean to hit him, man.
not_available It was a accident, man.
not_available I swear.
not_available It was an accident, man.
not_available I didn't mean to hurt that kid.
not_available I swear to God.
not_available I think it's this one.
not_available This one up here with the Oxfam logo on it.
not_available What did he say? He said Lwendo went to find the Janjaweed.
not_available It happened by the second checkpoint.
not_available You cannot do this.
not_available We can stop him.
not_available It's dangerous.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available It's Lwendo's fault.
not_available He knows it's suicide to leave camp.
not_available That's right.
not_available You'll get yourself killed.
not_available So could Lwendo.
not_available Look, I'll go.
not_available At least I know where it is.
not_available You stay.
not_available You drive.
not_available Is my dad still here? He's outside.
not_available No talking.
not_available You have to hold still.
not_available Liver and spleen look good.
not_available How's he doing? Why are you here? Follow
not_available up on my patient.
not_available Vitals good? 
not_available I've got this.
not_available You don't.
not_available Why are you here? Dr.
not_available Pratt was concerned you were not receptive to his input.
not_available So concerned that he had to page me out of the O.R.
not_available to come see this patient.
not_available Went over my head.
not_available Make sure we don't miss anything.
not_available I'm doing what you said.
not_available I'm getting ER to work up their patients completely.
not_available No, not really, since you're the one here doing the CT.
not_available Heart rate is up to 125.
not_available Got some fluid in the retroperitoneal fossa.
not_available That could be blood.
not_available Scan's over.
not_available Retroperitoneal injury wouldn't show up on an ultrasound.
not_available Jose.
not_available He's hypotensive, non
not_available responsive.
not_available He was talking.
not_available His heart rate was in the 90s before.
not_available Get two units type
not_available specific.
not_available Send off another set of blood cultures.
not_available Change to Zosyn and up the dopamine to 10 mics.
not_available Hey, whoa.
not_available You skipped her.
not_available What are you doing? We rounded on her 10 minutes ago.
not_available Don't think so, I didn't see new orders.
not_available Come on, I need to know what's going on.
not_available I'll catch up with you.
not_available She's off pressors, stable from a cardiopulmonary standpoint.
not_available We're just waiting for her neuro status to declare itself.
not_available So, what are you gonna do now? What are you gonna do? Sit back and twiddle your thumbs? Is that what you're gonna do? We're gonna wait.
not_available That's all we can do.
not_available What's up? How does it feel, Vic? Who is this? How does she look now? You still wanna touch her? You sick, twisted piece of
not_available Yeah, I might not have finished the job but it's still a beautiful thing.
not_available The cops are all over you.
not_available You wait, man.
not_available You wait till she wakes up and starts talking.
not_available Because you'll be in a world of hurt.
not_available Keep dreaming, buddy.
not_available You got out of Jersey okay.
not_available You're not gonna pull that off this time.
not_available Oh, you don't think? 
not_available She was mine.
not_available You never should have touched her.
not_available Is that kid gonna be all right? I don't know.
not_available He's up in the O.R., trying to stop the bleeding.
not_available Look, man.
not_available I messed up, man.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I went out on a limb for you.
not_available I risked my job to cover for you because you promised me you'd get help.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available All I do is think about drinking.
not_available I wake up, I want a drink.
not_available I walk down the street, I want a drink.
not_available I see the winos on the corner and I'm jealous.
not_available I think to myself, "If I could get through raising KJ get him through college, then I could be there with them.
not_available " 
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Are you listening to me? This is serious.
not_available I'm not proud of it, but it's serious.
not_available What's serious is that kid could die.
not_available And I know that, and I'm sorry for it.
not_available But what else you want me to do? Turn yourself in.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available Look, you talk about raising KJ to be honest, right? You got him working up here to teach him integrity and respect.
not_available How's he supposed to learn that if you just get away with this? I ain't going to jail.
not_available You've gotta turn yourself in, D.
not_available What does he think he's gonna accomplish? For men like him, pride slips away on a daily basis.
not_available They can't provide without getting killed, so their wives must do it.
not_available Then the worst happens.
not_available He's had enough.
not_available Just wants to be a man again.
not_available This.
not_available This is one of the places.
not_available Doesn't seem to be anybody around.
not_available Let's go a little further.
not_available Look, John.
not_available The farther we go, the more dangerous it gets.
not_available Now, I'm sorry, but we are going to turn around.
not_available How is she doing? She wants to know where Lwendo is.
not_available Tell her we have doctors out looking for him.
not_available Her children.
not_available They're here.
not_available I'll get them.
not_available Come on.
not_available Your mother's awake.
not_available What is he asking? 
not_available He's asking if we have weapons.
not_available We don't have any weapons.
not_available We don't have any weapons.
not_available We're doctors.
not_available A woman was raped, we're trying to
not_available He says shut up and so do I.
not_available I'm just saying that they can help us.
not_available John.
not_available Look, John, there's a lot of corruption.
not_available Government, military, police, everybody.
not_available They could've helped us.
not_available Yes.
not_available But then the U.S.
not_available would prefer to have conversations with criminals like Salah Gosh.
not_available Salah Gosh? Your government flew him to Washington to get intel on the war on terrorism.
not_available They wouldn't be able to do that if they started pissing off Bashir.
not_available They wouldn't be able to get their hands on the oil out here either.
not_available Let's go a little further.
not_available It is too late.
not_available A little further, please.
not_available No.
not_available We are going back.
not_available Oh! What? What? What is going on with you? It's not cholera, is it? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Cirrhosis.
not_available Spironolactone.
not_available You have hepatitis.
not_available Schistosomiasis as a child.
not_available Left me with a few liver granulomas.
not_available What is that? That could be them, huh? So, what happens now? He'll get booked.
not_available Probably post bail.
not_available My dad's going away, isn't he? We're going to go back.
not_available There's nothing more that we can do here.
not_available They're gonna kill him.
not_available And they'll kill us too.
not_available Stay still, John.
not_available Say nothing.
not_available Lwendo.
not_available Lwendo, stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available We've got multiple GSWs to the chest, flank and legs.
not_available Bagged the femoral artery.
not_available I need a clamp.
not_available John.
not_available Start an IV.
not_available We're just one hour to camp and another two to the surgical hospital.
not_available John! 
not_available Don't worry, Lwendo.
not_available We're gonna get you back to camp.
not_available Damn it.
not_available I need some suction.
not_available I need to intubate him.
not_available We can't even do that at the clinic.
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available John.
not_available Vic.
not_available Vicky.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God, you're awake.
not_available You're awake, baby.
not_available I was so worried about you.

not_available Hey, KJ, look.
not_available I feel bad about all of this, but you gotta understand
not_available It's not your fault.

not_available He's gonna get the help he needs.
not_available Thanks to you.
not_available KJ
not_available All my dad's other boys They just help him get out of trouble but you're the only one that makes him step up and take responsibility.
not_available That means a lot, Dr.

not_available A lot.
not_available All right, man.
not_available Oh, damn.

not_available Nothing.
not_available You're lying.
not_available What's up? I I know who hit that kid.
not_available It's all my fault.
not_available What do you mean, it's your fault? The cops brought in a friend of mine a while ago for a blood
not_available alcohol level.
not_available I drew my own blood, switched the tubes.
not_available What? He swore to me he was gonna get help.
not_available That kid almost died.
not_available You just said he was fine.
not_available He's got a pulverized leg, he needed blood transfusions he'll be on ventilator, he's in the hospital for weeks, you call that fine? All right, I made a mistake.
not_available Look, Darnell's not a bad guy.
not_available At the time, it seemed like him going to jail for DUI wasn't gonna help anybody.
not_available It would have helped Jose Rodriguez.
not_available He wouldn't be in the hospital now.
not_available I made him turn himself in.
not_available You think that's enough? So now what? You gonna tell Kovac or something? You got your friend to own up to what he did.
