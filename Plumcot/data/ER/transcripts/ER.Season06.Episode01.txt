not_available She wants her mother.

not_available Sounds good.
not_available Do you always jog to work? 
not_available It's only four miles.
not_available Makes me want to dislike her.
not_available This tube gives your mother medicine to make her better.
not_available And what's that? That's a machine that helps her take real deep breaths.

not_available Wings? 
not_available Kind of a life jacket for little kids.

not_available Hasn't mentioned it lately, huh? 
not_available Not to me.
not_available Not to me either.
not_available Bizarre, considering I sponsored her.
not_available Why is that? I know you two are friends.
not_available You know her better than I do.
not_available Do all our conversations have to revolve around Elizabeth? Perhaps we don't need to have further conversations at all.
not_available Some number two Dexon.
not_available for the intercostal.

not_available We'll tell him what we think.
not_available He's not the right one for us.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available You're a regular doctor, but you don't work here? I do work here, but only when they need me.
not_available I'm what they call a "moonlighter.
not_available " Because you're from another country? No, because I only work here from time to time, when they need me.
not_available They needed you today for the truck crash.
not_available No.
not_available I'm here because one of the regular doctors
not_available You said you were a regular doctor.
not_available I fill in when someone's absent.
not_available I get it.
not_available You're like a sub.
not_available A sub.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available I'm a sub.
not_available What kind of accent is that? Thick.
not_available Neighbors heard the baby cry.
not_available Called the police.
not_available Broke the door down.
not_available Any relatives? 
not_available They don't think so.
not_available Said she has AIDS.
not_available And the baby? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available We've got it.

not_available Take a blood count and a chest film.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Pneumonia? 
not_available Pretty safe bet.
not_available Want an HIV test? We need the mom's permission.
not_available That won't happen.
not_available Likely he's positive.
not_available The mom or the court has to allow the test.
not_available We'll start him on Cefurox.
not_available HIV
not_available positive, goes ahead and has a baby.
not_available No support.
not_available What was she thinking? Films are back on the girl with the broken arm.

not_available Thanks.

not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Wait a second, I forgot.

not_available Feel okay? 
not_available I feel fine.
not_available On your way.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Oh, my God! That boy is relentless.
not_available I think his parents feel quite exhausted, huh? It seems like I need some stitches.
not_available I already irrigated.
not_available You were at the coffee place when it happened? I had just left.
not_available I don't even want to think about it.
not_available It seems most people came out okay.
not_available Miraculously.
not_available You took that little girl in to see her mother? Dr.
not_available Weaver and Dr.
not_available Greene thought it was a bad idea.
not_available They're not sure if I'm a good doctor.
not_available But it's the second or third time you've worked here.
not_available Enough time for them to stop calling me Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available When people are not sure, they tend to keep things more formal.
not_available I hope after I suture you you'll call me Luka.
not_available Children need to know, need to see.
not_available Even if it's not good, it's better than being in the dark.
not_available Having that kind of fear You sound experienced.
not_available My experience with children didn't help me with that boy.
not_available Are you busy? 
not_available No, I just got sutured.
not_available Their mother was in that accident.

not_available You gonna fight this? Dr.
not_available Weaver and I will see Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available We'll give our honest opinions.
not_available You'll fight it.
not_available Good.
not_available That baby needs to get up to Pedes.
not_available I'll go.
not_available The mom's in the ICU.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available Great.
not_available Long cup of coffee.
not_available He got paged.
not_available He left and came back.
not_available How'd it go? Who ever knows with interviews? I'm late for a lap choly.
not_available I'll take that back pain in 4.
not_available Sure.
not_available You need some help? I'm okay.
not_available Thanks anyway.
not_available I don't mean to pry.
not_available How are things with you and Elizabeth? You're still going out? 
not_available A little.
not_available Must I beg for information? 
not_available I'd hate to see that.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available I may have backed off a bit.
not_available So she's backed off.
not_available These things just have a life of their own, don't they? If that's not enough, beg.
not_available MVA, BMW vs.

not_available Can't believe you're old enough to be a doctor.
not_available No midline tenderness? Turn your head to the right.
not_available To the left.
not_available Full range of motion.
not_available You're clear.
not_available Can I get up? Is that better? 
not_available I guess you are old enough.
not_available So no neck pain? 
not_available My little finger, actually.
not_available I jammed it when I got on the gurney.
not_available Let's check them all out.
not_available Hand x
not_available ray? I'll go order it.
not_available Thank you, Chuny.
not_available We'll make sure it's not fractured.
not_available I guess I'll be here for a while.
not_available If that's all right.
not_available I can't really think how long it's been.
not_available Let's see, I divorced your cousin Douglas three years ago.
not_available I remember your wedding.
not_available You were there? Douglas looked nervous as hell.
not_available You looked incredible
not_available ly calm.
not_available That was the calm before the storm, given how our marriage went.
not_available Ancient history.
not_available But divorce suits me.
not_available So I assume you drive the BMW, not the Toyota.
not_available What makes you think that? X
not_available ray confirms pneumonia.
not_available Pneumocystis? 
not_available Looks more bacterial.
not_available Is this the Ortega baby? I'm Jeanie Boulet.
not_available Robert Martin, DCFS.
not_available How long will he be here? At least a few days.
not_available The longer the better.
not_available More time to place him.
not_available Any ideas where? 
not_available No.
not_available Cases like this are a mess.
not_available Dying mother with AIDS.
not_available Probably have to go to court.
not_available If he's positive? Families willing to take on a child of color with HIV? Not a dime a dozen.
not_available You're late.
not_available I'm with Family Counseling Services.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available Fine, but you're late.
not_available I'll get right to it.
not_available This, as you know, is a mediation.
not_available We want an agreement regarding your son's custody.
not_available I'm not a judge.
not_available This is confidential.
not_available Nothing said here can be used in court.
not_available Why can't we go to court? Because this is a court
not_available ordered mediation.
not_available Because you got a restraining order on me and Roger.
not_available Just on your taking him to Germany where he can't develop language skills.
not_available My son's deaf.
not_available Our son.
not_available He knows.
not_available Reece will be fine with an American sign language tutor.
not_available You have a tutor? 
not_available I will! And what if you don't? We're here to talk about your child's needs.
not_available He needs to be with his mother.
not_available And father.
not_available You gonna put him to bed on the sofa in your living room? He doesn't have his own room? 
not_available Of course he does.
not_available Since when? We moved in with my sister Jackie and her family so Reece could have much more of a complete family unit.
not_available As he would with us.
not_available His black mother and black stepfather.
not_available What's that mean? So I went out with a white woman? I'm just saying
not_available I can't do this.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Courtordered, remember? What's the prognosis? 
not_available Why are you in here? You said to wait in Chairs, so I found one.
not_available I didn't even know we had a chair.
not_available Is that me? Not much of a measure of a hand, is it? I mean, of what a hand can do.
not_available Looks too spindly.
not_available There's no fracture.
not_available That's good.
not_available So I'm free to go? I'll walk you out.
not_available Do you need a ride? I'll be taking cabs until my car gets fixed.
not_available I hoped for something more dramatic.
not_available A cast or a sling to get me out of this fundraiser tonight.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available The Carter Family Foundation.
not_available Even in divorce, Gamma has her claws into you? Why aren't you at these functions? 
not_available I got myself declawed.
not_available What is it? Save The Lake? Children's Library? Children's Art League.
not_available Can you call a cab for Miss Nichols? Sure.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available You are welcome.
not_available I'll be thinking of you.
not_available You will? Tonight, mixing it up with the rest of the Carters.
not_available Then I'll have to think of you.
not_available It was nice to see you again.
not_available John.
not_available Think Anspaugh's decided? If so many oppose Romano, how can he appoint him? Will there be enough? What if it's just you and me? 
not_available Don't think about it.
not_available He's eager, if not downright breathless.
not_available I'm not compelled to oppose him.
not_available As head of Radiology, I'll point out that no Radiology head's ever considered for chief of staff.
not_available But perhaps that's a topic for some other day.
not_available I see why we wait so long for x
not_available rays.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Carl? Up in Psych we run our own ship.
not_available Took six months to hear Donald had taken over.
not_available It won't rock my world.
not_available Romano's fine with me.
not_available How about you, Jack? 
not_available I'm like you.
not_available I've had enough bureaucratic crap.
not_available I already had one heart attack.
not_available I say, book the guy willing to take it on.
not_available I hate to be the voice of dissent.
not_available And it certainly isn't personal.
not_available I feel I should be honest.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available As acting chief of the ER for the past few months Dr.
not_available Romano has There hasn't been a great deal of support.
not_available His management style is I guess, abrupt.
not_available And several members of our staff have Well, they've even found it offensive.
not_available Go on.
not_available I guess I'd have to say that I'd worry if Dr.
not_available Romano had the responsibility of the entire staff and faculty.
not_available Thank you for your candor.
not_available Kerry? Anyone in management knows it's never easy taking over another department.
not_available There have been bumps in the road.
not_available But I feel Dr.
not_available Romano has succeeded in stabilizing the situation and is now providing genuine leadership in the ER.
not_available You'd support him as chief of staff? It's only fair we give him all our support.
not_available You hung me out to dry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It was obvious he'd get the job.
not_available He'd take it out on the ER if I'd fought.
not_available It was politically smart.
not_available You were smart while I was stupid and honest.
not_available Stop! I'm only trying to protect the department.
not_available You believe that? I don't.
not_available Don has the dullest meetings.
not_available No wonder we need a kick of java.
not_available So? What do you think? Got the Remington heave
not_available ho.
not_available New look, new job.
not_available Kerry, there's something I want to discuss with you.
not_available Are my glasses at your place? 
not_available We can check later.
not_available What else did he say? 
not_available Carlos is hard to place.
not_available Because he's HIV
not_available positive.
not_available I can't tell them.
not_available I ordered the test illegally.
not_available You'd think they'd want to know.
not_available I know.
not_available I'd be the perfect foster mom for this baby.
not_available I can deal with HIV.
not_available You'd be perfect.
not_available The DCFS wouldn't agree, with my HIV status.
not_available You're healthier than most people in the city.
not_available Yeah, but I'm not married
not_available Yet.
not_available There's no support for him if something happens to me.
not_available Yet.
not_available Reggie.
not_available We can take care of that right now.
not_available I gotta get back to work.
not_available Not until you agree to marry me.
not_available You don't think I'm serious? 
not_available You're crazy.
not_available Will you marry me? 
not_available Good job.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Your meeting with Anspaugh.
not_available How'd you know? 
not_available Nurses know everything.
not_available You fought the good fight.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Lot of good it did us.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available I was just heading out.
not_available I think that we should talk.
not_available We've talked enough.
not_available It's something else.

not_available How's he doing? Better.
not_available Fever's down.
not_available He's resting.
not_available Good.
not_available Any news on his mom? I didn't realize she has end
not_available stage AIDS.
not_available Let's start him on the triple cocktail.
not_available He hasn't even been tested.
not_available Start him.
not_available Seen Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available He left for the night.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I hear Romano will be chief.
not_available I haven't announced it yet but he made me chief of the ER.
not_available As they search for a permanent? 
not_available No.
not_available Actually, I am the permanent.
not_available Congratulations! 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks for telling me.
not_available I think it's inappropriate to continue renting you my basement apartment.
not_available Whoever's there should be from outside the department.
not_available You want me to move? 
not_available Take your time.
not_available A week or two.
not_available Looking for something? No, just putting back this suture kit.
not_available You don't keep the opened ones but the scissors weren't used.
not_available Seems such a waste to throw them away.
not_available You okay? After that trauma? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I feel pretty lucky.
not_available Good.
not_available Luka, whatever Greene and Weaver think You're a good doctor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What was it you said? "I'll be thinking of you tonight"? I guess I meant it.
not_available How do you like Jeeps? It's not a BMW.
not_available It's also not a cab.
not_available I like Jeeps.
not_available I thought maybe we'd get a drink.
not_available I don't really want a drink.
not_available Can I talk to you? I checked on the anaphylactic shock.
not_available Her respiratory rate and pulse are down.
not_available The hematuria's going to Medicine.
not_available We can discharge the dermatitis.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Should I do any extra reading tonight? I'm afraid I can't continue mentoring you.
not_available I've been appointed permanent chief of ER.
not_available That's good.
not_available It may seem like favoritism if I mentor one student over another.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene may have time.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene has a call.
not_available Take a message.
not_available He left.
not_available It's his father.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's mother has died.
not_available Hello, can I help you? So this is how American males vent anger and frustration? I figured a Romano/Weaver double homicide was overkill.
not_available How'd you find me? 
not_available I have my sources.
not_available I heard about the meeting.
not_available I committed career suicide.
not_available Opened the door for Kerry to be chief.

not_available All right.
not_available Like this? Nice! Smack it.

not_available Here it comes.
not_available Very good.
