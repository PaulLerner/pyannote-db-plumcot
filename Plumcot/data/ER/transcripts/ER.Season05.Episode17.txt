not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Grab your coat.
not_available Tried to eat the lovebirds at the Delaware.
not_available You were right.
not_available She's crazy.
not_available Really psychotic.
not_available She's combative.
not_available She locked herself in.
not_available We'll try Haldol before we call for the bolt cutters.
not_available One, two, three Does she think she's a hawk or? Hawks attack with claws, not their teeth.
not_available Why is she staring? 
not_available She likes you.
not_available No, your gaze is threatening her.
not_available Look away! I'll look away, fine.
not_available You're looking at it now on Nicole's lovely wrist.
not_available It's a winner.
not_available It's a knockout.
not_available It really is.
not_available It's memorable.
not_available It's a bracelet you'll want to wear every day.
not_available It's bold and beautiful.
not_available You know what else? It's reversible.
not_available Flip it over for me, Nicole.
not_available Watch the other side.
not_available It's gorgeous.
not_available Why should I wait for Jerry? 
not_available He likes this stuff.
not_available What stuff? 
not_available These strange dudes.
not_available They're called "patients." I'm not waiting.
not_available Mr.
not_available IKornberg? Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Likewise.
not_available Here you go.
not_available He twisted his knee wrestling.
not_available At 3 in the morning? No, last night's match.
not_available It wasn't so bad until I got up to pee.
not_available Okay, let's take a look.
not_available A flying drop kick? 
not_available Jackknife power bomb.
not_available I thought you guys didn't get hurt.
not_available What do you mean? Come on.
not_available Everybody knows wrestling's fake.
not_available Who are you calling fake? 
not_available That's enough.
not_available You, man.
not_available It's all rehearsed.
not_available You and your boys are a bunch of fakes.
not_available Is that right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll show you fake.
not_available Hey, man! Hey! Stop it! 
not_available Hey! Mr.
not_available IKornberg, I said put him down right now! Call Security! I need some help here! Malik, are you all right? We got you good, didn't we? Oh, man.
not_available I wish Jerry could've seen this.
not_available Sorry.
not_available He wanted to do that.
not_available Sit down.
not_available What happened to her son? 
not_available They just left.
not_available They said they'd be back.
not_available Great timing.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Fong, don't worry.
not_available You're fine.
not_available We're taking you to your room.
not_available Is everything all right? 
not_available Yes, everything's fine.
not_available Did my mother have another seizure? She doesn't remember we left.
not_available She's fine.
not_available She just got back from her head CT.
not_available It's best if you stay close.
not_available It's difficult to find an interpreter.
not_available We had to get Pao Chi.
not_available The what? 
not_available To settle her stomach.
not_available She shouldn't take that now.
not_available Herbs will make her feel better.
not_available If you don't mind, I'd rather wait for the test results before giving her anything.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Haldol's kicked in and Maintenance will cut the cage.
not_available Psych should be down soon.
not_available Yo, John! Gotta go! Okay! 
not_available Sorry to dump her.
not_available It's our job.
not_available Are you stealing those supplies? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I didn't think so.
not_available Malik.
not_available Ah, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Yeah.
not_available About Mr.
not_available IKornberg.
not_available I asked him.
not_available He could've said no.
not_available You want a patient with a bad knee to do tricks? That's what they do.
not_available He's a major contender.
not_available He's the man! 
not_available Okay, let's break it up.
not_available One more for my mom? Here we go! Jerry! 
not_available Okay.
not_available That's it for now.
not_available No, that's it, period.
not_available Looking good, man! Ready to take on Hybrid? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Malik.
not_available I can handle this on my own.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'm sorry about all this attention.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm used to it.
not_available You have bleeding inside the knee.
not_available I'm gonna numb it and tap the joint.
not_available Should decrease some of the pain.
not_available I've had that done before.
not_available This isn't your first injury? 
not_available You name it, I broke it.
not_available Sounds like a rough sport.
not_available Living on the road most of the year and getting mauled by 40,000 fans that's rough.
not_available I've surfed by on cable.
not_available It seems like a profession for showoffs.
not_available You don't like the celebrity, huh? 
not_available Just give them what they want.
not_available What would you rather do? 
not_available You'd laugh if I told you.
not_available I will try not to.
not_available Live in Montana.
not_available Lots of land.
not_available Peace and quiet.
not_available Really? You'd raise cattle? 
not_available I'd like to have a farm.
not_available Grow sugar beets.
not_available Really? 
not_available Go ahead and laugh.
not_available I'm not.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I do.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now, does that feel better? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available You gonna wake Maloney? 
not_available No, he only gets up for admissions and code blues.
not_available Want me to talk to them? No.
not_available I can do it.
not_available And if she does? Mr.
not_available And Mrs.
not_available Fong, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
not_available Emily, go inside and keep 
not_available In a minute.
not_available It would be better if 
not_available It's okay, Dad.
not_available Yes, Miss IKnight? Your mother has a tumor in her lung which has spread to her brain.
not_available That's what caused the seizures.
not_available It's advanced cancer.
not_available Oh, my God! I know this is difficult to take in.
not_available We've known about it for a year.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? 
not_available You were away at school.
not_available You couldn't call? Maybe if you take some time to discuss 
not_available We didn't want to upset you.
not_available Not knowing is worse.
not_available I'll come back and review the results with your mother, okay? 
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available My mother doesn't know.
not_available You haven't told her? We're not going to tell her.
not_available She should be getting treatment from an oncologist.
not_available I don't understand why you're doing this.
not_available It'll only depress her.
not_available She'll die sooner for knowing.
not_available Radiation therapy can help her life and stop seizures.
not_available But she has to be informed.
not_available We're not telling her, and we don't want you to.
not_available You're right, Miss IKnight.
not_available You do not understand.
not_available Can't talk to them when they're like this.
not_available Like what? 
not_available Traditional.
not_available I guess that's the polite word.
not_available What's her prognosis? It's a stage
not_available four cancer.
not_available What does that mean? She probably has a few months.
not_available I wish they'd told me.
not_available I could've spent more time with her.
not_available You mentioned treatment? Radiation, maybe chemo.
not_available But we can't treat her if we can't tell her.
not_available We think she'll lose her will to live.
not_available And what do you think? You think she'd want to know? 
not_available She's a tough lady.
not_available She'd want to fight this.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available Mr.
not_available IKingsley, vomiting since 2 a.m.
not_available I ate the steak tartare at Fletcher's.
not_available Never again.
not_available A steak what? 
not_available Raw beef, raw egg yolk.
not_available Five of Compazine, liter of saline.
not_available Is that who I think it is? 
not_available You know IKornberg? IKnow him? He's the best since Freddie Blassie.
not_available Freddie who? Used to bite the hell out of his opponents' foreheads! In the '60s.
not_available Oh, you're too young.
not_available Jerry? I thought I told you to leave Mr.
not_available IKornberg alone.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I'm taking him to Radiology.
not_available And Transport? They were backed up.
not_available I thought I'd help out.
not_available Remember that payper
not_available view when Jericho hit your shoulder and you went down for two? But you came back with that jackhammer side slam, right? That's right.
not_available IKornberg's the bomb! 
not_available Jerry! Why not wrestle tag team? You and Stinger would be unbeatable.
not_available He's got that corner drop that's like I called the floor.
not_available A bed will be ready at 7.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Fong, who do you want to make decisions about your health? She says to talk to my father.
not_available Maybe we shouldn't do this.
not_available For any news about your condition, who do you want us to talk to? She says a year ago my father told her she had tuberculosis.
not_available They told her that instead of cancer.
not_available Cancer? Repeat! Unit 47 requesting police backup, 3800 block of Drexel.
not_available Sons of bitches! Threatened to burn my building! 
not_available Sit, Mr.
not_available Leonelli.
not_available We still might, to keep warm! 
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Why not call the cops? Because, they'd haul his ass to jail! Landlords can get away with it! Shut up, Felonia! Pay your rent! 
not_available Take the other side.
not_available You can't turn the heat off! My grandmother's freezing! Get a job, dumbass! You're the dumbass! Back off! Let's get him out of here! They're throwing bricks! Look at this! Turn the heat on! Pay your rent, I'll turn it on! Hey! Hey! Hey! Throw your beer bottles! That's what you do with the rent? Get in! Get in! Go! Go! Take it easy! This isn't helping! Get back!

not_available You wouldn't listen.
not_available This is your fault.
not_available All your fault! Out of the way! Please! RA 47, still waiting for police backup.
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available Now you're talking.
not_available Lars okay? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Units rolling.

not_available He's having trouble getting through.
not_available They want you, not him.
not_available Go, Carter, go! Get out of here! How do you work the PA? 
not_available Bottom button.
not_available Stand away from the vehicle! Coming through here.
not_available Step back from the vehicle.
not_available Stand back! Coming through! Get off the car! Nice and easy.
not_available Stop! Stop! What was that? I don't know.
not_available Ran over something.
not_available Must have been the curb! Look out the back! Give me some room! 
not_available There's a guy down.
not_available Oh, God! Did I run him over? I don't know! 
not_available We gotta stop.

not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Another headache? 
not_available Same as yesterday.
not_available Did it ever go away? 
not_available In the afternoon.
not_available You should let me do a CT.
not_available I don't need a head CT, Mark.
not_available At least let me do a neuro exam.
not_available Stop thinking like a doctor.
not_available We know what's causing my headaches.
not_available How's your insomnia? It's gone.
not_available You talk to him? No.
not_available We both thought it was better not calling for a while, you know? Give it some time.
not_available You don't need me to tell you this, but it's okay to miss him.
not_available Hell, I miss him.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I actually like coming to work.
not_available Really? Now I am worried about you.
not_available Move over.
not_available Hey, these guys saved my ass.
not_available A great job.
not_available Lf you'd turned on the heat we wouldn't have had to.
not_available Carter.
not_available No neurodeficits.
not_available Just a head lac.
not_available What happened? Mr.
not_available Leonelli decided to instigate some civil unrest.
not_available Typical angry mob thing.
not_available They started it! Dispatch, what unit was sent to 38th and Drexel? Are they still on the scene? What's their ETA? 
not_available Here, you should change that.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Follow my finger with your eyes.
not_available Good.
not_available This will teach them a lesson, eh? 
not_available You need to deal with them better.
not_available Carter, outside.
not_available What do you know? They don't pay their rent! They leave a mess! Turning off the heat will solve that? Carter, outside, now! Is there a problem? 
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available The problem's with you.
not_available Cool off and I'll finish him up.
not_available Go on.
not_available Will she wake up? 
not_available It's hard to say.
not_available If she does, will there be permanent damage? There could be some confusion or memory loss.
not_available She could've had a stroke.
not_available I want to talk to a more senior physician.
not_available I'm not happy with her care.
not_available Everything was done properly, Mr.
not_available Fong.
not_available A Medicine Attending will see her upstairs and we'll check back in a while.
not_available It was a championship tag team match.
not_available This giant of a guy twirls him around.
not_available Then, suddenly he stops, picks him up, threw him down I took Mr.

not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks, Yosh.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Pleasure to welcome the day shift.
not_available What's with the boxes? 
not_available They're for Pedes.
not_available Why aren't they in the Pedes room? They're addressed to Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available So should I keep them or forward them? 
not_available We still see kids, Jerry.
not_available Even before we had a Pedes.
not_available Jerry, help me with the boxes.
not_available IKerry, how was the graveyard shift? Fairly typical.
not_available A few strange dudes, as Malik would say including Dr.

not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, we're talking about you.

not_available He just sounded concerned.
not_available Well, I've had every conversation with Al I'll ever need to have.

not_available I should do that.
not_available Not a good idea.
not_available Right.
not_available I did it.

not_available It's my responsibility.
not_available But remember you're this kid's doctor first.
not_available Okay? Only talk about his medical condition.
not_available Carter, I want you, Zadro and Audia to find me and fill me in on exactly what happened, okay? I'll defend you to the police, hospital administration fire department and the media, if necessary.

not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Avery's pelvis is broken with some internal bleeding.
not_available Do you have to operate? 
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available A radiologist will use a catheter to stop the bleeding.
not_available Hey, Avery.
not_available For how long? 
not_available An hour or so.
not_available They said an ambulance ran him over.
not_available Is that right? 
not_available I believe so.
not_available How could that happen, huh? We'll know more about his condition soon.
not_available I'm sorry to bug you, but I'm gonna bug somebody because somebody has to pay for that.
not_available Thank you very much, doctor, okay? 
not_available Looks good, Debbie.
not_available Any pain? 
not_available It kind of throbs.

not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Jerry, who is that big guy over there in Curtain Two? 
not_available That's IKornberg.
not_available Oh, right, that's who it is.
not_available I hate to be such a girl, but who's IKornberg? Used to play for the Denver Broncos.
not_available I'll be in the Suture Room.
not_available Obviously, Dr.
not_available Greene is not a wrestling fan.
not_available Jerry, hand me a pen, please.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Pharmacy's on the second floor.

not_available Jerry, what did you do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available It's the bathroom alarm.
not_available What? 
not_available Trauma hallway.
not_available Intercom doesn't work.
not_available Oh, God, I sent Mr.
not_available IKingsley in there for a stool sample.
not_available Mr.
not_available IKingsley? 
not_available He didn't feel well.
not_available It's probably just a false alarm, right? Mr.
not_available IKingsley? 
not_available Mr.
not_available IKingsley, are you all right? 
not_available Let me see.
not_available It's locked.
not_available Where's the key? I'm supposed to have it? 
not_available Call Security, maybe he passed out.
not_available Or had an MI.
not_available He might be dead.
not_available Jerry! Mr.
not_available IKingsley! We need to get this door open right now.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Stand back.

not_available He's dehydrated.
not_available We need to get him on IV fluids.

not_available Carter, is this the kid? How's he doing? You know what? Hang on one second.
not_available Mr.
not_available Leonelli I just wanted to apologize.
not_available In all the excitement earlier, I got a little heated.
not_available I didn't mean to take it out on you.
not_available IKid, I got thicker skin than that.
not_available Be a hell of a day when I let a sweet do
not_available gooder baby doc get to me.
not_available Right.
not_available So, feeling better? 
not_available Feeling great.

not_available Be up in a couple of months.
not_available Thank God! Nice work.
not_available We needed a good outcome on this.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Carol's looking for you.
not_available All right.
not_available Why'd you even try that?

not_available IKind of like signing autographs? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't want any hurt feelings.
not_available IKeep everybody happy.
not_available Even if you're not happy? 
not_available I never thought about it.
not_available I was always "the big guy." Played football and wrestled.
not_available Friends ask me to help them move always ask me to play Santa Claus.
not_available So you do.
not_available Has he said anything? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Sheriff said he hasn't spoken since his first day in jail.
not_available Can you undo that, please? 
not_available Sure.

not_available Mr.
not_available Fong, I'm just trying to help your mother.
not_available All I'm asking you to do is to tell her that she had a seizure.
not_available She wants to know why.
not_available What you've experienced is fairly common, so don't worry.
