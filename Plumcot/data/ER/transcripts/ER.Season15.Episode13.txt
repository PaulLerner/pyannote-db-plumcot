not_available Jody, what really happened today?.
not_available Were you trying to hurt yourself?.
not_available Hey, so you guys done or what?.
not_available Yeah, we' re done.
not_available So you think we could handle triplets?.
not_available It's a non
not_available issue.
not_available Twins, okay.
not_available But triplets?.
not_available Even if all four follicles produce eggs the chance of three of them becoming high
not_available grade embryos is next to zero.
not_available One step at a time.
not_available We've made it this far.
not_available Yeah, well, this is the hard part.
not_available We have to be realistic.
not_available Who says I'm not?.
not_available Don't be disappointed if it doesn't work out.
not_available Of course I'll be disappointed, but I'll be okay.
not_available Cate, what we have now, especially these last few months I already feel pretty damn lucky.
not_available Sure, you do.
not_available No, I'm serious.
not_available You and me.
not_available It's enough.
not_available You know that, right?.
not_available You don't think it's gonna work out?.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available If you didn't want me to do lVF, you should have said way before now.
not_available I can't win here.
not_available No.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Baby, I'm already rearranging furniture in my mind thinking about where to put a crib.
not_available But you?.
not_available You're the most pragmatic person I know.
not_available The fact that we're here, in the face of all kind of discouraging evidence means that deep down, you believe we have a chance too.
not_available I don't know what made me think this could work.
not_available You don't have to understand it.
not_available Just hold on to it.
not_available Triplets would kill us.
not_available You.
not_available Not me.
not_available Jody's not telling the whole story.
not_available Probably won't with her boyfriend.
not_available Coffee?.
not_available Can't vouch for how long it's been sitting here.
not_available Sure.
not_available You know, maybe I should go back in there and try again.
not_available Or maybe when Jody's parents get here, she'll say
not_available What?.
not_available Bad idea?.
not_available If there was something I didn't want my parents to know.
not_available You exercised your right to remain silent.
not_available My father says me interrogating suspects as a detective will be karmic payback.
not_available You're getting really good at that.
not_available Much better than the other interns.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Hairy lice guy?.
not_available Very lame trying to butter me up.
not_available What?.
not_available I wasn't doing that.
not_available lt was pretty obvious.
not_available How am I gonna get out of this?.
not_available Oh, I don't know, be resourceful.
not_available Joey, let me help you with that.
not_available This is so frustrating.
not_available Can't do much if she won't talk.
not_available Maybe Psych can get it out of her.
not_available I'm sorry, I have to roll.
not_available If anything changes with Jody, call me.
not_available Or just call me.
not_available I will.
not_available Excuse me, we're here for our daughter, Jody Nugent.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, these are Jody's parents.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available I treated Jody.
not_available MRS.
NUGENT How is she?.
not_available She has a separated shoulder and a minor concussion.
not_available You should be able to take her if our psychiatrist clears her.
not_available Psychiatrist?.
not_available I have some concerns about what happened.
not_available What kind of concerns?.
not_available Our daughter's not nuts.
not_available No, I didn't say that, but her story doesn't fit
not_available Her story?.
not_available Now she's a liar?.
not_available That's not what I'm saying.
not_available Now, look.

not_available Tony
not_available I don't wanna be one of those couples who never get it right and never work through the tough times.
not_available We have something worth saving and I'd be an idiot if I didn't try to convince you of that.
not_available Did you realize that before or after you had sex with Daria?.
not_available It was one time, Sam.
not_available And it didn't feel right.
not_available It just
not_available It made me miss you more.
not_available Oh, flattering, really.
not_available lt was a mistake.
not_available Mm
not_available mm.
not_available The mistake is thinking we can put the past behind us and start fresh.
not_available We can.
not_available No, we can't.
not_available Because you're never gonna change.
