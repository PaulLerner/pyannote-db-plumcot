not_available No, no, it's not a foreign body, it's a ruptured globe.
not_available I tripped and some jerk stomped on my face.
not_available Something penetrated your eyeball.
not_available It's bleeding inside.
not_available Am I gonna be blind?

not_available Okay.
not_available How'd this happen? 
not_available I was cutting the lawn.
not_available I was having problems with the mower.
not_available I was running out of gas so I tried to refill the tank without shutting the engine off.
not_available I don't really remember what happened.
not_available I blacked out.
not_available There's a reason it's called an internal combustion engine.
not_available You managed to make it an external.
not_available You gonna be able to sew my fingers back on? Do you have them? Good luck.
not_available She's bleeding inside her lungs.

not_available Morris.
not_available I saw the blood tests.
not_available Relax.
not_available All right, good.
not_available We got severe pulmonary contusions, hypoxia with PEEP.
not_available And we switched to an oscillator.
not_available You can be better utilized outside.
not_available Have you taken a look at the x
not_available ray? Patient is critical.
not_available So are 10 other patients who have a chance.
not_available You're wasting time and resources trying to save a dead girl.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available With the extent of her hemorrhaging, her chances of survival are almost nil.
not_available So, what? You just give up on her? 
not_available We're not giving up.
not_available We're giving her the best care.
not_available Leave.
not_available I don't want you in here.
not_available He's doing fine.
not_available Please, continue.
not_available I will.
not_available She's bradying down.
not_available Lost her pulse.
not_available All right, PEA.
not_available She was fine until you came in here.
not_available Sir, please get out of the way.
not_available This is your fault.

not_available Clots in left upper quadrant.
not_available Pack off the spleen.
not_available No, she had impact on the right.
not_available Pack the liver first.
not_available And that's your call.
not_available Yeah, damn right it is.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Please have somebody call down if you hear anything.
not_available Is she out of surgery? Yo, Taggart.
not_available Got a live one for you.
not_available Found him in the street, directing traffic.
not_available Well, I was just trying to calm the masses.
not_available There was so much negative energy that nobody could feel the universal connection that we all have.
not_available Right, what are you on, buddy? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available You know, when I touch you like this we are exchanging matter on a subatomic particle level.
not_available I don't know where your atoms have been.
not_available Keep them to yourself.
not_available What's this? 
not_available I'm thinking acid trip.
not_available Oh, you would be wrong.
not_available LSD is a man
not_available made chemical and psilocybin is a gift from God.
not_available Oh
not_available ho.
not_available The magic of mushrooms.
not_available Yes, that is corr Look at this.
not_available Your shirt is breathing.
not_available All right, you're freaking him out.
not_available Ho.
not_available No.
not_available How's your doctor friend doing? 
not_available It's too soon to tell.
not_available We're all thinking about her.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Ho
not_available ho.
not_available Oh, this is so good.
not_available No, don't stop.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you have any medical problems? No.
not_available My skin becomes transparent, occasionally.
not_available I can see my organs, but I'll going to get a urine tox screen and find him a comfy bed.
not_available Dive, dive! 
not_available Don't touch that.
not_available You'd better hold my hand if you don't want me to just float away.
not_available I'll hold your hand, sir.
not_available Oh.
not_available I can feel the love you have for your friend.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available Any other victims? 
not_available No, I think we got most of them.
not_available No shrapnel or blast injuries? 
not_available It wasn't a bomb.
not_available There was an explosion.
not_available I heard it.
not_available People saw smoke.
not_available It was on the news.
not_available Bomb squad figures it was some guy setting off fireworks or something.
not_available Well, it had to be at least an M
not_available 80.
not_available Whatever it was, it wasn't the terrorists.
not_available Not today.
not_available Complex, stellate liver laceration.
not_available It's a bear
not_available claw injury.
not_available You'll never repair that.
not_available What? Why? What do you mean? Bovie.
not_available Bleeding too briskly.
not_available Bovie can't even coagulate.
not_available Well, what else can you do? Get me the argon
not_available beam coagulator.
not_available The thing to do is pack up the liver, put in a Bogota bag, close her up.
not_available We'll come back in two days for repair.
not_available Two days? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't want biliary leaks or abscess formation.
not_available Lap pads.
not_available Can't screw around while she bleeds.
not_available You can't try to repair the liver? We would have to clamp the artery less than an hour before the liver died.
not_available Can you do it in an hour? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes, yes, we can try.
not_available Where's my argon? 
not_available Ready in a minute.
not_available Stop.
not_available You're not helping.
not_available That makes two of us.
not_available I don't know what you're getting at.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Perhaps you should just shut up, both of you.
not_available Lucien, can the repair be done? 
not_available Yeah, yes, it can.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Crenshaw's gonna do it.
not_available What? 
not_available You're too close to this.
not_available You know I'm right so let him operate you'll assist and I'll keep time, okay? Okay, you.
not_available How's it going here? 
not_available Hand service can take him in an hour.
not_available Good.
not_available Can I get something to drink? Chuny, why don't you get him some ice chips.
not_available All right.
not_available So whose? Whose lawn were you cutting? 
not_available Mine.
not_available Yours.
not_available All right.
not_available Says here you live on Halstead.
not_available Not a lot of lawns out there on Halstead, right? There's some grass around the building, on the side.
not_available Right.
not_available So, what are you, the super? No, but sometimes I help out.
not_available So you help out the super cut the lawns on the side of the? 
not_available He's old.
not_available I feel sorry for him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, there are a lot of hospitals between Halstead and County.
not_available That's my stuff.
not_available Right.
not_available I stopped by a friend's house around here.
not_available She told me I needed to go to the hospital.
not_available What are you doing? Doesn't smell like gasoline, does it? 
not_available Smell that.
not_available That smell like gasoline? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't spill it.
not_available Does it smell like gas? 
not_available No! Smells like black powder, doesn't it? What's this? A lighter.
not_available Your chart says you don't smoke, but what's that? What was it? M80? Cherry bomb? What? Where you going? 
not_available You're crazy.
not_available Get back in bed.
not_available No.
not_available What are you doing? Where the docs don't sniff your Oh, yeah? What's your problem? 
not_available You know what my problem is, ass? All these people are here because of you.
not_available Look at this girl.
not_available Look at that girl.
not_available You see that? This is your fault.
not_available Look at him.
not_available Look at him, huh? That's because of you.
not_available Tony! What are you doing? This guy, you see him? 
not_available Tony, calm down.
not_available Use your brain.
not_available You killed people.
not_available Do you understand? Look over there.
not_available Look at that little girl.
not_available You killed that girl.
not_available All right? You killed people.
not_available You understand that? Are you supposed to be a tough guy? Where'd you hear that? 
not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available Word on the street.
not_available Mm.
not_available Seems you have a history of violence whenever your vocabulary is overtaxed.
not_available That happens with alarming frequency.
not_available Look around.
not_available Every bed has a patient because of that jackass.
not_available Not to mention Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not to mention.
not_available You think a dalliance with a coworker mitigates the situation? Is that what you think? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You don't know.
not_available It doesn't.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You attacked a patient.
not_available Who caused a riot that messed up a lot of people.
not_available That has been established.
not_available For what? For nothing.
not_available Because he thought it was fun.
not_available I don't care! I don't care! I don't care if he attacked your crippled, blind mother.
not_available You are not gonna get away with this stuff anymore.
not_available You understand me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you? 
not_available Yes, sir, I do.
not_available I will check myself next time this happens.
not_available You can check yourself in the ICU.
not_available What? There are lots of lessons for a guy like you up there.
not_available Trust me.
not_available You're kidding? 
not_available No, I'm not kidding you.
not_available The ICU forces one especially an ex
not_available paramedic, ER doc like yourself to slow down and to think.
not_available People are dying up there, often in excruciatingly slow ways " so" you won't really have much choice.
not_available We're at 52 minutes.
not_available Okay, release the Pringle.
not_available Let's see if the dam holds.
not_available How's the liver look? Not bad.
not_available Not bad at all.
not_available Minimal oozing.
not_available Systolic's holding at 110.
not_available It was a sound approach, Lucien.
not_available Well, you executed it well.
not_available Let's hope that her brain was sufficiently perfused.
not_available We'll see how she wakes up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Crenshaw, brachial artery repair is ready for you in 2.
not_available Care to finish? 
not_available Yes, I would.
not_available A few big liver sutures and simple closure.
not_available I'll be in O.R.
not_available 2 if you need me.
not_available And I have to get back downstairs.
not_available So I'll "just " I'll check on her later.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll let you know when she's in Recovery.
not_available What's the word on Neela? She took 10 units of blood.
not_available Yeah, they're still working on her.
not_available Take a deep breath and let it out.
not_available Another deep breath.
not_available Let it out.
not_available Now you're gonna feel some discomfort " but" it's not going to bother you, because you're in your safe place.
not_available Hey, you old stoner, what are you doing? Well, it's a Colles' fracture, I've reduced and casted.
not_available What? You what? This is embarrassing.
not_available I've neglected to introduce myself properly.
not_available I am James Broderick.
not_available I'm the chair of Orthopedics at St.
not_available Raphael's Hospital.
not_available You're a doctor? One of the leading orthopods in the country, yes.
not_available And you are doctor? 
not_available Morris.
not_available Morris, yes.
not_available Why don't we get you back to a bed.
not_available And maybe it's best if you don't touch anyone else.
not_available I don't mean to brag, but I am here now.
not_available And there are those who feel I have a certain gift.
not_available Well, save it for Christmas.
not_available We're good at this ourselves.
not_available You're not licensed to practice in this hospital.
not_available Will you show this gentleman back to his bed, please? 
not_available This way, sir.
not_available Sure.
not_available But I am internationally renowned.
not_available Don't let him drift away.
not_available He's on a beach.
not_available Look at that cast.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available Looks nice.
not_available I didn't do it.
not_available Who did? 
not_available A patient.
not_available Fast learner.
not_available Hey, I heard Moretti reassigned you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's only temporary.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available So, what's happening in surgery? She's had a hard time maintaining her BP.
not_available They said she's in renal failure.
not_available I'm calling.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available They're in the middle of surgery.
not_available Let them do their thing.
not_available Who's there with her? 
not_available Crenshaw and Dubenko.
not_available She's in good hands.
not_available Abby's there too.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Is she all right? Yeah.
not_available She in Recovery? They just They repaired the liver.
not_available Her vitals are stable, and Dubenko was closing up.
not_available She awake? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available With the arrest and hypotension, probably be a while.
not_available Yeah, that's what they said.
not_available Well, that's great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, where's Mussolini? He said he needed me down here.
not_available He gave me these to give you.
not_available You're not to see "him " until they are all disposed.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mm.
not_available All right, watch your step.
not_available Easy now.
not_available Melman? Melman.
not_available Where the hell did we put Melman? You're not lost, are you? Lf you need directions, you know 
not_available No, no.
not_available You know why we're here? Because of war.
not_available Without it, you would be a pediatrician or an oncologist " and" I'd probably still be losing my mind in the ICU.
not_available War, huh? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Emergency medicine is actually the result of centuries of warfare.
not_available It's a field that was defined by doctors and nurses in bombed
not_available out buildings trying to take care of patients on dirty canvas stretchers.
not_available And performing procedures in tent hospitals that were literally hundreds of feet away from where the battles raged.
not_available And these people, our predecessors they had a simple primary focus.
not_available Survival.
not_available And down in the bunkers, they dug in deep " to" try to save their patient's lives, and to try to save their own lives.
not_available And they ended up giving life to this whole new art form this great collaborative enterprise that we still carry on today.
not_available That's why we're here.
not_available You don't get out much, do you? If you can't take the bunker, get out of the trauma room.
not_available Ha.
not_available I hope, I hope you're not talking about me.
not_available Heh.
not_available No.
not_available If I can't manage this floor during a mass
not_available cas then what good am I? Every day is not the bunker.
not_available Most days aren't, in fact.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I guess every war teaches us something, right? I wonder what we'll learn from this one.
not_available Hey, stop it.
not_available Somebody call Security.
not_available Stop that.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Get off of him.
not_available You killed her.
MORETTl Hey, come on, come on.

not_available No pulse.
not_available He's not breathing.
not_available She's ready for an ABG on 5 liters.
not_available No problem.
not_available Hey, how's she doing? 
not_available Pressure's up, hematocrit's 32.
not_available Hi, Mayday.
not_available That's good.
not_available She'll be sleeping for a while.
not_available It's probably best if you wait out here.
not_available I have several pages of postop orders to write.
not_available Be an hour before she's ready for visitors.
not_available I'll just I'll wait out here, okay? 
not_available Check a repeat HemoCue in 15 minutes.
not_available Got it.

not_available No, call PR.
not_available That's extension 456.

not_available Hello? Didn't I just talk to you and tell you we already have digital television? Criminy.
not_available Telemarketers.
not_available Hey, Frank.
not_available Heard Neela's in recovery.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have confirmation on that.
not_available Is she awake? 
not_available Negative.
not_available Look, it's irrelevant, right? 
not_available Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.
not_available I mean, it'd be weird if she was awake this soon.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Sam was about to go up there.
not_available She wondered if anybody wanted to go with her.
not_available Any news? Vitals are stable, crits are okay.
not_available She hasn't woken up yet.
not_available How much longer is it gonna be? Oh, waking up takes awhile after all that anesthesia.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Has anybody seen her? 
not_available I saw her on her way to Recovery.
not_available She looked okay.
not_available Can we go in? Not yet.
not_available Dubenko said he'll let us know.
not_available So I guess we wait.
not_available I'm calling for pizza.
not_available Who's in? 
not_available Cool.
not_available Pratt, you buying? 
not_available No, no, I'm not.
not_available Sure, you are.
