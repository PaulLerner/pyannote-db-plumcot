not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available The toilet's overflowing.
not_available What? 
not_available In the women's bathroom.
not_available It's going all over the floor.
not_available Sounds like a call for Maintenance.
not_available I'm just the R.A.

not_available It's getting bad.
not_available I'm calling to confirm an 8 a.m.

not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't worry, you'll knock them dead.
not_available Uh
not_available oh.
not_available What did she do wrong? 
not_available Me? See a med student in two hours early, she must have screwed something up.
not_available She's checking her labs from yesterday.
not_available Just for fun.
not_available I just want to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
not_available Don't burn out.
not_available She's the Resident's pet.
not_available I am not! 
not_available She got an IV her first day.
not_available So I was lucky.
not_available Good morning, all.
not_available Good morning.

not_available If you need me to sign off on any procedures Check your calendar, Kerry.
not_available My probation was for 30 days.
not_available I'm a free man again.
not_available Thirty working days, Doug.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Check on that.
not_available I'm sure you will.
not_available I got him.
not_available Good luck upstairs.
not_available Come on.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Dad, hi.
not_available How's the sailing? I think Gamma's being dramatic.
not_available Because it's not a slum, it's a dorm.
not_available Well, Dad, it pays the rent.
not_available I said, it pays the rent.
not_available No, I'm not turning my back.
not_available Because I'm still a doctor.
not_available It's just not clear whether they'll be able to pay me this year.
not_available The R.A.
not_available Position is for Residents.
not_available No, there's student advising and counseling.
not_available It's, you know, practically a faculty position.
not_available And it feels good to pay my own way.
not_available Dad? Dad? Hello? Hello? Yosh, I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm so excited.
not_available They said yes! They said yes? Yes! You're hot stuff! 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mark, thank you so much.
not_available They said yes.
not_available To your proposal? Thanks to Mark's letter of support.
not_available I just told the truth.
not_available I said your clinic deserved a salaried RN.
not_available There you go, baby.
not_available Why's it flashing? 
not_available Calling on the landline.
not_available He's learning the radio.
not_available Are you taking the EMS job? I haven't decided yet.
not_available Just touch the screen.
not_available On the number? 
not_available It won't bite.
not_available What did I do? When you touch it twice, you hang up.
not_available They'll call back.
not_available Jerry, what's going on with the A/C? It takes a couple minutes for it to cool down.
not_available They're on Med 9.
not_available I've gotta take this to the lab.
not_available I'll take over.
not_available Okay, go ahead.
not_available Just once.
not_available Check volume.
not_available Pulse 120.
not_available Gave 500 cc's of normal saline.
not_available Copy? County General on Med 9.
not_available We didn't catch the first part.
not_available Can you repeat? You have to step on the pedal when you speak.
not_available County General on Med 9 
not_available You gotta switch over to Med 9 first.
not_available Now.
not_available County General on Med 9.
not_available Can you repeat the information? I said pulling up now.
not_available Single
not_available vehicle MVA.
not_available What's with the radio? Mark's considering a future in EMS.
not_available We were teaching him the ropes.
not_available BP's 100/60.
not_available Tachy at 120, diaphoretic.
not_available Air bags deployed.
not_available Wife was a passenger.
not_available He groaned and slumped over the wheel.
not_available Thank goodness we were barely moving! I didn't know you were on today.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm just talking to paramedics.
not_available When you're done.
not_available We'll take very good care of your husband.
not_available So if I can't persuade my daughter, you'd be interested in the job? I have considered a cardiothoracic fellowship.
not_available As a specialty it has it all.
not_available The heart.
not_available The most magnificent machine in creation.
not_available I'm flattered you came all this way to convince me to join your practice.
not_available It was on my way.
not_available I can't appear too eager with this one.
not_available And I can't be so picky.
not_available It isn't as if I have other options.
not_available Darling, isn't that him? Romano? Oh, God! Don't let him spot us.
not_available He keeps leaving messages about some dreadful lap choly today.
not_available Well, he still is your sponsor.
not_available He only wants me because he's got a potential partner to see the Aesop.
not_available And he's not certified.
not_available The Aesop robot? Brilliant.
not_available It galls me to help him in any way.
not_available I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of seeing that.
not_available I expect my daughter to fight.
not_available Dive in there.
not_available Impress the hell out of him.
not_available Make the bugger rue the day he terminated you.
not_available Yeah, go for it.
not_available I feel ganged up on.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available Peter.
not_available Mr.
not_available Corday, what a surprise.
not_available I bet you're on your way to UCSF.
not_available I came to visit my daughter while she was still here.
not_available I'm sorry we were unable to continue the fellowship.
not_available I was never fond of her working with you in the first place.
not_available I recall that.
not_available You got my message about the Aesop? Wouldn't miss it.
not_available Although, technically, you'll be assisting me, right? Well, you got me on that one.
not_available You know, I haven't seen this gadget in action.
not_available If that's all right with Dr.
not_available Romano? I'd be honored.
not_available I should've brought him in before, but he seemed better at his cousin's.
not_available Temp's still 100.5.
not_available Where's his cousin live? 
not_available Waukegan.
not_available On the lake.
not_available Sounds nice and cool.
not_available Miss Knight, what tests? A full metabolic workup.
not_available That sounds bad.
not_available We'll try something else first.
not_available Yosh, can you find a fan? 
not_available There's one in the lounge.
not_available We'll cool the room, see if it helps your grandson.
not_available I turn the lights out, that seems to help.
not_available We'll try that too.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Want to keep an eye on him? Questions? 
not_available An infant losing milestones.
not_available Sounds like a metabolic disorder.
not_available Ordinarily, you'd be right to check that first.
not_available But he's got a fever and he's not even damp.
not_available Why are the lights out in Exam 4? We're cooling a young boy down with anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
not_available No sweat glands.
not_available I think it's the right hunch.
not_available You want to look it up? Hold on.
not_available The EMS Medical Director's a real person? He's an ER doctor.
not_available I thought it was just a name they stuck on the top of memos.
not_available Not when I do it.
not_available Somebody page me? Yeah.
not_available Abdominal mass in Trauma 1.
not_available It sounds like a triple
not_available A.
not_available What? I pay attention.
not_available Carla called.
not_available She might not come to Reece's ear appointment.
not_available She said to call if that's a problem.
not_available No, that's cool.
not_available What is it, 100 degrees in here? 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, I'm sorry.
not_available I was with Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Coffee.
not_available For me? Imagine me on caffeine? One sugar, right? Right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Why am I signed up for two patients? I hope you don't mind.
not_available The right
not_available arm weakness is interesting.
not_available I ordered up the previous charts, reviewed them and did the H &amp; P.
not_available Already? To get a good Residency, you gotta fly out of the gates.
not_available You got a little time before worrying about that.
not_available Isn't it the same for you? Residents buck for Chief as Interns? 
not_available Right.
not_available You've probably been laying the groundwork since day one.
not_available At school they say that's how you build a career.
not_available Right, Dr.
not_available Carter? Don't call him "Dr.
not_available Carter." There'll be no living with him.
not_available What shall I call you? 
not_available He's just Carter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter will be fine.
not_available Oh, God, yeah.
not_available Right there.
not_available I was so tense talking to Admin.
not_available You didn't need to be.
not_available I should've asked for two nurses.
not_available You gonna hire yourself? I'm the only volunteer I don't mind asking.
not_available Besides, it'll be fun to hire someone good for the clinic.
not_available Did I get it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Double GSW, two 16year
not_available olds.
not_available One shot in the head, one in the flank.
not_available Mark, did you answer the radio? All by myself.
not_available Single GSW to the left temporal scalp.
not_available BP is 120/78.
not_available Pulse 80.
not_available No neurodeficits unless being a macho jerk and attacking your friendly paramedic counts.
not_available She was going for my piece.
not_available No, your pulse.
not_available Bleed out next time.
not_available Get that lac taken care of.
not_available Doris, I'll look at it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available There's no palpable bullet.
not_available What's your name? Looks like he's been shot before.
not_available First time above my neck.
not_available Well, you the man.
not_available Pupils are equal and reactive.
not_available Know where you are? Sixteenyearold African
not_available American male.
not_available Yo, Toine.
not_available What's up, man? Where you been? Gunshot to the buttock.
not_available Single entrance wound.
not_available Oh, they capped you in the ass? 
not_available Oh, that's whack, man.
not_available Nothing but a thang, B.G.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available There ought to be something to do.
not_available Maybe a central line, maybe a chest tube.
not_available I'm not ready for that yet.
not_available No, you aren't.
not_available Pain here? 
not_available No, man.
not_available I ain't shot there.
not_available Normal sinus on the scope.
not_available Need any help here? Dr.
not_available Carter, so glad you asked.
not_available Get some Surgilube and a fresh pair of gloves.
not_available We'll check next door.
not_available Tighter so I can't open them up.
not_available Anything we can do? No sister with no attitude's putting a shot in my head.
not_available Close your eyes, sir.
not_available We're checking your cranial nerves.
not_available Looks like they got it under control.
not_available There'll be more chances.
not_available I know.
not_available Sure, the guidelines say wait until the cops get there.
not_available Wait until the scene is secured.
not_available But when some kid is lying in the street bleeding, what do you do? I'm curious because the department's looking for a new medical director.
not_available You'd leave the ER? No, no.
not_available It would be part of my job here.
not_available It would be a good way to approach continuity of care.
not_available I hate to see it happen to such a decent guy.
not_available What do you mean? Seven years I've been working on a rig.
not_available We know that what we need is more paramedics.
not_available And every year for seven years Right, right.
not_available They cut the budget.
not_available That part of the job would not be new.
not_available Am I gonna have a scar? No.
not_available I'm too good at this.
not_available Get an abdominal CT with oral IV and rectal contrast.
not_available If the bullet hit his colon, you'd think he'd be hurting.
not_available The kid was masking his pain.
not_available How's yours doing? He's stable.
not_available No blood in the urine.
not_available Stool trace positive for heme.
not_available I checked on your probation and it ended yesterday.
not_available Well, I guess the party's over.
not_available The committee asked me to sign off on your patients, I didn't want to.
not_available Yeah, but you got off on it, though.
not_available I do not relish babysitting.
not_available My life would be a lot easier if everyone did their jobs.
not_available I'm sorry to be a burden.
not_available This all meant nothing to you, did it? Just water under the bridge, right? I wouldn't say that.
not_available Do you know how many calls I get from people who want ultra
not_available rapid detox? Forward them to me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can't do that.
not_available God knows what you'd say.
not_available I think it's a wise move for you.
not_available Great research opportunities in EMS.
not_available I'm more interested in coordinating paramedics.
not_available For once, we wouldn't be in competition.
not_available Field work was never my forte.
not_available You wouldn't want this job.
not_available There's no money, power or glory.
not_available It doesn't fit into my Machiavellian scheme to rule the Emergency Department.
not_available You going? Yeah, Rachel's got a soccer game.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, you have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Jerry, it is freezing.
not_available I know.
not_available Did you notice my salary request? 
not_available I did.
not_available My finances have changed, and it's no longer feasible Yeah, I approved it.
not_available And, frankly, I was glad to see it.
not_available If you practice medicine as a hobby, you risk looking like a dilettante.
not_available Ah, yes.
not_available Well, that's not me.
not_available It's not me.
not_available And that's what's been worrying me.
not_available While I was unpaid, it held me back from stating my long
not_available term goal.
not_available Which is? I want to be Chief Resident.
not_available You don't have to worry about that yet.
not_available No? I want to come out of the gate strong.
not_available It's the only way to build a career.
not_available Well, you're off to a good start with your student.
not_available Ms.
not_available Knight's organized and in control.
not_available Lucy's on top of it.
not_available A good student is evidence of a good teacher and that's the first step toward being a Chief.
not_available I say, Jerry? 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available They're turning it up now.
not_available Actually, I was asking if you paged me.
not_available That was me.
not_available Where's the man with the gunshot wound? Bangers to Curtain 3.
not_available Don't lead her by the nose too much, your student.
not_available I will keep that in mind.
not_available Jerry, it's like a meat locker in here.
not_available Nice work.
not_available Triple
not_available A on an anterior left renal vein is never a picnic.
not_available Yeah, divide and conquer.
not_available What are you doing at 4:00? I've got a tricky retroperitoneal sarcoma.
not_available I'm taking my son upstairs for an audiology exam but I guess I could reschedule.
not_available Your son have a hearing problem? There was a concern.
not_available He had fluid in his ears, I'm just following up.
not_available But he tested normal at birth? Wasn't he a preemie? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's right.
not_available They sometimes give gent to preemies.
not_available It can be ototoxic.
not_available No, no.
not_available He's fine.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Well, if you're sure.
not_available How would you like to follow up on Mr.
not_available Specchierla in Recovery? Our triple
not_available A? Oh, yeah.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available The CT scan showed a hole in your rectum.
not_available They ripped you another one, Little T.
not_available My belly's hurting.
not_available I gave him six of morphine.
not_available Hey, man! Come check me out too.
not_available I don't want no dents in my pretty head.
not_available Your head too big anyway.
not_available Are you gonna do my operation? You don't want no Chinese fag messing down there.
not_available Japanese.
not_available Your friend could use a little support.
not_available This isn't a joke.
not_available After surgery, you'll wear a colostomy bag.
not_available Do you know what that is? 
not_available No.
not_available Lil Toine gonna be crapping in a bag? You gonna be crapping in a bag! Not me, man.
not_available This is not an accurate picture of a colostomy.
not_available Oh, baby.
not_available I heard they shot you.
not_available What you doing here, Moselle? 
not_available She come to see Toine.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available What business is it of yours? 
not_available This is my business, girl.
not_available Chill, girls, chill! Take it outside, both of you.
not_available Now, go.
not_available Go.
not_available We'll explain the process when your mother arrives.
not_available Okay? That's what happens when you run, man.
not_available Booty call.
not_available Yosh, get these two in separate rooms.
not_available Gonna miss that, I bet.
not_available Actually, I will.
not_available He's just a boy.
not_available You know, I was really sorry to hear that nothing worked out for you.
not_available I had my fingers crossed for a faculty spot.
not_available Well, it wasn't meant to be.
not_available You know, I have heard of foreign doctors who were willing to start over as Interns.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I know.
not_available I can't even imagine.
not_available Actually, I do have one last
not_available ditch, desperate chance in half an hour.
not_available Wish me luck.
not_available I said, stay away from him! You stay away! Call Security! Hey! Hey! I said to take it outside! Shut up! Take it out now! Go! 
not_available She crazy, man! I called Security.
not_available I'm calling the police.
not_available Go, go! Shut up! 
not_available Now! Nice work, Kerry.
not_available Glad I stayed on your good side.
not_available Excuse me, nurse, I'm Mr.
not_available Savage.
not_available I've been waiting a long time.
not_available Well, Mr.
not_available Savage, I am a doctor and you have to wait your turn.
not_available You're not a nurse? 
not_available Rob Savage.
not_available I have your chart right here.
not_available You can't smoke that in here.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Get this mess cleaned up, and have Climate Control send down some parkas.
not_available Where's the Rowdies/Crush game? 
not_available Just started.
not_available I'm looking for my daughter.
not_available There's girls in this league.
not_available She's not playing on a coed team.
not_available Rachel? Go! Go all the way, Brandon! Take her! She can't stop you! Easy as pie! Hang in there, Rach! Take her! Take her! Tough D! Where's the flag? 
not_available Flag? Flag's right there.
not_available Penalty kick.
not_available This one's yours, son.
not_available Easy point.
not_available She can't stop you! Goalie's a girl! Put her away! Hang in there, Rach! This guy's got nothing! Don't worry, Rachel! Hang in! You'll do fine! Hang tough! What happened? I need a first
not_available aid kit! Sorry to kick so hard.
not_available It wasn't that hard.
not_available Hey, you okay? 
not_available Dad, you're here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That was a great save.
not_available That first
not_available aid kit was empty.
not_available Does she want some ice? No.
not_available No.
not_available She's tough.
not_available Hey, you got leaves in your hair.
not_available I've had it before.
not_available I just can't pee.
not_available How long has it been? 
not_available About two and a half days.
not_available It's pretty uncomfortable.
not_available Put this gown on.
not_available I'll go check with the doctor.
not_available Last time they stuck this tube Foley catheter? What are you doing? 
not_available Having a smoke.
not_available You can't smoke.
not_available Not even in here? No.
not_available Get undressed.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I got you.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I got you.
not_available Multiple stab wounds.
not_available She was out in the bay.
not_available Weaver kicked her out.
not_available God! Know where she is? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Page her! Peter? How have you been? Good.
not_available I was just checking something on Reece's chart.
not_available Is he having a problem? 
not_available No, he's fine.
not_available Well he had an ear infection, but he was given furosemide as a neonate.
not_available He had pulmonary edema.
not_available And gentamicin, right? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Was his hearing tested then? Right here.
not_available OAE, normal screening.
not_available Was that test done before or after he received the ototoxic drugs? Both.
not_available Dosages were in the safe therapeutic range.
not_available Does he have a hearing loss? No, no.
not_available I was just double
not_available checking.
not_available Sorry to bother you.
not_available Not a bother.
not_available BP's up to 85.
not_available Chest tube's in.
not_available Thora
not_available Seal to suction.
not_available Why put in a chest tube? To re
not_available expand the lung.
not_available Pulse ox is falling, 86.
not_available What the hell? Three hundred cc's of blood out the chest tube.
not_available All right, let's check into the hemoglobin.
not_available Lucy, draw the blood.
not_available Me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look at that.
not_available Air bubbles.
not_available Sub
not_available Q emphysema.
not_available Air bubbles from the stab wound.
not_available There's no oxygen to her lungs.
not_available Lucy, get to work.
not_available One cc venous blood.
not_available Pulse ox is down to 83.
not_available What's going on? She lacerated her right mainstem bronchus.
not_available Stop bagging.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Lf I can intubate past the laceration, we shouldn't have an air leak.
not_available You're only ventilating one lung.
not_available Better than none.
not_available Got it! 
not_available I'll check the hemoglobin.
not_available Hey.
not_available Pulse ox is 90.
not_available No air leak.
not_available Nice work.
not_available Nice work all around.
not_available Call Anesthesia.
not_available Tell them we need a Carlen ET tube.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Hemoglobin's 8.9.
not_available What? What was it before? 
not_available 13.7.
not_available She dropped the hemoglobin five points? Hang on! She must've lacerated her liver.
not_available Hang two units of O
not_available neg.
not_available Call the O.R.
not_available Let me do another hemoglobin.
not_available Machine wasn't calibrated.
not_available What is a sudden drop in crit? Intra
not_available abdominal hemorrhage.
not_available Her vitals are okay.
not_available Hold up on the O

not_available Cancel the O.R.
not_available Send her to CT.
not_available Get that machine checked out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You having fun? Oh, yeah.
not_available I knew that.
not_available I knew it.
not_available Never do a blood draw above an IV.
not_available The fluid dilutes the blood.
not_available That's right.
not_available Thank you for covering for me.
not_available I won't do it again.
not_available If you don't know something, ask.
not_available You're learning.
not_available I know, but you're judged from the word "go." I don't want to look incompetent.
not_available You are judged because it's life or death in here.
not_available I know.
not_available I just didn't think I'd have so much trouble with procedures.
not_available Your problem is you want to be perfect.
not_available Get over it.
not_available You're a beginner.
not_available It's not gonna be easy.
not_available Last night I went to the Procedures Lab and I practiced my IVs.
not_available I got them right every time on the first try.
not_available That's good.
not_available You keep it up.
not_available But know when to ask for help.
not_available You guys just missed a good one.
not_available Sent a guy to the O.R.
not_available Carrot perfed his intestine.
not_available A whole carrot? How do you swallow a whole carrot? He didn't swallow.
not_available Oh, I get it.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available "Swallowed a carrot." That is a classic, Lucy.
not_available Hey, can you work up this shoulder injury for me? Yeah.
not_available I lucked out with her, didn't I? I like her, but she's still a beginner.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available She's getting her bearings.
not_available She needs guidance in procedures.
not_available Come on.
not_available Relax, Carol.
not_available Lucy's a natural.
not_available Hell, I'm jealous too.
not_available No, no.
not_available Carter, you're way off base.
not_available I'm not jealous at all.
not_available L I don't believe this.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Savage, what part of "No smoking" didn't you understand? I have to go now.
not_available My nurse is here.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available What are you, an idiot? The doctor said I need a Foley catheter.
not_available You won't want me to put it in.
not_available I'll be good.
not_available Hand it over.
not_available Come on.
not_available The whole pack.
not_available Why? Because I said so.
not_available I'm not gonna wrestle you.
not_available Give me the cigarettes.
not_available Now, lie back.
not_available What about a rectal? That's next.
not_available Will it hurt? Only if I want it to.
not_available Aesop, move in.
not_available Stop.
not_available Standing by.
not_available Move left.
not_available Stop.
not_available That is a perfect view.
not_available The arm responds whenever addressed.
not_available I'm gonna zap this adhesion.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Everybody protected? Okay, looks good.
not_available Shooting.
not_available Isn't it risky to use a laser when contact cautery would do? Well, you do have to be precise shooting.
not_available But you can avoid inadvertent burns.
not_available Angie? Which you can have with a Bovie.
not_available Still, I wouldn't want a KTP laser in the wrong hands.
not_available And elevate the gall bladder.
not_available Standing by.
not_available Aesop, move back.
not_available Stop.
not_available You make it look easy, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Bet she can walk and chew gum at the same time too.
not_available Oh, she can.
not_available Standing by.
not_available She's been stridorous for a month? The high
not_available pitched wheezing? At least.
not_available Why did you wait to bring her in? The other hospital gave her stuff for croup, but it didn't help.
not_available Go like 
this What kind of stuff? Steroids? Antibiotics? One of them was pink.
not_available I don't see edema or swelling.
not_available Did she swallow something? Maybe.
not_available I can't watch her every moment.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Someone wants to see you, Doug.
not_available I'm with a patient.
not_available He's quite insistent.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll do some x
not_available rays of the neck and chest to look for an obstruction.
not_available If I don't see anything, we'll do an endoscopy take a look down the throat.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available If you said that to get a reaction, I'm not biting.
not_available Said what? Endoscopy? That's pretty invasive.
not_available Kid's been stridorous for a month.
not_available Carter, can I borrow Lucy for a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Mr.
not_available Savage needs an IV.
not_available Oh? Don't worry.
not_available He's a pain in the ass.
not_available Doesn't feel a thing.
not_available He's perfect for you.
not_available It's you? 
not_available That's right.
not_available I want the treatment.
not_available I'm a pediatrician.
not_available You got that baby clean.
not_available I'll give you names of clinics.
not_available I can't afford a clinic.
not_available You charge the kid? 
not_available That was special.
not_available No, I'm special! Maybe I don't look it 
not_available I don't treat adults.
not_available She said that only you do it.
not_available I don't do it.
not_available Sit and I'll get you some numbers I don't want numbers! I want that detox! You've made your point.
not_available I'm not making a point.
not_available It's a real fallout of your actions.
not_available Send all the requests my way.
not_available A journal article 
not_available He doesn't read journals.
not_available Justify your decision.
not_available I'm not interested in justifying anything.
not_available I'm concerned about false hopes from one good outcome.
not_available Was it good? Mother and baby are doing well? As far as I know, yes.
not_available Follow
not_available up care is not part of your measures.
not_available I am an ER doc, just like you.
not_available Not like me, Doug.
not_available You acted without the consent of your colleagues.
not_available What have we got? Thirteenyear
not_available old karate student.
not_available Collapsed after instructor's demo kick to the chest.
not_available Firefighters were first on the scene.
not_available They started CPR.
not_available We arrived on the scene about eight minutes after the call.
not_available Found him apneic and pulseless with rhythm of V
not_available fib.
not_available The teacher? 
not_available Drove behind.
not_available Parents are coming.
not_available How long en route? 
not_available Seven minutes.
not_available About 15 minutes at the scene.
not_available Been down for 30.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Yosh, take over compressions.
not_available Get him on a monitor.
not_available Stand by with high
not_available dose epi.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available Nice intubation, Zadro.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Is it suddendeath condition? 
not_available I'm not sure, Curtis.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Asystole.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available Give him the epi, four milligrams IV.
not_available Pupils fixed and dilated.
not_available Should've driven to the morgue.
not_available Get the external pacemaker.
not_available Put on the pacing pad.
not_available Carol.
not_available Harriet Goodwyn, Mr.
not_available Savage's private
not_available duty nurse.
not_available He called a while ago.
not_available Have I missed him? No, he's still here.
not_available Did he already have a Foley cath? Well, he complained of inability to urinate.
not_available I'm sorry he did this.
not_available Did what? Mr.
not_available Savage has a problem.
not_available He enjoys procedures, especially when administered by a nurse.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I sent a student in there.
not_available Don't scold him.
not_available I already did that.
not_available That's what he wants.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't get it.
not_available Try the foot.
not_available Lucy, you can stop now.
not_available Mr.
not_available Savage? 
not_available Nurse Goodwyn.
not_available I couldn't get it.
not_available He doesn't need it.
not_available Maybe if you show me again? I'll show you later, okay? Doug Ross is looking for you.
not_available It's not Saturday, is it? It's Thursday.
not_available I just saw you yesterday.
not_available Couldn't you wait? What are you doing? 
not_available I'm calling Psych.
not_available I can handle this.
not_available Hello.
not_available I need a Psych consult to the ER.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Will you take me home? 
not_available We'll see.
not_available Release him to me.
not_available It's no sweat.
not_available You're not a real RN, are you? 
not_available My clients like to think I am.
not_available You might want to see Psych yourself.
not_available Hey, it works for me.
not_available I'm in control.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available Coach was going crazy.
not_available Kept saying, "I barely hit him." 13 years old.
not_available Happened to my daughter.
not_available She got hit in the park.
not_available No first aid anywhere.
not_available For commotio cordis, you have to get hit right in the chest? Yeah.
not_available It's about timing.
not_available There's a split
not_available second upstroke when the heartbeat resets itself.
not_available In that instant, a blow will send the heart into fibrillation.
not_available So by the time we got there Don't fire trucks carry automated defibrillators? This one didn't.
not_available There's something we could change.
not_available We're moving to the higher frequencies.
not_available Okay.
not_available You may want your earplugs, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That's a funny bear, huh? Please don't speak during the test.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Reece? Come on, man.
not_available Pay attention.
not_available Moving to the 8
not_available K frequency.
not_available Let's try again.
not_available Glad they found you.
not_available I was on my way out when I got the page.
not_available Not as sexy as our afternoon with Aesop, but hey even a gangbanger shot in the butt has needs.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I met him earlier.
not_available You were outstanding with Aesop.
not_available I rethought my decision to let you go.
not_available You did? I even called upstairs.
not_available Unfortunately, the money's no longer there.
not_available I see.
not_available Well, maybe you should apply again next year.
not_available Ready? Sure.
not_available All right.
not_available Why are we scoping her? Her films were negative, and sometimes plastics don't show up on x
not_available rays.
not_available You hear the one about the patient that swallowed a carrot? Dr.
not_available Carter told you? 
not_available No, Jerry told me.
not_available Great.
not_available I found the mom.
not_available She's on the phone.
not_available We're gonna have to talk to her.
not_available Take a look at that.
not_available It's a classic case of pedunculated papilloma.
not_available Her mother had a sexually transmitted disease and the baby caught it through the birth canal? Gold star.
not_available No small bowel injuries.
not_available We're ready for the colostomy.
not_available Hold on.
not_available The path of the bullet is awfully close to the ureter.
not_available Janet, I need an amp of IV methylene blue.
not_available Looks like the bullet cleared the ureter.
not_available Sometimes you can't see a tear close to the UV junction.
not_available Fresh lap pad.
not_available I'd argue, but I've seen their soccer fans.
not_available GAA stapler, please.
not_available If you're dreading your dinner with your dad, we can delay.
not_available I look forward to dinner with my father.
not_available I need suction.
not_available Suctioning.
not_available So I expect your father's eager to have you back.
not_available Didn't he want you in his practice? He's made that offer before, yes.
not_available Kocher.
not_available Terrific specialty, the heart.
not_available Very romantic, but working with a family member Shall I Bovie? 
not_available Please do.
not_available I couldn't do it, work with family.
not_available Robert, you can't work with anyone.
not_available Doctor, there's blue urine in the Foley bag.
not_available Let's check.
not_available Well, I'll be damned.
not_available I guess the bullet nicked the ureter after all.
not_available Is she okay? I want to see her.
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's resting.
not_available Ms.
not_available Brown, were you ever diagnosed with genital warts? What's this about? Ever been treated for a sexually transmitted disease? None of your business.
not_available Did you know a C
not_available section prevents you from giving the illness to your child? What are you saying? You infected your daughter with papilloma My daughter is adopted.
not_available Ms.
not_available Brown, I owe you an apology.
not_available The loss is more profound at the higher frequencies.
not_available That's a common finding.
not_available In lower pitches, Reece begins perception at 70 decibels which is considered a severe loss.
not_available Shouldn't a doctor take a look at that? He will.
not_available And he'll want to meet with you.
not_available But I know you wanted the results.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available Look, I mean you're jumping to conclusions after one subjective test.
not_available The good news is that Reece tests within the aidable range.
not_available With digital hearing aids, he'll come up into this speech banana.
not_available In this range, he could develop language skills.
not_available "Could"? Reece can't hear talking, crying or the telephone.
not_available It's a severeto
not_available profound loss.
not_available You're saying this after one test.
not_available Reece wouldn't even wear the headset.
not_available Most toddlers won't.
not_available Two weeks ago ENT said it was an ear infection.
not_available But his ears are clear now.
not_available I don't want to argue with you, okay? I just want to talk to a doctor.
not_available As soon as possible.
not_available Okay, we'll set that up.
not_available Did I miss Doug? Yeah, just.
not_available He went up to Pedes to talk to Alex Babcock.
not_available The pediatric anesthesiologist? What's that about? You'd probably have to ask him that.
not_available You know, you are so right.
not_available Tell him I can't make it tomorrow.
not_available Rachel's got soccer practice.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Has anybody noticed the temperature in here? It feels like a perfect 72 degrees.
not_available I was thinking it's 
not_available Stuffy.
not_available Chilly.
not_available Good day today.
not_available Don't work late.
not_available I won't.
not_available Gotta be bright
not_available eyed tomorrow.
not_available I will be.
not_available Did you even eat today? If you're hungry, I didn't finish my lunch.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Well, all I have is a carrot.
not_available Okay.
not_available So I'm an idiot.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Ma Íana.
not_available Carol? 
not_available That's me.
not_available Lynette Evans.
not_available I've been working per diem up on the third floor.
not_available Don Anspaugh hasn't told you a word about me yet.
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available What can you expect of Admin but to drop the ball? He was supposed to blow my horn so I wouldn't have to myself.
not_available There's an opening for a nurse practitioner in your clinic? I'd settle for an RN.
not_available Our budget got approved today.
not_available A nurse practitioner, which I am, would serve you better since I can write prescriptions.
not_available I know you can't always call a doc.
not_available Have you worked here already? No, I ran my own clinic at Southside.
not_available That's where I know Don.
not_available Right.
not_available I heard about that clinic.
not_available Bye for now, suckers.
not_available See you next time.
not_available Are you talking to anybody in particular? You addressing the nurses and doctors who took care of you? Did you fall on that head? No, I got shot.
not_available I beg your pardon? I got shot, ma'am.
not_available Then I think you'd better say, "Thank you for saving my sorry life." She wasn't my nurse.
not_available At the rate you're going, she will be next time.
not_available Just say it.
not_available Thank you for saving my life.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available All that boy needs is somebody to smack him upside his head.
not_available Here's my number.
not_available Keep me in mind.
not_available I will.
not_available In fact I think you're great.
not_available Actually, I shouldn't waste our time.
not_available I'm just going to I'll hire you right now.
not_available I'm gonna like your style.
not_available Great.
not_available Good.
not_available Adele Neuman thought you'd know something.
not_available Is Adele the social worker? I called her when the mom failed to bring the baby in for a follow
not_available up.
not_available That was two weeks ago.
not_available So they disappeared? 
not_available It's not bad news.
not_available The mom's a junkie.
not_available She had a sister in the Carolinas who sounded pretty stable.
not_available For Josh's sake, I'm hoping that's where they wound up.
not_available I'm just lucky she doesn't want to sue me.
not_available She appreciated what you did for her baby.
not_available Enough to take care of him herself? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? Remember me? You're Dr.
not_available Ross, right? Yeah.
not_available You're the skateboard champ, right? Fractured arm? Good thing you wore a helmet.
not_available Yeah, that's me.
not_available What are you doing here? You should've seen Ruben two days ago.
not_available My arm was killing me.
not_available Yeah? You couldn't even touch me like that, it hurt so bad.
not_available Yeah, you were in rough shape.
not_available From the fracture? Been on morphine for months.
not_available No relief.
not_available Sounds like neuropathic pain.
not_available Exactly.
not_available My brain was like, getting its signals crossed.
not_available Switch to gabapentin.
not_available Yep.
not_available Gotta know what kind of pain you're dealing with.
not_available So, what you're saying is, you saved two lives today.
not_available I saved the boy from sepsis and a second trip to the O.R., at least.
not_available To a wonderful doctor.
not_available And a partner I'd be proud to have.
not_available Actually, Daddy, I'm gonna have to turn you down.
not_available I know this doesn't make much sense.
not_available But I have given it a lot of thought.
not_available After we sewed up that gangbanger It wasn't a fancy save or high
not_available tech.
not_available In fact, it was the kind of surgery one could almost do as an Intern.
not_available You're not thinking of starting all over again? Why not? I mean, yes, it will be a blow to my ego.
not_available But on the other hand, I'll be practicing medicine still.
not_available It's not so shabby, saving lives.
not_available And it's a means to what I really want, which is to stay here.
not_available How much does Peter Benton figure in this plan? I have to be a little protective after he stood us up tonight.
not_available Peter's complicated.
not_available He had something else on his mind.
not_available And you know I'd never make a decision based on a man.
not_available That said I don't know what to say.
not_available I couldn't tolerate going back to the beginning once I'd finished the fifth year.
not_available It's only for a year.
not_available Then I'll have a license to practice here.
not_available Does it seem like I'm giving up? On the contrary, I've never seen you fight harder.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Reece.
not_available Come on, man.
