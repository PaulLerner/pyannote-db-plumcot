not_available Phyllis Dodds.
not_available I'm the landlady.
not_available Hi, Phyllis.
not_available Are you okay?

not_available Oh, good.
not_available All the boxes go.
not_available The luggage stays.

not_available Unless Senior Residents lose vacation time we won't be able to cover the schedule.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I didn't get much sleep last night.

not_available Hang tough, Coach Pino.
not_available got slammed into the board.
not_available Possible hip dislocation.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, can I take this one? Did you guys nail him?

not_available Never apologize for a good hip check.
not_available Right, coach? Sure you're feeling okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Stiff muscles.
not_available Might be coming down with something.

not_available And I'll never forget your address.
not_available Wanna help me with a teaching demo? You give him five of morphine? 
not_available And Valium and 100 methohexital.
not_available The first nurse, in this case Susan, applies counter traction.

not_available I know.
not_available I've done a bunch of them.

not_available We're not usually shy about taking credit.
not_available But in this case Megan deserves all the congratulations.
not_available We'll be in touch.
not_available Bye.
not_available That was awkward.
not_available Why? 
not_available I almost killed their baby.
not_available Never begrudge a good outcome.
not_available It's nothing to be proud of.
not_available But sometimes the gods smile.
not_available Hi.
not_available Carter, what are you doing here? Actually, I was coming to To look at the literature review? 
not_available Yes, I was.
not_available I am, if you are.
not_available The literature review? 
not_available I kidnapped your intern.
not_available I hope you don't mind, but I'm up against a deadline so I asked Dr.
not_available Carter to contribute to an article I'm writing.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available As long as it doesn't interfere with your other work.
not_available No, this thing with Dr.

not_available Okay, good.
not_available Mark is acting so odd.
not_available Well, he's gonna miss you.
not_available He thinks I should go.
not_available If I have to hear how great Phoenix is once more He's just trying to be a good sport, judging from how miserable he looks.
not_available Having second thoughts? I never made a decision that seemed so right.
not_available You know, once I made it, I just felt great.
not_available Of course I'm having second thoughts.
not_available I wish you weren't going.
not_available But you do look happy.
not_available Do I? I'm afraid that I'm not happy at all.
not_available Just barging in on Chloe and Joe's happiness.
not_available Well, she owes you a couple of barge
not_available ins.
not_available Susan, there you are.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I need a second opinion.

not_available I wanna get your opinion on a patient.
not_available Are you coming down with something? 
not_available I hope not.
not_available Exam Room 1, complains of shortness of breath.
not_available Diffuse low voltage on her EKG.
not_available I'm thinking pericarditis.
not_available Get an echo.
not_available That's what I'd do.
not_available Could it be pulmonary embolism? She's at risk.
not_available Abnormal EKG.
not_available It could be lead placement.
not_available No, I'd go with the echo.
not_available You sure? It's a no
not_available brainer.
not_available You could always get a VQ scan if the echo's negative.
not_available That's what I was thinking.
not_available So I'll order an echo.
not_available The Mutt and Jeff of emergency medicine pooling their expertise before she leaves us in the dust.
not_available Doug, stop.

not_available That's why we're doing it.
not_available You look lousy.
not_available I've got this neck thing and fever.
not_available There's a flu around.
not_available You didn't do it?

not_available I don't see any point in saying anything.
not_available In two hours, we'll have a 1 week
not_available old male baby on this table.
not_available And what do we know about this poor soul.
not_available He has a distended abdomen, visible peristalsis.
not_available The upper
not_available GI series showed a partial small bowel obstruction.
not_available When we open him up we expect? 
not_available A malrotation of the gut.
not_available Meaning? The 10th week of fetal development, the cephalic limb of the intestinal loop elongated and twisted 270 degrees.
not_available Begin with the duodenum.
not_available What would you expect to see in a normal 1 week
not_available old? What? You mean, like the duodenum leads to? Close your eyes.
not_available Try to see it.
not_available The duodenum leads to jejunum, which connects to the ileum.
not_available Okay, but slow down and tell me what you see.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Start with the image of a healthy gut.
not_available I'm seeing the head of the pancreas.
not_available It's like a tiny fist holding two straws.
not_available You mean the mesenteric artery and vein.
not_available It's nestled in the open sea of the duodenum.
not_available And its surface is like fine pebbles.
not_available A beautiful shade of tannish yellow.
not_available Go on.
not_available You try it.
not_available Okay, the The pancreas is shaped like a tadpole with a big head.
not_available It narrows into a tail that curls into the hilum of the spleen.
not_available Go on.

not_available Susan.
not_available Yes.
not_available We had a rocky start, but I thought we worked on our relationship and developed a professional rapport.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available The smoker in 1.
not_available I diagnosed her with a pulmonary embolism and consented her for a VQ.
not_available I thought it was Mark's patient.
not_available He asked me for my opinion.
not_available My beef is with him then.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available I think I know what the problem is.
not_available No.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available It ticks me off.
not_available I probably could go up there.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available It wouldn't kill me to finish off this one shift up in Neuro.
not_available It's the principle.
not_available Last week Lydia went up there and it encouraged them to do it more.
not_available I got called up to Neuro to fill in for the day.
not_available May I speak to the nursing administrator.
not_available Hathaway in the ER.
not_available When do you max out on your pension? 
not_available Two more years.

not_available No.
not_available The opposite.
not_available She broke off with Al.
not_available I'm returning this ridiculous fake virgin outfit, and they'd better not offer me store credit.
not_available Sorry, Lydia.
not_available What did Al do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available He kept putting it off.
not_available He didn't wanna get married.
not_available I don't know why he proposed.
not_available What's the matter with you guys? 
not_available They're all petrified to make a move.
not_available It's lack of spine, isn't it? Whatever you're talking about, I'm sure you're right.
not_available Mark, I need to talk to you.
not_available Mary.
not_available Carol Hathaway in the ER.
not_available I'm not doing to good.
not_available One of my nurses just got floated up to Neuro.

not_available No.
not_available You know what? She's not going up.
not_available She's not going up to Neuro.
not_available Right.
not_available Right.
not_available Hot stuff.
not_available Unfortunately, you still have to go.
not_available But this is the last time.
not_available I made an appointment with her.
not_available I'm gonna stop this.
not_available Hang in there, Lydia.
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available You can't put me in the middle of your conflicts with Weaver.
not_available You can't, because I'm not gonna be here.
not_available I just trust your judgment.
not_available I know what this is about, and I'm having a hard time too.
not_available I think we've both been spoiled by what we have, the shorthand.
not_available It makes our jobs so much easier.
not_available Jobs.
not_available Right.
not_available In Phoenix, I'm afraid there won't be a single person in the ER that I can talk to.
not_available They've got great doctors there.
not_available They have great doctors here.
not_available The best I've ever worked with.
not_available You can rely on them.
not_available Thanks for the pep talk.
not_available Mark, is there something else? No.
not_available No, nothing else.
not_available I could ask you to consult on the hives in 4.
not_available It's time for us to stand on our own two feet.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available Jeanie, I'm glad I caught you.
not_available Did you get the mortgage papers back? 
not_available No, that's what I wanted to tell you.
not_available AI, you promised.
not_available I talked to this lawyer.
not_available He gave me some advice.
not_available And Here.
not_available Everything you said about our marriage.
not_available About how you carried all the weight.
not_available That's gonna stop.
not_available What is this? 
not_available Divorce papers.
not_available I'm giving you the house, the car, everything.
not_available And don't say no.
not_available It's not just because you deserve it.
not_available This guy helped me figure out that if I get my assets down and showed that my job has no insurance then I would get this state program for the working poor.
not_available They offer the drugs I need.
not_available It's a good deal.
not_available But your income has to be less than $ 15,000 a year.
not_available You don't have to worry about me anymore.
not_available Okay? You just take care of yourself.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Settle down.
not_available Hold her.
not_available Thank God she was passed out at Cubbie's.
not_available Bartender got worried after she downed that sixth double bourbon.

not_available Hold still, so we won't hurt your baby.
not_available Go ahead and kill it.
not_available I never wanted the little bastard.
not_available Too late to think about that now.
not_available Just sedate her.
not_available I'll kill myself and take it with me.
not_available Damned thing ruined my life.
not_available You're pissing me off, lady.
not_available Hold on, Doyle.
not_available I wanna die.
not_available Look out.
not_available Her water broke.
not_available We'd better get her up to OB.
not_available Fetal alcohol syndrome on the way.
not_available Need some help? We could use some muscle here.
not_available Doyle, take her up to OB.
not_available She was trying to kill her baby.
not_available Alert Social Services.
not_available Will they do anything? 
not_available They'll try.
not_available Keep your legs together, honey.
not_available That was ugly.
not_available It was criminal.
not_available Chaplain, got a minute? 
not_available Did you call for the last rites? No.
not_available I wanted to see if you were free to see this woman.
not_available She's in labor.
not_available Does she want a prayer? 
not_available No.
not_available But I think her baby will.
not_available Got a brittle diabetic in 2.

not_available Ceebar's ulcerated ankle.
not_available Do you have an endocrinologist? 
not_available Sort of.
not_available The ER is really not the best place for you to manage your diabetes.
not_available My ex stole 500 bucks from me.
not_available Upsetting, but still no reason for you not to monitor your glucose.
not_available I wanted to tell Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Well, you can't see her right now.
not_available Diabetes is a serious disease.
not_available You can manage it if you follow the regimen.
not_available But if you neglect it, you're at risk for kidney failure, blindness and vascular disease.
not_available Why? 
not_available Why can't I see Dr.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available Should I try to find her? Look, Dr.

not_available I'm putting traction on this mass twisting it counterclockwise.
not_available It's pretty tangled.
not_available Like a drawer full of socks.
not_available I have to remember that one.
not_available Okay, it's pinking up.
not_available I don't think we have dead bowel.

not_available Think he'll talk her into it? 
not_available Shouldn't be too hard.
not_available It's what she wants.
not_available Talk her into what? Living happily ever after.
not_available Sorry I couldn't step up.
not_available At least you knew you weren't ready.
not_available The malrotation was more disorienting than I expected.
not_available anomaly is knowing your embryology.
not_available I had reviewed that.
not_available Then you had 90 percent aced.
not_available What was the other 10 percent? 
not_available Being able to stand there and let the confused anatomy start to make its own sense.
not_available How? 
not_available By letting it happen.
not_available Abnormalities in neonates can be overwhelming if broken into parts.
not_available Aristotle would have made a lousy pediatric surgeon.

not_available This is crazy.
not_available Good thing you had this old rag lying around.
not_available Make it snappy.
not_available They only gave me 20 minutes off.
not_available This veil is a little crushed.
not_available I'll go see if the coast is clear.
not_available Hold still.
not_available I don't wanna stick you.
not_available How do we look? 
not_available No traumas coming in.
not_available Let's go while the radio is silent.
not_available Am I too late? No.
not_available Right this way.
not_available Bride's side or groom's? 
not_available Okay.
not_available They're a little drippy.
not_available Yeah? All right, everybody.
not_available They're ready, okay? Right over there.
not_available That'll be good.
not_available Okay, ready? Dearly beloved Friends and colleagues we have come here today as part of God's eternal plan and on the spur of the moment to this holy place of life and death and healing to join Lydia Wright and Alfred 
not_available G Grabarsky.
not_available Grabarsky.
not_available Anybody get a stool culture on Curtain Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll go.
not_available I did the rectal swab, and his chart's in Exam 1.
not_available Best wishes, man.
not_available Like all of us here, they've chosen as their life's work to care for and protect their community.
not_available It's taxing and draining.
not_available And at times, it's dangerous work.
not_available Now Lydia and Alfred are taking on the care and protection for each other and the love they Dr.
not_available Benton sends his apologies.
not_available He was called into an emergency.
not_available Today we witness and declare the sacred union between two Testicular torsion.
not_available souls that feed each other with that love.
not_available It's a love that sustains all their outer efforts.
not_available A love that is rare and that should be treasured.
not_available A love that at times will glow 
not_available I need a hand here! and yet at other times, it will flicker.
not_available And now the vows.
not_available Do you Lydia take Alfred to love and cherish from this day forward till death do you part? 
not_available I do.
not_available And you Alfred take Lydia to love and cherish from this day forward till death do you part? I do.
not_available I now pronounce you husband and wife.
not_available You may kiss your bride.
not_available Then he just handed you the divorce papers? 
not_available It wasn't like him.
not_available What do you mean? It's the most unselfish thing he's ever done.
not_available She's throwing the bouquet.
not_available Come on.
not_available No pushing now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available It's bouquet time.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Should we do the goodbye for Susan now while everyone's here? No.
not_available We'll do it in an hour or so.
not_available Did you see those two? 
not_available You see them during the ceremony? It's pathetic.
not_available I figured those two'd make a go of it.
not_available Best friends.
not_available What more do you want? 
not_available Not me.
not_available It's what Mark wants.
not_available Things happen or not for a reason.
not_available Why is she leaving? She doesn't have a life here.
not_available And one, two, three! Oh, my God! Oh, yeah, Susan! Yeah! Congratulations! 
not_available You're next.
not_available Yeah, funny.
not_available That was kind of great, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They seem happy.
not_available Hey, Mark I proved I'm no good at goodbyes.
not_available Me neither.
not_available I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.
not_available I just don't want to go unless I know we'll always be friends.
not_available We will.
not_available You ready for me? 
not_available Come on in.
not_available Almost there.
not_available Why don't you shut the door? So about your literature review.
not_available It's very complete.
not_available I have a few quibbles about emphasis.
not_available I'm not sure that Ladd warrants an entire paragraph.
not_available Probably not.
not_available But you have a very nice style.
not_available Easy to read, not a lot of jargon.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I would ask you to coauthor if you weren't first
not_available year.
not_available We need to be careful and not draw a lot of attention considering Considering us? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And what happened last Thursday and Saturday afternoon and evening? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And Tuesday before rounds.
not_available We can talk about that.
not_available The only thing we need to keep straight is that this is separate.
not_available Completely separate.
not_available From my work.
not_available It shouldn't matter.
not_available I'm not your boss.
not_available You're my boss's boss.
not_available Did you lock the door? Just so we both understand that this is strictly personal.
not_available It has nothing to do with work.
not_available Oh, I love that.
not_available There are so many things I'm not gonna miss about this place.
not_available Aftercare documentation is one of them.
not_available I can't tell you how many hours I've spent doing this.
not_available You're the only one who ever bothers.
not_available You kidding me? Yeah.
not_available She's gonna leave at 2:00.
not_available Are they setting up? In the lounge.
not_available I got a call from the D.A.
not_available Today about a drunk woman who came in in labor.
not_available They're charging her for attempted murder.
not_available Social Services jumped on that one.
not_available They're acting on a call from us.
not_available You've seen that crayoninthe
not_available nose trick before? Doctor, the address for Sisters of Mercy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We can handle it together.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle, did you make a call to the 32nd Precinct today? Yeah.
not_available I got a cousin there.
not_available She wanted to kill her baby.
not_available I was a witness.
not_available We get a lot of women here with alcohol and drug problems.
not_available We let Social Services handle it.
not_available It can fall through the cracks.
not_available Initiating criminal investigation wasn't your job.
not_available But protecting the health of the baby.
not_available Is that my job? We won't improve prenatal care for high
not_available risk infants if we scare off the mothers.
not_available How about this? If I get to testify against the bitch, I'll do it on my own time.
not_available I think we're gonna like her.
not_available Randi, could you try and find me some aspirin? It doesn't work for us.
not_available We never had floats in and out of the department.
not_available Budgets are tight, Carol.
not_available We're all aware of that.
not_available The hospital values its registered nurses.
not_available RNs are the best trained and most versatile part of the nursing staff.
not_available We are also the most expensive part of that staff.
not_available County has got to figure out ways to utilize RNs more effectively.
not_available At least have the floats make sense.
not_available Go on.
not_available ER and ICU have more skills in common than ward nurses, Recovery or Neuro.
not_available That's a very good point, Carol.
not_available That is precisely why I keep trying to get you managers who are in the trenches, more active on the committees.
not_available We need your perspective.
not_available Mary, I'm swamped.
not_available Okay, how about a deal? I can find ER floats to ICU per your suggestion.
not_available In exchange, you sit on the hospitalwide re
not_available engineering committee.
not_available We only meet once a month.
not_available I stalled her with one last patient.
not_available Good.
not_available She was out the door.
not_available Mr.
not_available Frick will keep her busy for a while.
not_available You got any tape? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is Mark coming? 
not_available I beeped him twice.
not_available Sorry, folks.
not_available MVA coming in.
not_available Kindergarten carpool versus joy
not_available riding teens.
not_available Could be as many as eight victims.
not_available There goes the party.
not_available What's the ETA? 
not_available They're pulling up now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available That's me.
not_available Runner
not_available up for Mr.
not_available Universe.
not_available Call me a fool, doc.
not_available But I'm betting on a comeback.
not_available Haven't changed a lick since 1947.
not_available I'm afraid you may have lost too much weight recently.
not_available I'm in training.
not_available Midwestern finals.
not_available American bodybuilders.
not_available 70 and older.
not_available Gotta take care of this damn sciatica.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available That smarts.
not_available Why don't you take a seat again? Do you know how this happened? My B
not_available 12 shot.
not_available Must have hit a nerve.
not_available You're injecting vitamins? 
not_available I stay clear of steroids.
not_available That's good.
not_available Scoot back.
not_available Press against my hands.
not_available Yeah, good.
not_available Any other complaints? 
not_available No.
not_available Best I've looked in 10 years.
not_available When's the competition? Mid
not_available March.
not_available I'll be 74 by then.
not_available And ready for a comeback.
not_available You think? Yeah.
not_available Plenty of bed rest, anti
not_available inflammatories and start back slowly.
not_available Thanks, doc.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fractured tib
not_available fib.
not_available Honey, you're gonna be fine.
not_available Order a portable Cspine and left tib
not_available fib.
not_available Come with me this way.
not_available I'll find you a place to sit.
not_available My mom and dad are gonna kill me.
not_available I'll tell them it was my fault.
not_available Signing out, Randi.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good luck in Phoenix.
not_available No.
not_available This is the ER again.
not_available We need a neurosurgeon now! Get him to the Suture Room.
not_available Set me up with some 4.0 nylon.
not_available You have a ruptured spleen.
not_available You need surgery.
not_available It's my carpool.
not_available All the parents need to be called.
not_available Randi, come here and take these numbers down.
not_available I told you not to let him drive.
not_available He told me he knew how.
not_available We were just goofing around.
not_available Hush! Hold still.
not_available Complains of chest pains, shortness of breath.
not_available Diminished breath sounds on the left.
not_available Get me a chest
not_available tube tray.
not_available We need an abdominal CT for the kid in Trauma 1.
not_available BP's coming down.
not_available 190 over 130.
not_available Poor cap refill.
not_available Pulse ox 90.
not_available Type and cross two units.
not_available O
not_available neg on the rapid infuser.
not_available Xray's coming for the C

not_available Anybody need any help? Susan, what are you still doing here? 
not_available You're gonna miss your train.
not_available Call us.
not_available Get some O
not_available negative too.
not_available BP's 200 over 140.
not_available Left pupil's sluggish.
not_available Dusky, you wanna intubate? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Possible subdural hematoma.
not_available Mannitol, 90 grams IV.
not_available Let's hyperventilate him.
not_available All right? 
not_available Here you go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Use suction if you need it.
not_available Take your time.
not_available He's breathing on his own.
not_available She didn't even leave a note.
not_available She was saying goodbye all day.
not_available One of the kids crashed in Radiology.
not_available Which one? The fractured tib
not_available fib.
not_available How did it happen? If it's okay, I'd love to get out of here by 7.
not_available You working on the literature review? 
not_available No.
not_available I got a date.
not_available Don't procrastinate and keep Keaton waiting.
not_available It reflects poorly on me.
not_available She's a hard one to get, isn't she? 
not_available How do you figure? She's a great surgeon, but not much of a teacher.
not_available You don't think so? 
not_available Come on.
not_available All that psychobabble? 
not_available Her explanations can be eccentric.
not_available She doesn't say what she wants.
not_available Sometimes she does.
not_available But I haven't been working with her like you have.
not_available She's soft.
not_available She doesn't act like a surgeon.
not_available It is difficult to learn from someone who teaches by intuition.
not_available Which I appreciate about your teaching.
not_available Excuse me, Carter.
not_available Carla? There you are.
not_available I've been here for half an hour.
not_available Why? 
not_available Kingston Mines.
not_available Dinner? 
not_available That's tomorrow night.
not_available No, that's tonight.
not_available Anything you need? 
not_available No, Carter.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Carla, this is Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Carter, this is Carla Reece.
not_available Pleased to meet you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm on till midnight tonight.
not_available This is where you work until midnight.
not_available I'll walk you to your car.
not_available You've never been here? 
not_available No, I haven't.
not_available I should give you a tour.
not_available She's got plans.
not_available No.
not_available I've been stood up.
not_available If Trauma 1 is open, we could start there.
not_available Don't show me anything bloody.
not_available No, no.
not_available What do you do, Carla? 
not_available I have this Caribbean restaurant.
not_available No kidding? My family used to sail to the islands every spring.
not_available Half day Dr.
not_available Ross? I was immunizing when you were hitting the snooze button.
not_available I'm upset because I don't understand how you could send a surgical I asked if I should send him for a CT.
not_available You said, "Go ahead." 
not_available I assumed he was stable.
not_available No, I asked for your call.
not_available You weren't listening.
not_available You were distracted.
not_available You were looking for Susan, worried she'd left.
not_available I understand.
not_available But don't yell at me now.
not_available Mark, grab your coat.
not_available Let's go talk.
not_available Admin actually listened? 
not_available So no more floating? You laid down the law.
not_available They won't be sending you to Neuro or the wards anymore.
not_available They're gonna limit our floats to ICU.
not_available How's that any better? 
not_available Similar nursing skills.
not_available We have to get it in our contract.
not_available Only way they'll respect us.
not_available They'll never respect us.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver is wondering where the nurses are.
not_available I don't think it's so bad floating to I.C.U.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available They won't send you.
not_available You're not close enough to your 20 years.
not_available It's a compromise, but it's better than what was happening.
not_available Careful, Carol.
not_available You sound an awful lot like management.
not_available I didn't even say goodbye.
not_available That's not what you need to tell her.
not_available Too late now.
not_available When does her train leave? 
not_available 4:20.
not_available Under one hour.
not_available They're usually late.
not_available She went home to get her luggage.
not_available I'm on till 11.
not_available You think I should just go? 
not_available You could.
not_available It's impossible.
not_available She's getting on a train.
not_available She's made up her mind.
not_available It may be.
not_available But that's not the point.
not_available What would I say now? 
not_available What you wanted to for years.
not_available You tell her how you feel or let her go without a word and regret it for the rest of your life.
not_available And make yourself and everybody else around you miserable like you have today.
not_available You're right.
not_available Wait.
not_available Can you tell Kerry? 
not_available Go, go, go! This is great.
not_available Oh, my goodness! Is this where you operate on them? 
not_available We stabilize them here.
not_available Then we send them upstairs to the O.R.
not_available Speaking of upstairs.
not_available Nice meeting you, Carla.
not_available Yes, thank you for showing me around.
not_available What's in here? 
not_available Just the Suture Room.
not_available What goes on in here? We just take patients down here that we need to You're gonna mess up my reputation around here.
not_available I've been wanting to do that since I came into this place.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry I got to work late.
not_available Well, there's late and there's later.
not_available Taxi! Pull up.
not_available Susan? Suse, are you here? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available You just missed her.
not_available She left you a note on the mantel.
not_available Is that clock right, Sister? 
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available I must be slow.
not_available I got a friend trying to catch a train.
not_available Sister Anne, try to get them to share.
not_available We haven't had a Lopez all month.
not_available It's a mother and an infant.
not_available I know, doctor.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You could leave a note on the board.
not_available Go! Go! Go, man! Southwest train.
not_available Track 10.
not_available Looking for the chief, sir? She got moved.
not_available Track 6.
