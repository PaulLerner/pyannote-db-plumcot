not_available My wife, two kids, and they hate me for it.
not_available I hate me for it.
not_available So why did you leave, then? Well, I could tell you that, but then I'd have to kill you.
not_available All systems are go.
not_available He'll be by later.
not_available All right, take it easy.
not_available Keep it on the low.
not_available My trap is shut.

not_available No.
not_available Not really.
not_available Lupus, huh? Hi, I'm Simon Brenner.

not_available See, the meds are kicking in.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Head CT, metabolic panel, tox screen, EEG, and neuro consult.

MORETTl Don't look so relieved.
not_available Excuse me.

MORETTl Yeah, I'm sure that's the case.
not_available Hey, hey, get off of him.

not_available You okay? Do you believe me now, smart guy? We'll be back to check on you a little later when you're rested.
not_available You can call me Arnie.
not_available I thought you said your name was Art? All right, men.
not_available Look alive now.
not_available What was that? Well, guy's got enemies.
not_available It's not hard to see that.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available I'll keep somebody on him at all times.
not_available Hey, that's a great idea.
not_available Why does it seem like someone's always getting punched in this place? I gave as good as I got.
not_available I would expect nothing less.
not_available They find a new chief yet? Soon enough.
not_available You? 
not_available Why, is that so crazy? I'm just pleased they finally recognized your talent, Greg.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks, I appreciate it.

not_available Your electrolytes look good and the drug test came back negative.
not_available Yeah, Mom gave up the crack years ago.
not_available Christine, let them do their job.
not_available CAT scan was normal, no bleed, no abscess.
not_available That's a good sign? Very.
not_available Systolic won't go up over 80.
not_available And she's got crackles, I think we should get an echo.
not_available I should have had more children.
not_available Deep breath.
not_available So that I wouldn't be such a bother to you.
not_available Shh.
not_available You're not a burden.
not_available My daughter takes care of me all day.
not_available Then works at night in a doctor's office.
not_available Physical therapy.
not_available It's for sports injuries and stuff.
not_available Let's skip the echo.
not_available Get a spiral CT.
not_available Really? 
not_available Lupus patients are susceptible to PE.
not_available What? 
not_available It's just that CHF is much more likely.
not_available Why don't we just get the echo 
not_available Get the CT.
not_available Let me pull rank on you while I still can.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's wrong? I tried to block my mother's fall.
not_available I must have tweaked something.
not_available Why don't I take a look? Chuny? We removed the infected graft and proceeded with the washout.
not_available You redose the antibiotics before opening the abdomen? No, she was already on triples.
not_available Well, still, it's standard practice to add a dose halfway through a case.
not_available Did you and your attending make a conscious decision not to do this? I don't see how your question is relevant given the acinetobacter did not originate It is relevant because it is a teaching point.
not_available It applies to abdominal surgeries in general and this is a teaching conference.
not_available Carry on, Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available You got no idea why this guy was trying to off you? I wanna make a phone call.
not_available I get one, don't I? 
not_available You're not under arrest.
not_available Then arrest me.
not_available I'm not talking to you, I wanna make a call.
not_available Why don't you just back off for a little while, let him calm down.
not_available I don't feel so good.
not_available My chest is tight.
not_available I think I'm having one of my anxiety things.
not_available Yeah, I can't imagine why.
not_available Look, there's a reason I left Chicago.
not_available Let me guess, people were trying to kill you.
not_available Look, you saved my life, I can trust you, right? No, I'd rather you didn't, man.
not_available Oh, son of a bitch.
not_available Hey, Art.
not_available I hear you got yourself into a little trouble.
not_available Rick.
not_available Who the hell are you? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Cops let you in? It was my mother.
not_available Gotta understand.
not_available We'll get him out.
not_available It's not that easy.
not_available I'm not going back.
not_available I can take care of myself.
not_available Oh, is that what you've been doing? 
not_available Sir, you really need to step outside.
not_available Jeez.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available I'm dying.
not_available You're agitating him.
not_available He's right.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What do we got? He's in v
not_available tach.
not_available Charging to 360.
not_available Here's the order for the spiral CT.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.

not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Well, my kid was really sick, okay? And I lost my footing for a while.
not_available Yes, I know how that feels.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Right, and he was in a psych ward for eight weeks.
not_available He told me he wanted to die.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available I am sorry, but 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Anyway, in the middle of it, his mother and I we started really talking.
not_available And by the time we got out of the hospital, we were a family again.
not_available That's great for you.
not_available It's really, really great.
not_available Look, all I'm trying to say is that every couple goes through some awful and messed up stuff.
not_available Kevin, are you feeling guilty or responsible? Because you're not.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available All you did was help me ruin my life a bit faster.
not_available I have to go back to work.
not_available "Man is like a breath.
not_available His days as a fleeting shadow.
not_available " "In the morning, he flourishes and grows up like grass.
not_available In the evening he is cut down and withers.
not_available " Walter? Walter? Walter? 
not_available What? What is it? Is the kitchen on fire again? What? What's the matter with you? Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not dead yet, you lanky bastard.
not_available Pancakes.
not_available I feel like pancakes.
not_available From the good place, not that greasy spoon, holeinthe
not_available wall.
not_available I don't think I can take you out today.
not_available Then go get me some.
not_available And one scrambled egg.
not_available Maybe on my break, I will.
not_available Someone's coming to see me, you know.

not_available My nephew.
not_available My brother's son, lives in Philadelphia.
not_available Second
not_available rate town if ever there was one.
not_available People say it's not a bad city.
not_available People lie.
not_available But he's a good kid.
not_available He got a sweet wife and two little girls.
not_available Kids are great.
not_available Yeah, my wife and I never had any.
not_available I regret that.
not_available Sometimes I think if we had maybe she might have hung around longer.
not_available How's that? Well, being a parent gives you strength you didn't know you had, you know? Places in yourself, reserves, and they can keep you going.
not_available They can drive you.
not_available Make you fight harder.
not_available Soldier on, keep rowing upriver.
not_available Even though everything else turns to crud.
not_available Least I've heard that "so " Epi's in.

not_available I'm having a heart attack, Rick.
not_available Maybe you can back off.
not_available You realize how complicated this is? 
not_available I didn't plan on having a heart attack.

not_available Tell them we're on our way.
not_available All right, thanks, guys.
not_available We'll get this from here.
not_available What are you doing? What's going on here? Well, I can't tell you.
not_available It's privacy issues.
not_available Who the hell are you? Let's not waste any more time talking.
not_available Do the cath so we can get him out.
not_available Let me tell you, you're in my ER, and that's my patient.
not_available You don't get to dictate how this goes.
not_available Actually, I do.
not_available U.S.
not_available Marshal Service.
not_available Every minute my guy sits in this hospital is putting him and everyone else here in jeopardy.
not_available So the king of crime is up in the cath lab? Yeah.
not_available Hey, so nobody gets in without double

not_available Both kind of busy, unclaimed baggage and whatnot.
not_available You're worried if things don't work out it'll turn into a big mess.
not_available Something like that.
not_available I'm here to tell you, it will.
not_available Come on now.
not_available What? What? A hot
not_available head Casanova like him and a feisty little spitfire like Sam.
not_available You think they have a chance? 
not_available Hey, your shoulder lady's in Sutures.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Love is hard, boys.
not_available Be hard on love.
not_available Seriously.
not_available I've been where you are.
not_available It can work out.
not_available It does work out.
not_available Just take the plunge.
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you ever hear of Arnie Markowitz? No, why? What kind of people can make cops just disappear like that? I'll tell you who.
not_available The feds.
not_available That got me thinking.
not_available Yeah, you see? 
not_available That was your first mistake.
not_available No.
not_available I wasn't on the force all that time for nothing.
not_available Read this.
not_available "Arnie Markowitz, busted in "'05 " for working with the Turkish Deep State.
not_available " Whatever that is.
not_available Here.
not_available That is the Mob.
not_available This guy made a deal, testified against the Turks then he disappeared, probably into WitSec.
not_available WitSec? What's WitSec? WitSec is the Witness Security Program.
not_available Next page.
not_available What are you saying? That my patient, Art Masterson, is this guy, Arnie Markowitz? Don't say that out loud.
not_available They are everywhere.
not_available Mom's been sick a long time.
not_available We've got the whole setup at home.
not_available Any tenderness here? No, it's fine.
not_available I could never live at home.
not_available I mean, my dad's dead now, but I got out of there as fast as I could.
not_available I lived alone for a while, but I was never any good at it.
not_available Good at it? 
not_available Yeah, it got boring.
not_available I'm not much of a dater, you know.
not_available Not into playing the game.
not_available I hear that.
not_available Plus, my work makes it difficult to have a normal social life.
not_available Me too.
not_available I guess that's what we get for pursuing careers in medicine, huh? I'm an escort.
not_available Um Could I? Could you? Raise your arm up in the air.
not_available Now try to resist my pressure.
not_available I thought you said 
not_available Yeah, I was I was trying to finish college when Mom got sick.
not_available No insurance, she needed money but she also wanted me home with her during the day, and Somebody told me about an agency where I could work five to 10 hours a week, nights and, uh, make 10 to 15,000 dollars.
not_available You'd be amazed how much men are willing to pay for the illusion of a submissive Asian concubine.
not_available It just sounded really easy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, it's Mrs.
not_available Barcenilla.
not_available We lost her pulse.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Page Abby, 911.
not_available You wanna wait outside.

not_available Her sats suddenly dropped into the 60s and she went into PEA.
not_available Mig of epi, MAC 3 and 7
not_available O.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Mom, please don't do this.
not_available Ready to intubate? Sorry.
not_available Can't let anybody by.
not_available You wanna get him out of here.
not_available You better let me in there.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Cromley cleared him.
not_available Well, Arnie, there are no more telebeds, so we're shipping you back to the ER.
not_available I can't go back.
not_available I can't move forward.
not_available I messed up, man.
not_available I did some things I got in trouble for.
not_available Yeah, you know, I'm starting to get that idea.
not_available I wasn't much of a lawyer, but I knew how to make things work.
not_available My firm had some clients that needed special help.
not_available Money laundering, visas, imports.
not_available That type of thing.
not_available When I got snagged, the feds 
said "Do the right thing and we'll protect you.
not_available Protect your family.
not_available " "So " You did the right thing.
not_available Did I? End up trapped between two worlds, like ET or something.
not_available Can't be honest with anybody.
not_available Gotta hide who you are, who you were.
not_available I had to teach my own kid his new name.
not_available Drill it into him.
not_available I kept thinking this is the price of being good teaching your kid to lie.
not_available He'll understand one day.
not_available Well, he's 12.
not_available Sure doesn't understand now.
not_available Hey.
not_available Yeah? Who are you? 
not_available I'm Anthony.

not_available So? They gave me a temp.
not_available I must've left 
not_available What do you think you're doing? Hey, relax, man.
not_available No, you relax.
not_available Where's the ID? 
not_available I just started last week.
not_available How did you get in here? Dr.
not_available Pratt, he's one of our new techs.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Welcome to my life.
not_available I dÃ©brided the area, and attempted a closure.
not_available Attempted? 
not_available Executed.
not_available I executed a primary repair.
not_available Did you consider resection? Yes, but I thought the best possible, um, option was primary closure.
not_available And Dr.
not_available Dubenko was in agreement? Oh, come on, once again, I remind you this patient died of pan
not_available resistant bacterial sepsis which had nothing to do with Neela's repair.
not_available A concomitant infection with bowel flora could have overwhelmed her system.
not_available What are you talking about? Show me the data.
not_available Her post
not_available op course could have Reign yourself in, Dusty.
not_available It's embarrassing.
not_available You're the junior attending.
not_available She's the person you can dump on.
not_available I'm not dumping.
not_available Sit down.
not_available You're out of line.
not_available I won't sit down, and I'm not out of line.
not_available I'm not out of line.
not_available That's a joke.
not_available Wanna know what's out of line? I'll tell you.
not_available A system so under
not_available funded that we have a single trauma attending to cover the entire hospital at night.
not_available That's out of line, letting a patient bleed out in the ICU because of a stupid rule, that's out of line.
not_available And you wanna know what else? Wanna know what else? Sitting by and watching my resident try and hide the fact that I left her in the O.R., that's out of line.
not_available It's all out of line.

not_available That's what you said.
not_available Christine.
not_available Do you wanna say goodbye? Mom I can't.
not_available Everybody out.

MORETTl I heard you were working here and I wondered if I might be able to talk to you.

not_available Look, I've had a very difficult time in my life.
not_available Really? Me too.
not_available I know that.
not_available And I'm sorry for any part that I played in that.
not_available But I just wanted to tell you that you know, whatever happened with me and Abby was just the misguided, messed
not_available up flailings of two people, two very troubled people.
not_available That's beautiful.
not_available Look, she loves you.
not_available Anybody can see that.
not_available As somebody who has squandered that kind of thing before in his own life I wanna implore you not to make the same mistake, so "that's " You done? 
not_available Yes, I think Yeah, I think so.
not_available Guess I had that coming, huh? Thanks for stopping by.

not_available Art, you did this to yourself.
not_available I'm trying to fix it.
not_available Whatever I do, I'm dead.
not_available Dead on the street or dead on the inside.
not_available What's the difference? Don't let other people in, all right? Got enough in harm's way.

not_available You ready for that? On your own? You ready to do that to you family? You're not in this alone.
not_available They're with you.
not_available All right, look, Arnie, this is the deal, man " I'm" gonna make sure that you get fixed up.
not_available But staying here isn't helping you.
not_available You know, in fact you're putting other people in danger, man, my people.
not_available Look, you did the right thing once, just do it again.
not_available Hey, you got my food? What's going on? What, this? It's SOP for leaving.
not_available Well, what did you do? Step on it? It's all smashed up.
not_available Well, what do you mean, leaving? 
not_available Oh.
not_available Hospice policy.
not_available There's a six month's limit.
not_available My nephew's taking me to Philly.
not_available They're kicking you out because you didn't die soon enough? It's pretty discouraging, isn't it? Why didn't you say something? 
not_available I didn't wanna depress you.
not_available You're depressive enough as it is.
not_available I don't wanna see you bawl.
not_available I'm sorry I never got to meet your family.
not_available Next time.
not_available Yeah, next time.
not_available Hey, he's taking me fishing.
not_available He says if I row us out, he'll row us in.
not_available Hey, Walter.
not_available Don't worry, kid.
not_available You'll figure it out.
not_available I got faith in you.
not_available Let's hurry up with this thing.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Now, when it comes to an investment like this you have to be concerned about the four Cs.
not_available You got your carats, your color, your clarity and your cut.
not_available You want white gold or platinum? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Platinum, it's the only way to go.
not_available It's the gold standard.
not_available Now, I brought this especially with you in mind.
not_available It's a threestoned platinum setting with a 2
not_available carat princess cut in the center.
not_available Top of the line, a real sweetie.
not_available Here, take a look at that.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Uh, it's a little on the pricey side, but for you, there will be a discount because I understand that you're a member of the tribe.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah, I told him you were part Semite.
not_available Who called in the bling man? Pratt.
not_available Here we go.
not_available What? Frank.
not_available Oh, Bettina's a lucky girl.
not_available Everybody calm down, all right? I'm only browsing.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available It's a beautiful spring "day " the Cubs are playing in Wrigley Field, and we live in America.
not_available I think I solved the case of the missing Lexapro.
not_available I was looking for some undepressed person that I could be happy around, and, uh You chose me? Must be slim pickings.
not_available What's the good news? You know, things are just falling into place.
not_available Well, that's great, you deserve that.
not_available Yeah, you sound thrilled.
not_available I am.
not_available Really.
not_available So, what's up with Luka? I don't know, it's been a month.
not_available Ah.
not_available He'll come around.
not_available I know him.
not_available And I know you too.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available Just come find me later, I'll buy you a coffee.
not_available Ah, there he is, my old mentor.
not_available How you been? What you been up to? 
not_available Keeping busy.
not_available It's like an Egyptian market here.
not_available Chickens, guys are selling diamonds at the desk.
not_available Diamonds, really? Wow, that's weird.
not_available Well, keep it real.
not_available She's in there.
not_available It's not a request, it's not optional.
not_available Unhook him.
not_available Not without doctor's orders.
not_available Somebody call me? 
not_available Keeping him isn't helping anybody.
not_available All right, Sam, give us a minute, okay? What's the plan? We've got a facility secured where he can get medical care until we regroup.
not_available I'm gonna have a tech over and expunge the medical record from your system.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, Arnie.
not_available How we doing? 
not_available Ready to roll.
not_available Good.
not_available You got everything? 
not_available You don't care what happens to him? Sam, I got this.
not_available My job is to keep him alive.
not_available That's what I promised when he came into the program.
not_available My only concern is him coding on the way.
not_available We got a paramedic.
not_available Why don't you let me ride along? 
not_available No.
not_available If anything, I'll go.
not_available Greg, I have transport training.
not_available Yeah, I'm his doctor.
not_available We need you on the floor.
not_available No, Morris can cover.
not_available Are you two fighting over me? 
not_available Look, neither one of you are coming.
not_available I've got room enough in the rig for one paramedic team and two of my guys.
not_available And as soon as we roll out the door, this never happened.
not_available This patient was never here.
not_available Get it? This is crazy.
not_available Don't.
not_available You're the one person who might actually talk me out of it.
not_available You're gonna walk away after one bad outcome? No.
not_available It's a million little things.
not_available It isn't like you to give up.
not_available What am I giving up? A dumpy O.
not_available R? Overnight call? Below
not_available market pay? You can't abandon me in the middle of training.
not_available You're not my responsibility.
not_available This is not what you want.
not_available Don't pretend to know what I want.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You all right? 
not_available What do you care? That was a pretty tough little teaching thing.
not_available You're worried about me.
not_available Well, you can hold your own, but yeah.
not_available See, I'm not a heartless beast.
not_available I never said beast.
not_available You know what? I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
not_available Doesn't mean I enjoy being treated like I crashed some party.
not_available You're the product of flagrant nepotism, and you're a tosser.
not_available Nobody really wants you here.
not_available Wow.
not_available Don't sugarcoat it, babe.
not_available Don't call me babe.
not_available You know what your problem is? No, but you'd be the first person I'd go to if I wanted to hear it.
not_available You need to get a life.
not_available You need to get out, which is my polite way of saying you need to get laid.
not_available Oh, is that right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm pretty certain of it.
not_available I was thinking about that night.
not_available That first night that we kissed out in the ambulance bay.
not_available You mean the night I totally geeked out and kissed you out of nowhere? I remember feeling you were someone who was so full of hope.
not_available I needed someone to teach me that again.
not_available I think that part was mutual.
not_available What, did we lose that? I mean, did we turn into some other people? I hope not.
not_available I realized today I have this idea of us, of you and me and Joe as something static, you know, concrete.
not_available But it's not.
not_available It's more like we're out there on the lake, on choppy water.
not_available Or, like, uh 
not_available In a rowboat.
not_available Yeah, in a rowboat, trying to get across.
not_available But when you told me what happened, I felt like something died.
not_available I was mourning.
not_available I couldn't see that what we have is always changing.
not_available It's moving.
not_available So for better or for worse, as long as we keep rowing we're gonna be okay.
not_available So let's just get past it.
not_available You know, let's just go someplace new, somewhere nobody knows us.
not_available I know we have good friends in Chicago.
not_available And I know you've got this great job Do you know that I love you more than I could ever explain? Let's get out of here.
not_available Nice bumper sticker, Bardelli.
not_available It's that against regs? It's not my rig.
not_available Mechanic says something's wrong with my alternator.
not_available What if you lose his pulse? What if he goes into V
not_available tach? I'm good now.
not_available You've done enough, doc.
not_available More than that, actually.
not_available You my guy? 
BARDELLl Yep.
not_available If he goes south, it's gonna come back on us.
not_available We're on your side.
not_available Let us do our job.
not_available Okay, then, we got room for one more.
not_available Who's it gonna be?
