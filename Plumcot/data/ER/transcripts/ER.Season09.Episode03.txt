not_available Now you' re talking.
not_available Get some cattle prods while you' re at it.
not_available Shut up, Frank.
not_available So he went home, got the gun and came back? 
not_available Probably went to the corner, bought it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available God, sometimes I hate this place.
not_available Sometimes? Pulse ox 90.
not_available He vomited twice before I could turn him.
not_available There's little use for the peg now.
not_available He can't breathe.
not_available Get a RT and set up for a vent.
not_available Okay, he's full of junk.
not_available Aspirated and decreased on the right.
not_available Not again.
not_available His cords are scarred from last year.
not_available He was on the vent two months.
not_available Meds are in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Be ready to roll him.
not_available The etomidate could make him vomit.
not_available Once you put that tube in, that's it, right? That's not coming out.
not_available Yeah
not_available Yeah, we want the bulletproof.
not_available What's he doing? 
not_available Contracting out our new triage.
not_available Are we finally getting that? Yeah.
not_available I've got the phony purchase orders to prove it.
not_available What about Stella? 
not_available She has a positive Murphy's sign.
not_available Because you keep feeding her cafeteria food.
not_available I still need to rule out cholelithiasis? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Get her out of here before she presents with something else.
not_available She's gonna suck him dry, isn't she? 
not_available Yes, she is.
not_available No, no.
not_available Sooner than that.
not_available As soon as you can.
not_available Why don't you come look at the space? What are you doing? I'm trying to make us all safer.
not_available You ordered six metal detectors, retail? 
not_available Yes.
not_available They should be here in half an hour.
not_available No.
not_available We have a procurement department that handles all capital expenditures.
not_available You canceled it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I canceled it.
not_available This is not your job.
not_available And believe me, you don't want it.
not_available We had another 15 percent budget reduction again this year.
not_available I am trying to keep the doors open.
not_available Close them.
not_available You shouldn't risk your life to work here.
not_available Of course not.
not_available But be responsible about it.
not_available You have to get competitive bids.
not_available No.
not_available You know what's irresponsible is letting this go on.
not_available And I have been in staff meetings for the past two years working on this.
not_available Where have you been? Where are you going? 
not_available The ambulance bay to wait for my metal detectors.
not_available When he calms down, have him see me.
not_available Abby.
not_available Answer the phone, Frank.
not_available You know, we have patients to care for.
not_available He's right, Kerry.
not_available You have a plan? No.
not_available Plain or peanut? M&amp;M;'s.
not_available No? Gum? Cheetos? How about some nylons? 
not_available What? Well, I hear they sell panties in vending machines in Japan.
not_available Save your quarters.
not_available You sure? You know, chocolate is a universal comfort food.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.
not_available What? The guy was a known drug hound.
not_available And I wasn't gonna play his game.
not_available But you gotta understand, I would never do anything to jeopardize you.
not_available Carter, maybe.
not_available But not you.
not_available Not my future love slave.
not_available Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay? I get a little punchy when I get nervous.
not_available I was scared too.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, you
not_available You were scared.
not_available You know, I'm the one who almost had a cap busted in my head.
not_available Oh, oh, and that's funny too? 
not_available Cap busted in your head.
not_available Come here.
not_available What? 
not_available Come here.
not_available No.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm consoling you.
not_available Well, don't.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right? You finished? Yeah.
not_available Plain.
not_available I want plain M&amp;M;'s.
not_available Voilà.
not_available Did you hear a fire alarm? Oh, not another evacuation.
not_available Now what? I have no idea.
not_available You got everybody here.
not_available Say something.
not_available Why you talking like it's a prison break? 
not_available In case this gets ugly.
not_available You don't know me? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Hey, what's going on? Talk to Norma Rae.
not_available We' re not working until they install metal detectors and get some additional security.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cool.
not_available My shift's over in an hour anyway.
not_available Looks like a showdown.
not_available Listen up! Unless you are on a scheduled break you are in violation of your hospital contract and are all in danger of being summarily fired.
not_available Part of our contract guarantees that the hospital provides us 
not_available with a safe working environment.
not_available Look, today's incident was horrific.
not_available We are already taking steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again.
not_available You always say that.
not_available Nothing ever happens.
not_available I don't always say that.
not_available We've heard it before.
not_available And this is how you choose to solve the problem? Hey, what's going on? We got a 62year
not_available old man, hypotension, low back pain, BP's 80 palp.
not_available You need to do something about this.
not_available Everyone needs to get back while they still have a job.
not_available Don't think about touching that patient! 
not_available Get him in there.
not_available Gallant, you are a student.
not_available You don't have a contract, you just fail.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Could be a ruptured aneurysm.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Hi.
not_available It'll be another couple hours before I can get him up to the OR.
not_available His sats have leveled off and we' re giving him as much pain medication as his blood pressure can tolerate.
not_available Do you know what it's like to watch someone die for 25 years? That's what I did with his father, every day.
not_available I mean, I loved the man.
not_available But I hated what it did to him.
not_available I can refer you to another nursing home.
not_available I don't know what you' re paying now.
not_available He was a singer.
not_available Did
not_available ? Did you know? Opera singer.
not_available A tenor.
not_available When he sang, it was the most beautiful sound in the world.
not_available And I
not_available I prayed it would pass him over.
not_available When he got to be 29, I thought, " My God! Maybe we got lucky.
not_available " Then he started having trouble at work.
not_available Forget things.
not_available And when he'd talk, sometimes it was hard to understand.
not_available And of course Of course he couldn't sing anymore.
not_available It just takes everything away.
not_available Everything.
not_available Can I have a piece of paper? What for? I'm gonna start work on my résumé.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available I know.
not_available Usually they just decapitate the leaders and send the peasants back to work tending the fields.
not_available But thank you.
not_available What took you so long? Abby, I need a repeat blood gas on my Huntington's patient.
not_available We' re staging a walkout.
not_available Yeah, I get that.
not_available I need a pH.
not_available He's throwing PVC's.
not_available In fact, I have 10 other patients on monitored beds who no one is watching.
not_available So maybe somebody will pay attention.
not_available So you quit, go outside and pout? 
not_available Too many patients.
not_available No room, overwhelmed staff, and it's dangerous.
not_available We' re not gonna be able to treat anybody.
not_available News flash.
not_available The healthcare system sucks.
not_available Our job is to treat people in spite of it.
not_available I can't.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available I don't expect you or anybody else here not to.
not_available But I can't do it.
not_available Too bad that the 10year
not_available old arrests? We've already had one staff member murdered on duty.
not_available And nothing happened.
not_available I'm trying to save people that roll in tomorrow.
not_available I know.
not_available You' re an emergency
not_available room doctor.
not_available It's about getting through the shift.
not_available Do you even know how many guns and knives pass through here?! I don't.
not_available I do know how many people are depending on us at this very moment.
not_available I got stabbed, Lucy got killed, and today, Abby and Chen get a gun to their head.
not_available No.
not_available It's gotta stop.
not_available Otherwise, it's not worth doing.
not_available You know what? You fix tomorrow.
not_available I have to go treat the patients that need us today.
not_available He coded? Think they closed the paramedic runs? 
not_available Can't tell.
not_available You think that they replaced us all? 
not_available I can't tell.
not_available Think it's gonna rain? Look, a new recruit.
not_available Shouldn't she be waving a white flag? Dr.
not_available Carter, let's take a walk.
not_available The metal detectors will be here either tonight or tomorrow morning.
not_available And we've accelerated our negotiation with the new security firm.
not_available What about triage? 
not_available Construction starts as soon as we can approve the bids.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No.
not_available You don't get to thank me.
not_available You go back inside and clear off that board.
not_available You are already four hours behind.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available And it will be hard to avoid a disciplinary committee hearing.
not_available It's nothing personal.
not_available We just need to protect our people.
not_available Yeah, well, speaking of that, I had hoped to control some of these costs.
not_available But now that we' re paying more for immediacy you'll have to offset that by either laying off three senior nurses and hiring new grads or canceling x
not_available ray and lab service after 10 p.
not_available m.
not_available Whatever you think.
not_available No.
not_available No, John.
not_available You forced us to do it this way.
not_available You get to decide.
not_available You can't run a trauma in the middle of the night and go to the lab.
not_available Patient could be dead before you return.
not_available That's true.
not_available Nurses then.
not_available Three.
not_available I want their names on my desk first thing in the morning.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Very nice.
not_available Very nice.
not_available What? I know you' re not going inside.
not_available Oh, I got patients.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Shouldn't you be getting some very serious therapy right now? What? And ruin all this hard won repression and denial? So you' re serious, huh? 
not_available Go home, Pratt.
not_available You sure you' re good? You know, it's not your fault.
not_available Go home.
not_available You' re okay? 
not_available Stop asking me that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yo! IAm
not_available Spartacus, come here.
not_available That proletariat revolt you staged left us a little short
not_available handed down here.
not_available Did you think that was clever? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It wasn't a joke.
not_available I told Weaver to fire you but you can't trust a lesbian to do a man's job.
not_available So instead, I ended up babysitting three gorks and a dirtball with the DT's.
not_available Last time I did ER scut work, I had a ponytail and a lava lamp.
not_available I do not enjoy revisiting those days.
not_available Am I clear? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, the tab is A
not_available negative.
not_available Should we give her RhoGAM? Some of the med students take their oaths more seriously than the doctors.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver cornered me before I could get outside.
not_available She gave me this speech about what it means to be a doctor.
not_available Well, that you need to figure out all by yourself.
not_available I'm looking for a doctor.
not_available Why don't you try sitting in Chairs? Over there.
not_available We'll be with you soon as we can.
not_available True? Construction is starting in a week? I don't know.
not_available You know what they say about construction.
not_available Nice work, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Let's hope you feel that way tomorrow.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Go home.
not_available And lie down? 
not_available And lie down.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, I need you to sign a Prevacid scrip for Exam 1.
not_available Stella?

not_available She's still here? 
not_available I was outside with you.
not_available Which I appreciate.
not_available I'm looking for a doctor.
not_available Right here.
not_available You'll need to take a seat.
not_available Someone will see you as soon as they can.
not_available I need to see him.
not_available He works here.
not_available Did he treat you for something? Security! 
not_available I don't know how to get home.
not_available Security! I can't help unless you tell me who you' re looking for.
not_available Just tell me where he is.
not_available We need you to leave.
not_available Hold on! Hold on! I don't know which way to go! Where do you live? G! Get G! He's my brother! Who? Who is G? Who is he?

not_available Excuse me.

not_available No coroner? We can release the body to the mortuary.
not_available Are you older or younger? 
not_available Older.
not_available His mama took me in when I was 9.
not_available Was she nice? Not really.
not_available And so, what happened to your family? Don't know, don't care.
not_available G's my family.
not_available What happened to you? 
not_available I went by the hospital.
not_available What? You got lost again? 
not_available I remembered where the hospital was.

not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available I knew I threw my back out as soon as I fell.
not_available My chiropractor says I got mild scoliosis.

not_available All right.
not_available Down to one board.

not_available Four entrances, six metal detectors.
not_available Rush.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Sign there.
not_available You gonna show me where you want them? 
not_available Right this way.

not_available We gotta pull old ones out? 
not_available No.
not_available These are the first.
not_available Hey, how you doing? I'm good.
not_available He gets defensive.
not_available "What are you laughing at? " And I thought, " He's not bad
not_available looking.
not_available " I missed the signs.
not_available That is the last time I ask a guy out.
not_available Oh, you asked him out? Yes! And he stands me up! Who was he? Oh, he's in venture cap
not_available Capitalism, or private equity, something or other.
not_available I don't know.
not_available One of those undefinable money jobs.
not_available Right now, you would probably be sitting in his apartment listening to Thelonious Monk or something.
not_available You' re right.
not_available But women who date those kinds of men don't get vomited on on a regular basis.
not_available Or get a gun to the head.
not_available Another one? Yes, thank you! Want anything?

not_available Where is she anyway? I think she went to the bathroom.
