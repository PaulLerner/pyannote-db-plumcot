not_available I don't need it.
not_available It makes me want to sneeze.

not_available I'm afraid you'll take it off.
not_available Get used to it.
not_available I made up my mind.
not_available I won't do my dying in your cramped, thin

not_available How's that gonna work? 
not_available Well, I'll get somebody to help.

not_available Is it a man or a woman? 
not_available It's a man.
not_available What happened to him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available An accident? That's usually it.
not_available Yup.
not_available I think it was.
not_available In Minneapolis.
not_available They'll fly the kidney in from there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday's procuring the organ.
not_available They put it in a cooler.
not_available Man, I thought I'd never make it to the top of the list.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available If I were lucky, I wouldn't need the kidney to begin with.
not_available As you do
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available You can't eat or drink anything.
not_available I've cleared you for the surgery.
not_available We're waiting for the kidney.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available The kid started it.
not_available Then he rammed into my damn car! 
not_available Dad, you said that already.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's not.
not_available I hate being clumsy.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Let's finish your sutures.

not_available I think I know that.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Dad? I'm sorry.
not_available It's just been a crappy day.
not_available Can I get some more water? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available I'll go.
not_available I'm gonna hit the ladies' room.
not_available I'll be right back, okay? What's going on? Is he all right? 
not_available Well, I think he's a little upset.
not_available I've never seen him like this.
not_available Running into a car.
not_available Stabbed a man with a pen? Has he always had a temper?

not_available Never.
not_available But this week, since I've been visiting, he just seems off.
not_available He loses his balance sometimes, lashes out at people.
not_available Does he have seizures or bad headaches? Not that I know of.

not_available Get an abdominal series? 
not_available Just now.
not_available Excuse us a minute, please.
not_available No blockage.
not_available Just a lot of stool.
not_available So the codeine constipated him? I'd have him cut back on his pain meds and give him a laxative.
not_available Also have the pharmacy give him bisacodyl, 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I thought it was serious.
not_available To him it is.
not_available She's had trouble breathing.

not_available We'll do the same.
not_available I'll go get her dolls.
not_available They help her feel better.
not_available We'll take good care of her.
not_available Could we get a VCR? She loves to watch the Muppets.
not_available Sure.
not_available We'll bring one in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Eddie Bernero, 12.
not_available His dad found him barely responsive.
not_available Dad's coming in his car.

not_available May be encephalitis, meningitis.
not_available He's been in before.
not_available Pull the chart.
not_available The nurse signed us out.
not_available You said I need medicine.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Help them transfer him? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Is the prescription back? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Once a day until the constipation resolves.
not_available All yours.
not_available Thanks.

not_available Almost.
not_available Bolus him with normal saline, Blood glucose is over 400.
not_available What? Are you sure? 
not_available I checked it twice.
not_available It's a hyperosmolar coma.
not_available Start an insulin IV, .
not_available 1 unit per kilo per hour.
not_available Get bicarb and potassium levels.
not_available He's been sick a while.
not_available His blood glucose last time? 
not_available They didn't do one.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Did they dip a urine? 
not_available No.
not_available Who took care of this kid? 
not_available Carter.
not_available Page him.
not_available Get him here now.
not_available Flight took forever.
not_available We have time.
not_available Ruled out the first recipient.
not_available Thought you cleared him.
not_available He developed unstable angina.

not_available I hope the kidney will still be viable.
not_available Family? 
not_available Dad's on his way.
not_available Recheck his levels in two hours.
not_available What's up? Eddie Bernero, on his way to the PICU.
not_available I'll refresh your memory.
not_available You saw him five months ago.
not_available I don't recall him.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available You called me in.
not_available Couch
not_available potato diabetic.
not_available Dad had insurance problems.
not_available You doctored the chart? What are you saying? He could've died.
not_available I rehydrated him without knowing he had diabetes.
not_available Show me the chart.
not_available His electrolytes were so off, he could've died.
not_available What were you thinking? 
not_available Your patient's having a seizure.
not_available If anybody asks questions, I won't lie for you.
not_available Nice hair.
not_available Can you get Bernero's chart? 
not_available We sent it up to PICU.
not_available I know.
not_available Get it.
not_available Henry is so excited.
not_available It had to be the day he flew to St.
not_available Louis! He's coming? 
not_available He could fly under his own power.
not_available I did dialysis four years, three times a week.
not_available But then I switched to CAPD.
not_available How often are the infusions? 
not_available Four times a day.
not_available Like getting my oil changed.
not_available A lot.
not_available But it gives you more freedom.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available It's great not going to the hospital every other dayAnd with the transplant
not_available Have you had peritonitis? Yes, but not for at least six months.
not_available Okay.
not_available Everything looks good, Mrs.
not_available Bassett.
not_available We'll wait for your labs and then get you to the O.R.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available I didn't have much to do with it, but you're welcome.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Dwyer.
not_available I'm back.
not_available You'll be okay, sweetie.
not_available The nurse told you? 
not_available You must start another IV.
not_available We've tried but Angie's a tough stick.
not_available She has a lot of scarring from IVs.
not_available So a central line's better.
not_available It's the best way for her.
not_available I understand.
not_available Could you sign the consent form? 
not_available I can't.
not_available It's very safe.
not_available I'm her foster mom, not her real mom.
not_available We care for her.
not_available We'd adopt, but we can't afford the medical.
not_available And her birth parents? 
not_available They abandoned her.
not_available She has a legal guardian through DCFS.
not_available Carol, call Adele Neuman.
not_available Can't you do anything else? We will keep trying for another IV, all right? Sweetie, here we go.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bernero? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, right? How is he? 
not_available Much better.
not_available Glucose is 380.
not_available His lytes? 
not_available Normalizing.
not_available He'll be here a couple days, but he's out of the woods.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available Of course.
not_available What happened, Mr.
not_available Bernero? We're working on the diet issues.
not_available What happened? 
not_available You knew my insurance problem.
not_available You knew his condition's serious.
not_available I cut you some slack.
not_available You agreed to monitor his food and exercise.
not_available You know how kids are.
not_available That's why they have parents.
not_available We have complete insurance now.
not_available At what expense? His life? He almost died today.
not_available You never said it could get this bad.
not_available He was fine until this morning.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available You're not culpable at all? Is that right? You're his doctor.
not_available You said he'd be fine for a few months.
not_available If you didn't know this could happen, how could I? It's not an emergency, but the child needs IV access.
not_available We know she's often hospitalized, but that has nothing to do with this.
not_available Her veins are sclerosed.
not_available I can't get a thing.
not_available Neither can I.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available Come on.
not_available This is Kerry Weaver, chief of emergency medicine.
not_available Angie's PICC line is infected
not_available A guardian should know what a PICC line is.
not_available I know her disease is incurable.
not_available But she is treatable nowIt's not a matter of life or death yet, but it could be
not_available Have you ever seen Angie? I'm looking at her now.
not_available I see an eminently treatable girl who
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for nothing.
not_available He said no.
not_available Give her pain meds and make her comfortable.
not_available There it is.
not_available A heartbeat.
not_available You're definitely pregnant.
not_available You're about eight weeks along.
not_available I wish Henry would get here.
not_available You been trying to get pregnant? For almost two years.
not_available With no luck.
not_available Until now.
not_available Does it take me out of the running? After a transplant, one takes immunosuppressive drugs.
not_available They're powerful.
not_available It's likely they'd cause birth defects or a miscarriage.
not_available If you won't have the child, we can go ahead with surgery.
not_available Sorry to pressure you.
not_available We don't have much time for the kidney.
not_available We can't wait for your husband.
not_available How could this happen? I've waited so long for both.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Bassett.
not_available I want to keep the baby.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you have an appointment? 
not_available Same old, same old.
not_available Where's the snack bar? I'd like a bite.
not_available Do you mind some company? 
not_available No.
not_available Let's go.
not_available His daughter says his behavior's been unusual? Erratic and volatile.
not_available Used to be easygoing.
not_available Maybe a mass or lesion? 
not_available No signs of that.
not_available Any new stress at home or at work? 
not_available He claims no.
not_available We have uncontrolled movements, loss of balance, personality change.
not_available Family history? 
not_available His mom's living.
not_available He doesn't know much about his dad, he died when Waters was 14.
not_available Makes him earlymid40s? 
not_available Probably.
not_available What did he die of? 
not_available Suicide.
not_available We need to talk to him.
not_available I wish you'd talk some sense into Mark.
not_available He's worried about you.
not_available I know he is.
not_available He also thinks that he can control what's happening to me.
not_available Hell! I wish he could, but we all know he can't.
not_available It's a cliché to say you don't wanna be a burden to your children but at my age, I'll be a cliché.
not_available He shouldn't have to deal with everything.
not_available He will, one way or another.
not_available Would your mother let you take care of her? She'd sooner go to sea in a canoe.
not_available I don't need to go to that extreme.
not_available I want to check out
not_available What do you call it? Not quite a nursing home.
not_available A hospice? 
not_available That's it.
not_available A hospice.
not_available If I stay in Chicago, at least that'll make Mark happy.
not_available Nothing about this will make Mark happy.
not_available Huntington's Disease? 
not_available We think so.
not_available I never heard of it.
not_available A progressive neurological disorder.
not_available It causes loss of balance, mood changes and jerking movements of the body.
not_available And progressive dementia.
not_available Like Alzheimer's? 
not_available There are similarities.
not_available Okay.
not_available We know what it is.
not_available What do I do? I'm afraid there's no cure.
not_available How bad will it get? 
not_available A geneticist will tell you.
not_available You're telling me I'll lose control of everything physically and mentally and I can't do anything about it? They're developing new treatments.
not_available But at the moment, no.
not_available I'm 46 years old.
not_available How could I get such a thing? 
not_available It's genetic.
not_available You inherited it.
not_available It generally manifests in your early 40s.
not_available It may be why your dad committed suicide.
not_available I could've passed this on to Jo? There is a 50
not_available 50 chance.
not_available Hyperosmolar coma, no evidence of DKA.
not_available Type Two diabetes.
not_available I'd say.
not_available His blood glucose was 980.
not_available How far did you get? Two liters saline, two units IV insulin.
not_available He's still in the PICU.
not_available He was seen here five months ago? 
not_available Apparently.
not_available If it's 980, it was high five months ago.
not_available You'd think so.
not_available Why wasn't it picked up? 
not_available I couldn't say.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Could you look at this elbow film? 
not_available What's the problem? Big anterior fat pad but no fracture.
not_available You the Attending? I'm admitting Eddie Bernero.
not_available The diabetic coma? Yeah.
not_available He was here in November.
not_available No one picked up on his diabetes.
not_available Do you have the old chart? 
not_available Here's a copy.
not_available Cleo, what was the glucose? 
not_available 980.
not_available Not today.
not_available In November.
not_available Should be in the chart.
not_available No urine dip? 
not_available Not that I saw.
not_available I'll look into this.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available An anterior fat pad can be normal.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Something you didn't wanna say in front of him? About what? 
not_available The diabetic kid.
not_available He was Carter's.
not_available You're not in surgery? We still have the kidney.
not_available We go through recipients likeCrap through a goose? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That works.
not_available The Morgan Center will call you.
not_available Hospice? Rehab? 
not_available Hospice.
not_available What patient? 
not_available Your father asked me about it.
not_available He may choose palliative care.
not_available You called? 
not_available He asked me to.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available He asked.
not_available What would you have me do? 
not_available Have him talk to me.
not_available He's a grown man.
not_available A stubborn one.
not_available The other option is your apartment
not_available I know my options.
not_available You'll look after him? 
not_available With a daytime nurse.
not_available I'll do the rest.
not_available You talked to him? 
not_available I'm handling it, okay? Or I was.
not_available I didn't mean to interfere.
not_available Then don't.
not_available Is this what's best for him, or you? 
not_available Stay out of it, please.
not_available Fine.
not_available I can send her up now.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available They can squeeze you in.
not_available I can't see my own ob
not_available gyn? No.
not_available Too many potential complications with your renal failure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Yeah? This is Steve Maldonado.
not_available The transplant candidate.
not_available Right.
not_available You the surgeon? 
not_available No, but we'll get you started here.
not_available I went out and left my pager at home.
not_available I went home to get it and it went off.
not_available I had it on for 30 seconds.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The nurses need to draw your labs.
not_available This way.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available You all right? If I could have both, I would be.
not_available But I do want the baby.
not_available Ask for Christine Collins.
not_available Suite 4020.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Waters.
not_available The geneticist is Dr.
not_available Kevin Casey.
not_available I made an appointment for you on Friday at 11 to go over the results.
not_available I've been ordered to appear in court Friday afternoon.
not_available The incident.
not_available I can make a day out of it.
not_available Uncontrolled temper is a symptom of Huntington's.
not_available They may not hold you responsible.
not_available That's a lousy excuse.
not_available How is Jo doing? 
not_available She's meeting Glen in the lobby now.
not_available That's her fiancé.
not_available Does she want to have the test? 
not_available I didn't tell her.
not_available Mr.
not_available Waters, you have to.
not_available If she has the gene, she will get the disease.
not_available My father didn't tell me and I'm glad he didn't.
not_available She has a right to know.
not_available If there's nothing she can do, what's the good in her knowing? But if she knows, she can make different choices.
not_available She might not want to work or have kids.
not_available She might not get married.
not_available Might not have a life.
not_available She has to know that she can pass this disease on to her kids.
not_available Why? So she won't have any? I love my daughter.
not_available And I can't imagine my life without her.
not_available She's had a good life up until now.
not_available A happy life.
not_available I'm gonna keep it that way as long as I can.
not_available If you sign an emergency consent, I can overturn the decision.
not_available Doesn't DCFS have to appoint me? 
not_available I cleared it.
not_available I don't know.
not_available This girl's gonna die of pneumonia.
not_available Her mother wants it.
not_available Her foster mother.
not_available She's had her for four years.
not_available She's her mother.
not_available She just can't afford the medical bills.
not_available But the state can? How much has been spent so far? 
not_available Mark.
not_available All right, all right, I'll sign.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Let me know how she responds.
not_available I will.
not_available Can I help you, Robert? My niece watched Sesame Street, until she was 8.
not_available Those are the Muppets.
not_available You need something? I came for supplies.
not_available We need to discuss your supply management.
not_available And I find this girl's foster parent is conspiring with DCFS and you to circumvent authority and perform a procedure on a gork.
not_available She has no chance of recovery.
not_available Is this correct? 
not_available You' re overstating it.
not_available Am I? She has a potentially life
not_available threatening infection, all she needs is a central line.
not_available And her so
not_available called guardian has never seen her.
not_available Well, I've seen her.
not_available We have to give appropriate care.
not_available All I'm doing is exercising a safeguard that's built into the system.
not_available Your sympathy for her mother overrides your clinical judgment.
not_available I disagree.
not_available But thank you for your input.
not_available She's not getting a central line.
not_available She's my patient.
not_available Feel free to hydrate her.
not_available I have a second opinion.
not_available I'm the final opinion.
not_available I'm not competing with the State Welfare Department! It's one bureaucrat! 
not_available He's right! It's hopeless and expensive! Stop flogging her! Frankly, I expect more professionalism from you! I'm supporting a parental decision! Angie is her daughter! She's her pet! Look at her.
not_available What quality of life do you think she has? Robert
not_available Kerry, I'm serious.
not_available No central line.
not_available Has he always had asthma? 
not_available Since he was 3.
not_available I'm okay, Mom.
not_available You are not okay, Troy.
not_available I saw his wheezing getting worse from the audience.
not_available Breathe.
not_available She came and pulled me off the stage.
not_available That's no fun, is it? 
not_available I don't ever wanna go back to school.
not_available We got a bounce
not_available back.
not_available Collapsed at home.
not_available Loss of consciousness.
not_available Who? 
not_available Grunwald.
not_available Grunwald? He was constipated.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Pulse is down to 50! 
not_available He's unresponsive.
not_available Put in a liter of saline.
not_available See if you can get a BP.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He just fell over.
not_available Get labs, cardiac enzymes.
not_available Pressure's 60 palp.
not_available Mix the dopamine.
not_available He was your patient? 
not_available Yes, abdominal pain.
not_available ST elevations in the leads.
not_available History of heart disease? No cardiac problems, right? His heart is fine! He on medication? 
not_available Codeine and what she gave him.
not_available What was that? 
not_available A laxative.
not_available Bisopro.
not_available BisoprolBisoprolol? 
not_available Yes.
not_available No, no.
not_available We gave him bisacodyl.
not_available Which one was it? 
not_available Bisoprolol.
not_available But it's not what we gave.
not_available Hal, wake up! Can she wait outside, please? 
not_available Come with me.
not_available No, I should stay! We need to work on your husband.
not_available Call the cath lab.
not_available Bolus heparin.
not_available What are doing? You gave him a beta blocker? You dropped his heart rate, pulse, and gave him an Ml.
not_available BP's improving! 
not_available Stand by with a nitro drip.
not_available I didn't write the prescription.
not_available You said you did.
not_available Handed it to him.
not_available I didn't write it.
not_available Who wrote it? The labs are back on the transplant recipient.
not_available Good.
not_available Get ready to move him.
not_available You should see this.
not_available You're kidding? 
not_available Nope.
not_available What should I say? You think it's okay to tell her? 
not_available It's debatable.
not_available His choice is, not your obligation.
not_available This information affects her life.
not_available I feel I have an obligation to her.
not_available Right, but she isn't your patient.
not_available You can try to convince him.
not_available I did try.
not_available Then you can't tell the daughter.
not_available Your renal failure was caused by rhabdomyolysis.
not_available Yeah.
not_available From muscle breakdown.
not_available And what caused that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I think you do.
not_available I was in a car accident.
not_available That could've done it.
not_available Not using drugs? 
not_available No.
not_available You tested positive for cocaine.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I didn't know I was this high on the list.
not_available I hardly ever do it.
not_available I went to a party.
not_available I was depressed.
not_available Damn dialysis.
not_available Get used to it.
not_available I can't have the transplant? Cocaine destroyed your kidneys.
not_available You're still using.
not_available Why should you? 
not_available I won't do it after the operation.
not_available You wasted my time.
not_available Please, come on! I'm not an addict.
not_available I need this kidney! It's viable for only a limited time.
not_available I have an hour to get a real candidate.
not_available You mean someone who deserves it.
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen? Yes? 
not_available This is my fiancé.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Good.
not_available Glen thinks Dad might be suffering from depression.
not_available The mood swings and stuff.
not_available It might be the wedding.
not_available I know he wanted to pay for it.
not_available But it costs a lot of money.
not_available That would be tough.
not_available And Jo is his only daughter.
not_available I'll get the car.
not_available Nice to meet you, Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available So you think it's depression? Well, it's hard to say.
not_available Ready to go, Dad? 
not_available Yeah, I am.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Thanks for everything.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Kerry? I thought Romano said no to a central line.
not_available He did.
not_available You're doing it anyway? I have emergency consent from another physician.
not_available That's all I need.
not_available I've got this.
not_available You need Opsite.
not_available I've got it.
not_available But Kerry
not_available It's my decision.
not_available It doesn't involve you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Looks like a "P" to me.
not_available Bisoprolol.
not_available It's a "C." Why would I order that? What's that say, Carter? I can see how the pharmacy could have read it wrong.
not_available They should've called.
not_available Sure.
not_available Blame them.
not_available It can be read both ways.
not_available You, come here.
not_available I need an impartial observer.
not_available That's a faxed copyQuiet! "C" or a "P"? 
not_available It looks like a "Q." Someone else who can't read it.
not_available I prescribed bisacodyl.
not_available That's what I ordered and wrote.
not_available Then why is this patient having an angioplasty for an infarction? You heard me say bisacodyl? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you read the label before you handed it out? 
not_available There was a trauma coming in.
not_available Oh, a trauma came in! When traumas come in, we can hand out any meds that are around.
not_available Dr.
not_available RomanoCarter, shut up! Can I go? 
not_available The incompetence here is scary.
not_available Amazing we're not shut down.
not_available It was an honest mistake.
not_available No, it was tag
not_available team negligence! You are both prohibited from writing prescriptions.
not_available How are we going to treat patients? 
not_available Others will write them for you.
not_available How long? 
not_available Until you can write and you can read.
not_available I know how to read.
not_available Then do it! Thank you, Carter.
not_available Thank you, Carter.
not_available You gave him the pills without looking at it? 
not_available What you wrote was illegible.
not_available I shouldn't write your scrips anyway.
not_available I didn't ask you
not_available He's your patient.
not_available You always check the label.
not_available They teach you that on the first day.
not_available You called UNOS? 
not_available I had to get the next patient.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Nussbaum is coming from upstate Indiana in 40 minutes.
not_available That's too late.
not_available The new kidney might fail.
not_available I thought we were at 10 hours.
not_available We need to do a workup.
not_available We may need to wait to anesthetize.
not_available We'll assess her.
not_available She's already on her way.
not_available You should've talked to me.
not_available We were in a hurry, we had to move on.
not_available You may not like this guy, but we have a match who's ready for surgery.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available I'd rather put a healthy kidney in someone than not at all.
not_available The guy knows he's on the UNOS list and can be called at any moment and he's snorting cocaine? He's not going to stop using.
not_available He'll burn another organ.
not_available Your Mrs.
not_available Nussbaum might not get here in time.
not_available She might not qualify.
not_available It'll go to waste! Let it! I'd rather take the risk than give it to him.
not_available It's not your risk to take! 
not_available He made his choice.
not_available Give the next person a chance.
not_available Thirty minutes.
not_available Then I'm taking up Mr.
not_available Maldonado.
not_available I'm not releasing him.
not_available I don't need you to.
not_available She likes this one, huh? 
not_available It's her favorite.
not_available Most doctors think she's just responding to the light changes.
not_available But I notice a difference.
not_available At least I think I do.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver put in a central line? 
not_available I know you think it's too much.
not_available But I'm not ready to give her up yet.
not_available I understand.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Strep throat ready for discharge.
not_available Penicillin? Yep.
not_available Curtain 3 Were my instructions in any way unclear? 
not_available No, you made your position known.
not_available And you ignored it? 
not_available I took it under advisement.
not_available Then you're suspended.
not_available Sign out and go home.
not_available Robert, let's
not_available Right now, Kerry.
not_available Right now.
not_available Suspended? 
not_available Effective now, until further notice.
not_available Carter, you going home? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wish I weren't.
not_available My grandparents are throwing a dinner party.
not_available You have to go? 
not_available Attendance is compulsory.
not_available I have a question.
not_available Shoot.
not_available A 12year
not_available old has abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, no ill contacts.
not_available What do you do? Any vomiting? 
not_available No.
not_available Probably gastroenteritis.
not_available Sounds like a trick question.
not_available So I'd probably order a CBC and dip a urine to rule out a UTI.
not_available Thought so.
not_available Do I pick up anything abnormal? Nothing on the CBC.
not_available And I don't know about the urine because you didn't order one.
not_available You saw him last fall.
not_available Came back today
not_available Type Two diabetes.
not_available Hyperosmolar coma.
not_available Cleo told me.
not_available Is he gonna be okay? 
not_available Should be.
not_available Been nice if we caught it earlier.
not_available Yeah, kid must not have looked that sick.
not_available What did I say? Stomach flu? 
not_available Yep.
not_available I wish I could remember him.
not_available I feel bad.
not_available Must've misdiagnosed.
not_available He didn't have any insurance.
not_available Really? What are they gonna do? 
not_available They're okay.
not_available They have it now.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Anything else you wanna tell me? No.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Have a nice party.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Yes, Peter? I didn't like how we left things.
not_available You mean, you screaming at me? You mind if I come in? Suit yourself.
not_available I've got one more set.
not_available You always work out in your living room? Beats the garage.
not_available Listen, I I was angry that I got dragged into this.
not_available It wasn't even a surgical patient.
not_available Cleo, I know it gets crazy down there.
not_available I just want you to know that I don't blame you.
not_available Oh, you don't? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Want me to give you a hand? 
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available Am I forgiven? Peter, that was the lamest apology I've ever heard.
not_available I gotta hit the shower.
not_available You coming? What's next on the agenda? 
not_available I'm building an airplane.
not_available An airplane? 
not_available An airplane.
not_available Out of wood? Dad? Think it'll be ready by March? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, thanks for letting us
not_available I'm wearing it.
not_available I didn't wanna drag it to the can.
not_available I didn't say anything.
not_available You were gonna.
not_available Your backup oxygen's low.
not_available I didn't notice.
not_available I'll go get you one.
not_available It'll last tonight.
not_available I don't want to take any chances.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available I made some macaroni and cheese.
not_available There's some extra on the counter.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Say, I saw Elizabeth today.
not_available She told me.
not_available Did she say anything about that place, the hospice? I checked it out.
not_available There weren't any spots available.
not_available When will they have one available? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available They didn't say.
not_available There's a long waiting list.
not_available Waiting list? What's the point of that? I don't know.
not_available Looks like you're stuck with me for a while.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Luka! What are you doing? The grease from the meat dripped on the coals and caught on fire.
not_available That's what the water's for.
not_available You didn't tell me that.
not_available Here.
not_available What's left of it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It really cooled off out here, huh? The girls asleep? 
not_available One is still fussing.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Kate.
not_available You had a 50
not_available 50 shot.
not_available No.
not_available She's the troublemaker.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You think these are too thick? Might be rare inside.
not_available Well, don't worry.
not_available I have a steak and kidney pie in the freezer.
not_available Kidney, huh? Very funny.
not_available The nurses thought you'd take it home with you.
not_available I might as well have.
not_available You probably scared the guy into rehab.
not_available What's wrong? What? Is that snow? Oh, man! Hello! It's April! We can finish cooking inside.
not_available No, I came to barbecue.
not_available You wanna freeze? 
not_available It's only snow.
not_available I'll get a sweater.
not_available Your sweaters won't fit me.
not_available I'll find something.
