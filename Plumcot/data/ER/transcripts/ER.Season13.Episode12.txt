not_available Weaver said? Just give us a sec.
not_available Why in the world would you tell her that she could be awake? Look,she barely agreed to the surgery.
not_available Just just give her an epidural.
not_available The anesthesia is better with a general.
not_available She's afraid of the dark.
not_available She's a Katrina victim.

not_available Abdomen's tense.
not_available All right,I'll get the ultrasound and call for surgery.
not_available Wait,we don't even know what we're dealing with yet.
not_available I think we have a pretty good idea.
not_available Even if it is acute pancreatitis, first

not_available They need to be involved.
not_available Got a flash.
not_available Sats dropping,82.
not_available Mr.

not_available Mom,stop it! I did everything for him! 
not_available All right,Meg.
not_available I straightened him out 
not_available Meg when he was a mess,when he was just a useless vet! I used my husband's insurance money to put him through medical school! You don't get to have him,do you hear me?! Where's Kovac? Trauma two.

not_available I'll give him a pneumo.
not_available PVCs.

not_available 18
not_available gauge spinal needle, connector tubing,and a manometer.
not_available The guy's in arrest 
not_available we don't have time for that.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Checking for abdominal compartment syndrome.
not_available He's got a fatal arrhythmia.
not_available We should focus on the heart.
not_available Look, his BP sucks because the abdominal pressure is crushing the vena cava.
not_available Can't ventilate,because his belly's compressing his lungs.
not_available Okay,hold compressions.
not_available More than enough to cause end
not_available organ damage.
not_available Okay,resume compressions.
not_available Ten blade.
not_available Ma'am,what's your name? Marnie.
not_available Your husband's pancreatitis is causing swelling of all the abdominal organs.
not_available Another 50 of lido.
not_available Pushing it.

not_available ups,two sets.
not_available Retract superficial layers.
not_available I'm doing CPR.
not_available He won't need it after this.
not_available Back in sinus with a pulse.
not_available Saline and sterile towels.
not_available I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve.
not_available I can't lose you,T.
not_available This ain't just the booze,is it? You can't walk out on us! We're your family! Family?! Meg,what you did out there, you call that family?! I work here! You've been avoiding me.
not_available What did you want me to do? Move on.
not_available You don't love me anymore.
not_available Not the way you want me to.
not_available I'll change! It's not about that.
not_available You can't change.
not_available You'd rather be with that little bitch.
not_available Knock it off.
not_available She has nothing to do with this.
not_available She has everything to do with this.
not_available I'm going to tell you one last time,Meg.
not_available I'm sorry,but it is over.
not_available You don't care about Sarah? Of course I do.
not_available Well,I mean,do you not want to see her anymore? I never said that Meg.
not_available Because that's what's going to happen if you do this.
not_available You would hurt her just to get back at me? You're a damn liar.
not_available You prick! Damn little prick! 
not_available Knock it off.
not_available Listen.
not_available Listen to me,Meg.

not_available Sarah That's what he does.
not_available But he always comes back to us.
not_available When we opened you up, we learned that the infection had spread.
not_available We had to do the amputation.
not_available I should have never trusted you.
not_available With the new prosthetic legs, you'll have complete mobility.
not_available Every time I make a choice,it's wrong.
not_available This was the right thing to do.
not_available My husband and I were on that bridge for 27 hours before a helicopter came and and took us to the Superdome.
not_available And when the buses came,there was only one seat.
not_available I didn't want to go,but he insisted.
not_available And I took that seat.
not_available I left him there.
not_available It was about a week later when I found out he died in that stadium.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available I know.
not_available It's God's.
not_available Why did he do this? Take it all away? He didn't take it all.
not_available You're still alive.
not_available You're getting another chance.

not_available I'll need his medical records.
not_available Yeah,but the family's not gonna sue.
not_available The records are for the State Medical Board.
not_available There's gonna be an investigation.
not_available Angela,how's it going? Okay,just following up a record.
not_available I meant you,your daughter.
not_available How's Danielle? She's better,thanks,Luka, for everything.

not_available Oh.
not_available I'm not scaring you,am I? 'Cause you are one of the sanest guys that Sam has ever been with.
not_available We're just friends,Gracie.
not_available That's what Angelina and Brad said.
not_available Hey.
not_available Upstairs,do your homework, brush your teeth and go to bed,okay? Tomorrow we talk about the new rules.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go.
not_available All right! I'm sorry.
not_available You owe me dinner,right? I'm so sorry.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Uh,okay,we finish unloading and then I will order us a pizza or I've got a better idea.
not_available I'm glad we got past the awkward part.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You need a pharmacy license to dispense meds and your malpractice insurance covers you only in the hospital.
not_available I know.
not_available I I was trying to give back.
not_available It's a felony,Pratt.
not_available A man died.
not_available What was I thinking? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available This,this goes against everything you've learned.
not_available You okay,man? I don't know what to do.
not_available Were you the only one involved? Yeah,yeah,it was just me.
not_available Good.
not_available That's good.
not_available I'll,uh, talk to Angela,see what I can do.

not_available What I said before, you know how it is in this job.
not_available I shouldn't give in to the pressure.
not_available Look,I'm gonna,I'm gonna find budget cuts somewhere else.
not_available There is no way we're losing you.
not_available Thanks,but,uh, I resign.
not_available You what? I can't I've trained residents, I've saved lives, I even ran this place.
not_available I loved it.
not_available And I've probably gotten more than I've given, but now it's time to go.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver,what are you saying? Kerry? It's easy here.
not_available It's comfortable, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to stay.
not_available Are you gonna go to Florida? Yeah,I mean,after Sandy died,I I thought I got over it.
not_available I thought I moved on,but I I felt stuck,like I'm treading water and it's taken a few years, but now I'm finally ready to move forward.
not_available So if you're ever in Miami, turn on channel six and that's where you'll find me.
not_available And if I'm not there I'll be on the beach with my son.
not_available Kerry,wait.
not_available Kerry,Kerry please.
not_available Hey.
not_available Luka,we're all right.
not_available We're fine.
