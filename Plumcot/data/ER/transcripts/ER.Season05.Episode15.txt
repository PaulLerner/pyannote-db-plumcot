not_available Admit her to Medicine for a liver biopsy.
not_available Oh, Mrs.
not_available Ekabo.
not_available I'm sorry for making you wait.
not_available Do you want a soda? Dr.
not_available Greene said you have questions about your husband's surgery.
not_available Do you know what happened to Mobalage? He was tortured in Nigeria, right? Dr.
not_available Greene said that after tomorrow he'll be able to have relations again? Yes, if it's successful.
not_available I don't know if I can.
not_available Can you tell me why not? Mobalage was a student leader.
not_available A dissident.
not_available After they tortured him, he fled.
not_available And when I joined him, he was happy we were together but not interested in me in that way.
not_available Well you have to help him through this.
not_available I should go.
not_available I'm sorry to bother you.
not_available Wait, Mrs.
not_available Ekabo.
not_available What is it? I can't 
not_available You can't what? After he left they came for me.
not_available Ten soldiers.
not_available Each took their turn.
not_available All night and into the next day in our home.
not_available I never told him.
not_available I want him to be happy but I don't know if I can be with a man again.
not_available You have to tell him.
not_available No.
not_available It would kill him.
not_available But he loves you.
not_available No.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I didn't mean to wake you up.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What time is it? It's 2:30.
not_available Sutures look great.
not_available Who did them? Peter.
not_available Took forever.
not_available He's kind of a perfectionist, if you hadn't noticed.
not_available We got a bed for you upstairs so you can get some real sleep.
not_available How you feeling? Sore.
not_available So, what is it? Peter took some more blood.
not_available How have you been feeling lately? A little rundown.
not_available Is it AIDS? No.
not_available Your T
not_available cell count was normal.
not_available But your liver function tests indicate that you might have hepatitis.
not_available And your abdominal CT showed a small amount of fluid around your liver capsule.
not_available Have you been tested? Yeah.
not_available I had a hepatitis B vaccination five or six years ago.
not_available I hadn't had an A.
not_available So you think it's C? It might be.
not_available We need to admit you and do a few tests.
not_available That sounds like the doctor answer.
not_available I was kind of hoping for the "good friend" answer.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That would be my guess.
not_available All this time I'm worrying about HIV and I get hepatitis C? Huh? We should do the biopsy.
not_available I might be wrong.
not_available Wouldn't be the first time.
not_available Maybe the second time, huh? Maybe the third time.

not_available We need to get them therapy.
not_available I'll call Riley.
not_available See if he knows anybody who specializes in PTSD in torture victims.
not_available Doug says he's gonna quit.
not_available Yeah? I think he's serious.
not_available Maybe he should.
not_available You want him to go? I'm done, Carol.
not_available I love him like a brother but I can't do this anymore.
not_available It's too hard.
not_available He says he wants to move to Seattle or Portland.
not_available Wants me to go with him.
not_available Are you going to? I can't remember a time when I didn't love him.
not_available I'll miss you.
not_available Maybe more than I'll miss him.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Mrs.

not_available dollar homes and Stoli martinis.
not_available He was in agony.
not_available He was dying.
not_available Not in days, in hours.
not_available You stole my son from me.

not_available Yeah.
not_available And you irritate the hell out of me.
not_available Right.
not_available Right, so clearly this is not something that's gonna work.
not_available Between hospital policy and us not liking each other we should accept that yesterday was a mistake and we should Things should go back to the way they were.
