not_available Yeah.

not_available She had heart failure? 
not_available Not since the transplant.
not_available She's been doing well.
not_available Hey, Mia.

not_available Sublingual captopril of nitrate.
not_available I'm Simon, new attending.
not_available Sam.
not_available Let's start airway first.
not_available This is only gonna take a second.
not_available We got to put her on a breathing machine.
not_available She really hated that after surgery.
not_available When her lungs are this bad, we don't have a choice.
not_available Ready with thorazine.
not_available Aah.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available You're at the hospital, honey.
not_available Pulse ox is 95.
not_available Wow.
not_available Those lips, those eyes, it'd be a crime to intubate a face like that.
not_available What'd you get me? You all right? We don't talk much anymore.
not_available Like we don't know what to say.
not_available Well, we should fix that.
not_available I miss you, Abby.
not_available Abby? 
not_available Janet.

not_available I rushed over here.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.

not_available I can get you a cup of coffee if you want.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing.

not_available It's been a week.
not_available He's been waiting a week for you.
not_available I'm not so sure about that.
not_available You can't keep putting it off.
not_available What if it doesn't work? 
not_available It works as long as you believe in it.
not_available I'm not talking about the program.
not_available I'm talking about my marriage.
not_available I just I don't know if I can fix it.
not_available What does it mean when a phone doesn't even go to voicemail? Is there an attending around? 
not_available That would be Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Ah.
not_available Laverne St.
not_available John, Really? With an overnight? 
not_available Some girls have all the fun.

not_available hm.
not_available You giving her to new guy? He seems to know how to do everything.
not_available Morris, I said no.

not_available That's what Dr.
not_available Mengele said.
not_available Great, thank you.

not_available Wanna make a quick hundred bucks? 
not_available Does it involve a French maid's outfit? No, I have a proposal due tomorrow.
not_available I need one test subject.
not_available What you have to do? Study the effects of conducted electrical weapons.

not_available It's just a five second shock.
not_available We record all your vitals 
not_available Forget it.
not_available How about for 200? 
not_available E and B's ready.
not_available Can I go with her? 
not_available It's best if you stay down here.
not_available Is that okay with you? It's not like I haven't had a biopsy before.
not_available I'll be waiting here for you.
not_available He seems like a good guy.
not_available Yeah, he really is.
not_available How long you been together? 
not_available About a year, I guess? It was 14 months ago.
not_available A few days after she got the heart.
not_available You met in the hospital? She was in cardiac rehab.
not_available We hit it off pretty quickly.
not_available He drove me to my doctors' "appointments " made sure I had my meds.
not_available I called him my recovery buddy.
not_available I can't imagine being without her.
not_available Well, you're lucky to have found that, especially so young.
not_available Every day, I thank God for bringing us together.
not_available Let's stock continuous albuterol at 20nl.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thank you for the med student.
not_available Intelligent and enthusiastic and docile.
not_available I'm surprised you didn't keep her for yourself.
not_available Doctor, this whole orientation shift, it's a formality.
not_available It's wasn't really my idea.
not_available So let's make it work.
not_available No sense getting in the same case.
not_available Instead of burdening you, I'll see patients on my own? 
not_available Lf that's what you want.
not_available Best for everyone.
not_available There's a trauma coming in, want me to take it? 
not_available Sure, thanks.
not_available Huh.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Sam, family in Exam 4, they're requesting a chaplain.
not_available Well, who's filling in for Julia? 
not_available I asked Father Brian.
not_available Who's that? Temp chaplain? No, he's Julia's replacement.
not_available She quit.
not_available Pratt, it's a double trauma.
not_available All right, come on.
not_available Let's clear two rooms.
not_available Kelly Robinson, 69, assisted living resident.
not_available Victim of assault.
not_available Chest trauma, facial lat.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Brenner.
not_available It hurts to breathe.
not_available Who beat her up? 
not_available That old bitch.
not_available Because you dropped me, dummy.
not_available She fell backwards off a table.
not_available Right onto my head.
not_available Few seconds at best.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available The hell it was.
not_available Then she started kicking and punching like a lunatic.
not_available Let's settle down.
not_available We'll get her in Trauma 2.
not_available I'll take her in Trauma 2.
not_available Go ahead, you can have it.
not_available What was she doing on the table? 
not_available We had a communal living workshop.
not_available It was a trust exercise.
not_available I'll never trust you again, whore.
not_available You know what? I feel like my whole life I haven't had control of a single thing.
not_available It's like I've just been, like, floating.
not_available Well, that's the disease.
not_available Drinking takes over, it directs your impulses.
not_available You stay out of its grip, you keep control.
not_available Yeah, well, maybe it's too late.
not_available All right.
not_available Thinking like that only opens up the way to a relapse.
not_available Are you looking for an excuse? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm not looking for excuses.
not_available It's just how many chances do you get? I'm already, like, two or probably three past what anyone actually deserves.
not_available So who decides how many chances you deserve? I don't know.
not_available Maybe he does.
not_available Yeah, he came to see me.
not_available Two weeks into rehab.
not_available I was very moved that he would come all that way for me, but, you know There's more to it than that.
not_available There's some pictures when I brought Joe to the seaside.
not_available You didn't bring him? I only came for a day or two to take care of some things, yeah.
not_available And I thought it might be too hard.
not_available Probably, yeah.
not_available What things? You said "take care of some things.
not_available " Uh I quit.
not_available I'm not gonna work at County again.
not_available Just after everything with my father, with you I was thinking I need something else.
not_available Are you gonna stop practicing medicine? I don't know.
not_available Maybe a different area.
not_available Well 
not_available Ah.
not_available It's like those halls are haunted to me.
not_available I mean, not exactly haunted, it's "just " 
not_available I need a clean break.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yup.
not_available So I gotta go.
not_available So I'm done here in two weeks.
not_available And I didn't Do you wanna come back here? Or should I meet you and Joe in Croatia? We'll see.
not_available What do you mean, "we'll see"? Right now it feels good for Joe and me to be there with my family.
not_available I think he's happy.
not_available Me too.
not_available Um Yeah, we'll see where we are when you're done here.
not_available How you feel, how I feel.
not_available You know, Luka Hey, and I also hope you'll let me know when you wanna tell me the truth.
not_available About what? Sats at 92.
not_available Okay, excuse us while we talk shop? Okay, what do you think about.
not_available 10 in this left costal margin? Let's do a chest x
not_available ray to rule out pneumothorax.
not_available Got any better ideas? Are we worried about the spleen? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You want morphine? 
not_available Fentanyl.
not_available Why don't you head next door.
not_available Maybe Dr.
not_available Pratt could use some help.
not_available But, I We're okay in here.
not_available Laverne, what's another way to diagnose a collapsed lung? You hear that, you old battleaxe, you collapsed my lung.
not_available Screw you, you had it coming.
not_available How much Ativan? 
not_available Start with two.
not_available You're just an old tart.
not_available She's combative from the trauma.
not_available I'm not combative.
not_available I thought you're with Brenner.
not_available He sent me in here.
not_available Senile kook.
not_available This is all your fault.
not_available You are rough on each other.
not_available What are you, professional wrestlers? We used to work together.
not_available We were librarians.
not_available Heh.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is that a blown pupil? All right, 15 liters O2 by mass.
not_available Let's mix up mannitol and make sure Do you need me, Dr.
not_available Pratt? What's going on in there? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner didn't like any of my ideas.
not_available He suggested I go to library and read.
not_available What? He also suggested I use a different eye shadow and do something different with my hair.
not_available He what? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Please don't make us go back in there.
not_available Call CT.
not_available She needs to be in the scanner as soon as the mannitol is in.
not_available Put her on a portable monitor, I'll be right back.
not_available And this is fentanyl.
not_available This is the really good stuff.
not_available I mean, for the special patients.
not_available While we fix you up, you're gonna be floating in a state of bliss.
not_available You know, I know this is your first day and I don't wanna embarrass "you " but this is a teaching hospital.
not_available So that means that you have to actually teach.
not_available You see, those guys, they look up to us as examples.
not_available Heh.
not_available So this is me trying to preserve their illusion that you are actually worthy of their admiration.
not_available Okay? All right.
not_available One more thing, keep a lid on talking about people's hair and their "makeup " " or" I'll make sure Human Resources throws you right out on your ass.
not_available I didn't realize you were running the floor, Greg.
not_available Keep it up, man.
not_available And I'll make you real familiar with the floor.
not_available All right, guys, it's all good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner will see you now.
not_available Hey, Pratt told me that the chaplain quit.
not_available You didn't mention that.
not_available Yeah, I didn't think it was that important.
not_available Did she find another job? I think she's gonna stay in Nepal for a couple years.
not_available A couple years.
not_available Hmm.
not_available We broke up.
not_available Just a little embarrassing being dumped like that.
not_available Well, it happens.
not_available Not really.
not_available It's new to me.
not_available You're such an ass.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates, are the biopsy results back? Your rejection fraction dropped from 60 percent to 25 percent.
not_available That doesn't sound very good.
not_available And under the microscope, we see that your heart is full of white blood cells.
not_available So your immune system is attacking the heart.
not_available It's rejection.
not_available But you can treat it, can't you? What do we need to do? This medication is to stop the rejection.
not_available What if that doesn't work? Don't worry, it's gonna work.
not_available Worst
not_available case scenario, you go back on the transplant list.
not_available No.
not_available Maybe there's some better medicines you don't know about.
not_available Shouldn't there be a specialist here? 
not_available Jordan.
not_available This is what Cardiology recommends.
not_available The heart she's got is perfectly fine.
not_available It's a good heart.
not_available Just find a way to keep it working.
not_available Here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What are you thinking? 
not_available Ahem.
not_available That I've been here before.
not_available Hmm.
not_available That I'm gonna have to be honest with him about something " I" don't really wanna talk about.
not_available Well, it's possible that the details don't matter.
not_available He's smart enough to know that the behavior was a disease.
not_available So don't tell him? It's about what they need to hear, not about what you need to say.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okay.
not_available So tell the truth.
not_available Unless it's too difficult, in which case lying is okay.
not_available To omit, maybe.
not_available Omit.
not_available Janet, omit is a nice word for lie.
not_available And it's like he knows.
not_available He knows.
not_available He knows there's more to it than I told him.
not_available All right.
not_available It's 
not_available Easy.
not_available It was Kevin Moretti.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hmm.
not_available It all makes more sense now.
not_available What does? When Luka came to Chicago, he came to see me at the hospital.
not_available He did? 
not_available Yeah, you were deep in recovery then.
not_available I didn't think it would help you to know.
not_available It might set you back.
not_available This is my marriage, Janet.
not_available We shouldn't even be discussing this.
not_available She won't tell me.
not_available That's her choice.
not_available I've tried to accept that because I want her to get better but how much am I to take? I can't talk to you about this.
not_available And I don't know anything that's going to help you.
not_available You stay committed to each other.
not_available Everything can work out.
not_available That great, that's really great.
not_available Is that how it worked for you? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Your husband left you, you've been alone ever since.
not_available I have stayed healthy and made life work.
not_available What about your husband? Your kids, are they happy? 
not_available We get by.
not_available You get by? And learn how to live with collateral damage? Everybody's got collateral damage.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll keep that in mind.
not_available I thought it was just venting, frustration.
not_available I've seen that before.
not_available I didn't realize it.
not_available How really torn up he was inside.
not_available Man.
not_available That there really was something more that he needed to know.
not_available You still want Neurosurg? No, the head CT was normal, there's no bleed.
not_available What about the blown pupil? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But call Ortho for the hand.
not_available I'll be next door.
not_available How we doing in here? 
not_available Great.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner's superb.
not_available He put this in, it didn't even hurt.
not_available A nickel every time a woman said that.
not_available All right, easy now, doctor.
not_available Status? I diagnosed pneomothorax using ultrasound thus saving her any unnecessary radiation to thyroid and breasts.
not_available What about our residents, getting hands
not_available on experience? Assisting the whole time.
not_available Laverne prepped us up with Betadine and Larry took the packaging off the chest tube.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner, mind if I get your opinion on an x
not_available ray? Yeah.
not_available I'm just gonna start on this facial laceration.
not_available That's okay, Dr.
not_available Weston's 
not_available Six of barkin.
not_available There you go.
not_available You won't even have a scar.
not_available Thank God you're here.
not_available So am I right in understanding that this injury is the result of a patient punching a coworker? Yeah, you should see if you can recruit her for hockey team.
not_available Ortho only has one more week to abuse me.
not_available And what, ahem, is this? That's your patient's crown.
not_available She was the team leader Don't touch that.
not_available That's thorn apple.
not_available It's a "Datura Stramonium.
not_available " It's a powerful anticholinergic.
not_available You get any in your eye, you'll be fixed and dilated.
not_available That explains her blown pupil.
not_available You were worried that it was No, I was never, I'm good I'm Simon Brenner.
not_available Neela Rasgotra from Surgery.
not_available Lovely to meet you.
not_available I look forward to working with you.
not_available Likewise.
not_available Think I can get you for five minutes in private? You'll have to take a number.
not_available I've got unstable GI bleed and then check on Kelly, but lovely to meet you.
not_available New attending? Seems like a nice bloke.
not_available Is that what you call it? 
not_available He's clearly smart.
not_available I didn't know anything about thorn apple, did you? I've heard of it.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra, I have an emergency consult.
not_available I've gotta reduce 
not_available This is critical, it can't wait.
not_available What is so critical? 
not_available My career.
not_available Morris, I'm trying to see a patient.
not_available You know the expression "publish or perish"? If I don't get this, I could be seeing earaches at Wal
not_available Mart.
not_available What do you want from me? I'll simply monitor all your physiological parameters for five minutes following a brief application Get that thing away from me.
not_available What? There's nothing to worry about.
not_available My study passed the investigational review board This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
not_available I desperately need a test subject.
not_available Then why don't you just Taser yourself.
not_available Okay, T3 is in.
not_available He's making sure my parents are okay.
not_available They don't freak out.
not_available Well, any guy who can handle his in
not_available laws is a keeper.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, Mia " I'm" trying to figure out why "you're " 
not_available Why you're in rejection.
not_available Doesn't that happen sometimes? Back when I was getting a transplant, they told me that.
not_available It's not as common in this type of situation unless someone stopped taking their meds.
not_available Do you ever forget to do that? My medication? No.
not_available Your cyclosporine is pretty low.
not_available About half of what it should be.
not_available I try to take them.
not_available I do.
not_available Your meds are keeping you alive, Mia.
not_available I know that you know that.
not_available Don't tell him, please.
not_available Why, because he'd get upset that you're killing yourself? 
not_available That's not what I'm doing.
not_available Then what? I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I know he loves me, I know that.
not_available It's just that 
not_available That guy wants you healthy.
not_available What's the problem? My heart.
not_available It came from his fiancÃ©e.
not_available She got into a bike accident, was brain
not_available dead and a couple of days after the transplant he started to visit, offered to help.
not_available And I felt so bad for him.
not_available He was destroyed.
not_available So he's not your boyfriend? It didn't start off like "that " but a couple of months ago, I realized I let it go too far.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available So you stopped taking the meds? I started doing things that didn't make "sense " because I care about him.
not_available I wanna help him, but it's just He's not the one.
not_available Getting sober means being honest with yourself and with the people you love, and you were right before.
not_available It means being honest about everything.
not_available Yeah, well, here's the thing.
not_available I'm a liar.
not_available I grew up lying about my crazy mother and now I lie to my husband and I lie to my coworkers.
not_available I lie to myself 
not_available Abby.
not_available I lie to my sponsor.
not_available I drank at work.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Displaced femoral neck fracture, right? You asking me? No, that's what it is.
not_available I'll get a hair traction.
not_available No, I wanna try 5 pounds of Bucks Traction.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah, Sam, I'm sure.
not_available We all lie.
not_available I am 12 years sober.
not_available And I can't say I know that I won't relapse at some point.
not_available But I sure as hell believe that I won't.
not_available And that is the best thing I got going for myself.
not_available Every day I look in the mirror and try to tell myself the truth.
not_available What if I can't? You already are.
not_available Hey, Bettina.
not_available It's Greg.
not_available Check your cell, there's something wrong with your voicemail.
not_available Anyway, I'm here in the ER.
not_available I'll be here all night, so if you get this, call me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available I already said no.
not_available I'll take the shock, you fire the weapon.
not_available Go away.
not_available I got a release form.
not_available Clearing you of any responsibility in event of Okay, think about it and, you know, get back to me later.
not_available Tony.
not_available No.
not_available Hey, there.
not_available Hey.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates says you're not feeling so good.
not_available We're giving her diuretics to dry out the lungs and IV meds to increase her cardiac output.
not_available Well, whatever you gotta do to keep that ticker going.
not_available If it doesn't work, we may need to intubate.
not_available Just to help the lungs.
not_available If her heart keeps failing, Mia is at risk for arrhythmias, cardiac arrest Can we not talk about that now? Jordan I am so grateful for everything that you've done for me.
not_available I've done it for us.
not_available This past year has been a gift.
not_available I know that.
not_available I will know that for the rest of my life.
not_available But I think We were both at very intense points in our lives and I think we got a little confused.
not_available Confused? I know it's hard.
not_available You know what? But I think you understand what I'm trying to say.
not_available You know what? I think we should talk when you feel better.
not_available I got to go outside, I promised I'd call your mother.
not_available Jordan.
not_available Uh You know she's gonna be upset if she can't get through, "so " I'm gonna call.
not_available I'll come back when she calls.
not_available Jordan.
not_available Hey, Jordan.
not_available I got to make a call.
not_available Hey, buddy, come on.
not_available Let's go take a walk.
not_available Let's take a walk, Jordan, okay? And I was thinking of a poem before, actually.
not_available Before, when I was getting ready.
not_available And I think it 
starts I carry your heart in my heart.
not_available You are a good nurse, Abby.
not_available But you could be a great doctor.
not_available You just need a little confidence.
not_available I am never without it.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Heh.
not_available No.
not_available I just can't stop thinking about What she must have gone through " and" I can't stop thinking about how afraid she must have been " and" I can't stop thinking about why we couldn't save her.
not_available I just Anywhere I go, you go.
not_available A compass? I know it's corny, but it seems we always find each other.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available I carry your heart.
not_available I carry it in my heart.
not_available What if I don't know how to love it right? "Abby.
not_available " "I'm afraid I'd mess it up, Luka.
not_available " We won't.
not_available Ask me again.
not_available Ask me to marry you.
not_available So.
not_available I guess what I'm saying is, let's just try to love each other and Persevere.
not_available Chuny, have you seen Brenner around? 
not_available In Trauma.
not_available He's playing peacekeeper with the two ladies.
not_available Great.
not_available As someone once 
said "To forgive is to set a prisoner free, and realize that prisoner was you.
not_available " Michelle.
not_available I'm sorry I hurt you.
not_available Look, we need to talk.
not_available And I'm sorry I didn't use my full strength to catch you.
not_available Now, doesn't that feel good? Not as good as when I'm doing her boyfriend.
not_available Haha
not_available ha.
not_available You lying strumpet, you will rot.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Larry, Laverne, they're all yours.
not_available Think those two can handle that? Yeah, they could handle a lot if you let them.
not_available That's right, you said that before.
not_available No disrespect.
not_available But you're making it real hard for me to respect you.
not_available You're taking the procedures.
not_available Not letting them do physicals.
not_available They don't know what they're doing.
not_available They've been to med school.
not_available You've either got it or you don't.
not_available Excuse me? You know what I'm talking about.
not_available Some catch on, others never get it.
not_available Yeah, but it's our job to train them.
not_available That is sweet, Greg, but it's also a complete waste of time.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available Look, I teach people that can benefit.
not_available Ah.
not_available What about Larry and Laverne? Well, they're adorable and eager and absolutely clueless.
not_available I could spoon
not_available feed everything I know.
not_available It'd pass to them like a case of cholera.
not_available So, what do you suggest instead? Encourage them to find new careers.
not_available I don't know where you came from, but this is a teaching hospital.
not_available So if you can't accept that everybody needs to learn " then" you don't belong here.
not_available Okay, sorry.
not_available Remind me again.
not_available You're not the Chief of Department, right? 
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Okay, that's great.
not_available So you do things your way, and I'll stick with the way that works.
not_available Shift's over.
not_available It's been a pleasure, but I gotta go.

not_available You ready to shoot me? Beth and I met our senior year in college.
not_available We got engaged two years later, we'd never spend a day apart.
not_available She must have been pretty special.
not_available It seemed wrong when I lost her.
not_available Not like it didn't happen, but like it shouldn't happened.
not_available It couldn't have happened.
not_available When I heard they'd found a recipient, I just wanted to meet her.
not_available That information is usually confidential, Jordan.
not_available I did some snooping around.
not_available You know, I was a man on a mission.
not_available It's all I had left of her.
not_available First love is rough.
not_available It's hard trying to find that feeling again.
not_available Whew.
not_available When I finally met Mia I just wanted to stay connected, you know? Maybe it's time to let go.
not_available Let go of Mia? Let go of Beth.
not_available Tony, her sats are bottoming out.
not_available Mia? Hundred percent? 
not_available Yeah, but it's not helping.

not_available Too late, Frank, my stuff's on ice.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Ready, set Hold on.
not_available I have to record data for a full five minutes after the shock.
