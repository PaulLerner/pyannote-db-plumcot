not_available country.
not_available It's great exercise.
not_available You're the moron.
not_available Sitting on the lake in winter with your pole.

not_available I think you're a fool for freezing on a lake.
not_available Who gave him that "Improve Your Vocabulary" calendar? I did.
not_available It broadens his horizons.

not_available head.

not_available Just get his coat and sweater off.
not_available IKid eats nothing but French fries and pizza.

not_available I hate you both.
not_available Nice package, huh? So, you two getting serious? She is.

not_available You're learning a new language.
not_available Reece is already getting it.

not_available He wants to communicate.

not_available We got him 15 minutes ago.
not_available He wasn't expected to make it.
not_available His mother wanted him to die at home.
not_available Joi, why did you call the paramedics? I didn't.
not_available Do you want us to use extraordinary measures?

not_available Oh, that's barbaric.
not_available Payment's 700 a month.
not_available That's a quarter of my take
not_available home pay.
not_available Money woes, Peter? Every Resident's chief complaint.
not_available I'll never understand this country's insistence on forcing its highly
not_available trained Residents to live in poverty.
not_available Only way the public health system can afford to provide care the freeloaders.
not_available By freeloaders, you mean people without education job training, children and the infirm.
not_available Like I said, freeloaders.
not_available You are a despicable human being.
not_available Do you know that? Having trouble making ends meet? 
not_available Things are tight.
not_available Why don't you apply to a Locum Tenens program? A Locum what? Tenens.
not_available Filling in for vacationing surgeons in rural hospitals in Minnesota, the Dakotas, on your vacation.
not_available They don't have staff to cover when somebody's out.
not_available They pay a bundle.
not_available What's a "bundle"? Eight, ten grand for a couple weeks.
not_available Where's the big storm? Should be any minute now.
not_available They're closing all those schools at lunch recommending people leave early.
not_available They emphasized the importance of leaving early to get home safely.
not_available No, Jerry.
not_available The National Weather Service 
not_available I said, no.
not_available Anspaugh said it might be months before we get a new Chief.
not_available Months with Romano? Did we do some
not_available thing in a past life to deserve this? There's Viking in my family.
not_available Maybe I pillaged Northern Europe.
not_available Pillaged? Cool.
not_available Bet you looked great in a horn hat.
not_available Maybe you should consider re
not_available applying.
not_available Once foolish, twice stupid.
not_available Don might entertain renewed interest.
not_available I spoke to him about you.
not_available I don't know if I could go through all that again.
not_available Can I tell him you seemed interested? 
not_available How about "intrigued"? Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for Mr.
not_available Abbott.
not_available Who? 
not_available Richard Abbott.
not_available His son Ricky died here this morning.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I was with him earlier, but I haven't seen him.
not_available I work with Richard down at the state attorney's office.
not_available He's asked us to open an investigation about his son's death.
not_available Have the police arrived yet? Hi.
not_available How are you? I'm fine.
not_available I'm sorry Richard hit you.
not_available We've been separated since Michael died.
not_available I called him yesterday to tell him Ricky That he should probably try to come see him.
not_available He was at a conference in Houston, so I left a message.
not_available And when he arrived this morning and saw that Ricky was gone he kind of lost it.
not_available He just wasn't ready.
not_available It's time for you to let the nurses finish up with Ricky.
not_available Have you made arrangements for him? I think I'll go to the same funeral home that took care of Michael.
not_available I'll call them.
not_available Give me the number, I'll call them.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Got a moment? What's up, Mark? The police are here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Abbott is accusing you of murdering his son.
not_available She was hit in the face kickboxing.
not_available Not kickboxing.
not_available Tae
not_available Bo class.
not_available It's aerobics, but better.
not_available It's supposed to be good for losing weight.
not_available I lost 16 pounds.
not_available Sixteen pounds? Wow! I had everybody spread out enough, but a new guy shows up and she got kicked.
not_available Did you lose consciousness? No, but I was pretty dizzy.
not_available How long did it take to lose? 
not_available Just melted off.
not_available I hope this won't keep me from getting back to class.
not_available Fundus is sharp, no papilledema.
not_available Want to palpate the orbit? 
not_available No.
not_available Is it expensive? 
not_available Not bad.
not_available It's worth it.
not_available You feel this? Any numbness? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you have early classes? 
not_available Any visual changes? Shapes? Things out of focus? I teach a 5:30 class.
not_available If you buy 20, you get five free.
not_available No kidding? 
not_available Where's a phone? There's a pay phone.
not_available No step
not_available off.
not_available I'm concerned about your blurred vision.
not_available Let's get some facial films and a visual acuity.
not_available If you think you can tear yourself away for five minutes, stitch her up.
not_available Your wish is my command.
not_available Irrigate and suture.
not_available I don't usually get a lunch break.
not_available I eat out of the vending machines.
not_available First, lidocaine to numb the area.
not_available Then you'll feel a little bit of wetness as I irrigate the wound.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Yeah? The cut's pretty deep.
not_available Should I do a few subcutaneous first? Yeah, absolutely.
not_available I'll check back with you in a bit.
not_available Was he staring at my ass? The coroner's coming over to get the body and do an autopsy.
not_available Roger Julian's coming from Genetics.
not_available Says Ricky was on his service.
not_available Wants to know where the mother got Dilaudid.
not_available He was dying.
not_available You promised IKerry and I that you wouldn't prescribe 
not_available He was in pain.
not_available You promised yesterday! 
not_available The mother was begging me.
not_available Where did you get the machine? 
not_available I got it from Carol's clinic.
not_available Come here.
not_available Carol's clinic doesn't have PCAs.
not_available She called in a favor, got it from one of her suppliers.
not_available The police are on their way to Joi Abbott's house.
not_available They have a warrant to impound the PCA.
not_available Are they gonna find anything strange? Like what? Like the machine set with enough to kill 10 grown men? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What? You set it! This boy was suffering.
not_available He had end
not_available stage ALD, in agony.
not_available The mother was watching him die.
not_available Did you help him along? I gave the mother the entry code and showed her how to change the dosage.
not_available I don't know what she did afterwards.
not_available You would've done the same.
not_available Anspaugh's coming with Romano and Julian.
not_available Doug got the PCA and the Dilaudid through Carol's clinic.
not_available What? When? Right after he told us he wouldn't.
not_available We'll have to tell Anspaugh about Doug violating the pain study protocol and our covering it up.
not_available They're gonna scrutinize everything he's prescribed.
not_available They'll interview the mother.
not_available It'll come out.
not_available What's wrong with you?! We trusted you, and you immediately choose to betray that trust.
not_available I'm done defending you.
not_available You've been trying to nail me.
not_available I don't "nail" colleagues.
not_available If you want to destroy your own career, that's fine.
not_available Stay away from mine.
not_available Have you called an attorney? I don't need an attorney.
not_available It was the right thing to do, Mark.
not_available He had a degenerative genetic disorder.
not_available His brother died of the same disease several years ago.
not_available I have a child.
not_available I don't know what I'd do under similar circumstances.
not_available Look, I know Mr.
not_available Abbott is upset, but his son died.
not_available There's nothing Dr.
not_available Ross or any other physician could do about it.
not_available This PCA 
machine It delivers pain medication to the patient? A steady dose through an IV.
not_available Can the patient or their parent program the machine to increase the dosage if the patient is in pain? No.
not_available They can give a booster every hour.
not_available But they need a code to change the dosage.
not_available That way they can't mess up.
not_available That's what I thought.
not_available I was surprised when Mrs.
not_available Abbott said Dr.
not_available Ross had given her the code and showed her how to change the dosage before he left.
not_available Why do you think he would do that? You covered up a serious breach of a federally
not_available funded program? It was in the hospital's best interest to keep it from becoming public.
not_available It'll go public now, in connection with a high
not_available profile euthanasia case.
not_available Where did Ross get a PCA? 
not_available The clinic.
not_available God, what a fiasco! 
not_available What about Ross? Take him out back and shoot him.
not_available We'll convene a meeting of the disciplinary committee and investigate.
not_available Okay, but don't conclude it until we know if the father's going to sue.
not_available Ross keeps working? You can have him dispense aspirin if you want to, I don't care.
not_available Don't take any further action.
not_available What about Hathaway's clinic? Close it.
not_available Public Relations will handle all the press inquiries.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano and I will make sure the staff cooperates with the police.
not_available That's it.
not_available IKerry, Mark I don't know what to say.
not_available When the dust settles, I'll personally chair an investigation into this and the appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.
not_available And on a more personal note I don't think I've ever been more disappointed.
not_available IKerry, I'm sorry this I just beat it in.
not_available The roads are getting really slick.
not_available It took me forever to navigate the IKennedy.
not_available Traffic was backed up for miles.
not_available What's the matter? Somebody die? Somebody we know? Dr.
not_available Ross lost the ALD kid.
not_available The police are in Trauma Two.
not_available The boy's father accused Doug of giving him an overdose.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available Coroner took the body.
not_available Police are interviewing.
not_available Where's Doug? In the Pedes Room, I think.
not_available Have you seen the labs on that drunk with the head lac? No, but he threw up on me again.
not_available Third scrub top today.
not_available We should wire a bucket to his head like a feed bag for horses.
not_available Any word on Doug Ross? Police are interviewing Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Have you seen Lucy? Dr.
not_available Edson keeps calling.
not_available Last time I saw her she was Hey, where's my kickboxer? Dr.
not_available Weaver moved her into Exam Two when that MI came in.
not_available Lucy was still working on her.
not_available Suturing? 
not_available That should've taken two minutes.
not_available I haven't seen her.
not_available My heart's really pumping.
not_available You're getting it.
not_available Five, six seven, eight, and Dr.
not_available Carter, are you okay? Don't move.
not_available Chuny, a backboard and a hard collar.
not_available I don't see any other blood.
not_available Nice kick.
not_available Damn! What happened? 
not_available I kicked him in the chest.
not_available I was practicing my Tae
not_available Bo.
not_available Now we're gonna roll him.
not_available Back under there.
not_available Watch your stethoscope, man.
not_available Pull back.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available So it's good, huh? 
not_available Terrific.
not_available I'm definitely going.
not_available Maybe I'll come with you.
not_available Hey, Doug, I just heard.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Didn't anyone explain Ricky's medical condition to them? And they're still pursuing it? Apparently so.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Can I do anything for you? Do you need anything? You know, you're the first person to ask me that all day.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm supposed to work a fast track, but I can get someone to cover.
not_available I don't have much to do.
not_available Weaver pulled me away from seeing patients.
not_available Told me to sit here and catch up on paperwork.
not_available For how long? From the tone of her voice, I'd guess maybe forever.
not_available What did Mark say? They're closing ranks, covering their asses.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? You have a couple minutes? I'm gonna grab some coffee.
not_available You set? I'm down the hall in 117.
not_available Meet you there in five? Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? I'm sorry.
not_available Is this not a good time? No, it's fine.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Do you remember my wife, IKubby? Sure.
not_available Hi.
not_available Did you two talk about this? His back? It is worse? His back is better.
not_available I suggested he see a urologist for his other problem.
not_available It's possible that he may need surgery.
not_available Surgery? If this is uncomfortable for you, I can leave for a few minutes No, please.
not_available Stay.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Have a seat, doctor.
not_available Are you sure you don't want coffee? I got an extra one.
not_available I'll have to drink it myself.
not_available Who's that? Detective Brannigan.
not_available He's part of the felony review team.
not_available We investigate all the first
not_available degree murder cases.
not_available I'm not trying to hang you out to dry or ruin your career.
not_available But if you showed Mrs.
not_available Abbott how to alter the PCA to deliver a fatal dose of Dilaudid, you can be held accountable for Ricky's death.
not_available Now, Miss Hathaway said that Ricky was getting eighty mics of Dilaudid an hour through the PCA.
not_available "Mics" is micrograms? And that Ricky's mother could give him a booster of an additional 120 every two hours.
not_available That's right.
not_available She was uncertain as to how much Dilaudid you'd placed in the machine.
not_available It was empty when Detective Brannigan examined it a few minutes ago.
not_available Mr.
not_available Sullivan I've dedicated my life to pediatric medicine.
not_available I've cared for dozens of dying kids.
not_available IKids in agony, pain you and I can't even imagine.
not_available Ricky Abbott was gonna die.
not_available Not in a month or a week, or a day.
not_available In hours.
not_available And nothing I did or could have done was gonna change that.
not_available His mother had already watched one son die from the disease.
not_available She was sitting there watching her second son dying a horrible death from something that she passed on to him.
not_available Sometimes it's impossible to save a kid's life.
not_available And the only thing we can do is save them from suffering leave them with a little dignity.
not_available In the end, that's all they have.
not_available Tell me, were you relieving the child's suffering or were you relieving your own? If you were so certain you were doing the right thing why didn't you administer the lethal dose yourself? You're the doctor.
not_available You could've stayed and made sure there were no complications.
not_available That he really did die with dignity.
not_available But you left.
not_available You knew that killing that child was wrong.
not_available That's why you snuck out of the house before dawn.
not_available You didn't want to be there, did you? You didn't want to be there because you knew killing Ricky Abbott was wrong.
not_available I don't see a broken rib.
not_available Maybe a hairline fracture.
not_available It's like an elephant sat on my chest.
not_available Don't get up.
not_available How did you get that cut? I think I hit it with the chart.
not_available You've taken martial arts before.
not_available IKarate when I was, like, 7.
not_available It can't hurt that bad.
not_available It's tiny.
not_available It doesn't even need a stitch.
not_available Baby.
not_available There.
not_available Better? Much.
not_available I'm a doctor, you're a student.
not_available So we shouldn't be doing this.
not_available The storm's finally here.
not_available Romano closed my clinic.
not_available Why? Because I helped you get the PCA.
not_available Well, Ricky was dying.
not_available I was there.
not_available I know he was dying.
not_available I didn't know you were gonna help his mother use a piece of my equipment to administer a lethal dose of Dilaudid.
not_available I didn't want to get you involved.
not_available But Doug, I was involved.
not_available I mean, were you planning on telling me any of this, ever? I don't know.
not_available I hadn't decided.
not_available What about you promising Mark never to prescribe narcotics? Had you decided on sharing that information with me? I thought it was right.
not_available Damn the consequences, right? I was willing to live with the consequences.
not_available Mark and IKerry are facing disciplinary action.
not_available My clinic has been closed which means hundreds of patients have no place else to go.
not_available The police are questioning the entire ER staff.
not_available Your actions carry consequences, Doug.
not_available It's not just about you.
not_available Do you even give a damn? Don't do that.
not_available Don't walk away.
not_available Why not? You don't need anybody else.
not_available You are a country unto yourself.
not_available You make decisions, ruin peoples' lives.
