not_available I'm not comfortable with this bargaining on Susan Lewis' behalf.
not_available It lacks dignity.
not_available Way of the world.
not_available What happened to advancement based solely on merit and ability? It went out with hoop skirts and smoking jackets.

not_available I guess after Marty Cannon leaves next month.
not_available Is the salary fixed or negotiable? 
not_available Fixed, I guess.
not_available I didn't negotiate mine.
not_available There's usually a little wiggle room.
not_available You'd have to discuss that with Morgenstern.
not_available And benefits? Pension plan through the hospital or your own 401 K? 
not_available Hospital, I guess.
not_available I never asked.
not_available This is really exciting.

not_available He's attending his daughter's wedding in London.
not_available I'm covering for him.
not_available Her ascending cholangitis worsened? 
not_available She's not responding to antibiotics.

not_available All right, let's get an echo.
not_available Find out who's on call for Pediatric Cardiology, please.
not_available Is he gonna make it? If we keep the ductus arteriosus open, he's got a shot.

not_available Davitch.
not_available Dr.

not_available They told us T.C.
not_available had been moved to Intensive Care.
not_available Unfortunately, your daughter's condition has worsened overnight.
not_available She's not responding to the antibiotics.
not_available I don't have much confidence that her liver will function much longer.
not_available So we have moved her from Status 2 to Status 1 on the transplant list.
not_available We're gonna do everything we can for her while we wait.
not_available So she'll get the transplant operation soon? 
not_available That will certainly be our hope.
not_available How soon? Mr.
not_available Carter, you're familiar with the UNIS procedure, aren't you? Mr.
not_available Carter will answer your questions and take you back to see your daughter.

not_available You gave a prescription for a hundred Percodan.
not_available Karen Hines.
not_available Isn't that that redhead you been seeing? 
not_available Yeah, she's got a bad knee.
not_available A hundred? Pretty bad knee.
not_available She travels a lot, doesn't know when she'll be able to get them.
not_available Mark, I need you in there.

not_available You told them it was okay? 
not_available Yeah, I told them you'd call.

not_available He gave me a lot of stuff.
not_available AZT, something called 3TC and Sacinaver.
not_available Saquinavir.
not_available Whatever.
not_available It's gonna cost a fortune.
not_available And he gave me a couple of packets of condoms too.
not_available Kind of seems like the horse is out of the barn on that one.
not_available It was a joke.
not_available It wasn't funny.
not_available You get tested yet? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's not back yet.
not_available The doctor said I may have been HIV
not_available positive for as long as 10 years.
not_available He wants me to make a list of all my past sexual contacts, let them know.
not_available It's gonna be quite a list.
not_available That's not much to be proud of now.
not_available Wasn't much to be proud of then.
not_available Well, I better go home.
not_available I got a lot of reading to do.
not_available If that baby'd stayed in the hospital, somebody would've picked up on it.
not_available Most babies are fine going home the next day.
not_available A lot of problems don't declare themselves right away.

not_available People trust us.
not_available The woman took her baby home because we told her it was safe.

not_available Glad that others concurred.
not_available I read your aortic aneurism study.
not_available Yes, it's been very well received.
not_available The drug company granted the hospital over 3 million dollars for Phase 4 trials, additional research facilities You know, I I couldn't help but notice the inclusion of the negative
not_available outcome patients that we discussed.
not_available It seemed prudent course, given the circumstances.
not_available They weren't, however, statistically significant in the final analysis.
not_available Well, I was glad to see them there anyway.
not_available Yes, I'm sure you were.
not_available Carter Armani? 
not_available Hugo Boss.
not_available Nice.
not_available The parents of that kid with liver failure called.
not_available They had some questions.
not_available Some more questions.
not_available I spent an hour with them this morning.
not_available I'm supposed to meet my folks at Trotter's for lunch in 20 minutes.
not_available They called three times? 
not_available Five.
not_available I quit writing it down.
not_available If they call again, tell them I'll be up later.
not_available My father hates it when I'm late.
not_available Mr.
not_available Carter, you got a minute? I'm completing the assignments for the first
not_available year surgical interns.
not_available We're breaking all the surgical residents into teams next year.
not_available You indicated on your application form that you're interested in Vascular, Neurosurgery and Plastics rotations? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Good.
not_available I've got one spot left on the red team.
not_available Really? It'll be primarily secondand thirdyear residents but seeing as you're our only locally
not_available grown prodigy we'll give you the home field advantage.
not_available It'll be quite a leg up on your peers.
not_available I'd be honored.
not_available Dr.
not_available Langdon will be your supervising resident.
not_available Do you know Nancy? Sure, she's great.
not_available So I won't be working under Dr.
not_available Benton anymore? No, Dr.
not_available Benton will be anchoring the blue team next year.
not_available General surgery, the ER, proctology, real meatand
not_available potato stuff.
not_available Unless you'd rather be with Benton? 
not_available No, I was hoping for the red team.
not_available Good.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available Peter.
not_available Weaver will support you as chief.
not_available Really? We should talk about that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, your wife called.
not_available Ex
not_available wife.
not_available Right.
not_available She said you're late for lunch.
not_available She's mad as hell.
not_available With Weaver onboard, it's a lock.
not_available You wanna have dinner and celebrate? I don't know.
not_available Check with me later.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brannigan? 
not_available Kenny, please.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Sorry to have kept you waiting.
not_available At least she stopped singing.
not_available So you've had a persistent cough? 
not_available For a couple of months.
not_available Coughing up any blood? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, not much.
not_available But some.
not_available Once or twice.
not_available No big deal.
not_available I pour concrete for a living, so stuff gets in your lungs.
not_available Are you a smoker, Kenny? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're not gonna lecture me? 
not_available It's not like I have to.
not_available So how much do you smoke? 
not_available A couple of packs a day.
not_available Sometimes more, sometimes less.
not_available 120 over 80.
not_available When was the last time you had a tuberculosis test? 
not_available I don't go to doctors much.
not_available All that lecturing, I guess.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available Like old times.
not_available Nice to see you too.
not_available If this is about getting Rachel this weekend, you can forget it because I got tickets for the Cubbies on Saturday.
not_available Rachel hates baseball.
not_available That's not true.
not_available This weekend's fine, Mark.
not_available That's fine.
not_available You gonna finish those fries? 
not_available Go right ahead.
not_available I can't eat this food.
not_available This place should have been shut down years ago.
not_available The hospital fights to keep it open.
not_available It's good for business.
not_available Food poisoning, stomach pumping, gastroenteritis.
not_available This joint's a gold mine.
not_available Craig and I are getting married.
not_available What? 
not_available In September.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available I didn't want you to hear it from Rachel.
not_available Rachel knows? She's excited.
not_available She's helping me pick out a dress.
not_available Something non
not_available traditional, I hope.
not_available Perhaps in red.
not_available I knew you weren't gonna be happy about this but I thought I should be the one to tell you.
not_available You should've kept the goatee.
not_available It made you look dangerous.
not_available Hey! Hey yourself! School let out early? 
not_available Well, I was on all night.
not_available Looks like you're still gainfully employed.
not_available I'm on probation.
not_available I lose another 250 grand, I'm back to card counting in Vegas.
not_available Really, you did that? 
not_available In a previous lifetime.
not_available Don't ask.
not_available So how's your knee? It's okay.
not_available How's yours? The prescription that I wrote out for the Percodan was for 10 tablets.
not_available You know, I wondered about that.
not_available The damned things cost me a fortune.
not_available So you didn't change it to a hundred? No, I didn't.
not_available Prescription pads for narcotics, they come in triplicate.
not_available I can check my copy.
not_available Maybe you should do that.
not_available Maybe I should.
not_available Count them, boyfriend.
not_available They're all there.
not_available I don't need to count them.
not_available Sure you do.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brannigan, sorry it took so long.
not_available Do you have a personal physician? 
not_available No.
not_available You have a density in your left lung.
not_available Tuberculosis? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Cancer.
not_available We need more tests to rule that out.
not_available How much are these tests of yours gonna cost? Do you have insurance? No, I work construction for a lot of different companies.
not_available No benefits.
not_available Maybe you qualify for Medicaid? 
not_available When my last kid was born, we didn't.
not_available It cost me a couple of grand.
not_available Still trying to pay that off.
not_available Well, I can't tell you exactly how much the tests will cost.
not_available We could get someone down from Admitting, if you have any questions.
not_available I got a couple of kids and a mortgage.
not_available And I'm just scraping by as it is.
not_available You have a potentially serious condition which needs immediate evaluation.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brannigan, you really need to stay here.
not_available Mark, Loretta's back.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available What this time? I think she's frightened and overwhelmed by the surgery.
not_available They only released her yesterday.
not_available I started an IV.
not_available She's in 4.
not_available Tell her I'll be down as soon as I can.
not_available Make sure that she's comfortable.
not_available So we're just gonna let him leave? 
not_available Do you want to tackle the guy? He said that he can't afford it.
not_available Who am I to say that he can? A full course of chemo and radiation will cost him minimum fifty grand.
not_available I don't understand what we're arguing about.
not_available You let the hospital bill him.
not_available He can declare bankruptcy if he has to.
not_available And if he dies, he leaves his wife and children in bankruptcy? At least he wouldn't be dead.
not_available I advised him to stay, he chose to leave.
not_available That's his prerogative.
not_available What are you doing out here? 
not_available Enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.
not_available Last few months, whenever I can, I like to get outside.
not_available It's about time you gave those up.
not_available My last vice.
not_available So they sent you home yesterday.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't think I was ready.
not_available Been able to eat anything? I haven't been able to keep anything down.
not_available How are the kids? 
not_available Hell on wheels.
not_available I wanted to ask you something.
not_available Shoot.
not_available I was wondering if you'd be guardian to my kids.
not_available Not that anything bad is ever gonna happen to me.
not_available It's just that they don't have anybody.
not_available My folks are dead.
not_available They like you.
not_available I know it's a lot to ask.
not_available But they're really good kids.
not_available What about their father? 
not_available Fathers.
not_available Plural.
not_available Good luck.
not_available I never could quite figure that one out.
not_available You don't have to answer now, I have time.
not_available At least a little bit, I think.
not_available I'm honored you'd ask 
not_available But you can't.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Besides, you're gonna make it.
not_available Damn right I am.
not_available Hey, you're up.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Kind of tired.
not_available Where are your folks? They were looking for me earlier.
not_available They went downstairs to get something to eat.
not_available In the cafeteria? Big mistake.
not_available My mom just kept crying.
not_available I think my Dad was worried she was gonna scare me.
not_available Well, tell them I stopped by.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available I'm graduating in half an hour and I'm late.
not_available Everybody in here looks pretty sick.
not_available Yeah, well, they get better.
not_available It just takes time.
not_available The boy who was in that bed, I don't think he got better.
not_available Am I gonna die? You're very sick, T.C.
not_available My mom says I'm Status 1.
not_available What does that mean? That means that as soon as the next liver's available, you get first dibs.
not_available Somebody has to die, right? 
not_available Yeah.
