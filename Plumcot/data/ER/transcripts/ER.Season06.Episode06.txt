not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available Barry always made all the important decisions.

not_available You let him go a couple months ago?

not_available With me cast as lago, I suspect.

not_available Gabe Lawrence was my closest friend.
not_available My mentor, my teacher.

not_available Who was that guy? Oh, Meg, you're pregnant.
not_available No kidding.
not_available I didn't ask to be.
not_available You weren't there? 
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available Your kid deserves a chance to live.
not_available You've mixed me up with someone who cares.
not_available I didn't do it.
not_available I saw you.
not_available I turned it off.
not_available Tell them it was you.
not_available Why would I? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch will be fired.
not_available Maybe she did it.
not_available Benton's with your patient.
not_available Her patient was an hour before yours.
not_available She was there long before us.
not_available I turned it off.
not_available Honest.
not_available Hey, Cleo.
not_available I have a 12year
not_available old with a 278 blood sugar.
not_available Diabetes? 
not_available I just got the test.
not_available Overweight? Crappy diet? Couch potato? 
not_available All the above.
not_available Kids eat junk food and play video games.
not_available Bingo! Diabetes.
not_available How do I treat it? Want me to talk to the family? 
not_available That'd be great.
not_available I'd heard Gabe lost a power struggle over tenure issues.
not_available You never checked? I've known Gabe my entire career.
not_available He's the reason I became an ER doc.
not_available I jumped at the chance to hire him.
not_available Or the chance to impress him.
not_available Student hires teacher.
not_available Spielman suspected early Alzheimer's.
not_available She asked him to undergo neurological testing.
not_available He blew up.
not_available Quit.
not_available Won't speak to her.
not_available You have to fire him.
not_available She wasn't sure.
not_available He can't cope with stress.
not_available Wanders around
not_available He's always been scattered.
not_available He may endanger patients.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I love him like a father.
not_available I don't know if I can fire him.
not_available Is there family history of diabetes? 
not_available My mother.
not_available Don't old people get it? This type, yes, but some children are susceptible.
not_available He needs a diabetes clinic.
not_available A new drug works well for kids, but it's expensive.
not_available Does your insurance cover prescriptions? I'm not insured.
not_available How expensive? 
not_available $100 a month plus clinic visits.
not_available I can't afford that.
not_available He needs to lose weight, exercise and control his diet.
not_available Then he might not need medication.
not_available I start a new job next week with good benefits.
not_available But they start in 90 days.
not_available Can it wait? With elevated blood sugar he's likely to have complications.
not_available Will this be a pre
not_available existing condition on my new insurance? If you treat him right now, they won't cover him.
not_available I don't know the specifics of your plan, but it's possible.
not_available I'll get him to diet and work out.
not_available He could take my mother's HMO's diabetes pills for 90 days.
not_available He needs a physician's supervision.
not_available He needs a nutritionist, an exercise specialist and education.
not_available What will that cost? It's only three months.
not_available We weren't here, okay? Your son has a very serious disease.
not_available He could have kidney failure, heart disease go blind, lose limbs.
not_available Let me talk to Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available You're making it worse.
not_available He'd wait three months to treat diabetes.
not_available If insurance won't cover him and he can't afford medication what will happen over 3 years? With his grandmother's glyburide, he might gain more weight.
not_available He'll start on half a pill and the dad gets him to lose weight.
not_available Later he'll get better care.
not_available You don't know about Type ll diabetes in children.
not_available Sedentary kids don't easily change lifestyle.
not_available Dad hasn't kept him off the sofa and potato chips in 12 years.
not_available How could he now? Your CHF guy is in V
not_available tach.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available You accommodate the dad's financial problems you're endangering a life.
not_available But what is it? It's ventricular tachycardia.
not_available It's an abnormal heart rhythm.
not_available How much longer? A few minutes.
not_available A few minutes? Dr.
not_available Lawrence? Can we talk? 
not_available What's up? You've had Mrs.
not_available Karis waiting for a prescription for four hours.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry, Mrs.
not_available Karis.
not_available I got tied up with other patients.
not_available I completely forgot.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available One pill every six hours.
not_available Elevate your ankle and ice it three times a day.
not_available Gabe, can we talk in the lounge? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That's it? Appreciate it.
not_available Wait, what is she doing? What the hell?! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Why's she taking off her ankle wrap? That's Brenda from Accounting.
not_available Her ankle's fine.
not_available You've never seen her before.
not_available You tricked me? 
not_available Can we not do this here? It's been very busy here today! I had several ankle injuries! I got confused.
not_available I went to see Renee Spielman.
not_available Time of death, 7:42.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Connelly? Has he gone? Barry you're so sweet.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available I'll miss you.
not_available I need to call my son.
not_available Is there a phone I could use nearby? I'll show you.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available You're sure about this? Jail's not the best place to have a baby.
not_available At least she won't be high.
not_available There he is.
not_available Got him.
not_available leather jacket in alley.
not_available What happens now? 
not_available Wait to see if it goes down.
not_available Bingo.
not_available Get anything? 
not_available Pills, some weed.
not_available What's this, Einstein, crank? Kid's a cashand
not_available carry pharmacy.
not_available You bitch! How could you? You have nothing to say? How could you do this to me?! 
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Lawrence back? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? I may have been last to use the Bunsen burner before the explosion.
not_available It's assumed Dr.
not_available Finch used it last.
not_available I used it too, probably after she did.
not_available I think I turned it off.
not_available Possibly I didn't.
not_available It could've been my fault.
not_available Fire investigators say it was a gas line.
not_available Ruptured pipe.
not_available I guess it wasn't me.
not_available Safety's our number one priority here.
not_available You cannot "think" you left on a potentially dangerous lab tool.
not_available Are we clear? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available This is Gabe.
not_available Please leave your name and number.
not_available Gabe, this is Kerry.
not_available I'm at the hospital.
not_available Please call me back.
not_available Can I come in? Sure.
not_available This is my son's record, right? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available It says here that Eddie has diabetes.
not_available You put that in? 
not_available Tear it up, please.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available It's illegal.
not_available I'm not a fool.
not_available I'd never hurt my son.
not_available We're just getting back on our feet.
not_available I don't have that kind of money.
not_available All those specialists and things.
not_available I'll have insurance in three months.
not_available It's good.
not_available He'll diet, exercise, use my mom's pills.
not_available She gets the test kits.
not_available Glucose levels.
not_available If he's not improving, we'll come back.
not_available I'll do whatever you tell me.
not_available If there's a chance to do this any other way please help us.
not_available What are you doing? I was doing chart review in here.
not_available Sprinklers soaked everything.
not_available I may have just done the wrong thing.
not_available Me too.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah, about an hour ago.
not_available I destroyed what little was left of a good man's career.
not_available What'd you do? Got a pregnant junkie arrested for possession so she'd get clean in jail.
not_available Want to drown our sorrows in ginger ale? No, I'm getting a surprise baby shower.
not_available It's supposed to be a surprise.
not_available I'll look surprised.
not_available I miss Doug.
not_available You call him? Has he called you? He leaves messages on my machine.
not_available He calls when I'm not there so I don't have to talk to him.
not_available You don't want to? I don't know what else to say.
not_available Rain check on that ginger ale? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Seen the Bernero Tsheet? The diabetic? Why's it so hard to keep them?

not_available We need the bed.

not_available He fell.
not_available You wanted me to come in? You've worked two days in the last three weeks.
not_available We depend on you.
not_available When you call in, it's tough on us.
not_available I'm not coming back.
not_available I'm sorry I've made it tough.
not_available I should've talked to you earlier.
not_available Is everything all right?
