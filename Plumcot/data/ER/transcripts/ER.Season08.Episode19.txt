not_available Maybe she's hiding from her controlling, lunatic sister who jumps on a plane the minute she doesn't answer the phone.
not_available She flew in from Chicago.
not_available She's worried and she's scared.

not_available He was always climbing.
not_available I swear he was half monkey.
not_available He's not gonna get better, is he? He's got what we call an axonal injury.
not_available Even if we could remove the blood the force of the fall damaged the connections of the brain.
not_available Is he suffering? I think he's gone.
not_available This is just his body.
not_available We wanna let him go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Where's Pratt? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I told you both to wait in here for me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I'm here.
not_available How's Stanley? 
not_available He's still in the O.R.
not_available That was really stupid, Gallant.
not_available Look, it was not my idea.
not_available You should have come to get me.
not_available I tried.
not_available If I would have left, he would have died.
not_available What was I supposed to do? You weren't supposed to crack the guy's chest.
not_available All right, you're on scut duty for the rest of the day.
not_available Both of you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You know Dr.
not_available Malucci? 
not_available No.
not_available That's because he got fired.
not_available He was a hotshot too.
not_available Killed a guy because he thought he knew everything.
not_available You two pull another stunt like that, you're out of here.
not_available Look, I don't blame you for being angry about what happened.
not_available But, please, don't confuse me and Pratt.
not_available Gallant? 
not_available I told you to get rid of him.
not_available I got pulled into a trauma.
not_available Doesn't look like you're in one now.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll ask him to leave.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Pratt, turf that guy.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available More suction.
not_available This the GSW? 
not_available What's left of him.
not_available What happened? Well, he had the unfortunate luck of passing through the ER butcher shop.
not_available Where were you? I paged you about a dozen times.
not_available I had to break bad news to the parents of a boy with a severe head injury.
not_available Right.
not_available That old excuse.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, you have a phone call.
not_available She's busy.
not_available Take a message, please.
not_available It's your stepdaughter calling from Hawaii.
not_available She says it's an emergency.

not_available Metz.
not_available Rachel, what's going on? There he is.
not_available Oleg? Oleg, I wanna ask you a few questions.

not_available Damn it.
not_available Hang on.
not_available You seen them? 
not_available How you been, Oleg? Get out of there.
not_available Get out of there.
not_available Stand up.
not_available Shut up.
not_available What do we have here? Illegal narcotics? I'm shocked, man! Let's do this again.
not_available Look again.
not_available You seen them? 
not_available I'm not good with faces.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Maybe.
not_available There's a shooting gallery in back of the old carpet factory.
not_available How long ago? 
not_available Maybe an hour.
not_available Was the girl there? 
not_available No kid.
not_available You sure? Maybe she was there.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I didn't see her.
not_available Show respect for the badge, Oleg.
not_available You're bleeding all over my car.
not_available You may have broken his nose.
not_available No, he was always that ugly.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Pratt just did a perfect tap.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Now you can go home.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available I told you to wait in the lounge.
not_available What good does that do anybody? You wanna stay here, you do what I tell you, when I tell you.
not_available It's that simple.
not_available Don't make me be a hard
not_available ass, okay? Okay.
not_available Gallant's in Exam 4.
not_available Why don't you teach him how to drain a perirectal abscess.
not_available Did I miss something? We need to keep our eye on him.
not_available He's good.
not_available He's dangerous.
not_available Any word on Pratt's thoracotomy? I haven't heard.
not_available Do you wanna talk about it? 
not_available There's nothing to talk about.
not_available Oh, no? This started after your assault? I said I didn't wanna talk.
not_available You said there was nothing to talk about.
not_available Whatever.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available I can handle this.
not_available I'm not throwing the program at you.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available Don't need any help.
not_available Six years, you know? You were sober for six years.
not_available That's right.
not_available That was then.
not_available I'm a different person now.
not_available What? I'm not shooting up.
not_available I had a beer.
not_available I had a beer.
not_available Stop trying to make it such a big deal.
not_available It is a big deal.
not_available It's not about the beer you had yesterday.
not_available Or the two you're gonna want today or the six you'll want tomorrow.
not_available It's under control.
not_available It is.
not_available And it's not a reaction, it's a decision.
not_available My decision.

not_available I don't know how long I'll be.
not_available We'll survive.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Anything I can do? Pray.
not_available It's not exactly my strong suit, but in this case I'll make an exception.

not_available This guy smells like a distillery.

not_available Did he hurt anybody else? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, I guess this is the downside to the three

not_available The detectives wanna talk to her.
not_available She doesn't remember anything.
not_available The longer she's missing, the worse it gets, right? Because I heard that if you don't find them in the first 12 hours Do you have a place to stay? If you want, I can take you to a hotel.
not_available No.
not_available I couldn't sleep if I wanted to.
not_available Where's your partner? He's out looking.
