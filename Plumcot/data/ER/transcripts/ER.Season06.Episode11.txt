not_available Previously on E.R Hi, I'm Jing
not_available Mei Chen.
not_available Dr Chen, as a rule, we don't lie about our patients' medical conditions.
not_available I cannot thank you enough, Dr.
not_available Knight.
not_available I'm not a Dr yet.
not_available You are to me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rollins, this is Lindsey Cordova.
not_available So, how can I help you? I want to bury my sister.
not_available Where is she Dean? How are you holding up? In all honesty I'm exhausted.
not_available Maybe you should come live with me in Chicago.
not_available Chicago.
not_available snow in the southern plains and rain in Texas going northeast.
not_available You see the trough here.
not_available That's allowing cold air in.
not_available The moisture mixing with snows in Kansas.
not_available But this low that's moving will pull up some Gulf of
not_available Dad? Hey, Mark.
not_available You' re up early.
not_available Might snow later.
not_available Fifty percent chance.
not_available It's a little loud.
not_available You ought to have a bedroom door.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I can build you one.
not_available I don't want a door.
not_available Can you turn that thing down? Hello? Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available My dad's visiting.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available Who's calling at this hour? 
not_available You woke my neighbor too.
not_available No wonder.
not_available The walls in this building are paper
not_available thin.
not_available By the way, we're out of coffee.
not_available So I see.
not_available There was only a little left.
not_available Barely able to get any myself.
not_available I'll just go to work.
not_available This early? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This early.
not_available I like that weather channel.
not_available No sense in watching it in San Diego.
not_available "Clear and sunny." "Chance of a cloud.
not_available Mostly sunny." 
not_available Hey, Chuny.
not_available Welcome back! How are the twins? They're great.
not_available This is my first whole day without them.
not_available It seems pretty quiet, though.
not_available Actually, no.
not_available Back to work.
not_available See you.
not_available I'm right behind you.
not_available Vito Camporsero, 29, acrobat.
not_available He slipped off the trapeze.
not_available How far did he fall? 
not_available About five feet.
not_available His armpit caught on the cable.
not_available It's not so bad.
not_available Carol, welcome back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Deep laceration to the left axilla, three
not_available liter blood loss.
not_available BP's 60 palp.
not_available Okay, ready, steady, lift.
not_available Four units of O
not_available neg.
not_available Are you the new nurse? 
not_available Good to be back.
not_available I need a pulse ox probe.
not_available A gram of Ancef.
not_available No water.
not_available Anybody know why? 
not_available No.
not_available I just got on.
not_available I'll check it out.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available All set, thanks.
not_available Pressure is crashing.
not_available Carol, prep for a subclavian.
not_available Are you hurt? 
not_available It's Vito's blood.
not_available Dominic carried him down the ladder.
not_available Pulse is 124.
not_available Carol, the Betadine.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I got it.
not_available It's okay if you're rusty.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I didn't know the circus was in town.
not_available Laceration of the axillary artery.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Hello.
not_available Help my brother.
not_available Check the crits first.
not_available Okay.
not_available Absent wrist pulses.
not_available Let's have a look.
not_available Easy, easy! You're hurting him! Give him morphine! 
not_available Stop it, please.
not_available Almost done.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Step back a little bit! 
not_available Get these guys out of here! Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stop, please.
not_available Kovac? What the hell are you doing? Let go of me! Hey, call Security! Get your hands off me! 
not_available Put four liters at every sink.
not_available What's up? Water main broke.
not_available Could be a while before they fix it.
not_available You're not on.
not_available Valerie Page called me.
not_available The girl you ordered LVAD for? 
not_available They found a transplant match.
not_available That is great.
not_available They're stacked in Chairs.
not_available I'm on the code team today.
not_available I was paged for a respiratory arrest that was a false alarm.
not_available What's up? Your dysentery patient used the toilet.
not_available So? 
not_available No water? We can't flush.
not_available Oh! Well, sorry.
not_available I got another case.
not_available Put the "Out of Order" sign up.
not_available Call Housekeeping.
not_available Amira, can we get portable toilets and maybe some air freshener? You get many accidents in the circus? 
not_available No.
not_available Not usually.
not_available Peng is afraid she won't be able to perform tonight.
not_available No, no.
not_available The laceration is not bad.
not_available Tell her she'll be fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How did this happen? One of the platforms broke.
not_available A piece of wood fell right on top of her.
not_available Yes, but if the wood fell from above, how did it hit the bottom of her foot? 
not_available Like this.
not_available You see? 
not_available Wow! I think I'll go see this circus of yours.
not_available There's one of them.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available My mother's had Parkinson's for 15 years.
not_available Has her condition changed? The past couple of days, she's been so weak.
not_available I'm worried she had a stroke.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Let us help.
not_available No, I don't mind.
not_available I do it every day.
not_available Good for my health.
not_available Right, Mom? To tell you the truth, I'm a burden.
not_available Louise has to lift me onto the toilet and sponge bathe me.
not_available Oh, come on, Mom.
not_available Stop it.
not_available She gets dizzy when she sits up.
not_available Could it be her heart? Well, we'll check.
not_available Maybe the Parkinson's is worse? 
not_available Well, I don't feel worse.
not_available Well, you might not.
not_available But I'll examine you, run some tests and find out what's going on.
not_available You okay? Oh, yeah.
not_available Fine.
not_available Okay We got an IV cefotaxime order for Exam Two.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's been in the rack.
not_available I just checked the rack.
not_available Lady's got pneumonia.
not_available This man has chest pain.
not_available I only do one thing at a time.
not_available I'm moving as fast as I can.
not_available I know.
not_available It's your first day back.
not_available I know you've gotta get back into the flow.
not_available I don't think any of my patients have suffered.
not_available I didn't mean to imply that.
not_available Why wasn't I paged for the water crisis? We have a plan.
not_available I'm on the committee.
not_available There's no crisis.
not_available We got portable toilets.
not_available We got bottled water.
not_available It's under control.
not_available Except that the O.R.
not_available can't sterilize the instruments.
not_available We're closed to trauma.
not_available That sounds good.
not_available If the patients can't make it out or they don't want to freeze we can use the physical therapy pool.
not_available A two
not_available gallon dump gives you a solid flush.
not_available Thanks for the information.
not_available Sure.
not_available That's good to know.
not_available Hi! 
not_available Hi.
not_available I was about to eat when my pager went off.
not_available I just about jumped out of my seat.
not_available This is news worth missing breakfast for.
not_available I forgot my slippers.
not_available You'll get some with your new heart! Keeping up, Carol? 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Seen the records on my patient? 
not_available File room's bringing them.
not_available Did you fax his EKG to his PMD? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He said he'd call.
not_available Maybe he's busy.
not_available Here's the problem.
not_available Paper jam.
not_available Fax it again, will you, Carol? Anyone seen the xrays on that ankle? 
not_available Don't hold your breath.
not_available Radiology can't process the film without water.
not_available We might be able to grab something to eat.
not_available Sounds like fun.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Have a good time.
not_available Michael Mueller.
not_available Had a seizure while driving, crashed into a wall.
not_available He's post
not_available ictal, tachy at 120.
not_available We were going to play hockey and he started to shake.
not_available Curt Obarr, passenger.
not_available He has a forehead lac.
not_available Has he ever had seizures? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Okay, everybody, nice and easy.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Get a C
not_available spine, chest, and head CT.
not_available They can't develop x
not_available rays.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get the fluoroscan.
not_available Sinus tach, 130.
not_available BP's 124 over 78.
not_available Pupils are equal.
not_available Does he have medical problems? He uses an asthma inhaler.
not_available Old bruises.
not_available Play rough? 
not_available He got hit bad last week.
not_available Did he hit his head? 
not_available No.
not_available Temp's normal, 98.8.
not_available Whoa! Let's roll him! 
not_available Add a theophylline level.
not_available What's that? Asthma medication.
not_available Take too much, this can happen.
not_available Louise? Hey.
not_available Everything looks okay.
not_available Head CT, EKG and the blood tests are all essentially normal.
not_available Then why can't she walk? It's probably the Parkinson's.
not_available But her neurologist can adjust her medication as an outpatient.
not_available Could we talk outside? Yeah, sure.
not_available Of course.
not_available Then you're not going to admit her? 
not_available Not when there's no reason to.
not_available I love my mother.
not_available But I can't take her home and care for her when she can't walk.
not_available I'm just too exhausted.
not_available Well, maybe you need a home aide.
not_available I can't afford a home aide.
not_available She needs to be in the hospital for a few days 
not_available so you can adjust her meds.
not_available We can't admit her for that.
not_available I'm asking you, please.
not_available I'm just so tired right now.
not_available It's been such a difficult few weeks.
not_available If she could just stay for a couple of days Well, I wish I could help you.
not_available But the hospital doesn't allow that.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available These are 
not_available "Ridiculous" would be one word.
not_available Yes.
not_available Best the gift shop had to offer.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available I called your mom.
not_available She is on her way here.
not_available And your dad is
not_available Not around.
not_available I know the story.
not_available Hello.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Valerie, how are you? The proverbial "couldn't be better." 
not_available Good.
not_available Lucy, do you have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available We'll be right back.
not_available I've looked over the chart.
not_available And Valerie has a fever.
not_available Her temperature is 100.9.
not_available That could just be a cold.
not_available She needs immunosuppressive agents so she won't reject the new heart.
not_available Even a cold could be fatal.
not_available What are you saying? Notify the transplant coordinator.
not_available We may have to decline the heart.
not_available Is there anything we can do? It'll be their decision.
not_available But I think that's what will happen.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available She was so close.
not_available Want me to tell her? 
not_available No.
not_available No, I'll tell her.
not_available Shooting.
not_available Yeah, definitely got a fracture on your hand just below the pinky.
not_available You can move it back.
not_available It's gonna need a cast.
not_available I'm lucky.
not_available It could've been worse.
not_available How's Curt? 
not_available Oh, he's fine.
not_available His forehead's being sutured up.
not_available I'm more concerned about you.
not_available I feel fine.
not_available Your seizure was caused by an overdose.
not_available An overdose? 
not_available Were you trying to hurt yourself? No.
not_available My asthma flares up when I'm stressed.
not_available So I took a few extra pills.
not_available Stressed at work? At home? I'm a landscaper.
not_available January's tough.
not_available Work stops, the bills don't.
not_available Why the third degree? 
not_available I have to ask about depression.
not_available If I wanted to die, I'd find a better way.
not_available All fixed up.
not_available They figure out what's wrong? Yeah.
not_available I took too much asthma medicine.
not_available Busted up my hand.
not_available We have to find someone to play left wing.
not_available Is he gonna be okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He should be.
not_available How's the car? 
not_available Totaled.
not_available Don't worry, you're insured.
not_available Can I use this in here? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll get a rental.
not_available When did you pass gas? 
not_available An hour ago.
not_available No fever or vomiting.
not_available I agree with your assessment.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hoyt, you are full of stool.
not_available We will give you an enema.
not_available Excuse me, Doctor
not_available Not now, we're busy.
not_available Come back later.
not_available Peter, who's next? 
not_available Splenectomy from last week.
not_available Valerie's here for a heart transplant.
not_available Old news.
not_available I stay informed.
not_available Then you know she has a fever.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Call the coordinator? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Peter, call her and tell her we pass.
not_available Won't you examine her? 
not_available We can't operate if there's a fever.
not_available But her white count is normal.
not_available Good effort.
not_available But a fever spells infection.
not_available It's an infection of her L
not_available VAD.
not_available I did research on Medline and found articles from Stanford.
not_available The treatment is antibiotics, remove the device, give the new heart.
not_available Peter, go work her up.
not_available I'll talk to the transplant service.
not_available You are like a crazed Energizer Bunny on this.
not_available You keep going and going 
not_available Thank you.
not_available and going and going 
not_available We're out of I and D kits.
not_available I'll check the suture room.
not_available I don't need one.
not_available Just wanted to let you know.
not_available Big trauma came in.
not_available I haven't checked all my rooms yet.
not_available I'm not criticizing you.
not_available I'll get to it.
not_available It must be strange coming back after being off for six weeks.
not_available Not really.
not_available If you need a breakWhy? 
not_available Maybe you need sleep.
not_available I'm getting plenty of sleep.
not_available Dr.
not_available Malucci, is there a problem? 
not_available Yeah, chief.
not_available There is.
not_available Check this out.
not_available Dolison? Her husband took them.
not_available He's vomiting blood.
not_available What is this? They're from Mexico.
not_available Combo painkiller and steroid.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available Be sure ICU gets him on a steroid taper.
not_available Cleo.
not_available Yeah? When I said I was trying to get out of here early to go eat
not_available Wish I could get out early.
not_available So, what if we made it later? 
not_available Don't wait on me.
not_available Carol? You all right? 
not_available Oh, I'm fine.
not_available You don't look fine.
not_available No, really.
not_available I am really fine.
not_available First day back must be tough.
not_available Why don't you just leave? No.
not_available I'm gonna sit here and have a good cry.
not_available And then I'll feel better.
not_available It's what I do at home.
not_available You see? I am
not_available I'm better already.
not_available Thanks, Elizabeth.
not_available Carol, are you okay? 
not_available Oh, I'm fine.
not_available She's overwhelmed.
not_available I don't blame her.
not_available The diapers, the dishes
not_available The feedings.
not_available Laundry.
not_available Then a 12
not_available hour shift.
not_available How will she do it? Staying focused with the patients.
not_available All she wants to think about are her babies.
not_available Carol, if there's anything we can do Okay.
not_available I'm really confused.
not_available You were gonna cancel the transplant.
not_available And now I can have the heart? You need a day or two of antibiotics before you can get the transplant.
not_available So I lose the heart after all.
not_available No.
not_available You have a very low fever.
not_available We think we can clear up the infection with a few doses and still do the transplant.
not_available If the antibiotics don't work? Worst case? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Worst case.
not_available After surgery you could develop a life
not_available threatening infection.
not_available What would you do? 
not_available It's your decision.
not_available I know.
not_available Would you have the surgery? The risk is small.
not_available And you've waited a long time.
not_available I would go for it.
not_available How long have you been with Curt? 
not_available A while.
not_available Everything okay? Yeah.
not_available What happens when the two of you fight? What makes you think we fight? Everybody has arguments.
not_available You got bruises, stressed out.
not_available You OD'd on your medication.
not_available I'm trying to put it all together.
not_available It's not uncommon for fights to turn physical.
not_available People don't mean for it to happen.
not_available No, no.
not_available I know they don't.
not_available Something just sets it off.
not_available That ever happen to you? I forgot to get the dry cleaning.
not_available He
not_available He hit me.
not_available He said he's sorry and promised he'd never do it again.
not_available Has he? So there have been other times.
not_available I'd like you to talk to a social worker.
not_available They have experience with these things.
not_available Okay? I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? Lindsey, how are you? 
not_available I'm all right.
not_available It was my sister's funeral yesterday.
not_available I wanted to thank you.
not_available You really don't have to.
not_available The police said that he finally told you where he left Jenny.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm trying to forget him.
not_available I just hear his voice all the time.
not_available And it's very gentle.
not_available But it's just saying these awful things.
not_available Now, you listen to me.
not_available That's what he wanted.
not_available To make you suffer.
not_available You don't let him win.
not_available He's nothing.
not_available He can't hurt you anymore.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available It's okay.
not_available How long is the operation? 
not_available Four, five hours.
not_available They let med students watch? 
not_available If they're on the transplant service.
not_available That means you can't stay? 
not_available They'll make an exception.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you do me a favor? I forgot to feed Spoony.
not_available My cat.
not_available Tell my mom? Yes.
not_available I'm gonna go change.
not_available I'll see you.
not_available Can I have a moment with him? 
not_available I knew you'd come.
not_available Did you? When I woke up and I found you hadn't done what you said you'd do I was glad.
not_available The fact that you were a coward never even occurred to me.
not_available Your conscience is bothering you.
not_available Isn't it? 
not_available It is, actually.
not_available Why? Because you nearly killed me? Or because you didn't have the guts to? Because I enjoyed the power I had over you.
not_available When I could've let you bleed to death.
not_available When your heart stopped.
not_available When the morphine took you under.
not_available I held your breath in my hands and I wanted to repay the pain you'd caused.
not_available But then I looked at your sad little body.
not_available And I saw what a pathetic man you are.
not_available I realized I didn't want power over you at all.
not_available That my job, for better or worse, was simply to put you back together.
not_available See, I don't give a damn if you go to the chair or spend your life in prison.
not_available My job's done.
not_available You were my patient, you were sick, you're better.
not_available Goodbye, Mr.
not_available Rollins.
not_available You can take him.
not_available Come back! I haven't finished with you yet! Get back here, Corday! Corday! Do you have any chest pain? I'm a little lightheaded.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Code blue.
not_available She slipped on the ice.
not_available I was helping Mom into the car.
not_available My wheelchair fell.
not_available Did you hit your head or lose consciousness? Louise? I don't think so.
not_available I fell first.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Put her on a monitor.
not_available You want her? 
not_available I just discharged her.
not_available I believe in continuity of care.
not_available No head trauma, check her hips.
not_available I'm so sorry, Mom.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available Her BP is 170/95.
not_available Is that bad? It's a little high.
not_available Get a CBC, chem panel, cardiac enzymes, EKG and postural vitals.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm just so tired.
not_available What was she here for? Exacerbation of Parkinson's.
not_available She hasn't been able to walk for days.
not_available It's harder to take care of her.
not_available Her head CT was normal.
not_available I see.
not_available Atrial cannulation complete.
not_available Umbilical tape? How long does the LVAD stay? 
not_available Until bypass.
not_available Aortic cannula's looking good.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Kill the air pump.
not_available Clamp the aortic graft, Peter.
not_available Okay.
not_available And got it.
not_available Open the venous line.
not_available Anyone looking for a heart? 
not_available You're early, Shirley.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Take it up with the FAA.
not_available Is it too early? 
not_available No.
not_available It can wait on ice for a while.
not_available Wow! That's her new heart.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It sure is.
not_available He denied it? 
not_available Said he never touched him.
not_available I thought he was ready to talk.
not_available Victims change their minds.
not_available He loves and wants to protect him.
not_available Or he's afraid.
not_available Will you be around? Thinking about asking him again? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Give me a call.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Carol, how are you? 
not_available Four hours and 43 minutes left.
not_available Counting minutes is bad.
not_available Can someone take this ingrown toenail? A real bitch.
not_available Carol.
not_available She's exhausted.
not_available She needs a break.
not_available I can't.
not_available You can't? Or you won't? 
not_available Both.
not_available Just say you're ruling out a stroke.
not_available I can't lie.
not_available Sometimes we make a judgment call.
not_available We bend the rules a little.
not_available I bent them and got in trouble.
not_available Then you're in the wrong department.
not_available Listen, everybody does soft admits.
not_available It's just part of the drill.
not_available I know what you're saying.
not_available I'm not admitting her.
not_available She's my patient.
not_available It's my call.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, you're right.
not_available Yeah? I don't agree with you.
not_available But you gotta do whatever you think is best.
not_available Well, thanks for your input.
not_available Anytime.
not_available Hey, Amira? I need a telemetry bed for Louise Duffy.
not_available Wait.
not_available You're admitting the daughter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I want to rule out an Ml.
not_available You're kidding? 
not_available She may have unstable angina.
not_available She slipped on some ice.
not_available It's my patient.
not_available It's my call.
not_available Where's the mother supposed to go? 
not_available Your patient.
not_available Your call.
not_available A bunch of us got into a fight at the hockey rink.
not_available You're not gonna be safe until you get out of this.
not_available I'll wear more pads.
not_available Most domestic homicides have a history of physical abuse.
not_available You trying to scare me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You need to get away from him.
not_available I got the rental.
not_available We're set.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Is he ready? 
not_available We need a CT scan.
not_available Why? 
not_available He had a head trauma.
not_available We play hockey.
not_available I want to clear him medically.
not_available I wanna take him home.
not_available You should stay.
not_available Do you understand the risk? 
not_available He understands.
not_available I'm not so sure.
not_available Why don't we
not_available ? Mike, shut up.
not_available If he needs to sign something, he'll sign it.
not_available Right? You don't have to go.
not_available It's your decision.
not_available Thanks.
not_available But I feel better now, really.
not_available We should get home.
not_available One more dispo and I'm out of here.
not_available What's that? 
not_available It's from the vending machine.
not_available And the cafeteria? 
not_available No water.
not_available Can't cook.
not_available Then don't eat.
not_available That'll kill you.
