not_available Oh, doing your NICU rotation, huh? Just when I was used to my double life in the ER.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available We think Jacob has a heart problem.
not_available You think? ABG's back, metabolic acidosis, minus 18.
not_available What does that mean? It means his body's not getting enough oxygen but the breathing tube should help.
not_available Sam, 10 of bicarb, 50 of saline.
not_available I only have two hands and he only has one line.
not_available Abby, bag him.
not_available Tell Cards to meet us in the NICU.
not_available Start the Prostins on the way.
not_available We'll take it.
not_available We don't need help.
not_available If he starts crashing 
not_available you'll need extra hands.
not_available Push this.
not_available It can be difficult to diagnose congenital heart disease.
not_available His doctor saw him yesterday.
not_available She missed this? Sometimes symptoms don't present right away.
not_available How serious is this? 
not_available We don't know yet.
not_available Cards will meet us just in case.
not_available In case of what? 
not_available Cardiology will talk to you.

not_available When'd you two start your rotation? 
not_available Five minutes ago.
not_available Well, the NICU's 
great intubations, chest tubes, umbilical lines.
not_available You'll get to do all sorts of teeny, tiny, kick
not_available ass procedures.
not_available Cards is waiting and Raab is pissed.
not_available You trying to give him a pneumo? 
not_available Good luck.

not_available Other than that, he's great.
not_available Okay.
not_available You didn't keep flow sheets, index cards? 
not_available It's all up in here.
not_available Tell me youre joking.
not_available You don't need any paperwork for this kid.
not_available Bad hypoxic encephalopathy.
not_available His brain's mush.
not_available But his vitals are good.
not_available He can go on indefinitely.
not_available Family won't withdraw support? 
not_available Two months and about $2 million later Mom's still holding out for a miracle.
not_available Theyre here every day.
not_available He's a paperweight.
not_available There's nothing to do.
not_available Come on, theyre waiting for us.
not_available Thank you so much for joining us.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Raab, director of Neonatology.
not_available We round twice a day, 7 and 4.
not_available You will come ready to present overnight data and exams on your patients.
not_available Everyone scrubs for a full three minutes before you enter the NICU.
not_available No jewelry on the hands, spreads bacteria.
not_available Not even my wedding band? 
not_available No, and cut your fingernails.
not_available In 1993, two children were abducted from this unit.
not_available Explains the little LoJacks around their ankles.
not_available You will be issued a code for this door.
not_available Do not give your code to anyone.
not_available I tattooed mine on my scrotum.
not_available No one will ever see it there.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gillespie, back already? Another month in the box.
not_available Your standup routine might go over on other rotations but the NICU is a tough room.
not_available Who do we have here? Lloyd Roberts, ex38weeker 
not_available admitted for TTN and detox.
not_available What's TTN? Transient tachypnea of the newborn results from delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid.
not_available Good.
not_available Continue, Kate.
not_available Born to 23year
not_available old G4P4 mom who used meth and heroin during pregnancy.
not_available Do we need to keep our voices down? Confidentiality doesn't exist here.
not_available The quieter we talk, the harder they listen.
not_available Kate, your plan? 
not_available DC the O2, continue amp and gent advance the feeds, morphine taper.
not_available Did you name him yet? 
not_available Everyone, meet Virgie.
not_available Twentyyears
not_available plus as a NICU nurse.
not_available Her 
mission to protect the babies from the likes of you.
not_available Haven't had a Thor in a while.
not_available We have a tradition of giving the babies tough
not_available guy nicknames.
not_available Hard to fight with a name like Lloyd.
not_available Latest gas on Jacob Kolber.
not_available Acidosis is worse.
not_available What was the final read on the echo? Come on, people, who picked him up? Lockhart, he's yours.
not_available Go.
not_available Examine your patient.
not_available Cardiology confirmed a critical coarct.
not_available Which is? 
not_available A narrowing of the aorta usually at the ductus arteriosus.
not_available And why do we care? 
not_available Because blood can't get to the lower half of the body.
not_available Why is that bad? His legs need blood.
not_available If you don't know, don't guess.
not_available Decreased perfusion means acidosis shock and heart failure.
not_available His means have been drifting down.
not_available Lungs are wet.
not_available I can barely palpate the femorals.
not_available Ten of bicarb, start dopa at 12, crank up the Prostins to 0.
not_available 1.
not_available He needs the O.
not_available R.
not_available The cardiologist said to try medicine first.
not_available Medicine isn't working.
not_available CT Surg said they'll 
not_available get to him in the next 48 hours.
not_available This boy can't wait 48 hours.
not_available If not to the O.
not_available R., they can take him to the cath lab for dilation and stenting.
not_available Stenting? 
not_available Another way to open a blockage.
not_available Blocked? You said it was too narrow.
not_available So narrow, blood isn't getting through.
not_available Tom, send off LFTs and creatinine.
not_available Check for end
not_available organ damage.
not_available You got it.
not_available I want to talk to that cardiologist again, all right? Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Kolber, Jacob is very sick but all this is really a plumbing problem.
not_available Nothing that a CT surgeon can't fix.
not_available Surgery will cure him? 
not_available It should, yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, he needs a nickname.
not_available How about Jake? Sounds tough to me.
not_available Jacob to Jake.
not_available Very creative.
not_available Thin mec, Delivery Room 3.
not_available What are you waiting for? Go.
not_available Fifty cc saline bolus.
not_available Push it, Tom.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, what are you waiting for? Go.
not_available You could learn something.
not_available I'd like to stay here, if that's okay.
not_available Covering deliveries is part of your job.
not_available Go.
not_available Tom, we need another i
not_available STAT to see where we are.
not_available Dr.
not_available Raab
not_available And he needs a Foley and another PIV.
not_available I can do that.
not_available He's my patient.
not_available Get CT Surg on the phone and tell them your patient needs the O.
not_available R.
not_available right now.
not_available Not in 48 hours 
not_available not sometime today, now.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available So when the DR phone rings we drop everything and run? Yep, 24/7.
not_available It means some potentially sick
not_available ass baby's being born.
not_available Kid ends up fine, but you never know.
not_available Can I do the intubation? If it's indicated.
not_available Oh, you like this stuff.
not_available The technology's fascinating.
not_available What's wrong with us? We should be in the easy, lucrative 
specialties Derm, Radiology.
not_available Okay, little gunner, welcome to your very first delivery.
not_available Matt, just in time.
not_available Six weeks early, no prenatal care.
not_available You have a boy.
not_available First get rid of the gunk.
not_available And dry him like crazy.
not_available Warms the baby up and reminds him to breathe.
not_available Good pulse but the cry's weak.
not_available It's all about ventilation.
not_available Get them to breathe, the rest follows.
not_available Decel down to the 20s.
not_available Got it.
not_available One more big push.
not_available Hand me the bag.
not_available You can do better than that.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Matt.
not_available Head's out, here we go.
not_available We were visiting my cousin.
not_available Baby come too soon.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Just needs help getting started.
not_available Thirtytwo
not_available weekers usually do fine.
not_available Matt, it's twins.
not_available Dude, thanks for the heads
not_available up.
not_available We would have brought down a second team.
not_available Neela, second setup.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Okay, buddy, you just bought yourself a tube.
not_available Call the NICU for backup.
not_available It's a girl.
not_available This baby's not breathing.
not_available A NICU admission is like running a marathon without training.
not_available It's an endurance test for patients, for families, and for you.
not_available Eat when you can, sleep when you can, and when it's time to go home get the hell out of here.
not_available Let's round.
not_available Jiang Han's up to 1830 grams.
not_available Room air, q.
not_available 3 feeds.
not_available Feeder and grower, behaving himself nicely.
not_available Inga's ABG.
not_available Sister's a mess.
not_available Inga? Inga? 
not_available You had to come up with nicknames and you failed to.
not_available Dirk and Inga.
not_available I was going to call her Surinder.
not_available It's Punjabi for "warrior.
not_available " 
not_available You're thinking too much.
not_available Inga doesn't sound tough.
not_available Neela, present your patient.
not_available Her pneumonia is worse.
not_available Acidotic.
not_available Ventilation's crap.
not_available Pa02 in the 40s all day.
not_available I think we should consider ECMO.
not_available Cardiopulmonary bypass? Isn't that incredibly dangerous on a 2
not_available kilo kid? We need to do something before the prolonged hypoxia causes brain damage.
not_available Who can tell me the risk of ECMO? 
not_available Overwhelming infection.
not_available Could happen anyway, ECMO or not.
not_available Head bleed.
not_available Parents could end up with a little potato.
not_available We'll get daily head ultrasounds.
not_available Won't prevent a bleed 
not_available just detect it after.
not_available She was well till she became bacteremic.
not_available It's risky, but ECMO could get her through.
not_available She's not getting enough oxygen.
not_available If we do nothing, she'll die.
not_available Are you sure? How can anyone be sure about something like that? Neela, call the profusion team to start ECMO.
not_available Rounds are over.
not_available Thanks.
not_available She already thinks I'm an idiot, so there's really nothing to lose.
not_available I have your sign
not_available out.
not_available You should get out of here.
not_available I need to talk to Inga's parents about ECMO.
not_available I'm gonna be here all night anyway.
not_available Go.
not_available I'll talk to them.
not_available No.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Did you change Rocky's diaper? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why did you do that? 
not_available Because it was dirty.
not_available My ins and outs are all off now.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Not good enough.
not_available Go find it.
not_available It's in the trash.
not_available Find it, weigh it, and I might let you get some sleep tonight.
not_available Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Tseng.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Do you have the results back on the cardiac cath? Cards will talk to you as soon as they have an official report.
not_available I've been waiting.
not_available I'll take an unofficial report.
not_available I'll ask Abby if she's heard.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Waiting's driving me crazy.
not_available The waiting is hard.
not_available You know how long it takes to recover from something like this? A rough estimate? 
not_available It's too soon to say.
not_available Would you two come with me? How long you been here? Eight days.
not_available We were visiting from Suzhou in China when the babies come.
not_available Are they doing okay? 
not_available Our son is very strong.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tseng? ECMO stands for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.
not_available Ready for circuit.
not_available The machine puts oxygen in the blood and sends it back to Inga's body.
not_available It does the work of her heart and lungs.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm clamped on high.
not_available I know it looks scary, but it's her best chance.
not_available Chance of what? 
not_available A good outcome.
not_available She be healthy? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available Chow time for Dirk.
not_available One of you want to feed him? 
not_available I go.
not_available I've got control down low.
not_available Releasing arterial.
not_available Releasing venous.
not_available Clamping bridge.
not_available ECMO on, 20
not_available 25.
not_available It'll be a while before we know how she's going to respond.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available If she was born in China, she'd already be dead.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available My husband and I are lucky.
not_available We went to school, we have jobs as teachers.
not_available But it's not like here.
not_available We wanted our daughter to be born in America so she'd have more options.
not_available And she already does.
not_available We don't have hospitals like this.
not_available It wasn't an accident, then.
not_available You meant to deliver here.
not_available We sold everything to come stay with my aunt have the babies in Chicago.
not_available You're just going to start over, with nothing? Her life will be better.
not_available Isn't that why your parents sent you to this country too? Tom, can you help me out? 
not_available Not now.
not_available Gotta hang vanco.
not_available Transducers, art lines, no butterflies.
not_available They're in the cabinet by the sinks on the left.
not_available Been here for nine weeks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Just came to check on Jacob.
not_available He looks great.
not_available His suck is still weak, but Abby tells me to keep trying.
not_available He'll get there.
not_available You keep trying.
not_available It says here that he may need surgery again in a few years.
not_available Is that true? That sounds like a question for Cardiology.
not_available Occasionally the area where the aorta was repaired gets blocked from scarring but usually they can take care of it and avoid another surgery.
not_available That's good to know.
not_available Thanks, Abby.
not_available I better get back to work.
not_available But I'll be by later.
not_available It was nice to see you, Mrs.
not_available Kolber.
not_available Looks like you're doing well here.
not_available Right.
not_available Abby, take a look at the CO2.
not_available Back off on the rate, check it in an hour.
not_available You got it.
not_available Parents love you.
not_available Nurses wouldn't give you the time of day 
not_available unless you knew what you were doing.
not_available Yeah? Tell that to my Attending.
not_available You should see me on rounds.
not_available So Kem and I had our first official tour of the labor and delivery suites today.
not_available How can you call one room a suite? They're counting the bathroom.
not_available You're gonna be a dad.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's it feel? 
not_available Scary.
not_available Especially in this room.
not_available I start thinking about all the things that can go wrong all the mistakes you can make.
not_available You're gonna be a great father.
not_available Full
not_available term forceps in 2.
not_available That's my cue.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available You're gonna be a great doctor.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Baby time.
not_available Can't.
not_available Got a finger in this kid's pleural cavity.
not_available You go.
not_available Alone? Is that even legal? 
not_available I'm right behind you.
not_available Get set up, I'll meet you there.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available Are you kidding? You have to go home.
not_available You can't go to a delivery on your own.
not_available I dream about blood sugars, TPN orders, gent doses, boxed kidneys.
not_available Get used to it if you're going into neonatology.
not_available I haven't slept well for days.
not_available You know, all this whining about how tired you are, but you never leave.
not_available I hate to break it to you, but we'll make it through this night without you.
not_available Just trying to help.
not_available NICU's here.
not_available Thirtyfive
not_available weeker, maternal diabetes, failure to progress.
not_available I thought this was just a forceps delivery.
not_available That too.
not_available Here comes a contraction, Sarah.
not_available That's it, baby.
not_available Big push.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available What do you mean "we"? Hi, I'm Abby from the NICU team.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available We're called for forceps deliveries.
not_available It's standard procedure.
not_available Baby's heart rate's dropping.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Baby's getting tired! She's not the only one.
not_available Nuchal cord.
not_available Bad decel, 54.
not_available Okay, Sarah, one more.
not_available That's it.
not_available Here she comes.
not_available Okay, Sarah, one more.
not_available That's it.
not_available Here she comes.
not_available A girl? It's a girl? It's a girl! It's a girl! 
not_available Good work, baby.
not_available Good work.
not_available Poor tone.
not_available Check the heart rate.
not_available I can't feel it.
not_available Well, listen, then.
not_available Shallow resps.
not_available How is she? How's my girl? Come on, baby.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Hold on, I'm gonna get a picture.
not_available Neela, what's the pulse? 
not_available I'm counting.
not_available It's not that hard.
not_available Tap it out.
not_available Where the hell is Matt? Oh, look at all that hair.
not_available I'm sorry, I'm going to need some room, okay? Okay.
not_available She's okay.
not_available You hear that baby? She got some lungs.
not_available Everything cool? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's gonna have to come upstairs to monitor her sugars but, yeah, she looks good.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Girl, you look just like your daddy.
not_available Except three shades lighter.
not_available Babies are supposed to be light when they're born, I told you.
not_available Don't listen to your daddy, Daphne.
not_available You're perfect.
not_available It's Matt.
not_available He's a little late.
not_available It's Inga.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Hypertensive.
not_available Crit bottomed out.
not_available Ultrasound shows huge brain bleed.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah, like we said, it's always a risk with ECMO.
not_available She's got to come off.
not_available She'll die.
not_available We can't leave her on, the bleed will get worse.
not_available Hey, Matt, they need you in L&amp;D.;
not_available There's a C
not_available section.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Order 20 per kilo of packed cells.
not_available I'll be back soon.
not_available Surgery's on their way to decannulate.
not_available I talked everyone into this.
not_available Nobody, not even you could talk Raab into ECMO if she didn't think it was the right thing.
not_available She's seizing.
not_available 0.5 of Ativan.
not_available I can't take a verbal from a student.
not_available Raab's gone, Matt's in a delivery.
not_available I could lose my job.
not_available She's seizing.
not_available That's the least of her worries.
not_available Let's see what Matt says.
not_available Versed will do the same.
not_available You can't without a cosigned order.
not_available Watch me.
not_available I'm telling Dr.
not_available Raab.
not_available You do that.
not_available She'll kick you guys off the rotation.
not_available Kick me off.
not_available Neela has nothing to do with it.
not_available What am I going to tell her parents? Versed's in.
not_available Go home.
not_available "Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Tseng, I'm sorry.
not_available I screwed up.
not_available Inga's brain is toast.
not_available " 
not_available Stop it.
not_available You didn't do this.
not_available I've gotta call them.
not_available Just go.
not_available Raab will do it.
not_available They should hear it from me.
not_available You're a med student.
not_available The Attending can handle it.
not_available Just go.
not_available Good night, Neela.
not_available Excuse me, can someone get the door, please? Hello? Anyone? Get me the hell out of here! Oxygen is perfect the whole time.
not_available When can we take Dirk home? 
not_available As soon as Dr.
not_available Raab writes her a note.
not_available Thank you, Neela.
not_available Inga's not breathing over her ventilator at all.
not_available That's not a good sign, is it? It'll take time before we know how much neurological function she'll get back but her lungs are much better.
not_available She's a strong girl.
not_available Yes, she is.
not_available I'm waiting for Dirk's discharge summary.
not_available I'll get on that.
not_available Cher's a lovely name, it's just how you spelled it.
not_available I just wanted it to be different.
not_available Okay.
not_available As long as you're aware.
not_available Poor Chair, she's doomed.
not_available Hopefully she'll meet a nice Ottoman someday.
not_available Heard any funny dead
not_available baby stories lately? Here's a good 
one Inga's hydrocephalus is worsening.
not_available EEG shows continued seizure activity.
not_available She's not dead, but she might never wake up.
not_available It's a real laugh.
not_available Bad day, Neela? Millions of dollars keeping these babies alive.
not_available Half die anyway.
not_available Why bother? Time for rounds.
not_available Forty years ago, Inga was considered a micro
not_available preemie, borderline viable.
not_available In many parts of the world, that's still the case.
not_available We saved her so she can endure a lifetime of seizures, lung disease, cerebral palsy.
not_available We gave Inga a chance.
not_available Her brother's going home today, a normal kid.
not_available But Inga's here now, gorked out in a level
not_available three nursery.
not_available Look, we do our best.
not_available Some kids will end up hospitalized for life, and some will go to the prom.
not_available Neela, there are no guarantees in this work.
not_available If you can't live with that, I suggest you become a bank teller.
not_available We'll pick up again when I get back.
not_available Don't listen.
not_available My cousin's a bank teller.
not_available Got held up at gunpoint last year.
not_available Still here? I discharged Daphne an hour ago.
not_available I'm just waiting for the nurse to take out that IV.
not_available I can do it.
not_available You're letting a student touch your IV? That's brave.
not_available She's territorial.
not_available They teach that in nursing school.
not_available Abby, we need you over here.
not_available Just keep some pressure there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available She's gonna miss you guys.
not_available No, she won't.
not_available She'll be home.
not_available He's been tachypneic, sats dropping.
not_available He's tiring out.
not_available Put him back on O2? 
not_available He's going to need more than that.
not_available Diastolic is in the teens.
not_available Widening pulse pressure.
not_available Okay, 50 cc's of saline cultures, start him on amp and cefotax.

not_available Five As and Bs in the last hour.
not_available Did anybody page Raab? 
not_available 911.
not_available Okay, Mrs.
not_available Kolber
not_available Kyle? Jacob's having trouble breathing likely due to blood infection.
not_available From what? 
not_available We sent out cultures.
not_available He was okay.
not_available Sepsis can come on quickly.
not_available We're starting antibiotics, but we have to put the breathing tube back.
not_available We were talking about going home.
not_available He's tough.
not_available He'll get through this.
not_available Get together.
not_available Photo for the wall.
not_available Smile.

not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Neela.
not_available Mei Fan.
not_available Mei Fan? I want you to have this.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's strange to be going.
not_available Lots of parents are nervous when their babies are discharged.
not_available It'll be great.
not_available You'll love having him home.
not_available I know you're right.
not_available Bye, Neela.
not_available See you tomorrow.

not_available 24 over eight.
not_available We'll adjust from there.
not_available Order a Versed drip and a chest film.
not_available You wanna call the tech? Okay, nothing to do now but wait for the antibiotics to kick in.
not_available I don't know if I can take another round of this.
not_available Sit.
not_available One of those better be for me.
not_available I just needed to get outside for a minute.
not_available The NICU's so confining, claustrophobic.
not_available There's a reason why Matt calls it the "the box.
not_available " 
not_available Raab's right, you know.
not_available Did you eat anything? I like science, complete answers, a plan for everything.
not_available I can't deal with uncertainty.
not_available It gets easier.
not_available I planned neonatology since I started medical school.
not_available I'm supposed to be loving this.
not_available Well, the whole purpose of rotation is to try on different specialties.
not_available I mean, it's okay if you don't
not_available I had a baby brother.
not_available He died when he was 6 days old.
not_available I was only 3.
not_available I remember sitting in my mom's hospital room eating ice cream.
not_available But I don't actually remember him.
not_available The NICU's just so sad all the time.
not_available How can you stand it? I don't know.
not_available When I was an OB nurse, preemies freaked me out.
not_available I thought they looked like frogs.
not_available I was pretty sure I was gonna hate the NICU.
not_available But you don't.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available It's not just about the babies.
not_available You know, so much of it is about taking care of the parents.
not_available And it turns out tragic family dynamics are my specialty.
not_available It's Matt.
not_available There's a delivery.
not_available Full
not_available term, mom's febrile, PPROM, suspected chorio.
not_available Good work, Sandy.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Honey, we're almost there.
not_available The little boy is officially here.
not_available You did it.
not_available We have a baby.
not_available Amniotic fluid's clouding.
not_available Kid's had late variables.
not_available Abby? Wait, you're bagging him? 
not_available You need to wait over there.
not_available No, that's my son.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available It's okay, Matt.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Honey, what's wrong? Just a little blow
not_available by.
not_available Let them work.
not_available What's wrong? He's too quiet.
not_available Give him a minute.
not_available Good chest excursion.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available That's what we like to hear.
not_available Congratulations, Mom.
not_available And Mom.
not_available He's beautiful.
not_available Is he really all right? 
not_available He'll go upstairs for antibiotics because of the chorio.
not_available But right now, he looks great.
not_available I love you.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available Nobody did.
not_available Would you like to cut the cord, Dr.
not_available Weaver? Hello, Henry.
not_available Hey.
not_available Your usual.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bad night? Jake is maxed out on dopa and epi, third
not_available spacing like mad.
not_available In the past two hours, his belly blew up in front of our eyes.
not_available I think it's NEC.
not_available Surgery's on their way.
not_available God.
not_available His parents here? No, they're on their way.
not_available I finally convinced them to go home and then I had to call them back.
not_available Any word from Inga's parents? 
not_available No.
not_available Three days and not a single phone call.
not_available KUB on Jake Kolber.
not_available Free air under the diaphragm and pneumatosis.
not_available Oh, damn it.
not_available He's perfed.
not_available Pedes surgery's gonna meet us in the O.
not_available R.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Can we wait for his parents to see him? 
not_available His bowel's dying, there isn't time.
not_available We need to save the viable tissue before there's nothing left to save.
not_available He's thrombocytopenic.
not_available Platelets and FFP are on hold in the O.
not_available R.
not_available Abby, where are you going? 
not_available To surgery.
not_available His intestines were injured and they need to cut out the injured part.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available The injury's compromised your son's already tenuous condition.
not_available The sooner we get him to the O.
not_available R., the better.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Would you like to see your little brother up close? Abby.
not_available Kids aren't allowed in NICU.
not_available Just five seconds.
not_available There he is.
not_available Can he hear me? 
not_available Yes, he can.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You won't hurt him.
not_available I'm Miranda, your big sister.
not_available Come on, honey.
not_available Thank you, Abby.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Where is your prayer group? I told them not to come.
not_available I think he's getting a diaper rash.
not_available I'll order some nystatin.
not_available He's 3 months old today.
not_available You should go home.
not_available I thought that if I prayed hard enough if I showed God how much I believed You must be exhausted.
not_available I don't want him to suffer anymore.
not_available My patient has been bumped three times for so
not_available called emergencies.
not_available Been waiting over 24 hours for ORIF, happened again.
not_available Came up to see what's so important.
not_available Jake Kolber.
not_available It's the congenitalheart
not_available disease baby you guys admitted to us.
not_available Do you remember? No.
not_available Circumferential necrosis to the jejunum.
not_available There's really nothing viable here.
not_available Damn.
not_available Abby? The bowel's completely infarcted.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We're closing.
not_available So that's it.
not_available Can't live without a gut.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available I'm gonna go tell the family.
not_available Give yourself a minute.
not_available They don't need to hear this immediately.
not_available What am I to do, go out and get a latte while they wonder what's going on? All right, listen.
not_available Maybe you would want to wait for the Attending to tell them.
not_available Is that what you would do? Kyle.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Is this the Chinese interpreter? Excuse me.
not_available No, I don't understand what you're saying.
not_available I've already called them.
not_available I was connected to you.
not_available Please don't put me on hold again.
not_available Hello? Yes, I'm still here.
not_available I'm not sure if I need Mandarin or Cantonese.
not_available How long will it take? An hour, maybe longer.
not_available You helped this family, Abby.
not_available They will remember you for the rest of their lives.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm hoping you'll give neonatology serious consideration.
not_available Are you mocking me? Because it's really, really not a good time.
not_available No.
not_available You're one of the best students I've ever had.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye.
not_available What? 
not_available The Tsengs have gone to China with Dirk.
not_available What? 
not_available That was Mrs.
not_available Tseng's cousin.
not_available They went back yesterday.
not_available She doesn't know how to reach them.
not_available Come on.
not_available We've got work to do.
not_available Tell me this is our last day.
not_available Good morning.
not_available How's Henry today? 
not_available He's great.
not_available He's raring to get out of here.
not_available All cultures came back negative, but we need to treat for another seven days.
not_available Unless you two allow us to do the LP.
not_available I do taps on babies all day in the ER and never think twice about it.
not_available Just do the spinal tap.
not_available We wanna take our baby home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Abby, you're on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Raab, I would be more comfortable if you did the procedure, if you don't mind.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll be back after rounds.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Let Abby do it.
not_available Kerry.
not_available It's okay, Sandy.
not_available What's going to happen to Inga? If she survives, she'll either be adopted or put in a long
not_available term care facility.
not_available Should I call Social Work? Go ahead, but nobody's going to China to look for them.
not_available Her mother wouldn't leave her here.
not_available They're young, scared.
not_available Maybe they think Inga would be better off this way.
not_available In a hospital, alone? If you were in a foreign country with no money, no job, and no place to live, who knows? 
not_available You might do the same thing.
not_available No, I wouldn't, and neither would you.
not_available You can't begin to know what you would do and you don't know the first thing about me.
not_available People are complicated.
not_available That's not an excuse for abandoning a baby.
not_available Neela, if you stay that judgmental, you're gonna hate this job.
not_available CSF on the first attempt with Dr.
not_available Mom breathing down your neck.
not_available I'm impressed.
not_available You should see how good I am when I'm not post
not_available call.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available You stuck a needle in my kid's back and you've been working for 36 hours? Actually, it's only been 31 hours.
not_available Tube four, crystal clear.
not_available Owen Miller.
not_available Bad hypoxic brain injury.
not_available Mom's your real patient.
not_available She's letting go, needs help.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Miller, this is David.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm your new medical student.
not_available Ex34
not_available weeker with mec asp and pneumomediastinum.
not_available Got him off high frequency last night.
not_available "Mec asp"? 
not_available Meconium aspiration.
not_available It's a foreign language, but you'll pick it up fast.
not_available Zero red blood cells.
not_available Champagne tap.
not_available Hey, before we go, do you mind taking a picture? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Get your butt back down to the ER where you belong.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You all signed out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ever been to the Sky Bar? This is disgusting.
not_available I told you.
not_available Why are cigars associated with babies? This stinky thing has no place in a nursery.
not_available It's Freudian.
not_available Something about men wanting to have sex with their mothers.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know what else I don't get? Why we're drinking cider instead of champagne.
not_available You're supposed to get champagne for a champagne tap.
not_available Is Weaver that cheap? 
not_available Weaver knows I don't drink champagne.
not_available So you still thinking about neonatology? Not in a million years.
not_available I hope you didn't let Raab discourage you.
not_available It's more than that.
not_available She thinks you should go into NICU, you know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You should.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I bet every Attending tries to recruit you.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Look who's talking.
not_available Your mind is a sponge.
not_available Maybe, but you've got that thing.
not_available I don't know what it is, but it's much harder to learn.
not_available I think all that cider's going to your head.
