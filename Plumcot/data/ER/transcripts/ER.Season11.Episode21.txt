not_available My very white mother, my black father, with their little brown girl.
not_available It wasn't easy for them.
not_available You know that Joshua would be a year old now? I'm gonna head back to the hospital, see my mother, okay? What are we doing? What are we doing? I still love you, and I know you still love me.
not_available We talk to each other every day.
not_available We talk for hours on the phone.
not_available We tell each other absolutely everything about our lives.
not_available I make you happy.
not_available I make you laugh.
not_available I tried living in Chicago and it wasn't for me.
not_available We don't have to live in Chicago.
not_available You have your life there 
not_available your career, everything.
not_available I would give it up for you.
not_available I don't want you to.
not_available Kem, we had a baby and he died.
not_available It's a tragedy that happens to people and it happened to us.
not_available But that doesn't have to define us.
not_available It doesn't.
not_available We're stronger than that.
not_available Aren't we? I can't
not_available We can have another baby.

not_available Stop doing this.

not_available I called.

not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Ambu
not_available bag.
not_available Charge at 200.
not_available Cardiac history? 
not_available I don't know, Ray.
not_available You're the only one that's met her.

not_available Oh, we're being rude.
not_available No.

not_available Who?

not_available Well, yeah, I guess.
not_available Also something of a fool.
not_available When are you going home? 
not_available There's a flight tonight at 9.
not_available You're giving up awfully easily, aren't you? I was rather firmly discouraged from continuing to try.
not_available You know what life is? Joy and grief, hand in hand.
not_available You can't know real happiness until you've had sorrow to contrast it with.

not_available Starting internal compressions.
not_available We put in six units.
not_available Where's it all going? 
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Fine V
not_available fib.
not_available Internal paddles.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available All right, stop bagging.
not_available Eighteen
not_available gauge needle.
not_available Coronary artery's full of air.
not_available An air embolus? All right.
not_available That's it.
not_available We're done.
not_available Time of death, 11:47.
not_available How did she get that much air in her heart? I don't know.
not_available She had an open neck wound.
not_available The negative pressure sucked air into her jugular.
not_available I don't see how that's possible.
not_available She has an occlusive dressing.
not_available I I took it down to explore the neck.
not_available Was it before or after the intubation? This was before.
not_available You took down a patient's dressing before she was intubated? Excuse me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart? Your emphysema guy is coding.
not_available But it was only for a few breaths.
not_available I didn't Damn right, we're gonna stay closed as long as I've got crap
not_available I don't mean figuratively.
not_available literal crap pouring out of my ceiling.
not_available I came to check his neb.
not_available He was down.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brixton? Mr.
not_available Brixton? 
not_available PVCs.
not_available All right, a mac
not_available two and an 8.0.
not_available You should have got me if he was tiring out.
not_available No, no.
not_available He was holding his own.
not_available Systolic's 77.
not_available Okay.
not_available NS, wide open.
not_available Start second line.
not_available Run of six.
not_available All right.
not_available What now? 
not_available Acute emphysema flare.
not_available He went apneic on continuous nebs.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Start compressions and mark the time.
not_available Let's get an ABG and a capnograph now.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Good sats, no stridor.
not_available Got a repeat EKG and neck films.
not_available You're doing good, Rebecca.
not_available I didn't mean to hurt her.
not_available I just wanted her to leave Rebecca alone.
not_available Did she suffer? No.
not_available We put her to sleep to work on her.
not_available She didn't suffer any pain.
not_available I didn't mean to kill her.
not_available We loved her.

not_available Back in sinus.
not_available Got a pulse.
not_available Okay.
not_available What do you got? Emphysema flare.
not_available Abby had him on continuous albuterol.
not_available He was wheezing.
not_available Given the acute setting
not_available Chuny, correlate the capnograph to the ABG.
not_available Set the rate at 40.
not_available Abby, what's the end tidal CO2? Ninety
not_available six.
not_available Can you tell me why? 
not_available He was apneic.
not_available Why? He wasn't ventilating? 
not_available That's not an answer.
not_available He has emphysema? 
not_available Wrong.
not_available Tired out.
not_available No.
not_available Basic respiratory physiology.
not_available He was hypoxic.
not_available ABG's back, pH 7.1.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Emphysemics chronically retain CO2.
not_available They rely on relative hypoxia
not_available To trigger their respiratory drive.
not_available I put him on nebs, oxygen, and took away his impulse to breathe.
not_available Leading to hypercapnia, acidosis, V
not_available tach.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Don't apologize to us.
not_available He'll be okay once you blow off some CO2.
not_available It's a classic intern mistake.
not_available You won't make it again.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get up.
not_available What? What's going on? 
not_available Tell them.
not_available That poor woman in there thinks she murdered her own niece.
not_available Now, Ray.
not_available Hey.
not_available If it's any consolation, that was a great teaching case for me.
not_available I'm glad my public humiliation can further your educational goals.
not_available The guy is fine, Abby.
not_available It's not your fault he smoked two packs a day for decades.
not_available So I was thinking that I might rank County as my first choice for internship.
not_available What about UCSF? I don't want to go to UCSF.
not_available I want to stay right here.
not_available Don't do that for me.
not_available Now, this was a seriously crappy day.
not_available Who wants to get drunk and pick a bar fight with a bunch of law clerks, huh? I still have an hour of charting to do.
not_available How are Birdy and Rebecca? 
not_available They're gonna be fine.
not_available Did you find out what happened? Turns out the niece had them panhandling to support her crack habit hit them when they didn't bring home enough.
not_available Well, well.
not_available If it isn't the three amigos.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Failure to recall basic respiratory principles unsupervised umbilical lines in an infant and a fatal air embolus.
not_available Hey, when do the new interns start? 
not_available A week from Monday.
not_available Man, oh, man.
not_available God help your patients.
not_available Wait up, dude.
not_available I don't know about you, but I feel really inspired now.
not_available So I think I'll go and throw myself under a train.
not_available Don't go away mad, Jake.
not_available But do go away.
not_available I'm moving back to Africa.
not_available And we can start over.
not_available We can do everything that we didn't do before.
not_available You take as much time as you need.
not_available Take a month.
not_available Take a year.
not_available You can take 10 years.
not_available I don't care.
not_available And I'm not leaving without you, and I'm not living without you.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you.
