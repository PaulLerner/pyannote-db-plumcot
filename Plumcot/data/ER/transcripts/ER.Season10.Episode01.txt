not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available I left, I guess.
not_available This guy's not on Medicaid.
not_available He's uninsured so I referred him to ADAP.
not_available So, what do you wanna do with him?

not_available That's the bad news, huh? 
not_available No, actually, that's the good news.
not_available It's an opportunistic infection.
not_available It means you now qualify for Medicaid and the anti
not_available retroviral therapy.
not_available So, what's the bad news? Candidal esophagitis is an AIDS
not_available defining infection.
not_available That's why you qualify now.
not_available I have AIDS.
not_available We're going to write you a prescription for Diflucan to help fight the infection.
not_available What is that gonna cost? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Medicaid will cover it.
not_available We'll send you to the financial counselor's office to help get your paperwork done.

not_available That's the men's room.
not_available Howdy, boys.
not_available Don't mind me.
not_available Guard the door for me, would you? Make up for it how? 
not_available Flowers, a nice dinner.
not_available If you're really mad, jewelry.
not_available I could use a new transmission for my car.
not_available You're a real romantic, you know that? AV graft connects the brachial vein to the brachial artery for easy dialysis access.
not_available See the redness and the swelling? Is there any pain here? 
not_available It hurts like hell.

not_available You use anything special on it? 
not_available Not really.
not_available What a lovely color.
not_available Lastly, you want to check the heart to make sure there's no murmur.
not_available What do you think we'd worry about? 
not_available Bacterial endocarditis.
not_available Good, good.
not_available So, what do we need? Labs? 
not_available Yep.
not_available CBC, Chem
not_available 7 Gram's stain, and a culture from the abscess and get me 3 grams of Unasyn IV, piggyback.
not_available Do we drain it? 
not_available No, not in the ER.
not_available She goes to the O.R.
not_available for an I&amp;D.;
not_available So check her vitals every 15 minutes until she goes up to the O.R and grab another chart.
not_available Talk to him.
not_available Haven't you punished him enough already? 
not_available It's not about punishing him.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available If he starts in on me again, I swear I'll cut the other arm off.
not_available Get a saw.
not_available I'll hold him down.
not_available A same
not_available day surgery center will get more paying customers.
not_available This department is a money pit.
not_available We have people coming through the door every day and we're legally obligated to treat them.
not_available Which is why we should grab wood, nail the entrance shut, and paint "Go away.
not_available " Frank, are the phones working again? 
not_available Two lines.
not_available The rest we don't answer.
not_available Some guy looking for Cubs tickets last time I checked.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Carter, that guy from the foundation called again.
not_available Take a message? 
not_available I said you were here.
not_available He's coming with some papers.
not_available I don't want him here while I work.
not_available Well, tell him yourself when you see him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You want to get a cup of coffee? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Carter, right? Tom Williams.
not_available You sent me up to financial counseling to get on Medicaid for my throat medication.
not_available Right.
not_available I filled out the paperwork.
not_available I went to the pharmacy.
not_available They can't give me the prescription until I get my Medicaid card.
not_available Should I keep taking Nystatin until then? Did they say how long it will take? 
not_available A few weeks.
not_available You need to take the Diflucan now.
not_available Can you cover the cost of it? It's 300 bucks.
not_available Okay, hang out.
not_available I'll call the pharmacy myself.
not_available Now what? The pharmacy won't fill his prescription till he gets his card.
not_available We could shoot him.
not_available It would be easier.
