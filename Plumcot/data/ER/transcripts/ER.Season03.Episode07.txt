
not_available Previously on ER What's your name? 
not_available Gail.
not_available She's 10 days.
not_available Is she okay? Pulse ox is falling.
not_available You need to get this baby off the table.
not_available I'm getting Keaton.
not_available No.
not_available I don't want you near my patients.
not_available I don't need your approval.
not_available If the baby dies, it's my responsibility but your fault.
not_available Hi, Mark.
not_available Hi, Susan.
not_available Excuse me? You just called me Susan.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available You did.
not_available Guess she's on your mind.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available I wish you could just get married.
not_available You're perfect for each other.
not_available You almost went on vacation together.
not_available You knew about that? 
not_available Everybody knew.
not_available Why did you back out? 
not_available She didn't want me to go.
not_available She wanted you to go.
not_available Did she? Nobody told me.
not_available Just do us a favor and ask her out.
not_available We need some fresh gossip.
not_available Oh, man! I need some sleep.
not_available You? At least you get off in 11 hours.
not_available I've got 18 to go.
not_available Where's Benton? Still in the ER? 
not_available No, still where he's been lately.
not_available Still with that baby? 
not_available The man is obsessed.
not_available Damn it, Edson! I told you to keep an eye on him.
not_available That's what I told the nurses.
not_available He's probably in the cafeteria.
not_available He better not have eaten.
not_available Have you seen a male patient about this tall, kind of peculiar? Lost one? 
not_available Great case.
not_available Guy's got a big tumor in his throat.
not_available He needs esophagectomy.
not_available Anspaugh brought some hotshot from Japan, and the patient goes AWOL.
not_available You guys help me find him, and I'll get you in on the surgery.
not_available We'll keep our eyes open.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He's got a sweet tooth, so check the vending machines.
not_available Last shift, he left me three lines to change.
not_available I had to pick up his labs.
not_available Have you had breakfast yet? 
not_available I'm starving.
not_available You paged me? 
not_available Her abdomen is distended.
not_available She's hemorrhaging.
not_available We need to take her off the anticoagulants.
not_available Take her off the machine.
not_available Can she live off it? I doubt she'll last the day, but there's no other choice.
not_available We should take her to the O.R.
not_available Her platelets are too low.
not_available Then we gotta transfuse her.
not_available We just did.
not_available We got to try something.
not_available At this point, the best thing we can do is to do nothing.
not_available I also think that for the time being, you should be more of an observer.
not_available You mean on this case? 
not_available On all the cases.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton, I'd do anything to undo what I did.
not_available But I can't.
not_available This isn't a punishment, but you tend to act without thinking.
not_available If you want to grow as a surgeon, you got to learn more patience.
not_available Hear ye.
not_available Hear ye.
not_available Who wants taffy? Homemade, per chance? 
not_available Saltwater.
not_available Pulled it myself.
not_available Don't mind if I do.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you have change for the candy machine? 
not_available Let me see.
not_available Quarters okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Excuse me, cuz.
not_available You owe me a buck.
not_available I don't have one.
not_available Then you're SOL.
not_available Conni's sick.
not_available Call in a float.
not_available I already did.
not_available Call them back.
not_available I want to approve whoever they send.
not_available Can someone call Security? There's a man urinating in the phone booth.
not_available That's why.
not_available Did anyone hear me? Yes, but you don't need Security.
not_available You need a mop.
not_available I don't mop.
not_available Way to go, Jerry.
not_available How was I supposed to know? I wonder how long we can sit here before anyone notices we're missing.
not_available You just jinxed it.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available That's what I mean.
not_available It's Benton.
not_available Couldn't happen to a nicer What's that? 
not_available The ER.
not_available Do you want to trade? 
not_available No way.
not_available Hi, John.
not_available I got that review article you dropped off on congenital hernias.
not_available I heard you were doing one.
not_available I didn't know if you had read it.
not_available I actually helped edit it.
not_available Oh! Well, then It was very sweet of you.
not_available See you.
not_available Anything I should know about? 
not_available Please! And when was your last bowel movement? Technically, that would've been Monday afternoon.
not_available Which is a little unusual for me.
not_available I'm a morning person.
not_available And then sometimes in the evening, I pass a little gas.
not_available Gas in the evening.
not_available We don't take lengthy histories here.
not_available I believe in being thorough.
not_available When the patient is in for an extended stay, that may be appropriate.
not_available But down here, we keep it short.
not_available That's not the way I do things.
not_available The longer it takes, the longer the patient waits in distress.
not_available That's all right.
not_available We were having a nice little chat.
not_available Anything else? Where were we? 
not_available Gas in the evenings.
not_available We'll need some saline, some 4.0 nylon and a suture setup.
not_available I know the squirrels are cute, Arthur, but I wouldn't try petting one again.
not_available He was trying to eat it.
not_available You all right, Wendy? 
not_available It's not me.
not_available He's choking! 
not_available His airways are blocked.
not_available It's my taffy! It was meant for the staff.
not_available He's dying, Wendy! Do you want to give me a hand? One, two, three! There's more.
not_available How much did you make? Get a McGill and hook up the suction.
not_available Arthur, go to the waiting room.
not_available What's a patient from Surgical doing here? Call upstairs.
not_available I think we just found Dale's AWOL patient.
not_available Where do you want him? 
not_available What's this? Took two bullets to chest and belly.
not_available How long has he been down? 
not_available 15 minutes.
not_available No signs of life.
not_available Let's transfer him over.
not_available Give me 4 units of O
not_available negative.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Here's one entry.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Some gang thing.
not_available He's a banger.
not_available Flatline.
not_available How long was he down? 
not_available 5 to 10 minutes.
not_available Anyone give him CPR? 
not_available No.
not_available So he was down for 20 minutes? 
not_available At least.
not_available Pupils are fixed and dilated.
not_available This kid is dead.
not_available Very dead.
not_available Calling it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Time of 
death 8:26.
not_available This the GSW? 
not_available He's been down for 20 minutes.
not_available Giving up on him? There was no sign of life in the field.
not_available Lydia, start bagging him.
not_available Thoracotomy tray.
not_available Peter, I called it.
not_available Let's get a cutdown on the ankles.
not_available This kid has been down for 20 minutes.
not_available His brain is mush.
not_available Ten
not_available blade.
not_available His parents don't want him opened.
not_available They want us to do our best.
not_available Lydia, go get Mark.
not_available Put the O
not_available neg on the rapid infuser.
not_available Ribspreader! God, it's like rubber! 
not_available It's all the cornstarch.
not_available Scissors.
not_available Yes.
not_available I think it is coming loose.
not_available What are you doing to my patient? 
not_available He swallowed two pounds of taffy.
not_available Here it is! Shame on you, Mr.
not_available Percy.
not_available You're not supposed to eat before surgery.
not_available Nothing can get past that tumor.
not_available We need to move.
not_available Let's take him up.
not_available Hey, Dale.
not_available Remember me? Oh, yes.
not_available I'd ask you to join us, but we're a little crowded.
not_available We can make room.
not_available After all, Carter saved your keister.
not_available Did you consent Mr.
not_available Percy? 
not_available Yes.
not_available All that's left is an art line.
not_available Carter, do the line.
not_available Edson, prep the O.R.
not_available Dr.
not_available Okida likes the temperature to be 67 degrees.
not_available Got the Oneg running? 
not_available Two lines, wide open.
not_available What's the story? 
not_available Kid was down 20 minutes.
not_available I called it.
not_available Peter's now playing God.
not_available He was out in the cold.
not_available He's started, might as well finish.
not_available The kid is dead.
not_available He was my patient.
not_available I assessed him as unsalvageable.
not_available He's not just your patient, Doug.
not_available High
not_available dose epi.
not_available Start internal massage.
not_available Like this? Anything? 
not_available Still flatline.
not_available He jumped.
not_available He's got a rhythm.
not_available That's the epi, not his heart.
not_available That's more than the epi.
not_available You got him back.
not_available His heart's back.
not_available His head's dead.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Call the O.R.
not_available Tell them we're on our way.
not_available Here we go, people.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Thanks, Haleh.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Hello, Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available What's the matter, ERay? 
not_available I just don't feel like myself.
not_available Fever? No, but I had an MRI yesterday on my shoulder.
not_available An old conga injury.
not_available And ever since I just feel off.
not_available Could it be radiation sickness? MRIs aren't radioactive.
not_available They just scramble your electrons a bit.
not_available Forever? 
not_available No, just for a few seconds.
not_available That's odd.
not_available My watch stopped.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available What? My watch stopped last night.
not_available Right after the MRI.
not_available And the toaster.
not_available What toaster? 
not_available My toaster.
not_available It shorted out this morning.
not_available I've had that toaster for 10 years.
not_available Could the MRI have rearranged my molecules, causing me to radiate some sort of bizarre electronic interference? No.
not_available Follow the light with your eyes.
not_available What light? That's funny.
not_available What have we got? and pulmonary artery.
not_available Got his heart back in the ER.
not_available Down time? 
not_available 15 minutes.
not_available Closer to 20.
not_available But he was out in the cold, so we can save his brain.
not_available Giving odds? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene agreed to keep trying.
not_available This could take all day.
not_available He's bleeding from the belly.
not_available I'd go for a midline incision.
not_available I thought I was supposed to observe.
not_available I'll make an exception.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available All right.
not_available Mark 9:35 as start time.
not_available Mark, we've got a 10foot
not_available fall.
not_available Where from? A tree.
not_available Taking pictures in Grant Park.
not_available Dizzy? Nauseous? 
not_available Dizzy, yes.
not_available Nauseous, no.
not_available What were you taking pictures of? 
not_available Birds.
not_available Haven't they gone south? 
not_available Not the ones I'm interested in.
not_available Seems okay to me.
not_available Why don't you take her to Curtain Area 2? 
not_available Susan.
not_available Hi.
not_available You want to go out tonight? Yes, sure.
not_available I'd love to.
not_available But I can't.
not_available I have something planned.
not_available So you can't.
not_available I guess not.
not_available Maybe some other time.
not_available Sure.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis? Dr.
not_available Morgenstern is on the line.
not_available I'll call you tonight.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Percy.
not_available We need Mr.
not_available Percy? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Percy? 
not_available Who's there? It's Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I take it you have some reservations about the surgery.
not_available Do you have change for the candy machine? You can't eat with the tumor in your throat.
not_available Eloise put a Hershey bar in the blender, and I drank it.
not_available Do you know that you're about to have an operation? There's no blender here.
not_available I asked.
not_available Has someone gone over the risks with you? Another time, she blended up Snickers.
not_available The trouble was that the nougat got caught in the straw.
not_available You ever have a Zagnut? 
not_available I love Zagnuts.
not_available They're my favorites.
not_available Mine too.
not_available Mr.
not_available Percy, do you want to have this operation? Can I just have change for the candy machine? Is it ready? 
not_available Not quite.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Mixing an enema.
not_available "White and brown." 
not_available Milk and molasses.
not_available Did a doctor order this? 
not_available I know when it's needed.
not_available We give people an enema in a box.
not_available We don't spend time mixing up a recipe.
not_available I do.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available I'll take over.
not_available Change the beds in Exam 4.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available I'm the charge nurse.
not_available I don't want a new nurse.
not_available You're in luck.
not_available You can go home.
not_available Where are your clothes? Hello.
not_available Your CT is fine.
not_available I don't see any birds in here.
not_available I let you in on a secret.
not_available I'm more than just a bird watcher.
not_available I'm a comparative anthropologist doing field study on the mating rituals of man and bird.
not_available Sounds interesting.
not_available Yes.
not_available Take those two over there.
not_available Notice the occasional lateral
not_available body contact initiated by her, and then reciprocated by him.
not_available Identical to the courtship dance of the sharp
not_available tailed grouse.
not_available Check out the two at the desk.
not_available Do you see how he puffs his chest and strokes his goatee? Same as the slender
not_available billed shearwater.
not_available Look at that! What? Her frontal
not_available neck presentation.
not_available What does that mean? In the nuthatch, it's an invitation to love.
not_available She is shameless! See how she strokes her throat with her finger? The spoonbill would bend over and shake her tail feathers in his face.
not_available I need some moist lap pads to pack off the liver.
not_available Bad news for the gallbladder.
not_available A bullet tore through the common duct.
not_available What's your plan? Pack and stitch off liver put in 3 or 4 Jackson
not_available Pratts, move on to the gallbladder.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available I'd love to stay, but I have a cystic hygroma.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Maxwell available to supervise? He's resecting a bowel, but Dr.
not_available Breedlove is around.
not_available Breedlove would be perfect.
not_available 3.0 on a needle.
not_available Let's move! Did my blood test come back? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Damn.
not_available The computer just went down.
not_available Why don't you have a seat right there? Here's your aftercare, your prescription and your enema.
not_available Instructions are inside.
not_available I know all about them.
not_available Someone from the home will be here any minute.
not_available I'll believe that when I see it.
not_available Mark, what are you doing? 
not_available Do you see what I see? Susan's talking to Morgenstern.
not_available So what? He's stroking himself, puffing out his chest like a slender
not_available billed something.
not_available She's giving him full frontal neck.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available You'd know if you were a nuthatch.
not_available Mark, are you okay? 
not_available She turned me down.
not_available Susan? 
not_available Now I know why.
not_available Oh, God! She's stroking her neck.
not_available So? Why doesn't she just bend over and shake her tail feathers in his face? 
not_available Did you consent Mr.
not_available Percy? 
not_available Yes, why? He couldn't reiterate the risks to me.
not_available He only wants to talk about chocolate.
not_available He's just in denial.
not_available This is a high
not_available risk procedure on a guy that can't carry a conversation.
not_available He signed the consent.
not_available He's not qualified to make decisions.
not_available Let's get a shrink down here.
not_available You want to delay the surgery because you aren't comfortable with the patient's mental status? I'll get a stat Psych consult.
not_available If he agrees with me, I'll tell Anspaugh.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Doug tried to explain things and the guy just went bozo.
not_available It's a scratch on his finger! 
not_available A serious infection.
not_available Who are you to tell me what to do? 
not_available I'm his doctor.
not_available The boy has an infected human bite.
not_available The father refuses to let me treat him.
not_available It's a free country.
not_available We want to go.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Can I see the x
not_available ray? The infection could be in the joint.
not_available Let me see you guys outside.
not_available We'll be right with you.
not_available He could loose his finger.
not_available There's no signs of osteomyelitis.
not_available The dad won't come back with him.
not_available IV is the best way to go.
not_available But we shouldn't call the police if he can be treated with oral antibiotics.
not_available Fine.
not_available You do what you want.
not_available Psych consult come down? 
not_available Still waiting.
not_available Time's up.
not_available Mr.
not_available Percy.
not_available Do you want to go through with this surgery or not? Can I have change for the candy machine? Art line in? 
not_available It's in.
not_available Let's take him, Oki.
not_available Okey
not_available dokey.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, the patient is more interested in candy than surgery.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available You can have all the candy you want when the tumor is out.
not_available Coming, John? 
not_available I'm due for my break.
not_available We don't take scheduled breaks.
not_available It's in the contract.
not_available Is a little flexibility too much to ask? Whose patient is she? She's been discharged to her nursing home.
not_available They won't take her.
not_available She just had an accident.
not_available The loose, runny kind that makes a puddle on the floor.
not_available I believe the mop is over there.
not_available More O
not_available chromic on a liver needle.
not_available Cut.
not_available Box! You Benton? Sam Breedlove.
not_available Where are we? Finished pneumonectomy.
not_available Almost done with liver.
not_available Gallbladder to go.
not_available Take wider bites, and don't tie so tight.
not_available More 3.0 Vicryl.
not_available Good stuff, Vicryl.
not_available Closest thing to catgut.
not_available Surgeons still use that? Not these days.
not_available It's a shame.
not_available Nothing ties like catgut.
not_available Got a bleeder.
not_available Is it new? Where is it coming from? 
not_available Aorta.
not_available We got a pumper.
not_available Put your finger on it! 
not_available Statinski.
not_available I got it.
not_available Clamps here.
not_available Clamps.
not_available Still falling.
not_available D Ábride hole and sew.
not_available Vascular needle now.
not_available Internal paddles.
not_available Charging 20.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still in fib.
not_available Charging 30.
not_available No change.
not_available Charging 40.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still at it? 
not_available Lot of work to save an organ donor.
not_available Wait! Lost it.
not_available Charging 40.
not_available Clear.
not_available Charging.
not_available Clear! 50.
not_available Susan and Morgenstern? 
not_available It makes sense.
not_available She's been preoccupied lately, distracted, avoiding me.
not_available I did see her and Morgenstern having lunch the other day.
not_available See? I waited too long.
not_available That's my chance.
not_available Blew it.
not_available Can't believe we got him back.
not_available Kid's got good protoplasm.
not_available Set him up for an apnea test.
not_available See if he's got any brain left.
not_available Do you think he's got a chance? 
not_available He's made it this far.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? The boy's mother.
not_available Do you want to talk to her? Not yet.
not_available I want to assess his brain function first.
not_available I will talk to her.
not_available Don't get her hopes up.
not_available How's the Herlihy baby? 
not_available Still alive the last time I checked.
not_available My foot! Sal Urbanski.
not_available Playing football in the street, went for man in Buick.
not_available Right foot ripped off at the ankle.
not_available In shock.
not_available Lost a liter at the scene.
not_available Where's the foot? 
not_available Between his legs.
not_available Why is he holding a football? 
not_available It's his lucky ball.
not_available Let's get 6 units O
not_available neg, CBC, type and cross.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Get his foot on ice.
not_available Someone call Vascular and page the Reimplantation team.
not_available Stand by with morphine, 4 mgs.
not_available The pressure dressing isn't working.
not_available I need a thigh cuff.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oki is freeing up the esophagus posteriorly with his fingers.
not_available Dale, you're in a position to displace it laterally.
not_available I can free it up anteriorly.
not_available You stick to suction, Carter.
not_available I can feel it coming loose.
not_available Suction.
not_available Suction! As Oki cuts along sternocleidomastoid down towards the carotid sheath what should he watch out for? Not to nick any arteries? Dale? 
not_available The vagus nerve that runs through the sheath.
not_available Very good.
not_available Dale is smart.
not_available Those little bubbles on the lung normal? Those little bubbles there, where Dale just moved the esophagus.
not_available You tore the lung pleura.
not_available I didn't feel it tear.
not_available Congratulations, you've just given Mr.
not_available Percy a pneumothorax.
not_available I can put in a chest tube.
not_available Yes, do that now.
not_available Dale, can you hold this for me, please? Scalpel.
not_available Chest tube.
not_available Thirty
not_available two French.
not_available Scissors.
not_available Got it.
not_available That was a nice catch, Carter.
not_available Where is my suction? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Give me the football, sir.
not_available Don't lose it.
not_available Ditka signed it.
not_available I'll put it with your clothes.
not_available BP down to 60.
not_available Let's get another line going.
not_available Start the rapid infuser.
not_available Someone called for a vascular surgeon? 
not_available It's about time.
not_available Don't get fresh with me, lassie.
not_available Ice is here.
not_available Put it on the foot.
not_available I'm in trouble.
not_available Can't find a vein? 
not_available No.
not_available Itchy in my mush.
not_available Your mustache? Would you be so kind? Left side, near my nose.
not_available That's my spot.
not_available That's my spot.
not_available Want me to help you? 
not_available No.
not_available Susan's got it.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Hook it up.
not_available Let's get him upstairs.
not_available The Reimplantion team awaits.
not_available Have we got the foot? 
not_available Right here.
not_available See you later.
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, the boy's mother wanted to watch.
not_available I said I had to come and ask you.
not_available All right.
not_available Tell her to come in.
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available Dorset.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I took him off the ventilator to test if his brain'll trigger him to breathe.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Lf we see your son take a breath that means that his brain functions are intact.
not_available If there's no attempt to breathe in, that's a sign of brain death.
not_available PCO
not_available 2 is 60.
not_available It's high enough to make him breathe.
not_available How long will it take? We'll know in 10 seconds.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You wanted to see me? Yes, I did.
not_available How many shifts do you work a week? Four? 
not_available Usually.
not_available As long as we don't work the same four, we'll get along great.
not_available Is this about the kid's finger? 
not_available You don't respect my decisions.
not_available You can't take professional differences personal.
not_available It is personal.
not_available You have been Mr.
not_available Moral since I came in with that OD.
not_available What do you expect when you drag your dirty laundry through the door? But it's not personal, right? Who are you kidding? Mrs.
not_available Urbanski, the surgeons are trying to reattach your husbands foot.
not_available But is he all right? 
not_available He lost blood, but he will be fine.
not_available Here's his stuff.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He seemed concerned about his Mike Ditka football.
not_available He loves the Bears.
not_available I'll find someone to bring you up.
not_available Wendy? Can you bring Mrs.
not_available Urbanski up to Surgery for me? How are we doing? 
not_available Ready when you are.
not_available Let's bring in the foot.
not_available What the hell? Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
not_available In and out in two hours.
not_available Oki's amazing.
not_available I'm glad you invited me along.
not_available I'm glad we did.
not_available Otherwise we might not have seen the pneumothorax.
not_available Want to eat before my flight? 
not_available Lf you're buying.
not_available Why don't you join us, Carter? Edson, monitor Mr.
not_available Percy in Recovery.
not_available It was an honest mistake.
not_available It was incompetent.
not_available And because you didn't ice it, it can't be reattached.
not_available Please don't write me up.
not_available Lf anyone deserves that, it's you.
not_available Do the dirty work for them.
not_available That's what they want.
not_available Whose dirty work? Hospital Administration.
not_available I'm nine months from getting maximum pension.
not_available That's why I'm sent where I don't know what I'm doing.
not_available They want to get rid of people like me to get cheaper aides.
not_available If they know the difference between a football and a foot, I'll take them.
not_available I will not let you put me through the humiliation of a review board.
not_available Not after 22 years.
not_available Watch me.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available I quit.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton says that her oxygen level is as low as it can go.
not_available It's only a matter of time.
not_available Thank you for everything you have done for Megan.
not_available What happened to the float? 
not_available She quit, thank God.
not_available She said that Admin tried to make her quit before her pension maxed out.
not_available That's why she was floated down here.
not_available She gave me the same line.
not_available They're floating me to Neuro.
not_available What? Starting tomorrow, the hospital's floating me there three times a week.
not_available When does your pension max out? 
not_available In a year.
not_available So maybe it was personal.
not_available Go ahead and say it.
not_available I'm a sanctimonious judgmental, self
not_available righteous, sexually frustrated, little man.
not_available You're not little.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I hate to think that my personal pique could color my professional decisions.
not_available But it happens.
not_available And it probably happened today.
not_available You don't need to beat me up about making a mess out of my life.
not_available I like to do that myself.
not_available That may not be the healthiest approach.
not_available I'm seeing a shrink.
not_available That's a good step.
not_available Man or a woman? 
not_available Woman.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She's 62 years old.
not_available Freudian? Sorry, I couldn't resist.
not_available I hate you.
not_available You know that? I know.
not_available When a whippoorwi// ca//s And the evening is nigh I hurry to my blue heaven You'// see a smiling face A fireplace, a cozy room A /ittle nest that's nestled By a clear rose's bloom Just Mo//y and me And baby makes three We're happy in my blue heaven Take it, Oki.
not_available Rough day? You knew it would be, didn't you? 
not_available I had an idea.
not_available I did exactly what you said.
not_available Rushed ahead, didn't think.
not_available Did you actually believe that you could save that boy? I never worked so hard or performed more surgery than I did today.
not_available When I took that vent off, I actually thought that kid would breathe.
not_available Did you check on the Herlihy baby? Couple of hours ago.
not_available I can't face those parents.
not_available You should check on her before you go.
not_available The guy walks in the room, and every vending machine goes kaput.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Jerry, I've got the keys.
not_available Are we going through with this? 
not_available Yes, I'm desperate.
not_available You are nuts.
not_available MRIs don't cause negative force fields.
not_available I think we better take the stairs.
not_available Dale, my hale and hearty friend, today was a blast.
not_available Not bad.
not_available Too bad Mr.
not_available Percy stroked out.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available Didn't you hear? Went to check on him, and he couldn't even talk.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available No.
not_available Nothing left to do but turn and water him.
not_available Shame you backed off on that Psych consult.
not_available You could've saved his life.
not_available You smug son of a bitch! What the hell is going on here? We were just discussing the finer points of informed consent.
not_available What is wrong with you guys? She and Morgenstern are going out.
not_available I can live with that.
not_available What bothers me is that she didn't tell me about it.
not_available If I was going out with Morgenstern, I wouldn't tell anybody.
not_available Susan and I are supposed to be friends.
not_available How did this happen? How serious is it? 
not_available Ask her.
not_available Do you want me to go to her and say, "What's up with you and Morgenstern?" 
not_available That would be one way.
not_available That's not my style.
not_available Mark, you might want to think about changing your style.
not_available Okay, E
not_available Ray.
not_available What's that key sequence? Control, AQ
not_available R, and then push the pound key.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Someone's coming.
not_available Close the door.
not_available Okay, here goes.
not_available Control, AQ
not_available R, pound.
not_available Good job, Jerry.
not_available Don't leave me too long.
not_available Fifteen minutes should be enough.
not_available This Radiology tech stuff isn't so hard.
not_available I can feel the difference.
not_available I'm me again.
not_available Now turn it off.
not_available What's the sequence for that? Isn't there a switch? Which one? 
not_available There should be a kill switch.
not_available A big, red button.
not_available What about this? Oh, my God! Jerry, what are you doing? I don't know! What are you doing? I don't know! Pull the plug! Oh, my God! 
not_available Pull the plug! Medicine is supposed to be a noble profession, not a motorcycle club.
not_available Why were you fighting? 
not_available It was stupid, Dr.
not_available Keaton.
not_available Abby.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available There was a patient scheduled for high
not_available risk surgery.
not_available Clearly not compos mentis.
not_available And I knew that I should've called the Psych consult down to clear him.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available I was too afraid of pissing off the surgeons to speak up.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He stroked out.
not_available He should never have had the surgery.
not_available And I knew it.
not_available At least you care about your patients.
not_available A lot of surgeons don't.
not_available They don't? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton 
not_available Abby.
not_available Abby.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available It's Mark.
not_available I just called you.
not_available Are you alone? So I'll make this easy.
not_available I know about you and Morgenstern.
not_available You do? How long have you been seeing each other? You mean as in "going out"? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Mark, we're not.
not_available You're not? Are you sure? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you seeing anybody? Maybe we should sit down.
not_available Morgenstern has been helping me get my transcripts together.
not_available I'm leaving my Residency.
not_available You're quitting? 
not_available Transferring.
not_available Where? Phoenix.
not_available When I was there visiting Chloe and Susie I just got this feeling, like this is where I'm supposed to be now.
not_available And I don't really have anything here in Chicago.
not_available I mean 
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available And after I've decided, I just feel happy.
not_available For the first time in a long time.
not_available I'm finally moving on with my life.
not_available That's great.
not_available God.
not_available So you're sure? Yes, I am.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm going to miss you.
not_available I'm going to miss you too.
not_available Kit, is the pulseox monitor right? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available What did you do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available About an hour ago, she just started getting better.
not_available It's a miracle.
