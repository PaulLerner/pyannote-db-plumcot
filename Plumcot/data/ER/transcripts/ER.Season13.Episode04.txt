Previously on ER Are you loving motherhood? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, this isn't awkward? 
not_available What ? That you and I are equals now? Dr.
not_available Crenshaw is our new chief resident.
not_available Neela Rasgotra.
not_available Two years in the ER, then defected.
not_available It took you that long to figure out you were wasting your time? 
not_available I'm your daddy.
not_available What's up? How's the new intern doing? 
not_available She's very, uh, devoted.
not_available Thank you, Jesus.
not_available Were you the best one there? How many people did you save? Did you rock? Next time you don't do what I tell you to do, or any other attending tells you to do, you're gonna find yourself getting bum
not_available rushed right out of this program.
not_available You don't even appreciate the fact that I took the time and money to go out and buy you some new clothes.
not_available I didn't ask you to do that.
not_available No, because you'd rather go to school dressed like a bag lady.
not_available Would you rather I dressed like a slut?! Because that's how most of the other girls dress.
not_available I'd rather you dressed like someone that has a mother that cares about her.
not_available Tony, would you please say something? 
not_available Good morning.
not_available What's wrong with the way I dress? She won't even try on the clothes I bought for her.
not_available Those are nice.
not_available They're ugly, and I refuse to conform to some anorexic, media
not_available fueled ideal of beauty.
not_available That's fine, but you're not leaving the house dressed like that.
not_available Tony? I hate living here! We never resolved the nanny issue.
not_available Do you really want someone else raising our child? Well, I'm just talking about a few hours a week so I can at least get some stuff done around here.
not_available Oh, I thought we had agreed to stagger our shifts.
not_available Well, and what, never see each other? I mean, even if that was practical, after your first day alone, you'd be begging for help, trust me.
not_available Mm.
not_available I think I can handle it.
not_available Well, if you can handle it so well, help me get Joe in the car, will you ? We're late for our first Mommy and Baby class.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available What? I thought it would be fun for What? I didn't say anything.
not_available What? I'm late for work.
not_available Bye.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Don't forget his frog.
not_available I know.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh.
not_available Can you say "Daddy is a butthead," hmm? Why is your daddy a butthead? 
not_available I look like a dork.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available This is not my style, and this is not me.
not_available If you didn't like what your mother bought you, ask her to go shopping.
not_available Then you guys buy something together.
not_available What are you doing? Damage control.
not_available Sarah What? 
not_available This is not cool.
not_available Do you mind? I'm changing.
not_available I hope your mother doesn't find out about this.
not_available She won't.
not_available And besides, you don't know what it's like for girls my age these days.
not_available There is a lot of pressure at school.
not_available What you wear, what you eat, what you don't eat.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Who ? This is obviously about a guy.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Maybe I should dress like a hussy.
not_available Maybe we should get you a plaid jacket.
not_available We'll just tell everyone you're a lesbian.
not_available Adam.
not_available Huh? Adam Horner, but he doesn't even look at me.
not_available Well, good.
not_available I don't want some guy named Horndog anywhere near you.
not_available It's Horner.
not_available Listen, most guys are jerks, but if you want this guy Okay, wait a minute.
not_available You're a guy.
not_available Exactly, and if you want this guy to notice you, forget about your clothes and ignore him.
not_available That's your advice? 
not_available Yup.
not_available Ignore him? 
not_available Yup, that's right.
not_available Wow.
not_available You really suck at this.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Most guys want what they can't have.
not_available You ignore him, that guy'll come running to you, all right? Try not to kill anyone today.
not_available Bye.
not_available He's out.
not_available All right.
not_available Hope you're going to take a deep breath, and you're going to hold it.
not_available Now, if you don't get the tube in by the time you run out of air, we're gonna stop, and we're gonna bag.
not_available Okay? Are you ready? With you and Jesus guiding my hand, I am.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay, sweep the tongue to the side and advance until you're in the vallecula.
not_available Elevate the scope at a 45
not_available degree angle.
not_available See the cords? All right, I'll give you some cricoid pressure.
not_available How's that? Come on, Hope.
not_available The cords should be right there.
not_available He's a young guy.
not_available All right, pull up more, but do not rock back against the teeth.
not_available Aim the end of the handle to where the wall meets the ceiling.
not_available Can you see the aryepiglottic folds? Hello?! Sats are dropping.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Whoa.
not_available All right, pull out.
not_available You bag, you breathe.
not_available I'm sorry I ran If you were doing what I told you to do, you should have been able to pass the tube.
not_available Come on.
not_available Maybe you should sit down.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't feel so good.
not_available Uh, I'm in.
not_available Here, that should keep you from swelling.
not_available Oh, bless you, Sam.
not_available What happened to her? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Damn, it's only the morning test.
not_available What are you doing with the transport beeper? I gave that to Jane.
not_available You know, I don't think she really wanted it, so I offered.
not_available You can't monopolize the beeper, Ray.
not_available The other residents need the experience, too.
not_available She gets airsick.
not_available Hey, what's going on with your rhabdomyolysis guy? 
not_available He's pretty stable.
not_available He's making urine.
not_available What about his creatinine? 
not_available I'd have to check the chart.
not_available Peak CPK? Medicine team's all over it.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available You got to be all over it.
not_available You cannot let the internal med docs take over your patient's care.
not_available I can't? 
not_available Hey, I'm serious, man.
not_available You've got critical patients.
not_available You got to stay on top of the labs.
not_available I know, but the guy was ready to hand off, and I And what? 
not_available And that was a great talk.
not_available What the hell's going on with the PACS system? Down again.
not_available They said they should have it running in an hour, but they've been saying that since yesterday.
not_available So, is it true? 
not_available Rumor is you killed an intern.
not_available Yeah, I wish.
not_available You know, everything in this place is crap.
not_available The equipment sucks; the students are incompetent; the interns can't finish a chart; the residents
not_available they don't give a damn about their patient Yeah, okay, okay, Kovac.
not_available I see what you're going to say.
not_available That I was the same way, right? But I wasn't.
not_available I didn't say anything.
not_available Yeah, I could chart, I could clear beds, 
not_available and I never passed out tubing a patient.
not_available I know, you were really, really special.
not_available You need to go through in
not_available service exam results with your residents.
not_available Have you seen these? See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
not_available They don't know jack about emergency medicine.
not_available Solomon is an idiot, Hope is annoying and incompetent, Gates should have stayed a paramedic, and Jane is like What's wrong with Jane? She is good.
not_available No, Jane is creepy, I'm serious.
not_available She's always sneaking up on me.
not_available She's like those twins in The Shining.
not_available Look, in
not_available service shows you their strengths and weaknesses, so focus on that.
not_available They all have their own learning process, so you need to adjust accordingly.
not_available If the residents fail, it may be because you're a bad teacher.
not_available Down on two, up on three, and mommies let go! Good.
not_available Everyone pick up their babies.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm sorry I'm late.
not_available I'm Abby, and, uh, this is Joe.
not_available Um, am
not_available am I in the right place? This is the, uh, Mommy and Baby class? Yes.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Good.
not_available Well, uh I'm a mommy and, uh and this is a baby.
not_available Uh, yeah, being suspended by his crotch.
not_available Excuse me? You're carrying your child in a device that can cause hip luxation and spinal injury.
not_available He should be in a sling.
not_available Oh, well, you know, I'm a doctor, um, and Then you'd think she'd know better.
not_available She is sitting right here.
not_available Well, um, then you should know that
not_available a happy, healthy baby is always carried in a sling.
not_available Well, I do know that if you dress your baby like some sort of designer accessory, you're headed for problems.
not_available But don't worry.
not_available I work in the ER, so I'll be there to take care of her when she comes in 14, pregnant, 
not_available with a drug overdose.
not_available Maybe this isn't the best class for you.
not_available Thank you so much for the lunch tray, Archie.
not_available I particularly enjoyed the bread pudding.
not_available Oh, you're welcome, Emma.
not_available That's one of my favorites, too.
not_available Ah, the return of Goat Boy.
not_available I heard one of the doctors made a charm bracelet from all they took from his belly.
not_available Okay, here's what we 
got stable CHF, going to tele.
not_available had levaquin.
not_available Incomplete miscarriage.
not_available Do a repeat pelvic in an hour to see if 
not_available everything passed and the os is closed.
not_available Wait a minute, wait a minute.
not_available What the hell are these? Pass
not_available ons.
not_available Oh, and her BP's a little low, like 90 systolic.
not_available It's up with two liters, and her crit was 24.
not_available She's typeand
not_available crossed for transfusion? No, but that's a that's a good idea.
not_available Do that, totally.
not_available Twoyear
not_available old with possible meningitis.
not_available Ceftriaxone on board.
not_available Currently at CT, needs an LP when he gets back.
not_available Morris, we do not sign out spinal taps.
not_available Since when? Wait a minute, wait a minute.
not_available Hold on.
not_available These aren't pass
not_available ons.
not_available They're train wrecks.
not_available I'm not taking them.
not_available Dude, I can't.
not_available Max has a soccer game.
not_available It's the playoffs.
not_available I promised him I'd be there.
not_available Who? My son.
not_available It's a family thing.
not_available Yeah, his family even know about you yet? No, no, no, no.
not_available We're keeping that on the low
not_available low for now.
not_available You know what I'm saying? Exactly.
not_available Thanks, dog.
not_available Did you just see that? Yup.
not_available He's your dogboy.
not_available Please.
not_available He's not my dog, and he's not my boy.
not_available And we don't use the two together.
not_available I know.
not_available So, you're gonna take one of these? 
not_available Nope.
not_available I have a trauma coming in, and you're not always going to have the luxury of having another attending on shift with you.
not_available You need to learn how to handle these things on your own.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jennings is on his way up to ortho and Lundquist is out of here.
not_available Nice job, Ray.
not_available Here's four more.
not_available Are you kidding me? Is this about the transport beeper? 
not_available The packing is Webril, and we wrap with bias.
not_available We try to keep it tight enough to immobilize, but not to the point of discomfort.
not_available You don't want to cut off circulation.
not_available Salomon you know, you didn't do so hot on the Ortho section of the in
not_available service.
not_available So what's the difference between a Jones and a Dancer fracture? Dancer's a proximal avulsion.
not_available Does great with conservative therapy.
not_available Jones is transverse, a little more distal and you got to keep an eye on this bad boy because there's a good chance of non
not_available union.
not_available Let me 
guess you just had a patient like that? No.
not_available Right.
not_available Come on.
not_available Who's got somebody in Curtain 2? Uh, me, sir.
not_available 48yearold 
not_available PSVT resolved with adenosine.
not_available Excuse me, doctor.
not_available Is your boss still here? Excuse me.
not_available I need to speak with Archie.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris is not my boss and I'm afraid he's gone for the day.
not_available Is there something I can help you with? No.
not_available Jane, you need to focus on cardiology.
not_available What are the options with a hemodynamically stable wide complex tachyarrhythmia? 
not_available Lidocaine if you think V tach.
not_available What else? Amiodarone.
not_available Okay, I'm guessing Amiodarone.
not_available Well, Procainamide and Amio can do the trick, but you want to stay away from beta and calcium blockers 'cause you'll end up with V fib if you have a bypass tract.
not_available Right? So how'd you manage to fail every subsection of the in
not_available service exam? I guess I just don't test well.
not_available Well, you better start.
not_available Come on.
not_available Have you got something to present? No.
not_available Actually I started with Dr.
not_available Kovac Where are your charts? Let me see them.
not_available Well, I'm still working on them.
not_available I told you to keep them current.
not_available You got to do them as you go.
not_available What part of this concept don't you understand? Fiveyear
not_available old with crush injury to abdomen.
not_available He and grandpa were chopping down a tree.
not_available They're bringing grandfather with chainsaw injuries.
not_available All right, I got it.
not_available Keep working up your patients and grab a couple more charts.
not_available Where do you think you're going? 
not_available Chainsaw injuries can be gnarly.
not_available No, no, you need to finish with the patients you've got before you do anything else.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Hi, I'm Katey Evans
not_available medical student.
not_available Dr.
not_available Crenshaw told me to shadow you today.
not_available He did? I got the feeling I was getting on his nerves.
not_available He gives that impression to everyone.
not_available Hey, Katey.
not_available Friend of yours? Hardly.
not_available We went out a couple times.
not_available It didn't work out.
not_available Too bad.
not_available He's cute.
not_available Cute, but he's way too into himself and to be honest, he's orally challenged.
not_available Oh, bad breath? Not exactly
not_available he won't go south of 14th Street.
not_available You know He refuses to dine at the Y? Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available This is what I'm talking about.
not_available Making friends and saving lives.
not_available Does it get any better than this, ladies? No, it does not.
not_available So, Mrs.
not_available Draper is back for her 27th hospital admission.
Status postpancreatic pseudocyst.
not_available 27th? Yes.
not_available Someone needs to tell her the hospital stopped giving out frequent flier miles.
not_available Oh, and she's a chronic rectal discomfort.
not_available And you two get to work her up and review her old charts.
not_available All 27? No.
not_available Why don't you forget all about visits six, 13 and, um what do you think, 21? Yeah, that should keep it interesting.
not_available It'll be like playing patient roulette.
not_available Be prepared to present her at afternoon rounds.
not_available Smiles all around.
not_available Maybe he should use his extensive surgical skills to remove that bug from his ass.
not_available Oh, saved by the bell.
not_available We're paged to the ER.
not_available I'm so glad I'm not doing an ER rotation.
not_available I have heard horror stories.
not_available Oh, it's not so bad
not_available once you get used to the smell.
not_available The line is good to go.
not_available Pressure's only 85 after the bolus.
not_available How much O
not_available neg? Chest and pelvis films are back.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Sam, your son's school called.
not_available Said he never showed up for homeroom.
not_available First hemoglobin is 9.8.
not_available What? I dropped him off this morning.
not_available Type and cross four units.
not_available He's losing a ton of blood.
not_available Crush injury? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Unstable pelvis.
not_available Open book fracture with complete SI joint disruption and lateral displacement.
not_available I've got the T
not_available POD.
not_available How's the belly? Spleen is okay.
not_available Looks like a small liver lac.
not_available So he goes to angio first? For embolization.
not_available Hypotension and pelvic fracture has a 50% mortality.
not_available Blood at the meatus.
not_available Probably tore his urethra, 
not_available but that'll have to wait.
not_available Along with his liver.
not_available If they can stop the pelvic bleeders in angio, he might make it to the OR.
not_available Okay, bring blood, FFP, and get him on a portable monitor.
not_available It wasn't a very big tree.
not_available It was only about eight inches in diameter.
not_available I was just finishing the cut when the chainsaw broke Ow! Sorry about that, Mr.
not_available King.
not_available We're going to get you really numbed up right now.
not_available Another five of lido to me.
not_available How we doing in here? 
not_available He's pretty lucky.
not_available Most of these wounds look superficial.
not_available I'm just going to clean and close.
not_available How's my grandson? His injuries are 
serious he's bleeding internally, but he's hanging in there.
not_available Can I see him? 
not_available Not right now.
not_available We're taking him upstairs and we're going to try to stop the bleeding, okay? You good down here if I go up to angio with him? Yeah.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Go.
not_available Okay.
not_available I was being so careful.
not_available I thought he was safe.
not_available Don't worry, sir.
not_available We're doing everything we can to help him.
not_available Are you almost finished in here? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? I could really use your help in Curtain 2.
not_available You've got to be a little bit more specific, Ray.
not_available Morris' little old UTI lady, the one that's just "waiting for a ride," has a systolic of 55.
not_available Damn it, Morris.
not_available All right, here, keep irrigating and set up another suture kit.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available and gram
not_available negative rods on the UA.
not_available Morris said she was tucked, nothing to do.
not_available I guess he lied.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tachy after two liters, he should have seen this coming.
not_available Access? 
not_available PIV, we're working on another.
not_available Here.
not_available Rennie Stevens, welding tank explosion.
not_available Secondand third
not_available degree burns over chest, face, and arms.

not_available Other one? Luis Escobar, 23, shrapnel to neck and left chest.
not_available Vitals stable, good breath sounds.
not_available All right.
not_available I better page an attending.
not_available I am an attending.
not_available I got this.
not_available Put him in Trauma Two.
not_available Jane! You're with Haleh.
not_available Solomon, you're with me.
not_available Come on, Trauma One.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Ray, titrate dopamine and mix up levophed if she doesn't respond to 10 mikes.
not_available Alex, where are you? No, you're not.
not_available Don't lie to me.
not_available The school called the hospital.
not_available Yeah, well, you got ten minutes to get your butt back to Solomon, help Sam make some room.
not_available Please give me something for the pain! All right, another five of morphine.
not_available Hang tough, Mr.
not_available Stevens.
not_available We're going to help you.
not_available Start a second line with two liters of LR, wide open.
not_available Full thickness over the entire chest.
not_available I'll alert the burn unit.
not_available Sats down to 83.
not_available Okay, listen to me very closely, Mr.
not_available Stevens.

not_available Escobar.
not_available That's it, Max.
not_available That's it.
not_available Hustle! Go, Stuart, stay with him.
not_available Come on, Max, come on.
not_available You take this guy.
not_available If you can't go around him, you go through him! 
not_available Hey, come on, man.
not_available What? You're not setting a good example.
not_available That's it.
not_available Nice, nice, buddy.
not_available You're killing them out there.
not_available Who is that with your son? I don't know.
not_available Excuse me, Coach? Who's Max talking to? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available He said he was a friend.
not_available Chest x
not_available ray on Escobar.
not_available All right, pneumothorax on the left.
not_available Set up for a chest tube.
not_available I'll be right over.
not_available We're having a hard time finding a second line.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, he's bradying down! 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Try a saphenous.
not_available If that doesn't work, we'll go central.
not_available Right.
not_available Heart rate's in the 40s! I need to put a tube in your chest to re
not_available expand your lung, Mr.
not_available Escobar.
not_available Need any help in here? 
not_available Push 50 mikes of fentanyl.
not_available What's going on with Morris' patient? 
not_available Uh, I think she's doing okay.
not_available I handed her off to Gates.
not_available Gates? You left her with Gates? 
not_available Yeah, he's all over it.
not_available All right, you're going to feel some pressure here, okay? Gates is an intern, Ray.
not_available Who's supervising him? I guess, officially, you are.
not_available Jane, find out what's going on with Gates.
not_available I'm not having any luck with the ABG.
not_available Angle the needle at 45 degrees.
not_available I can't see.
not_available My glasses keep fogging.
not_available Well, maybe next time, you should leave the hazmat uniform at home.
not_available Feel for the pulse.
not_available You see that? 
not_available Yo, Doc.
not_available Your sheet metal guy in Exam 3 lost his foot pulse.
not_available Nurses can't get his leg out.

not_available I'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available Someone grab me a central line kit.

not_available Are we going to get in trouble? 
not_available No, this lady is in trouble.

not_available God, give us the strength and the knowledge to help save this sweet woman.
not_available Hallelujah to that, sister.
not_available Good embolization of the superior gluteals and pudendal arteries.
not_available That ought to buy you a little time.
not_available Pressure's back down to 60.
not_available Another 400 of PRBCs.

not_available One, two, three.
not_available Mig of atropine and squeeze in the blood.
not_available Want me to continue bagging? No, see what they need in the ER.
not_available I've got this.
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available Mommy and Baby was a freak show.
not_available So we're headed to the park and I thought maybe even if you only had a couple minutes, you might want to come by and say hi.
not_available I'm going to look for some normal moms, so we'll be here for a while.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can I sit here? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Yo no quiero perder mi trabajo pero si mi jefa se entera, es la primera vez en mi trabajo y yo estoy muy nerviosa, 
not_available yo no se que hacer.
not_available Quisas estas tarde.
not_available Is everything okay? She thinks she's pregnant.
not_available Oh, congratulations.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available No? No, the father is the husband of the woman she works for.
not_available Wow, that's What's she going to do? 
not_available I told her to have an abortion.
not_available That's what I did.
not_available You got pregnant with the husband of the woman you work for, too? It happens.
not_available Los uniqos hombres que no fantasayan con estar con sus nanas son los que ya estan haciendo.
not_available What'd she say? Oh, "The only husbands that don't fantasize about banging their nanny are the ones who are already doing it." It's sort of our nanny motto.
not_available Oh, you're all nannies? Yeah, aren't you? Yes.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available All right, tube's in position, no pneumo.
not_available Vent pressures are almost 50.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Chest wall's restricting lung expansion.
not_available He needs an escharotomy.
not_available Ten blade.
not_available Sats down to 84.
not_available All right, put the vent rate up to 25 and the tidal volume down to 500.

not_available Okay, okay, sats are coming up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We need an attending in here.

not_available All right, I'll be right there.
not_available What's going on with Gates? 
not_available He's asking for a rib spreader.
not_available What the hell would he be doing with a rib spreader? I'm not really sure.
not_available Pratt, what do you want me to do? 
not_available Just a sec.
not_available What's going on out there? Sorry, sorry, we were stuck upstairs.

not_available Never seen him before.
not_available Oh, okay, don't get fancy.
not_available Don't get fancy, just just put it in the net! Put it in the net! Goal! Yes! Baby! That was a rocket, huh?! That's got to hurt, right? Yes! All right! Did you see that?!

not_available Everybody just back up.
not_available Let me do what I have to do and give me They spent about one million dollars on fertility drugs to have this kid.
not_available Look at her; that's not a million
not_available dollar baby.
not_available Right, like, take the hint, lady.
not_available Maybe there's a good reason why Mother Nature doesn't want you having kids of your own.
not_available The woman she works for is a bitch.
not_available She felt sorry for her husband.
not_available He seemed so lonely.
not_available She was always going away with her friends.
not_available And all she did was shop.
not_available My boss has closets full of clothes she never wears.
not_available Which il good for me.
not_available So you wear her clothes? What, you don't? 
not_available No.
not_available You fool around with her husband? 
not_available No.
not_available He's ugly? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh, no, he's he's hot.
not_available He's a doctor.
not_available I worked for some doctors.
not_available They wanted to kids safe so they let me drive the Lexus.
not_available And they went away a lot, so I could always use their apartment.
not_available Which they didn't know about.
not_available Course not.
not_available Course not.
not_available How you feeling, Mr.
not_available King? I was a little woozy there for a bit, but I feel better after my nap.
not_available Bacitracin and a gauze dressing.
not_available These need to come out in seven days.
not_available You know, I could probably take those out myself.
not_available No.
not_available You need to come in for a wound check.
not_available Hey, make sure that guy's X
not_available ray goes up with him to the burn unit.
not_available He's had three liters of fluid and needs seven more in the first eight hours.
not_available Is there any chance I can be with my grandson? I don't think so, but we can get an update on his condition.
not_available CT's back on Escobar.
not_available Grade three splenic lac.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Consent for surgery and he's all yours.
not_available Sorry, but my chief wants to observe him down here for a while.
not_available You just told me he tore his spleen.
not_available With no free blood, and stable crits.
not_available His belly's tender, he's tachycardic, and he'll have other fluid losses through his burn.
not_available The OR's full.
not_available We can't take him right now anyway.
not_available Well, we can't keep him down here.
not_available We're getting slammed and he's tying up a trauma room.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Put him in the ICU.
not_available Crenshaw says we can't use our last bed in ICU.
not_available Hey, that's not Crenshaw's call.
not_available What do you want me to do? I want you to get rid of him.
not_available If his crits are stable for six hours, he can go to telemetry.
not_available Neela Luis Escobar's girlfriend is here.
not_available All right, I got to go find Gates before he kills somebody.
not_available When I get back, that guy better not be here.
not_available Systolic pressure in the 70s after aggressive fluid resuscitation but responded well to a dopamine infusion at 10 mikes per kilo per minute.
not_available What have you been doing? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Central venous oxygen saturation is in target range of 88%.
not_available At this time, patient remains guarded but stable for critical care service.
not_available What is that? 
not_available I'm dictating my notes.
not_available And you're kidding me, right? There's no time for you to send stuff to a transcription service.
not_available I need your notes on the chart now.
not_available Well, I find it so inefficient to write everything down.
not_available Yeah, well, that's how we all do it, so you better figure it out.
not_available And what were you doing with a rib spreader? Well, one of your minor victims from the explosion came in with metal wrapped around his leg.
not_available It was occluding blood flow to the foot, so I used the rib spreader to pull the metal off.
not_available Seemed safer than a blowtorch, right? 
not_available Yeah, right, right, right.
not_available Okay, hold on, hold on, one second, one second, man.
not_available I get it, okay.
not_available You're the cool guy, the paramedic who became a doctor.
not_available And I'm pretty sure that all the residents are eating up your war stories and tales from the street
not_available I don't tell war stories.
not_available But this is the ER.
not_available And we have a way of doing things, a curriculum for shaping young doctors, even you.
not_available Oh, is that what this is about? You feel the need to "shape" me? Why don't you just teach me.
not_available I like the shape I'm in.
not_available I can't teach somebody who thinks they know everything.
not_available What are you talking about? Talking about you running around here unsupervised.
not_available Putting in central lines.
not_available What was I supposed to do? You were busy in a double trauma.
not_available I saved some woman's life and some guy's foot.
not_available And what would have happened if you had messed up on either one? I don't know.
not_available Who would have been responsible for that? Not you.
not_available Me.
not_available It would have been my ass on the line.
not_available So do we have to go through this every damn shift? I don't know.
not_available You going to ride my ass every damn shift? Because you seem to be missing the point here.
not_available I didn't mess up.
not_available That's not the point, and that's your problem.
not_available Who's got the urosepsis case? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available At your service.
not_available Maya Tennyson, Critical Care.
not_available Yeah, excuse me, Dr.
not_available Tennyson, but we're in the middle of some She's still on dopa at 10? She's holding her pressure like a champ.
not_available Hmm, nice work with the early goal
not_available directed therapy.
not_available By the way, I love the dictation.
not_available I can never read anyone's writing down here.
not_available The Bluetooth.
not_available You just speak in this little machine right here and it prints up instantly at the desk.
not_available I like it.
not_available This ER needed an attending with some initiative.
not_available Hey, I'm the attending.
not_available He's an intern.
not_available Well, actually, the Bluetooth was Dr.
not_available Pratt's idea.
not_available I want to see the rest of your charts now.
not_available I bet you do.
not_available Hey, Timmy, do they still put people's names on hats and stuff like that in the gift shop? You know what? I think so.
not_available But if you want to write your name in your underwear or something, man, 
not_available a Sharpie works just as well.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I just need to get a gift for somebody.
not_available What the hell happened to you? I was attacked by ninjas.
not_available What's it look like? Who's this? Obnoxious soccer dad, blunt head trauma with LOC, breathing on his own, normal vitals.
not_available What's open? 
not_available Talk to me, Morris.
not_available Nothing to talk about.
not_available Guy came at me.
not_available I defended myself.
not_available I'm patching him up.
not_available Why'd he come at you? Have you ever been to a kids' soccer game? Those parents are crazy.
not_available I would never do anything to hurt my grandson, Irene.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available What were you thinking? He's only five years old.
not_available He shouldn't be anywhere near a chainsaw.
not_available He wasn't.
not_available Then why is he in surgery? 
not_available Hey, I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Dennis King, this is my wife, Irene.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available We only leave our son with family, just to be safe, and this is how we're rewarded? We're doing everything we can for Thomas.
not_available Why don't I have a nurse take you up so you can be with him when he gets out of surgery? Dennis, Dennis, I'm sorry.
not_available You know I am.
not_available I know, Dad, I know.
not_available I raised my two boys by myself.
not_available Wasn't easy being a single dad back then.
not_available I I don't think I was very good at it.
not_available I thought I could make up for it by being a terrific grandfather, but Looks like I blew that too.
not_available Pratt.
not_available You got a sec? Yeah.
not_available I'll be right back, Mr.
not_available King.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's going on? The police are here for Morris in connection with an assault.
not_available And there are two moms with the cops saying that Morris is a child molester.
not_available What? I got a feeling the white mom's got a boxer's fracture.
not_available What is Morris' problem? Brain damage is the first thing that comes to mind.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Escobar's losing his airway.
not_available Why didn't you intubate prophylactically? His face was spared.
not_available He didn't seem like he had respiratory issues.
not_available Damn, he's already got too much swelling.
not_available Page Crenshaw again.
not_available And get someone from ENT down here.
not_available Sats down to 76.
not_available All right, somebody get me a smaller tube.
not_available A 75, 7
not_available 0.
not_available It's too late for that.
not_available You might need an open trach.
not_available Heart rate is dropping.
not_available Please help him.
not_available He was just talking to me.
not_available Damn, that 7
not_available 0 won't pass.
not_available He needs a trach.
not_available ENT is in OR 2 on a radical neck dissection.
not_available They can't come down right now.
not_available ENT needs to be here.
not_available Well, they're not, and this guy needs an airway.
not_available And you're sure you can do this? 
not_available I think so.
not_available You better know so.
not_available How many have you done? 
not_available I've assisted on several.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available All right, OR Girl, please do not make me regret this.
not_available Okay, Katey, Betadine and sterile sixes.
not_available Without electrocautery juice, this will be messy.
not_available All right, Haleh.
not_available Can you take Tina to the Family Room? 
not_available Sure.
not_available No, no, I want to stay with him.
not_available Come on, honey.
not_available No, I want to stay We'll come and get you as soon as we make him more comfortable.
not_available Okay.
not_available 15 blade to me.
not_available Neela.
not_available Oh, I was hoping there were be a raisonnable explaination for your incessant paging, but you know what? 
not_available This is not it.
not_available I had to do a tracheotomy tube.
not_available Oh, really, and who told you to do that? Because I sure didn't.
not_available Nobody did.
not_available My chief didn't answer his pages.
not_available You did this without any supervision? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt was here.
not_available Oh, great, that is such a relief.
not_available Unfortunately, your little ER forest friends don't count anymore.
not_available You want to be a surgeon? Huh, want to be a big girl doctor? This isn't Barbie's Dream Doll Hospital you're playing in.
not_available I am the ER attending.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra was only following my orders.
not_available Oh.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hello.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, is it? I took your silence for subservience.
not_available You know, not a lot of ER attendings have the skills to do a trach.
not_available Very impressive, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Well, you just, uh, take care of my girl here and we'll call it even.
not_available You don't need to worry about that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra gets plenty of my attention.
not_available Oh, I think I can manage this from here.
not_available Why don't you girls, uh, finish up down here.
not_available You've done more than enough.
not_available Believe me.
not_available Wow, you're so lucky.
not_available He seems like a great guy.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available I'm going to go and find the girlfriend, tell her what's happening.
not_available Hey.
not_available You did good, man.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Must be quiet if you have time to stand around.
not_available How's the kid? Looks like he's going to pull through.
not_available How's the grandfather? Eh, he's a little worried, but he'll be okay.
not_available You make out okay down here? I heard you had two more traumas come in.
not_available Nothing I couldn't deal with.
not_available Well, if it's that quiet, maybe I'll leave a little early tonight.
not_available Abby could probably use some help with the baby.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Go for it.
not_available Sure? Yeah.
not_available I got it all dialed in down here.
not_available This place practically runs itself.
not_available Can one of you look at a suspected hand fracture? Who ordered the films? 
not_available I did.
not_available Everybody was busy.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Did you find Alex? Oh, yes, he was ditching school with a friend at the mall.
not_available I guess I have all that to look forward to, huh? Yep.
not_available You saved that guy.
not_available It was so cool.
not_available You mean "terrifying." 
not_available Dude, you rocked.
not_available Did you see the look on Crenshaw's face? The one that suggested he was going to punish me for the rest of my natural life for what I just did? You spanked him.
not_available Deep down, I think he probably likes it.
not_available Seriously.
not_available You know it's always those type
not_available A guys that are so wound up they go home and put on a diaper or want to be led around by a leash.
not_available You're mad.
not_available Hey, Neela.
not_available Ray Barnett.
not_available I don't think we've officially met.
not_available Katey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Um, I'm still getting some of your mail.
not_available Oh.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've tried to change everything over.
not_available Well, I don't mind.
not_available I just figured you might need some of these.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh, I'll see you guys around.
not_available It was nice meeting you.
not_available You two lived together? 
not_available Oh, we were roommates.
not_available Hope you had benefits.
not_available It wasn't like that.
not_available We were just friends.
not_available Why? That guy is smoking hot.
not_available Does he have a girlfriend? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available I just remembered something.
not_available Um, I'll catch up with you later, okay? Witnesses confirm that the other guy started and you just pushed him away.
not_available I told you that.
not_available But that doesn't explain touching the kid.
not_available I wasn't "touching" him.
not_available My relationship to the boy is complicated.
not_available It's, uh, sort of a secret.
not_available No, no, not like that.
not_available Well, your hand isn't broken; it's just sprained.
not_available It would have been worth a fracture if I would have knocked out that freaky little leprechaun's teeth.
not_available What's going to happen to him? He's going to jail.
not_available What do you think about that, Max? Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't arrest my dad.
not_available What did he say? Max, what's going on? 
not_available This is where I leave.
not_available Good luck with that, Pops.
not_available Mom, Mom, this is my dad Dr.
not_available Archie Morris.
not_available What's up? Hey, Timmy, did you get it? Yeah, but I didn't get a chance to wrap it.
not_available Nah, it's all good.
not_available Gates! Just the man I was looking for.
not_available Here, I got a present for you.
not_available What's this for? It's so, uh, people know who you are.
not_available Hey.
not_available You didn't have to do this.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available Let's see.
not_available What the hell is this? Students wear short coats.
not_available It helps remind everyone, including you, that you are still learning.
not_available You feel better now? 
not_available I feel great, man.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How long has he been crying? About ten minutes.
not_available I think he'll settle down.
not_available How was your shift? Uh, the usualI had a fiveyear
not_available old kid crushed by a tree.
not_available I don't want to hear any stories about bad things happening to children.
not_available He survived, okay? How about your day? It was divine.
not_available Look, I've been thinking.
not_available Maybe you're right, maybe we should get somebody like a nanny No, thanks.
not_available But I thought you 
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available No nannies just us.
not_available Doesn't sound like he's settling down, hmm? I'll get him.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available What's all that crying? Should I stay or should I go now? If I stay it will be trouble If I go it will be double That good, hmm? I should have stayed a paramedic.
not_available No.
not_available Doctors are much more sexy.
not_available Rough day? Yeah, one of my attendings has it out for me.
not_available Either that or he's in love with me.
not_available I can't tell which.
not_available How was your temp gig? Same thing, different people.
not_available Nobody knows you.
not_available Nobody really talks to you.
not_available It's like being the office ghost.
not_available Do you want a drink? No, I have to study.
not_available Knock
not_available knock.
not_available You decent? I'm in my thong.
not_available Guess what? I take it your homework is done? Yeah.
not_available I've got some stuff from school you need to sign.
not_available I left them on the table.
not_available All right.
not_available There's lasagna in the fridge if you get hungry later.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Well, you were right about Adam Horner.
not_available I ignored him all day, even when he was looking at me, and tonight he IM'd me.
not_available The Horndog comes through.
not_available It's Horner.
not_available it.
not_available I bruise easy.
not_available Did you save anyone today? Yes.
not_available Actually, I separated a pair of Siamese twins.
not_available Must be gross seeing all that blood, huh? Nah, I saw more blood when I was a paramedic.
not_available Besides, I'm half vampire, so I kind of dig it.
not_available Do you want me to help you study? No.
not_available I want you to work things out with your mother.
not_available I'd rather shave my head.
not_available Oh.
not_available All right, good, I have a razor in the bathroom; we can shave it into a nice little Mohawk.
not_available Okay, I'm just kidding.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Sometime.
not_available Tonight? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Good night, baby girl.
not_available Night, Doc.
not_available For the next hour, we're going to be talking about abdominal pain in the elderly patient.
not_available Now, I don't have to tell you what an important disease this is No pass
not_available ons, no major tragedy, no deaths.
not_available Gates still here? 
not_available You just missed him.
not_available What about his charts? 
not_available They're over there.
not_available Hey, you know, from what I've seen, Gates's a good doctor.
not_available Oh, he's all right.
not_available Plenty of room for improvement.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, I heard some guy attacked you.
not_available Are you okay? Oh, yes, yeah, I turned the other cheek.
not_available You know what Jesus said.
not_available You know when the, those guys who trespassed against him, as those who trespassed against uscan I get an amen? 
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available I have a patient waiting, so Good night, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available God bless you.
not_available God bless all of us.
not_available You want to grab a bite with me and Max and his moms? You worked things out, huh? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, they're pretty cool.
not_available And if everything goes well at Ike's, we may really work things out tonight.
not_available if you know what I'm saying Morris 
not_available and I think you do.
not_available You do know they're a couple, huh? 
not_available Yeah, a couple of lesbians in desperate need of a Morris sandwich.
not_available You know you're sick, right? What? Good night, Archie.
not_available Could you help me with a two
not_available layer closure? Nope, nope, not now; I'm off.
not_available Weaver should be here any minute now.
not_available All right, wait, wait, wait.
not_available First off, you never want to inject directly into the wound.
not_available It distorts the anatomy for your repair.
not_available He needs regional anesthesia.
not_available Have you ever done an infraorbital block? Not really.
not_available Okay, well, it's pretty easy once you know the tricks.
not_available Now, first, what you want to do is you want to use your left index finger to palpate the infraorbital ridge.
not_available Got it.
not_available Good.
not_available Now you're going to inject one centimeter lateral to the ala and advance upward until you're five millimeters from the ridge.
not_available Good, good, very good.
