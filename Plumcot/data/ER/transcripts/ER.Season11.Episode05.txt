not_available Sevenyear
not_available old with a lead level of 59.
not_available The city notified the family three weeks ago to come in.
not_available Three weeks ago? Okay, what does that tell us? He's got bad parents? 
not_available It tells us his lead exposure is chronic.
not_available If he was poisoned, he'd have symptoms and there's no way they would wait.
not_available Does this case belong in the ER? 
not_available No.
not_available They wouldn't wait here unless they didn't have someplace else.
not_available System's broken.
not_available Can't blame the victims.
not_available Good morning, Mr.
not_available Lucas.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Barnett.

not_available Thanks, doc.
not_available Punch it.
not_available I'm gonna sell your autograph on eBay for a million dollars.
not_available A billion dollars.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Five
not_available minute discharge, boys.
not_available Watch and learn.
not_available Are troponins useful in ruling out coronary aneurysms in Kawasaki's? Aren't enough good studies on kids.
not_available Do ex
not_available preemies have a problem with lead metabolism? No.
not_available Patients will tell you all kinds of irrelevant crap.
not_available They don't know what's important.
not_available You're so patient.
not_available The key is to look like you're listening while you're doing your charting.
not_available Multitask.
not_available Guys, it is the key to survival in the ER.
not_available There you go.
not_available Is that really the best advice you can come up with? 
not_available Second best.
not_available First was feed the nurses.
not_available Well, they're students.
not_available They should focus on taking a history and learn efficiency later.
not_available Med school teaches them to practice medicine in fantasyland.
not_available Never gonna clear that room if it takes us two hours working up a case.

not_available dunk case, not as an intern.
not_available Suit up.
not_available We got a trauma coming in.

not_available Do we have a pressure yet? 
not_available His wife is here.
not_available Get this? Why don't we give the doctors room to work and I'll explain everything to you.
not_available Why don't you call the blood bank.
not_available Full trauma panel, type and cross for 6.
not_available Sats only 84.
not_available We need a portable chest and respiratory down here.
not_available Get him a blanket.
not_available He's cold.
not_available Blood bank.
not_available Hi, I need four units of O
not_available neg in the ER.
not_available What happened? That was yours.
not_available No, it's a trauma.
not_available No medical
not_available record number yet.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't say thank you 
not_available and don't let the boys bully you.
not_available I wasn't letting the boys
not_available You play with your hair when you're nervous.
not_available I can't get a vein.
not_available Get back in there.
not_available Your patient needs a central line.
not_available Chest x
not_available ray's clear.
not_available CT's negative 
not_available BP's better after 2 liters.
not_available What does that mean? Is it bad? 
not_available It's too soon to make any diagnosis.
not_available Just hang in there.
not_available It sounds like the fluids helped you.
not_available You ordered a CT, films and labs without talking to me first.
not_available You were busy.
not_available So where's your student? 
not_available She's in Sutures taking out stitches.
not_available You know, I really don't get it.
not_available I mean, you're proactive, you're delegating and yet you're still in last place.
not_available Here.
not_available Med refill, five minutes.
not_available Go.
not_available Ray and Abby are stuck in Trauma.
not_available This is your chance to catch up.
not_available Femoral's in.
not_available Sats down to 78.
not_available Neck's too mangled.
not_available Anatomy's distorted.
not_available Feel the landmarks.
not_available Jet skis account for 20 percent of boats but are involved in 44 percent of injuries.
not_available Know why that is, Dr.
not_available Lockhart? 
not_available No.
not_available Three
not_available 0 nylon.
not_available No is right.
not_available No throttle, no steering, no way to stop.
not_available Still can't find
not_available You're fine.
not_available Make your cut.
not_available Extend with the clamp.
not_available Good.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Insert the tube.
not_available So if this poor guy hit a pylon driving his jet ski 30 miles an hour what was the equivalent Gforce? 
not_available Got it.
not_available Give me the bag.
not_available Seven G's.
not_available This guy's head was subjected to 
not_available We're doctors, not physicists.
not_available Pressure's dropping.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available Take the airway.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available The impact of 999 pounds dropped on his head.
not_available That's what you're up against.
not_available Not all I'm up against.
not_available You're gonna shock him? 
not_available Charging to 200.
not_available Watch yourself.
not_available I'm not near the bed.
not_available Exactly.
not_available You want me to grab the paddles out of his hand? Mg of epi, have lido on deck.
not_available You did it again.
not_available Did what? The hair.
not_available I mean, eight years of school.
not_available Most people would just suck it up, you know? Diarrhea times eleven months? What did your parents say? 
not_available My dad would have ripped my head off.
not_available Why don't you start the history.
not_available All right, guys, talk to me.
not_available Homeless guy with gnarly feet.
not_available Clotrimazole, new socks, home.
not_available Sevenyear
not_available old with lice.
not_available Permethrin shampoo, repeat in a week.
not_available Good work, guys.
not_available Keep them coming.
not_available Still in the lead with 11, Abby seven, Neela four.
not_available Ray gets credit for those? He's in Trauma, he didn't even see them.
not_available The students are part of his team.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available He's got two.
not_available Can you handle two students? You better go in with me.
not_available There's a patient crouched in the corner.
not_available Every time I go near her, she starts, like, yelling in Chinese.
not_available That galea.
not_available He's basically scalped.
not_available Just tamponade the bleeding.
not_available He's maxed out on dopa.
not_available His pressure still sucks.
not_available Of course.
not_available Why? 
not_available Spinal shock.
not_available Yep.
not_available No sympathetic tone.
not_available What do you want to do? 
not_available Epi drip.
not_available Get the BP up, increase the cerebral oxygen delivery.
not_available Right.
not_available Ready for the cruel twist? Systolic's 58.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Epi drip, one mic per kilo per minute.
not_available Didn't I just say that? Ischemic brain needs oxygen, but oxygen also forms free radicals after brain injury.
not_available Mother Nature is such a bitch.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Paddles to Lockhart.
not_available Charge to 360.
not_available Clear.
not_available Free radicals cause secondary
not_available cell death.
not_available You following? Clear.
not_available Can we take a break from chemistry class? Difference between a physician and a witch doctor is appreciation of science.
not_available These trauma algorithms should be automatic for you by now.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Barnett, take over compressions.
not_available Look at his face.
not_available His brain is gravely injured.
not_available The brain is starting to compromise his heart.
not_available I didn't see it happen.
not_available I told him not to rent that thing.
not_available I'm sorry, his body is shutting down.
not_available Going again.
not_available You know, I was running this.
not_available Really? I hadn't noticed.
not_available Clear.
not_available Procainamide.
not_available What? Fine.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Clear.
not_available So, wait, why did you decide to come back, then? 
not_available It's not like anything has changed.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Neela, knee sprain won't leave until she gets a prescription for some memory pill she saw on TV.
not_available Positive tox on the kindergarten teacher.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Get knee lady out of here and meet me in Curtain 2.
not_available What do you want me to tell her? 
not_available She can ask her primary doc.
not_available Pratt, fix this order.
not_available Teach your interns the difference between micrograms and milligrams.
not_available I can't be with them every minute.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available If I've made a mistake on an order, I'd appreciate it if you'd confront me.
not_available I'd like to be treated the same 
not_available and subjected to the same scrutiny.
not_available Neela, we weren't talking about you.
not_available Pupils fixed and dilated.
not_available No gag, no corneals.
not_available Here.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, what now? 
not_available We wait.
not_available At least he's in sinus.
not_available That means that the brain is no longer capable of telling the body to die.
not_available Kovac needs some help.
not_available I got it.
not_available Elena Flemming, 32, poly
not_available pharmacy overdose.
not_available Paramedics couldn't get the line.
not_available Let me give it a try.
not_available Elena, what did you take? 
not_available The stuff that was in my cabinet.
not_available What was in your cabinet? Usual stuff.
not_available I don't remember.
not_available Urbanus, catch the paramedics, see if they got any meds from the home.
not_available What's your plan? CBC, lytes, serum and urine tox Tylenol and salicylate levels, activated charcoal 
not_available and KUB to check for iron fragments.
not_available Good.
not_available And call Psych and Social Services.
not_available Elena, were you trying to kill yourself? I don't know.
not_available Looks pretty rough in there.
not_available Guy is brain
not_available dead.
not_available They have kids? 
not_available Three.
not_available Coming? 
not_available No, they're too young.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah, it's part of the job.
not_available Bruised guy's CBC is finally back.
not_available It's full of blasts.
not_available You ever told anyone they had leukemia before? Part of the job.
not_available ICU can't find a bed for our jet ski trauma.
not_available They're not expecting to find one.
not_available He's gonna be with us for a while.
not_available Why don't you call Social Services for the wife.
not_available What are you guys still doing here? Can't send them out until the chart's signed by an Attending.
not_available Okay, a 7year
not_available old was sent by the city with a lead level of 59.
not_available Asymptomatic, dispo'd to lead clinic for chelation.
not_available Did you get a repeat level? 
not_available Figured they'd get it there.
not_available Come on.
not_available Tell meIs that cool? 
not_available No, Ray, that's not cool.
not_available You've been a doctor for a month.
not_available You know you can't sign off before you run it past an Attending.
not_available So why don't you get a repeat level and then I'll sign the chart.
not_available Where are you going? I
not_available I need to go to church.
not_available You're too sick to go anywhere right now.
not_available I need to talk to you about the results of your blood test.
not_available Juan? I got one in my eye now.
not_available Look.
not_available Your platelet count is very low.
not_available That's why you're bleeding so easily.
not_available Juan, your blood smear showed some abnormal white cells.
not_available The abnormal cells are crowding out the healthy ones in your bone marrow.
not_available Juan, please listen.
not_available We can help you.
not_available You can't
not_available You can't help me.
not_available Okay, nobody can.
not_available Yesterday I hit a man with my car.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available But today I wake up like this.
not_available Your blood pressure's still a bit low.
not_available You need to be in bed.
not_available I want to review your smear and check on more labs.
not_available And then I'll be back to go over everything with you, okay? Why didn't you tell him he has leukemia? Overdose only had antacids and a bottle of Benadryl in the medicine cabinet.
not_available She'll sleep off the antihistamine and be good.
not_available What the hell is going on here? I've been here for four hours and there's nothing wrong with me.
not_available Sir, we honestly don't know.
not_available You could have TB even though you don't feel sick.
not_available We are going to recommend treatment.
not_available You want me to take medicine for a disease you don't even know I've got.
not_available People tolerate the medicine.
not_available There are risks.
not_available You people are really something.
not_available Mr.
not_available Decoyte
not_available I want a better doctor! I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Can I help you? I've been here all day for a stupid skin test.
not_available And no one here seems to know if I've got TB or not.
not_available The safest thing for us to do is to treat it as if you do have TB.
not_available If I were in your position, I would do the same thing.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then get me out of here.
not_available Please, have a seat in the waiting area.
not_available We'll get your discharge paperwork and your prescription.
not_available A good doctor knows how to make "I don't know" sound reassuring.
not_available Lymphoblastic leukemia has a remission rate of over 80 percent.
not_available How did he take it? 
not_available I should know the treatment before I tell him.
not_available Can you page Oncology? Okay, halftime score.
not_available Ray fourteen, Neela seven.
not_available The nurses were tied up in traumas.
not_available It slowed things down.
not_available So you're gonna blame the nurses while you're on your ass? Ray's using the same nurses and discharged twice as many patients.
not_available My man.
not_available No more than 10 minutes in the room.
not_available At seven, you start saying goodbye.
not_available You better start wrapping things up in five.
not_available There's a jammed finger in Sutures.
not_available Go check it out.
not_available Ray, how is it that you get lice and I get new
not_available onset leukemia and a referral from Kazakhstan? You got some cool cases.
not_available Our boy in 4.
not_available I think it could be intussusception.
not_available You get jammed finger, I get intussusception.
not_available Are you accusing me of cherry
not_available picking charts, Neela? That hurts.
not_available Evans Syndrome with varicella, unexplained vision loss idiopathic proteinuria, LOC NOS, cystic fibrosis with SBO.
not_available And drug
not_available seeking heroin addict with a butt abscess who threw an emesis basin at my head.
not_available Yeah, she was a winner.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm just slow then.
not_available You're not slow.
not_available You're just differently abled.
not_available Don't let Pratt get to you.
not_available Abby's slower.
not_available Not that he'd ever call her out on it.
not_available But Attendings love her, nurses protect her.
not_available Must be nice to be the teacher's pet.
not_available Screw you, Ray.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Good, you're all here.
not_available We didn't finish talking about my research with free radicals and superoxide dismutase.
not_available It's good stuff.
not_available Hold up, hold up.
not_available Come on, you might learn something.
not_available Step into my office.
not_available Right over here.
not_available Free radicals are the link to so many disease processes in the human body.
not_available Ischemia, cancer, aging.
not_available I think that's permanent marker.
not_available They form after tissue is deprived of oxygen.
not_available Why are they bad? Lockhart, we went over this in the trauma.
not_available We did? Okay, what happens when the radical encounters mitochondria of a healthy cell? Lockhart? Why don't you let me do some research and I'll present to you? 
not_available I just told you the answer.
not_available Okay, let's try this.
not_available Draw an oxygen atom.
not_available I'm not trying to trick you.
not_available This is easy.
not_available Just draw an oxygen atom.
not_available Look, you guys everything that we do in the ER every intervention ultimately operates at a molecular level.
not_available I don't understand how any of you expects to manipulate the complicated machinery of the body if you don't understand the basics.
not_available Okay.
not_available There.
not_available I've done the hard part for you.
not_available That's an oxygen atom.
not_available Now, all you have to do is add the electrons.
not_available I have patients to see.
not_available You couldn't tell, really.
not_available You didn't even seem upset.
not_available I know how to draw a damn oxygen atom.
not_available That guy just gives me the creeps.
not_available Okay, that's truly disgusting.
not_available Look, don't knock it.
not_available It's fast, high in protein and free.
not_available Sutures is Ã  la casa, Exam 4 splint and home and fever is just waiting on a chest film.
not_available Okay.
not_available That would be 17, Neela 12.
not_available That brings you to 21.
not_available It's only 4:00.
not_available When I hit 25, can I go home early? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, what have you got? 
not_available Diverticulitis versus biliary colic in 2.
not_available In 4, Ml versus reflux, and in 3, sepsis versus viral syndrome.
not_available In Admit, Abby versus Ray.
not_available Neela, you're getting your ass kicked.
not_available Start making decisions and move those patients.
not_available Ray's logged 21 discharges with three hours left.
not_available I guess 25 was too easy.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available I better up the target to 30.
not_available Thirty? Double your speed, you might make it.
not_available Pratt, your lacrosse player's sedated.
not_available Come do his lid lac.
not_available What? It wasn't like it was my idea.
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett? Wendall Meade, Social Services.
not_available Yes.
not_available I paged you like four times.
not_available Yeah, in like 15 minutes.
not_available If I don't answer you right away, there's a reason.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need you to talk to Trauma 1 's wife.
not_available He's brain
not_available dead.
not_available Interesting name, "Trauma 1." 
not_available Ben Coleman.
not_available Wife's name is Stacy.
not_available He's an intern.
not_available I see.
not_available So referring to a patient by name instead of room is a second
not_available year skill.
not_available Did you go through the care pathway? 
not_available The what? The checklist that systematically covers all postmortem issues with the patient's family.
not_available You need a list to check off questions you'd ask anyway? I'll see her when you're done.
not_available Contact dermatitis versus candida.
not_available Call it dermatitis.
not_available Topical steroids and send her home.
not_available It resolves, we were right.
not_available If it doesn't? 
not_available She'll come back.
not_available The overdose is waking up.
not_available And here's the UA on your tarantula dealer.
not_available UTI versus kidney failure.
not_available If I'm right, she takes antibiotics and gets better.
not_available If I'm wrong, she becomes hyperkalemic and dies.
not_available I'm trying to embrace uncertainty.
not_available How am I doing? 
not_available Not so good.
not_available You know, you haven't had anything to eat or drink all shift.
not_available Go to Oncology and get a copy of the chemo protocols.
not_available Isn't that Oncology's job? 
not_available They said it might be a couple of hours.
not_available I wanna be prepared to cover all the bases for when we go back in there.
not_available I'm on an ER rotation.
not_available Shouldn't I be cracking chests instead of making copies? I got a 15year
not_available old skateboarder versus firetruck.
not_available The ladder clipped his leg.
not_available Looks like an angulated tib
not_available fib.
not_available Leave him.
not_available We'll find him a hallway.
not_available I've got it.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available My med student is driving me mad.
not_available Wanna trade? Were we that annoying? 
not_available I wasn't.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Does your arm hurt? You got hit by a firetruck and just broke a leg? Lucky guy.
not_available Hey, hello in there.
not_available We're your doctors.
not_available We'll try to keep this brief.
not_available My sister is coming.
not_available How am I gonna tell our kids? Well, the social worker will be here to see you.
not_available She can help you with all that.
not_available Would you like to speak with clergy? Any denomination? Okay.
not_available I'm sorry to bring this up so soon, but we only have a limited amount of time 
not_available to make this decision.
not_available Is it okay if I don't tell them yet? Have you thought about donating your husband's organs? 
not_available I think it's okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let them have one last night before their lives change forever.
not_available Well, you're looking better.
not_available Just don't make me drink any more of that mud.
not_available Well, the good news is your tox screen came back negative and your EKG was normal.
not_available So from a medical standpoint, you're clear.
not_available Good.
not_available Can I get out of here? 
not_available I wasn't trying to commit suicide.
not_available What were you trying to do? Abby? Is the baby in 3 a real ALTE or just a choking episode? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I haven't presented him.
not_available The parents are refusing blood draws and x
not_available rays.
not_available Okay, I'll go find them when I'm done.
not_available I need Psychiatry to see you before I can send you home.
not_available I'm not crazy, just stupid.
not_available Abby, is IV contrast contraindicated in someone with wheat and peanut allergies? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Can you find out? 
not_available CT's calling for your MVA.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hold them off and I'll look into it.
not_available I'm gonna page Psych for you and get you an ETA, okay? The condom broke.
not_available Abby.
not_available What? Your abdominal pain is gonna leave AMA if he's not sent up soon.
not_available I tried to admit as acalculous cholecystitis but they think it's a retrocecal appendix.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm waiting for Surgery to see him.
not_available Keep it moving.
not_available Three an hour now.
not_available Thank you for your concern.
not_available So the condom broke? I'm a temp at a commodities firm and I slept with one of the traders last night.
not_available He left a note on my 
bed "I got HIV.
not_available See a doctor.
not_available " Five years of needles and I managed to stay negative.
not_available I cleaned myself up, turned everything around and because of one stupid night, now I'm gonna get AIDS? I can't get sick.
not_available I have a kid.
not_available Just because you've been exposed doesn't mean you're infected.
not_available The incidence of transmission from one exposure is actually relatively low.
not_available You know, it might be better if I told him he has leukemia alone.
not_available I wouldn't wanna cramp your style.
not_available Seen Juan Enriquez anywhere? That leukemia guy? 
not_available He was out here a while ago.
not_available He's gone.
not_available He'll be back.
not_available There's a patient in his bed.
not_available Nobody would have discharged him.
not_available Damn it.
not_available He's gone.
not_available Doughnut? Who? 
not_available My leukemia patient.
not_available I'm such an idiot.
not_available I hadn't even told him, but I think he knew.
not_available You're not making a lot of sense right now.
not_available He thinks he's being punished by God.
not_available I should have realized he was a flight risk.
not_available No, there's nothing you could have done.
not_available I could have told him it was treatable.
not_available He has a shot at remission.
not_available There isn't enough time to help the people who want help.
not_available Don't beat yourself up over people who don't.
not_available He was distraught, and I left him alone so I could go and do research.
not_available Dude, where did you go? 
not_available Jane's gonna hang with us, okay? You seem stressed out.
not_available It's about time for the nurses' nighttime feeding.
not_available Better go.
not_available Beastie Boys.
not_available He's out.
not_available Have you ever heard of prescribing prophylactic triple cocktail after a known HIV exposure? Sure.
not_available The hospital gives it to health workers all the time for needle sticks.
not_available I'm not talking about a health worker.
not_available One of my patients had unprotected sex with an HIV
not_available positive guy last night.
not_available It's really only available for occupational exposures.
not_available Too expensive.
not_available Okay, on my count pull the distal segment out and down while I give counter traction.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Only healthcare workers are worthy of HIV prophylaxis? We can't give preventive meds to every one
not_available night stand when we still can't afford to treat people who are actually infected.
not_available I'm talking about one patient who's here now and she's asking for my help.
not_available And what about the patient who walks in tomorrow and the next day? Put him in a long leg splint and stay with him until he wakes up.
not_available The guy's been here for eight hours and hadn't been told? What were you waiting for? Oncology couldn't get here.
not_available I was figuring out what to tell him.
not_available He wasn't gonna hear anything.
not_available It was important I get my facts straight.
not_available Why didn't you call a social worker? I thought it was better for him
not_available No, it's not about him, it's about you and your need to be perfect.
not_available Stop being a slow A
not_available plus and start becoming a fast B or you're not gonna make it.
not_available Now, find him before he bleeds out and he dies.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm looking for funding for HIV medication for an uninsured ER patient.
not_available If anyone ever actually checks this machine please call Dr.
not_available Lockhart in the ER.
not_available What? I look at you and Ray, you're so confident in
not_available It's your first day.
not_available Give yourself at least a week 
not_available to be better than the rest of us.
not_available I don't even know why I'm here.
not_available Listen.
not_available Every shift at about this time I start fantasizing about working in a tollbooth.
not_available Neela, what's going on with that football player in 3? Knee pain times two days.
not_available No drawer sign, no AP or lateral laxity.
not_available Point tenderness? 
not_available And he's bearing down weight.
not_available Rest, ice and Ace wrap, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available No, you can't! No, no, no! There's nothing wrong with him
not_available Looking good today, Dori.
not_available Doughnut? 
not_available I am not helping with the disimpaction.
not_available Doughnut? 
not_available Babinka? Don't act immune to my charms just because you brought your own sweets.
not_available He does that every day? 
not_available Twice.
not_available Start of each nursing shift.
not_available It actually works? 
not_available Apparently.
not_available Abby, you're lagging.
not_available Well, I have more patients on the board.
not_available Which is meaningless if you can't dispo them.
not_available You're taking up room, jamming the flow.
not_available Yesterday, I got a hot Ml to the lab in 15 minutes reduced a perilunate dislocation and a case of malaria.
not_available Today, I'm in some kind of bizarre vortex.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Cough times two days.
not_available In and out.
not_available Doubt it.
not_available Probably turn into myocarditis versus tracheoesophageal fistula.
not_available All of my patients need three consults and a huge workup and even then, there's no definitive diagnosis.
not_available I guess you're gonna have
not_available No, I'm not gonna pretend things are cut and dry! I just want one patient today that has a clear problem that I can help.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sam, how come Brandon still hasn't gone to the scanner? 
not_available Because CT's been backed up for hours.
not_available Charlie's the CT tech from 3 to 11.
not_available He loves bear claws.
not_available The rest of the doughnuts go to the nurses' station.
not_available Should I make sure someone sees me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You don't find all this wheeling and dealing a bit slimy? Yeah, but you gotta play games to get stuff done.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Let's review the standings.
not_available Ray, still in the lead with 25.
not_available Got 26.
not_available Abby at 19, Neela brings up the rear with 16.
not_available File this under Neela.
not_available And why would you do that? 
not_available Because you'll owe me.
not_available Hey, there's a patient with an ER wristband who's upstairs in the chapel.
not_available Been up there a couple of hours.
not_available Where are you going? You're only at 16.
not_available Employee Health.
not_available Can I help you? This is Abby Lockhart in the ER.
not_available I've been stuck by a needle.
not_available Let's roll.
not_available Curtain 2 needs a thumb spica and we need to take off a toenail in 4.
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett, did you fill this out? What? This is the postmortem checklist for the jet
not_available ski guy in Trauma 1.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Did you actually talk to Stacy Coleman, or did you just fill this out to save time? What? Well, you checked off that she wanted to have her husband's organs donated.
not_available She said she never consented to that.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I asked her all the questions.
not_available While the transplant surgeon was prepping to harvest she thought her husband was getting better, so Okay.
not_available Can we talk about this someplace else, please? UNOS has been on the phone with a kid who thought she was getting a heart.
not_available Are you worried about getting yelled at? 
not_available The lady said she was fine with it.
not_available No, Ray, she did not! Did you make sure she was? 
not_available I asked her all the questions.
not_available Did you take time to explain it to her? How am I supposed to? 
not_available Nobody said this job was easy.
not_available When you take shortcuts and you drop details, people get hurt.
not_available We'll send this in for hep B, hep C and HIV.
not_available You can call tomorrow for results.
not_available And never stick your hand in a full sharps container.
not_available Stupid.
not_available AZT and 3TC in a combined pill.
not_available The other is your protease inhibitor, BID, on an empty stomach.
not_available Two quarts of water a day.
not_available And we'll see you in two weeks to check your LFTs.
not_available Juan.
not_available We've been looking for you.
not_available Have you been down here the whole time? Juan, you have leukemia.
not_available Leukemia is very treatable and you have an excellent chance of a cure.
not_available I know it feels like something bigger than you is making this happen but something also led you here.
not_available We will help you get through this.
not_available There's a reason why you came to this hospital today.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available I heard you got a needle stick.
not_available Are you okay? Oh, yeah.
not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available You wanna go home early? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm fine, really.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey, Wendall? Yeah? Did you get to see my overdose? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I left a note in the chart.
not_available I'm comfortable discharging with outpatient follow
not_available up.
not_available Great.
not_available Listen, I heard about your needle stick.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I am.
not_available Page me if you wanna talk.
not_available I will.
not_available You're back.
not_available Can I do anything? Do you feel okay? 
not_available Yes, I'm fine.
not_available A little woozy from all the blood they took, though.
not_available I'll get you water.
not_available Great.
not_available How about an iced tea from across the street? 
not_available Yeah, you got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Sam, did the radial fracture get Ancef yet? Yeah.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available I gotta give this message to Mrs.
not_available Coleman.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Coleman.
not_available They took him to the morgue.
not_available Your sister called.
not_available She took your kids to your house for the night.
not_available Hey, I guess we had some kind of misunderstanding back there and I'm not even sure what it was about.
not_available If there's anything I can do Can I call you a cab or something? I'm sorry for your loss.
not_available Just the man I was looking for.
not_available Do you know how often I hear that? Are you okay in there? Yeah, it'sIt was just a little mix
not_available up.
not_available What do you got there? I need a favor.
not_available I'm into favors.
not_available These are for my patient in Exam 3 but as you can see, they have my name on them.
not_available HIV meds.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you have any friends in the pharmacy that could doctor those labels? Yeah.
not_available I think I'm falling in love.
not_available How was your first day? 
not_available Hard.
not_available You gonna come back tomorrow? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Juan Enriquez's priest called.
not_available Still no word from him? He's on the Oncology Ward starting chemo.
not_available I found him in the chapel.
not_available Great.
not_available Hey, thanks for your help today.
not_available Sure.
not_available You off? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available If you wait for a second 
not_available I'll walk out with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available I think I hear rounds starting.
not_available Make sure you drink at least two quarts of water a day and see your doctor in two weeks and get your liver function tested.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Take care of yourself, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available You have dinner plans tonight? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe that was too subtle.
not_available Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? 
not_available It wasn't too subtle, Urbanus.
not_available I got it.
not_available Answer still no? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good morning.
not_available You buy your tshirt like that or you rip it yourself? 
not_available Hey, I met my discharge quota today.
not_available So did I.
not_available Not quite, Dr.
not_available Barnett.
not_available Twenty
not_available nine, you're one short, buddy.
not_available Afterwork cocktail? 
not_available That's totally gross.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's go get a real drink then.
not_available Not a chance.
not_available I'm exhausted.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Lewis is handing out the paychecks today.
not_available How can he still have energy after a day like this? Work is easy when you have the entire staff literally eating out of your hand.
not_available I don't know how he can finish his work at the end of his shift.
not_available I still have an hour's worth of charting.
not_available Two hours.
not_available Hello, Abby, Neela.
not_available Survive? Okay, let's round so the day crew can get out of here.
not_available In 2, we have DZ with V and HA.
not_available Finishing a liter, PO challenge and home.
not_available All right.
not_available Who can tell me what the criteria is for scanning headaches? Worst case 
not_available Thunderclap onset.
