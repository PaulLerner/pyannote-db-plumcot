
not_available Previously on ER This is Dr.
not_available Fischer from Infectious Disease.
not_available Lf you wanna go, we need to leave.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You don't know a thing! So why don't you back off and stay out of my face? The truth is I'm really, really good at my job.
not_available Why change that? 
not_available You never wanted this baby.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Go home.
not_available I don't need you doing me no damn favors.
not_available Can I come in? Oh, my! On the dance floor again.
not_available Thank you, bubbles.
not_available Should I try a 1? Use a 3.
not_available You got more control.
not_available What did you get on the last hole? Five? Six.
not_available Make it 5.
not_available Use your mulligan.
not_available That was 6 with my mulligan.
not_available You gotta go to the driving range with me more often.
not_available You don't car pool on Tuesdays, right? I think a car full of screaming over who's got shotgun is less aggravating than this.
not_available Okay, hang on.
not_available Straighten up your back.
not_available Keep your head down.
not_available I'll watch your ball.
not_available You're on the fairway.
not_available Wrong fairway, but you're in the fairway.
not_available I think it's this whole doctor
not_available golf clich Á that's really throwing me.
not_available You can't fight it.
not_available Play nine holes twice a week and 18 on the weekends.
not_available You'll be in the low 80s by Labor Day.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, I see you have a thymectomy scheduled.
not_available Would you mind if I gave it to Dr.
not_available Levin? Yes, I would.
not_available Drs.
not_available Fecteau and Loesch are looking for a Resident to assist them.
not_available On a transplant? A 35year
not_available old with lupus.
not_available Her brother's donating a kidney.
not_available You may like the opportunity.
not_available Yes, I would.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter can scrub in on the thymectomy.
not_available Sure.
not_available Unless, of course the transplant team could also use Dr.
not_available Carter? Perhaps Dr.
not_available Carter could assist the donor's team.
not_available I'll ask.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, thanks! It means a lot to me that you'd Carter, I'll see you up there, okay? Jeanie, it's after 7.
not_available Oh, my God! Did my alarm ring? 
not_available Every 10 minutes for the last hour.
not_available My 7:00 
not_available Pills.
not_available That's why I woke you.
not_available I can't believe I overslept.
not_available Here's some juice and toast to take with it.
not_available You take AZT first, right? Then I can take my nine o'clocks on an empty stomach.
not_available Thanks for letting me stay.
not_available And for not asking why.
not_available Sure.
not_available I didn't wanna be alone, or feel like calling anyone else.
not_available I'm glad you called.
not_available A minor meltdown, you know? I was doing great, then out of the blue, it snuck up on me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I forget sometimes for a couple of hours.
not_available Then I remember.
not_available What's that? They're playing around with my meds.
not_available The good news is if I start the day with this, I can work in my Oreos at bedtime.
not_available You haven't outgrown the Oreos? Hell, no! Why are they adding meds? Is your viral load up? I'm fine.
not_available I gotta be on the job in an hour.
not_available You wanna walk to the El together? Al, how are you doing? You know.
not_available It seems I'm resistant to something or other.
not_available What about those new drugs? The nucleoside analogues? My docs are trying to get me into a trial study for those.
not_available They only take 20 people.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? It's not your problem.
not_available I might be able to help.
not_available I do know some doctors.
not_available I didn't wanna bother you.
not_available Maybe I can get you an interview.
not_available Where's the study? At County.
not_available Some docs who work in Infectious Disease are running it.
not_available It's a hassle.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's a simple request.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available No problem.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available I told you.
not_available "She reached to hang his banana bag her breasts swelling under her uniform.
not_available 'Carly.' His voice hoarse with desire.
not_available 'Call me Nurse Hallonan"'? Carly Hallonan.
not_available That's you.
not_available Read about the "gentle giant" at the desk.
not_available You didn't mind he was Neanderthal? More brawn than brains.
not_available A dude! Who wrote this trash? 
not_available Randi.
not_available It was under the desk.
not_available Maybe Lydia.
not_available She had a poem in Good Housekeeping once.
not_available It was definitely written by a woman.
not_available No man thinks like this.
not_available Listen to 
this "Witchcraft attracted her as a child when Zulu tribesmen on her father's preserve tried to heal her shriveled leg." Weaver's in it? 
not_available You're cruel.
not_available "Now she aimed her spells at fellow Attending, Martin Bean.
not_available She nightly stirred and whispered in jealousy and, yes perhaps a perverted yearning." Yikes! 
not_available We should be careful.
not_available People's feelings could get hurt.
not_available How many copies should I make? 
not_available A lot.
not_available That LOL in Curtain 1 is still waiting.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Water cannot wash away prophecy.
not_available We'll still start with a shower.
not_available Those who minister to the anointed must shun the flesh of pigs.
not_available Refuse the carnal touch of any man.
not_available No meat, no men.
not_available I'm your woman.
not_available And all we know will crumble unto dust Doyle, did you call Psych? 
not_available Don't play into their delusions.
not_available I told the truth.
not_available The world is delusion! And truth shall rain upon thee with fists of thunder! 
not_available Okay, let's go take a bath.
not_available Rejoice, lost man.
not_available Chaos is your destiny! 
not_available I am the prophet of evil.
not_available I'll be in Curtain Area 1.
not_available Good.
not_available I thought I was late.
not_available You are.
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn's later.
not_available How you doing? I'm glad to be out of the house.
not_available How was the cab ride? I would've picked you up.
not_available The cab ride was fine.
not_available I'm fine, Peter.
not_available And the Lamaze class? You rescheduled it? I did, but I won't need you to be there.
not_available You're fired.
not_available What do you mean? Peter, I cannot work with you.
not_available The way you bark orders at me? "Twenty seconds! Blow!" Please! This baby's not gonna wanna come out.
not_available Carla, look, I didn't make up the drills.
not_available Well, I am planning on a birth, not a military maneuver.
not_available Folks, I'm sorry but Dr.
not_available Coburn's been called into delivery.
not_available She'll be delayed at least another hour.
not_available Damn! Peter, it's okay.
not_available I know you're working.
not_available I wanted to ask her about your iron supplement.
not_available Go save a life.
not_available I'll call you later, okay? Look at all the typos.
not_available You think I'd do something so sloppy? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm going to Rachel's school.
not_available I'll be back before noon.
not_available It's only in a couple inches of water.
not_available He puts on his waders.
not_available But you're still sitting sweet.
not_available Two
not_available under after 15.
not_available Is Doug's fellowship in question again? He's angling an invite to play golf at Fair Oaks.
not_available Anspaugh's a member there.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross has gone to the dark side.
not_available Help! I need help! 
not_available I'm looking for the ER.
not_available You found it.
not_available My daughter's leg was cut with a saw.
not_available She's bleeding.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene, come this way.
not_available Tell Doyle to meet us in Trauma 1.
not_available I thought you were leaving.
not_available I am soon.
not_available It's not that bad.
not_available This is why girls shouldn't take shop.
not_available It was Jim Rentschler who did it.
not_available I'll take a look.
not_available I got your message.
not_available No need to come down.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available I called last night.
not_available I got in late.
not_available I need to ask a favor.
not_available Shoot.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kramer in the AIDS clinic is doing a trial study of nucleoside analogues.
not_available Are they looking for subjects? Having trouble with your meds? No, I'm fine.
not_available Knock wood.
not_available That's a relief.
not_available Wanna have dinner? I can't.
not_available You'll tell me if I should stop asking.
not_available I'd like to recommend someone for the trial.
not_available I'll get your patient an interview and flag their file if they fit the protocol.
not_available That's wonderful.
not_available But it's not a patient.
not_available Actually, it's my ex, Al.
not_available I'll get him an interview today.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Irrigate.
not_available D Ábride.
not_available Single layer closure with 4.0 nylon.
not_available Sounds right.
not_available You're lucky it didn't cut deeper.
not_available Was she talking about stitches? 
not_available Right.
not_available You're in good hands with Dr.
not_available Doyle.
not_available You're going someplace? 
not_available I'm not on duty.
not_available You're leaving us with a student? Dr.
not_available Doyle is an intern.
not_available Another Attending will consult with her if there are any problems.
not_available I don't want an intern.
not_available I don't want her to have a scar on her leg.
not_available Am I gonna have a scar? 
not_available A small one.
not_available But I'm a majorette! Get a plastic surgeon here! We don't consult plastic surgeons for lacerations of this kind.
not_available For God's sakes, don't stick us with a student! I'm an Emergency Medicine Resident.
not_available You're learning on the job, dear.
not_available This is a teaching facility.
not_available If you wanna investigate a plastic surgeon on your own, that's your right.
not_available Like I can afford that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle is fully qualified for this kind of repair.
not_available I'm running late, so I'm leaving now.
not_available You're not the only one leaving.
not_available Alyssa, get your shoes on.
not_available Her injury may mean nothing to you, but if it were your kid you'd make sure she got the best.
not_available Whatever you think, Mr.
not_available Gunther.
not_available Great! Just walk away! 
not_available I owe you one, Kerry.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I got it.
not_available Will this put me to sleep? No, this is just for IV access, Mr.
not_available Twomey.
not_available They won't start anesthesia until you get to O.R.
not_available Good.
not_available I was hoping I could see my sister before I went under.
not_available It's a great thing you're doing, giving her a kidney.
not_available She practically raised me.
not_available Our family wasn't too interested.
not_available Then she got lupus.
not_available She's been through so much, with dialysis and all.
not_available Hang on, this might be her.
not_available Jean Twomey? Someone here wants to see you.
not_available Oh, my God! He's gonna bug me until the last minute, isn't he? If I can.
not_available Change of heart, crybaby? Of course not.
not_available I already offered him my stereo in a trade.
not_available A stereo for a kidney? You'll have to throw in the Jet Ski too.
not_available Okay.
not_available As long as that settles it and I'm not beholden to my kid brother for the rest of my life.
not_available Does this sound fair to you? Fair and square.
not_available All right, it's a deal, then.
not_available Deal.
not_available You're going to be with my brother? 
not_available I sure am.
not_available Well, take care of him.
not_available He's a wimp.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for a head doctor.
not_available Which one? Bald white guy with little glasses? Dr.
not_available Greene's not here.
not_available What do you need? A few weeks ago he took care of my brother.
not_available Now I got this.
not_available You'll have to take this to the 3rd floor, past reception, to the east wing.
not_available They can help you there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The secret to putting, since you didn't ask is to change your focus.
not_available These machines are for idiots.
not_available Anyone can sink the same shot over and over.
not_available I'm getting hooked on this.
not_available I think Randi has a hidden talent.
not_available She says she didn't write it.
not_available A nurse didn't write it.
not_available Nurses go home too tired to write.
not_available Maybe a doctor did.
not_available The medicine's too cheesy.
not_available She has got you down.
not_available "The suave Resident cocked his head boyishly and winked.
not_available A quick wink.
not_available Almost a reflex.
not_available She trembled, her resolve crumbling." Who's he winking at? My character, who's he winking at? A lot of these characters are just made up.
not_available There you are.
not_available How are you? I'm glad to see you're not swamped.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Do you mind? 
not_available No.
not_available Here, go ahead.
not_available I just got a phone call from a friend of mine.
not_available P.
not_available K.
not_available Palmer of the railroad Palmers? Sure, yeah.
not_available Damn it.
not_available I know P.
not_available K.
not_available From the club, of course.
not_available He's a hell of a guy.
not_available A 2 handicap.
not_available This floor must be sloped.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It slopes.
not_available Anyhow P.
not_available K.
not_available Called from Hilton Head.
not_available He's there with his missus.
not_available Seems their little one stayed home with a nanny and took a spill.
not_available Could be a fracture.
not_available Their pediatrician's out of town.
not_available He asked me for a referral.
not_available Have his nanny bring him.
not_available They're on their way.
not_available There we go.
not_available Right in the heart.
not_available The parents are flying home now.
not_available I promised them their son would get the best.
not_available I'll take good care of him.
not_available If you're interested, you couldn't ask for a better recommendation to Fair Oaks than P.
not_available K.'s.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I hadn't thought of that.
not_available Fair Oaks is one of the 25 best courses in the country.
not_available Really? You could take me as your guest.
not_available You don't play golf.
not_available That's a good thing because they don't allow women.
not_available Or blacks.
not_available Jews either.
not_available I think they changed that.
not_available I'm pretty sure they changed that.
not_available Chris Law.
not_available My brother was Kenny.
not_available I remember.
not_available How are you? Not so good.
not_available My mother got this yesterday.
not_available A $ 19,000 bill from a hospital that killed her son.
not_available My mother doesn't have insurance.
not_available I'm sure the billing department 
not_available Will make a payment schedule? They don't understand that my mother, who pays every bill, won't pay one penny of that.
not_available She's not gonna pay because I'm telling her that it's a mistake.
not_available You don't get bills from people who kill your child.
not_available You don't pay people who lose his body between their morgue and a coroner so that you have to postpone a funeral for two days.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I had no idea that happened.
not_available Nobody has any idea.
not_available But you tell them that she doesn't get another piece of mail from this hospital unless it's an apology.
not_available I'm very sorry for your loss.
not_available I'm not threatening to sue.
not_available I'm sure you have a department for that too.
not_available But if my mother gets another bill from this hospital maybe I'm gonna kick some ass.
not_available Maybe I'll start with yours.
not_available I'd report it to Security.
not_available He was blowing off steam.
not_available He had a good point.
not_available The morgue did mix up the body transfer.
not_available How's Rachel? 
not_available Good news.
not_available She's Marco Polo in the school play.
not_available Save me a seat.
not_available There's no chocolate chip.
not_available Aren't you with me? Lydia is.
not_available One RN per collarbone, even for the country club set.
not_available Who gets the VIP treatment? 
not_available I get yogurt for kids who wait.
not_available All right.
not_available Got some chocolate yogurt for the big guy with the sore clavicle.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available You're very welcome.
not_available You wanna see why it hurts? Here.
not_available Hop down.
not_available Will you get ice and a sling, Lydia? Be right back.
not_available There's his anomalous left renal vein posterior to the aorta.
not_available Can you see that, Dr.
not_available Carter? We're standing by.
not_available Houston, do you read me? Loud and clear.
not_available This is very cool.
not_available Our first time on intercom.
not_available We usually have a nurse running back and forth between donor and recipient.
not_available Ready for countdown, Fin? 
not_available Ready and waiting.
not_available Clock starts.
not_available Why does it become interesting now, Dr.
not_available Carter? You want to monitor your ischemic time.
not_available Bingo.
not_available I'm lifting the kidney out.
not_available Basin, please.
not_available Ever pass the baton in a relay? I ran the 440 in high school.
not_available Good.
not_available Perfuse it.
not_available Good.
not_available That's it.
not_available Well, Dr.
not_available Carter don't get lost.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter's bringing the kidney your way.
not_available Oh, my God! Problem, Dr.
not_available Benton? No, not at all.
not_available Somebody wanna sign for this? What's your name? John Carter.
not_available Why don't you scrub in? You can join us for the second act.
not_available Great.
not_available Do you see this line right here? Come here.
not_available Take a look.
not_available See that? You know what that is? That is your first broken bone.
not_available You're officially a man.
not_available I let him talk me out of bringing him last night.
not_available He said it didn't hurt.
not_available He's such a tough guy.
not_available He didn't wanna get in trouble.
not_available He shouldn't be out after dark.
not_available It's tough to stay in when it's this warm.
not_available My mom says I'll get hurt.
not_available She does? What does your dad say? 
not_available I'm a klutz.
not_available He does? 
not_available He gets a lot of bumps and scrapes.
not_available His father's quite an athlete, you know? Do you fall down a lot? I'm not supposed to let him run around without watching.
not_available Let's play a game.
not_available I'll cover my eye.
not_available You do the same.
not_available You cover your own eye.
not_available Tell me if you can see my finger.
not_available Tell me when you see it.
not_available Don't look.
not_available Look straight ahead.
not_available Cover your eye.
not_available See it? 
not_available I see it.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's try the other eye, okay? So you found it, huh? 
not_available I did.
not_available How much have you read? I got past the part where the "alpha
not_available bitch Attending" goes to a faith healer to cure her limp.
not_available The seduction scene after that is really hot.
not_available I don't think whoever wrote it was being mean.
not_available It's a tonguein
not_available cheek romance.
not_available You gotta take it that way.
not_available Sounds like you got into it.
not_available It's a hoot.
not_available I think it's meant to be.
not_available Kerry, you wrote it.
not_available I did not.
not_available You did too.
not_available Why waste my time? For the money.
not_available There's a big market for this kind of thing.
not_available Too bad I didn't write it.
not_available Hey, somebody! I need help now! Is this the ALOC 57 called in? 
not_available He had a stroke.
not_available Why aren't you in uniform? 
not_available Day off.
not_available It's okay, Gramps.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available Take it easy, Pam.
not_available He had a stroke.
not_available I know it.
not_available We had stroke training last week.
not_available I did the SAS test.
not_available Slow down.
not_available He's got one
not_available sided weakness.
not_available I went to take him shopping.
not_available I always go on my day off.
not_available Give me the bullet.
not_available ALOC, slurred speech.
not_available Loss of motion on left side.
not_available He's never sick.
not_available Vitals? 
not_available BP 175 over 100.
not_available I didn't have a cuff.
not_available Pulse was 140.
not_available When did you find him? 
not_available 20 minutes ago.
not_available We were closer to Mercy, but Pam insisted on coming here.
not_available I knew you'd set up a stroke treatment program.
not_available Call Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available How's the time, Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available You're at 43 minutes.
not_available And anastomosis is completed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, why don't you move the DeBakey clamps? Can everybody see in here? It's pinking up.
not_available Look at that.
not_available That's what I live for.
not_available The sight of urine flowing.
not_available We got trouble in here.
not_available What? 
not_available Donor's hemorrhaging.
not_available He's tachycardic.
not_available Sounds like a tie slipped.
not_available Renal artery? 
not_available That'd be my guess.
not_available Let's open him up.
not_available He's losing blood fast.
not_available Get me a tonsil clamp.
not_available Let's stay in the game.
not_available We gotta close here.
not_available That ophthalmologist has messages.
not_available He's finishing up.
not_available Opthamologist? You're giving him the million
not_available dollar workup.
not_available What do you mean? If you're a Palmer, you get the full treatment here.
not_available Would I put a kid through unnecessary tests to impress his family? I guess not.
not_available Retinitis pigmentosa.
not_available He's going blind.
not_available I was afraid of that.
not_available Getting hurt at night? His parents will want to hear the options.
not_available Possible brain attack? Yes.
not_available This is Paramedic Olbes' grandfather.
not_available Let's get a CBC, PT, PTT, platelet count fibrinogen, type and cross 4 units.
not_available Team's on alert.
not_available Malik, record the BP.
not_available Stick of glucose.
not_available Alert Radiology that we're coming in for a noncontrast head CT.
not_available BP's 185 over 110.
not_available IV labetalol 15 mgs.
not_available Sir, do you know where you are? Can you help him? 
not_available What's his name? Everybody calls him Gramps.
not_available Gramps, can you tell me what happened? Sir, can you squeeze my hand? Can you squeeze? Did he complain of headaches? 
not_available No.
not_available I talked to him last night.
not_available Nausea? Vomiting? Is your grandfather on any medications? Does he take aspirin? 
not_available No.
not_available He hates pills.
not_available Are you gonna give him TPA? That's what he needs, right? We're trying to assess that.
not_available Do you know when the symptoms began? Do you know anybody who might? Maybe his neighbor.
not_available They walk together in the morning.
not_available Can you give him a call? Go! Go.
not_available CT's ready for us.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get him upstairs.
not_available I was afraid of this with the stroke team.
not_available People heard of a miracle cure.
not_available They don't understand the risks.
not_available I understand the risks.
not_available I've seen patients hemorrhage with TPA.
not_available It's no cure
not_available all.
not_available That's why we follow protocol.
not_available The results aren't convincing.
not_available I understand you have reservations.
not_available That's why I'm on the team and you're not.
not_available Fine.
not_available But if she can't clarify the onset of symptoms I'd be a fool to give TPA.
not_available It's just an interview.
not_available They'll ask me a bunch of nosy questions.
not_available They have to be sure they have reliable candidates.
not_available That's what makes me nervous.
not_available I don't deserve this help.
not_available Everyone deserves help from their friends.
not_available Friends, huh? It reminds me of when we first met before we even started dating.
not_available We were never friends.
not_available I always had my eye on you, wondering when I'd make my move.
not_available See? You're a good liar.
not_available You'll do fine on the interview.
not_available CT confirms an ischemic stroke.
not_available Gramps' neighbor verified that he had no symptoms two hours ago.
not_available So he's easily within the If you're looking for my blessing on this, forget it.
not_available I was hoping you'd talk to Olbes.
not_available She's heard from the neurologist and from me that we think her grandfather is a candidate for TPA.
not_available I'd like her to hear the risks from you.
not_available I happen to believe that he'll respond to thrombolysis.
not_available But if I'm wrong, he could die.
not_available She needs to hear that clearly.
not_available You want me to tell her? Who better than a respected colleague on the other side of the fence? I suspect you won't soft
not_available pedal it.
not_available I won't.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How's he doing? It looks like they got the bleeding under control.
not_available They're closing.
not_available This is a first.
not_available Usually he's had a shower before I get finished.
not_available Would you gentlemen care to join us for the postgame wrap
not_available up? We find that debriefing can be useful when there's been a complication.
not_available Yes.
not_available We'd be honored.
not_available You had a call from Carla Reece.
not_available Would you like the number? 
not_available I got it.
not_available Carter, you coming? 
not_available Shirley? Can you call Recovery? Ask them to page me when Jean Twomey wakes up? Sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kramer, I was wondering if I could interview this candidate.
not_available Al Boulet? You know him? I'm familiar with his treatment.
not_available I'm curious to see what he's like.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Fischer.
not_available Thanks for taking the time to fill out all these forms.
not_available I thought I was meeting a Dr.
not_available Kramer.
not_available I'm helping him out.
not_available All the information looks complete.
not_available You mentioned some slip
not_available ups with your drug regimen in the past.
not_available So many pills to keep track of.
not_available I've got it under control now.
not_available You began treatment a year ago? 
not_available Right.
not_available You contracted AIDS through? Heterosexual contact, I guess.
not_available I mean, since I never shot up or had sex with a guy.
not_available You couldn't identify the partner who infected you? I contacted all the women I could to let them know.
not_available No one had any prior infection.
not_available But it was a lot of years and a lot of women.
not_available Now you live alone? 
not_available Right.
not_available That factor mitigates against your inclusion in the trial.
not_available Participants must adhere to a strict regimen.
not_available Participants should have someone to back them up.
not_available I'm sure I can handle it.
not_available And I have backup.
not_available My ex
not_available wife is around off and on.
not_available Off and on? 
not_available A lot, recently.
not_available I mean, she's kind of back in my life.
not_available Stays over and all.
not_available She's a physician assistant.
not_available She'll keep on me.
not_available Make me stick to it.
not_available I see.
not_available Once Jeanie takes something on, she doesn't mess around.
not_available Ten mgs TPA over one minute.
not_available Follow with 50 milligrams over the next hour.
not_available For a total dosage of 60 mgs.
not_available Monitor his vital signs and maintain a diastolic of under 110.
not_available Now we wait? Now we wait.
not_available In retrospect, studying Mr.
not_available Twomey's renal angiogram we might have predicted a problem.
not_available With the angiogram and a crystal ball, maybe.
not_available Look at the short renal vein.
not_available Do you appreciate that, Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available I think he's being hard on himself.
not_available How did we do on ischemic time? 
not_available We can do better.
not_available Lf you weren't so chintzy with the ureter.
not_available Give me something to work with.
not_available Let's go step by step.
not_available I lost time dividing the vein.
not_available Our biggest deviation was anastomosis 21 minutes.
not_available What are you saying? She denied it, but I could tell it was true.
not_available I bet she wrote it on that free time.
not_available When she was on suspension.
not_available Did you get that history from the abdominal pain in Exam 2? What? 
not_available You little slut.
not_available I see you in a whole new light.
not_available We know you wrote it.
not_available I didn't write it.
not_available You ought to be proud of it.
not_available Kerry, did you tell She wrote the book.
not_available Nice try.
not_available I'd make myself the villain? 
not_available I knew it was you.
not_available I didn't do it! 
not_available You thought it was Jeanie.
not_available Or Carol.
not_available I knew it was an incurable romantic who was warped.
not_available I'm not warped.
not_available This is cool.
not_available Watch it.
not_available The big spinout, baby! Hit the button.
not_available Hit the "down" button.
not_available Hop off.
not_available I know you've been given a lot of information.
not_available This is a tough time.
not_available There are a lot of new interventions.
not_available P.
not_available K.'s doctor will be able to fill you in on those.
not_available I like Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available We all do, sweetie.
not_available I like you too.
not_available Make sure you keep these glasses on.
not_available Okay? Where's your sweater? I know where I left it.
not_available Let's get that sweater.
not_available One thing to be careful about is that he doesn't feel like he's been bad.
not_available Sometimes kids with RP feel like it's their fault.
not_available We'll be careful of that.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye, you guys.
not_available See you.
not_available No holding you back.
not_available Some people think of RP as looking through a telescope.
not_available I owe you an apology.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I have no reason to question your integrity.
not_available As a doctor, at least.
not_available Everything's so glib with you these days.
not_available I don't know what matters to you.
not_available Me, either.
not_available Great job, Carol.
not_available Did you know she wrote the book? 
not_available Are you kidding? She stole the idea from me.
not_available I did not write the damn book! Welcome back.
not_available You're doing well.
not_available Why isn't Carl here? Nobody will tell me anything.
not_available He's still under anesthesia.
not_available Why? What went wrong? 
not_available Your brother's fine.
not_available There were some complications, some bleeding.
not_available They had to open him again.
not_available I was afraid of something like this.
not_available He's stabilized.
not_available He's fine.
not_available I wouldn't tell you if it wasn't true.
not_available I'll see if they can move him here with you.
not_available I'll stay with him until he wakes up.
not_available Great.
not_available Any response? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Seen Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available You just missed him.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? I'd like you to meet a new Resident, Anna Del Amico.
not_available This is our Pedes Fellow.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available Mutual.
not_available So you're starting early? I'm doing a Pedes elective before my Residency starts.
not_available We always welcome slave labor in Pedes.
not_available I'll show you around.
not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico is a pediatrician.
not_available She's double
not_available boarding in Emergency Medicine.
not_available What we need around here, more overachievers.
not_available There you are.
not_available Can you believe it? I'm getting out of here on time.
not_available Al qualifies for the trial.
not_available He should read over this, then pick up his meds.
not_available Shouldn't you tell him? We left a message, but I figured you'd probably see him first.
not_available Greg, what's going on? I've been asking myself that for the last two months.
not_available I thought I was honest with you.
not_available That I understood the reasons you'd be hesitant about getting involved.
not_available I guess I missed one.
not_available You're still involved with your ex
not_available husband.
not_available After how he treated you, he still uses you to get him meds.
not_available He didn't manipulate me.
not_available But you do still love him? I don't know.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, can I ask you something? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Did you ever think Carol Hathaway might be interested in me at all? Did you ever pick up on anything? No, I can't say that I have.
not_available Have you read her book? 
not_available What book? Carol wrote a book.
not_available There's some parts about me that are pretty flattering.
not_available Did she say anything about me? It seems a little amateurish.
not_available I was impressed.
not_available I didn't read much.
not_available A few pages.
not_available You gotta give it a chance.
not_available Didn't you think Carol's book was pretty decent? The part I read was racist.
not_available Don't tell Carol I said that.
not_available You didn't like the Latina nurse? 
not_available It wasn't real.
not_available I didn't think the ethnic characters were handled any differently.
not_available Have you seen Mark? Gramps' blood pressure is going up.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available No, I was looking for him too.
not_available Look who's here.
not_available You did it.
not_available You did it.
not_available Okay, no fighting.
not_available I did it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? They're doing really well.
not_available Where did you go? 
not_available To make sure they saw each other.
not_available Two of the best transplant surgeons let us look over their shoulders debriefing on the most fascinating procedure we've participated in and you just get up and leave.
not_available I promised the sister.
not_available I knew she'd be worried.
not_available Is that a problem? I don't know.
not_available Another message from Carla Reece.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I got her machine.
not_available She left an extension.
not_available OB, I think.
not_available Will you take Dr.
not_available Del Amico back? I'm intimidated enough already.
not_available Anna, please.
not_available All right, Anna.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Did you find a place yet? I don't know Chicago.
not_available I thought I'd look this weekend.
not_available Hey, guys! Oh, my God! It's Mark! 
not_available What happened? Stabilize his neck.
not_available Where do I find a Ccollar? 
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Help Doug.
not_available Hold his neck.
not_available In
not_available line stabilization.
not_available I got it.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available Is he an ER doc? Attending.
not_available Give me the collar, please! 
not_available Get the board ready.
not_available Slowly, slowly, slowly.
not_available Here we go.
not_available We'll roll him.
not_available Easy.
not_available First roll him towards me.
not_available Let's roll him.
not_available Slide the board in.
not_available Be gentle.
not_available That's fine, right there.
not_available Okay, roll him back.
not_available Go, roll.
not_available Gently.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available Now hang in there.
not_available Let's get him monitored.
not_available Crosstable C
not_available spine, chest CBC, type and hold.
not_available On my count we'll lift him.
not_available Nice and gentle.
not_available Real slow.
not_available All right, Malik? One, two three.
not_available Go.
not_available Alert CT.
not_available He's vomiting.
not_available Watch for aspirations.
not_available Let's roll him! What's going on? Oh, my God! Mark! Pulse is 120.
not_available Resps 24.
not_available BP's 100 over 60.
not_available What happened? 
not_available We need to put on a mask.
not_available 15 liters.
not_available We need to rule out pneumothorax.
not_available Chuny, aren't you with the stroke team? Go back to your patient.
not_available Go on! Come on! 
not_available Now! Get back there.
not_available Pupils are round and sluggish, react to light.
not_available Possible hyphema.
not_available DTR's 2
not_available plus, bilaterally.
not_available Babinski's negative.
not_available Radiology's on the way.
not_available Oh, my God, it's true! 
not_available We got crunchy ribs here.
not_available I'll get the bleeding under control.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available New Resident.
not_available Guarding and tenderness.
not_available Abdominal CT? You bet.
not_available Give him the works.
not_available Come on! She was in my office when the contractions started.
not_available Her membrane hasn't ruptured, and the baby isn't in distress.
not_available Is she dilated? 
not_available Two centimeters.
not_available I admitted her.
not_available I put her on bed rest.
not_available With luck, we can keep her from going into labor.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Coburn.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn said they stopped the contractions.
not_available You mind if I sit? You pretty much have to stay like this? Exactly like this.
not_available For eight weeks.
not_available Can I get you anything? No, just sit there.
not_available And entertain me.
not_available Never mind.
not_available What? You know, I was wondering about it I think I know when this baby was conceived.
not_available Me too.
not_available Really? Oh, yeah.
not_available Really.
not_available You remember that morning? Seems like a long time ago.
not_available Yeah, it does.
not_available Possible side 
effects Bloating, nausea, sustained diarrhea Stop reading that.
not_available I don't have a single vice left.
not_available Forget beer.
not_available Sometimes I'd double my viral load for a glass of milk.
not_available I don't mind the soy stuff.
not_available Well, you were always a pushover.
not_available Yes, I was.
not_available And I took it for granted.
not_available You know what I miss most about us? Hearing you laugh.
not_available The sound of you laughing in the dark.
not_available We both took a lot for granted.
not_available I don't take anything for granted anymore.
not_available I'd better go.
not_available Sure.
not_available Or stay on the couch if you want.
not_available I don't wanna stay on the couch.
not_available Then you better go.
not_available I'll stay on the couch.
not_available Me too.
not_available Wait.
not_available Can you stay right there? 
not_available I doubt it.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I don't have a condom that's not over a year old.
not_available And I have to have one, right? You're right.
not_available I could have a different strain than you.
not_available And we need to be safe.
not_available I'll be two minutes.
not_available Will you wait? I'll try.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's what I missed.
not_available CT's negative.
not_available He was lucky.
not_available Gotta get Ortho to look at that hand.
not_available I'll see what's keeping him.
not_available Any change? And nobody saw anything? I told the cops that basketball player's brother was around.
not_available A psych guy threatened Dr.
not_available Greene this morning.
not_available The cops will want to hear about that.
not_available The kid with the allergic reaction is in Exam 2.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available Can you rustle me up a lab coat? 
not_available I'll find you one.
not_available It's usually not this crazy here.
not_available Not a problem.
not_available Can you check this out? I'll be back.
not_available Keep working, people.
not_available We still got an ER to run.
not_available What about Rachel? 
not_available The sitter's gonna keep her tonight.
not_available He had a response a few minutes ago.
not_available His speech is coming back.
not_available Something is wrong.
not_available Yeah, Gramps.
not_available You had a stroke.
not_available You're gonna be better now.
not_available I couldn't do that He's being admitted upstairs.
not_available I guess Dr.
not_available Greene made the right call.
not_available I want to thank him.
not_available I'll tell him for you.
not_available He'll be very pleased.
not_available GCS is still 13.
not_available I know.
not_available You just checked 10 minutes ago.
not_available How's his IV rate? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Don't want to overhydrate.
not_available I cut it back.
not_available You have him on 80 cc's an hour.
not_available He weighs about 80 kilos Why don't you find out what's keeping Ortho? I'm bugging you that much? 
not_available I guess I'll call Ortho.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available He's back.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Hi, buddy.
not_available What happened? You got beat up.
not_available But you're okay.
not_available You got bruised ribs and a concussion.
not_available Midshaft fractures and two metacarpals.
not_available Other than that, you're fine.
not_available I signed you up for a double Saturday.
not_available What happened?
