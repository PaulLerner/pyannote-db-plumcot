not_available I don't know.
not_available He's not the first to lose his temper in the heat of the moment.
not_available Over a lavage kit? 
not_available You know what? He's been doing this for 30 years.
not_available He doesn't like the newer equipment.
not_available I know you two are close.
not_available What are you trying to say? 
not_available He's acting a bit strange.
not_available Yeah, he's eccentric.
not_available But he's a great doctor.
not_available Don't be defensive.
not_available I'm not.
not_available You don't like that I hired Gabe.
not_available I did, so deal with it.
not_available I repaired Ben's liver.
not_available He's fine.
not_available Any complications? 
not_available We gave him some blood, but I expect a full recovery.

not_available What happened today, Howie? If you have any information, you should let me know.
not_available It might help us treat Mr.
not_available Sutherland.
not_available Do you promise to keep this secret? Doctor/patient confidentiality and all that? I can promise you'll feel better if you tell me the truth.
not_available The right eye will be fine.
not_available But glass sliced through the left eyeball and displaced the lens.
not_available When can they fix that? 
not_available It will be a difficult job.
not_available Can I see? I don't think thatJeez

not_available The jocks talked me into it.
not_available I switched the chemicals.
not_available It was supposed to be a small, exothermic reaction.
not_available A little smoke and a few bubbles, that's all.
not_available But Mr.
not_available Sutherland changed the experiment.
not_available This wasn't supposed to happen.
not_available It was just a joke.
not_available You son of a bitch! Sir? 
not_available My son is blind because of you.

not_available Let's bag him.
not_available No breath sounds.
not_available Not pinking up.
not_available Intubation was good, I saw the cords.
not_available He's blowing up.
not_available Subcutaneous emphysema.
not_available You broke his larynx? 
not_available Let's prep him for a crike.
not_available It could be below the cricoid.
not_available Let's trach him.
not_available What about the tube? 
not_available Pull it out.
not_available Pulse ox at 81.
not_available Heart rate's down to 50.
not_available Amp of atropine.
not_available Carter, blow some oxygen down there.
not_available I'm not seeing his chest rise.
not_available Pulse ox 76.
not_available Run of five.
not_available Get a crash cart.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Bag him.
not_available I'm getting breath sounds.
not_available Pulse ox up to 85.
not_available That was a nice save.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I spoke to the plastic surgeon and he said your burns shouldn't scar too badly.
not_available Right.
not_available Well, um I'll check in later.
not_available If you need anything, hit the buzzer.
not_available I'm gonna have scars.
not_available The new skin may have irregular pigmentation.
not_available But it's only temporary.
not_available How temporary? Six months to a year.
not_available The plastic surgeon will know more.
not_available I might look like this for a year? No, no.
not_available Um it will take up to a year, but you may heal much faster.
not_available Okay? How much faster? I don't know.
not_available It'll get a little better each day.
not_available You were lucky, Quinn.
not_available You think this is lucky? I look like a hideous freak.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available You look like like a girl who was lucky enough to survive a dangerous accident.
not_available I'd rather be dead than look like this.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Peachy.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available I think Mr.
not_available Perez might feel differently.
not_available I saw it.
not_available Mark.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Howie, you all right? Yeah.
not_available How's Mr.
not_available Perez? 
not_available He's gonna be okay.
not_available But not Mr.
not_available Sutherland, huh? I don't know.
not_available A lot of kids thought he was a geek.
not_available He'd mess up the experiments sometimes, but he did it on purpose just to make class a little more fun.
not_available He was a really good teacher.
not_available He might recover, right? Like a long shot or something? Like one in a million? Yeah.
not_available I told him.
not_available I told my father I was HIV positive.
not_available Good for you.
not_available He kicked me out.
not_available You know, he might just need a little time.
not_available He said I'm not his son.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available At least he knows the truth.
not_available Screw him if he can't handle it.
not_available It might be a few days before I can get you into detox.
not_available Should have made reservations.
not_available You can be an outpatient.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You need help.
not_available I need a real job.
not_available I watched you here today.
not_available You, the doctors, the cops, paramedics.
not_available Everybody's doing something important and I eat paint.
not_available You need to talk to someone.
not_available I don't need a shrink.
not_available See you around.
not_available Can you speak to one of my patients? 
not_available Go away, Dave.
not_available You fixed that last guy good.
not_available Real good.
not_available This one's different.
not_available I got a teenage girl who burned her face.
not_available She's really depressed 
not_available and nothing I say is helping.
not_available Really? About the hockey game, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel.
not_available Everything all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Something came up.
not_available So I can see.
not_available What? 
not_available Moods swings, haggard brow.
not_available Inability to concentrate.
not_available All signs of woman problems.
not_available It's that obvious? 
not_available If you've been married enough.
not_available And I met her today.
not_available I don't forget a pretty face.
not_available You got any professional advice? 
not_available What? From me? I'll diagnose any disease but I can't figure out women.
not_available That's what makes them so irresistible.
not_available But I do know life's too short to waste on regret.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lawrence.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got your films.
not_available Anyone seen the pregnant woman in 3? 
not_available No, sorry.
not_available I think she left.
not_available She was supposed to go to detox.
not_available How's he doing? Chest is clear.
not_available Setting at 98 on two liters.
not_available I'd give him albuterol and I'll stop by tomorrow.
not_available I had a question about DNA testing.
not_available What about it? Sometimes we get single moms who have questions about DNA testing.
not_available Can we do anything here? Yeah, we've got a kit you can use.
not_available Just call my office.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He said my skin would be discolored.
not_available The new skin will be sensitive to UV rays.
not_available So you have to use lots of sunscreen.
not_available So much for my tan next summer.
not_available Your skin will look younger for it.
not_available There will come a day when younger is better.
not_available Trust me.
not_available What about my hair? It'll be thinner.
not_available But it will grow back.
not_available How long does that take? Does it grow fast? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, you might have to wear a wig.
not_available You could go blond.
not_available It's true what they say.
not_available Just be patient.
not_available And if you have any questions call me or Dr.
not_available Dave.
not_available Okay? Thank you.
not_available Wow, you're good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I mean really good.
not_available You're welcome, Dave.
not_available Chief.
not_available You wanted to see me? No? I heard you had a question about my leg.
not_available Me? No, not me.
not_available I had a patient with a bad ankle.
not_available Someone must have misunderstood.
not_available Oh.
not_available I see.
not_available Well if you do ever want to know, you should just ask.
not_available No problem.
not_available But it's none of my business, right? No.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available If it isn't the lean, Greene fighting machine.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available That you caused.
not_available Self
not_available defense.
not_available Oh? 
not_available He attacked Carter.
not_available Carter didn't crush his throat.
not_available I want a formal apology to Mr.
not_available Perez.
not_available Fine.
not_available Something else? I didn't bring this on.
not_available I'll try to do damage control but his family will be coming in.
not_available They want a sacrificial lamb and right now, you are looking pretty woolly.
not_available ER? Hey, Jeanie.
not_available How's Carlos? Good.
not_available No, Kerry left already.
not_available Mark? Yeah.
not_available He's right here, honey.
not_available Jeanie, it's Mark.
not_available Sorry I had to rush out.
not_available He's better, he's just a little wheezy.
not_available Tell Kerry I'll be late tomorrow.
not_available Thanks, Mark.
not_available Okay.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Hey, big boy.
not_available How's my favorite little man? How's my favorite little man? 
not_available John.
not_available Hi.
not_available What are you doing here? Can I come in? If you want me to leave, just say so.
not_available I don't want your sympathy.
not_available I know.
not_available Gabe? 
not_available Hey, Kerry.
not_available Is everything all right? 
not_available I think somebody stole my car.
not_available What? I never leave it unlocked.
not_available Maybe I did.
not_available I left the house in such a hurry.
not_available Are you sure you' re on this level? What? Did you park on this level? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Every day I park on four so I can get a space.
not_available This is three.
not_available What an idiot.
not_available After a while they all look the same.
not_available I swear, I'd forget my head if it wasn't attached.
not_available Do you want me to help? No, thanks.
not_available Please.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Okay, good night, Gabe.
not_available Good night.
