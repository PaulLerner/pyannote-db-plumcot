not_available I don't wanna die.
not_available Then you should fight.
not_available With everything you have.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I want you to stop being so afraid.
not_available I'm not afraid.
not_available I'm want us to stop being so careful.
not_available I'm just

not_available This graveyard shift's going forever.
not_available You okay? I love you too, Carter, but it's over.
not_available I'm gonna ask her tonight.
not_available Youre going to propose? Actually, I already did, but badly.
not_available She said no? 
not_available She didn't say anything.
not_available But this time I'm gonna do it right.
not_available That is a nice rock.
not_available That was my great
not_available grandmother's.
not_available Great
not_available grandfather gave it to her the day he left for the Army.

not_available Way to start the day, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can I buy you some breakfast? Okay.
not_available So, what's that youre reading? The workplace sensitivity manual.
not_available Weaver wants me to learn it.
not_available What's? What's "schmuck"? 
not_available Schmuck? It's one of the inappropriate words.
not_available "Schmuck," "puts" No, I think you mean "putz." 
not_available Putz.
not_available "Peckerwood." Is that a tree? Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Oh, my God.
not_available Gray matter.
not_available No pulse.
not_available We should get the police.

not_available Oh, God.
not_available GSW to the head.
not_available Exit wound through the spine.
not_available Theyre gone.
not_available Trina.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available She's breathing.
not_available Go get help.
not_available Do you remember the Rileys? You guys stayed with them when you were about 10 or so.
not_available Yeah, they had a cabin up by Mount Lutsen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Eric used to call Sonia "Gammy. 
not_available Grammy.
not_available Grammy.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Maybe he went there.
not_available Maybe.
not_available They were really good with you when things were bad.
not_available They
not_available They took you fishing.
not_available Remember? 
not_available Yeah, in Grand Rapids.
not_available At Grand Rapids.
not_available I cut my finger.
not_available Yeah, with a hook.
not_available Eric caught this great, big old smelly fish.
not_available He acted like he found gold, for God's sakes.
not_available He'll be okay, Mom.
not_available I know.
not_available I should pack.
not_available Is that John? 
not_available No.
not_available It's work, but guess what.
not_available He asked me to marry him.
not_available Really? Well, he didn't really mean it.
not_available I mean, it was
not_available We were on the roof it was freezing, there was a helicopter flying around, and he was kind of shouting it at me.
not_available It's every girl's dream, right? What'd you say? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Really, because, you know, he didn't mean it.
not_available It just
not_available It was just something that happened.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hi, it's Abby.
not_available What? Oh, my God.
not_available Was anybody there? No, from the ER.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available What's the matter? I
not_available I have to go.
not_available But come by the hospital later, and I'll give you a ride to the bus station.
not_available Okay.
not_available Or you could stay a few more days.
not_available No, I
not_available I have to get back to work.
not_available Be here waiting in case he shows up.
not_available What if he shows up in Minnesota? Youre right.
not_available Nothing confirmed.
not_available Looks like you got multiple shooters on the loose.
not_available She's dropping her sats.
not_available Keep those people away from the building.
not_available Can we talk to her now in case she can't later? Setting up for multiple traumas.
not_available How many? 
not_available One.
not_available Three were pronounced on the scene.

not_available Luka? Just need a minute.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, patron saint of lost causes.
not_available GSW to head and chest.
not_available Tension pneumo.
not_available One's clear.
not_available Hey.
not_available You all right? Yeah.
not_available I'm a little nauseous.
not_available It takes me a couple days to get back up to terminal.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available There was a shooting across the street.
not_available Anybody you know? 
not_available No, but still.
not_available Kind of scary when it happens so close.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So I heard you' re getting released today.
not_available My next round of chemotherapy's in about two days, so I thought I'd come by, say so long.
not_available How's your mom doing? You mean is she still pissed at you? No, I didn't mean exactly that, but 
not_available She's still pissed at you.
not_available Good to know.
not_available She's upstairs with the "doc.
not_available " Does she know you' re here? I kind of snuck off.
not_available I actually might need one of those basins.
not_available I think you need some IV Compazine.
not_available That sounds good.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll go tell your mom you' re here.
not_available Will you watch him for a minute? I'm not a child.
not_available Yeah, Marky! Yeah, Marky! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

not_available What, you wanna go? Forget about it.
not_available We won.
not_available Let's get some breakfast.
not_available Come on.
not_available Next week.
not_available That's what I thought.
not_available I thought you were on later.
not_available I heard what happened.
not_available I thought we might need help.
not_available Actually, we only got the one.
not_available Three went straight to the morgue.
not_available Sorry I didn't come by last night.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Maggie and I played Scrabble.
not_available I got a 75
not_available point word.
not_available Really? 
not_available "Cyanotic." She challenged it.
not_available found brutally murdered early this morning inside of this establishment.
not_available Doc Magoo's a diner frequented by staff and visitors of County General Hospital.
not_available The crime was committed prior to opening as the staff was preparing for a day of serving the usual sandwiches and sodas.
not_available What got served instead was a coldblooded robberyhomicide in which four people were murdered execution
not_available style.
not_available One of them's still alive.
not_available Police are trying to identify suspects.
not_available More on the story later.
not_available Any word on Eric? I don't expect any.
not_available It's like a bear hibernating.
not_available He won't come out till spring.
not_available Hey, what do you say we go out tonight? Sushi.
not_available Just you and me.
not_available Maggie can fend for herself.
not_available Told her I'd drive her to the bus station.
not_available She's leaving? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Is that a good thing? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It was kind of nice having a roommate.
not_available Sushi? I hope you have a better plan than that.
not_available It's all about misdirection.
not_available I don't wanna show my hand too early.
not_available Well, the two of you have had enough misdirection.
not_available Trust me, show your hand.
not_available Move your toes, Trina.
not_available Good.
not_available O
not_available neg's here.
not_available Put it right on the infuser.

not_available I saw them drive up.
not_available Another 50 of fent.
not_available Knife back.
not_available Curved Kelly.
not_available I might have seen them getting away.
not_available Anything more specific? It was a 4x4, gold or tan maybe.
not_available It looked pretty new.
not_available Anything about the men? Height? Weight? What they were wearing? 
not_available It was far away.
not_available Into pleural space.
not_available Tube.
not_available Chen? OpSite and Polysporin.
not_available Tube's in.
not_available Hook up the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Any detail would help us.
not_available Sats are back up, 91.
not_available Were they Latinos? Black guys? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It happened so fast.
not_available Let's page Corday.
not_available Hey, Trina, you did really good.
not_available Rest up now, okay? For us to get to work here, we need a real description.
not_available I saw one of them.
not_available I think he was black.
not_available Driver, get out nice and calm.
not_available Face the vehicle.
not_available Welcome to the ' hood.
not_available Passenger, come around to this side.
not_available Face the vehicle.
not_available Put your hands up on the roof.
not_available Grab the roof.
not_available Hey, man, take it easy.
not_available License and registration's in the glove.
not_available Hey, what are we being stopped for? 
not_available Easy.
not_available Where'd you get money for a ride like this? We' re doctors at County.
not_available Where you headed in a hurry? 
not_available Y'all can't just do this.
not_available Just be quiet.
not_available I see you guys brought a lot of pals.
not_available What's the deal? 
not_available Four people shot this morning in a diner.
not_available What diner? We were just up at the Sedgwick Y in a pickup game.
not_available Call the gym manager.
not_available Why don't you search the car and let us get the hell out of here? All right, go ahead.
not_available See, that's my boss right now.
not_available Somebody's very sick.
not_available Look, we' re late for our shift.
not_available Dealers got shifts now, huh? 
not_available We are doctors, damn it.
not_available Relax, punk.
not_available No, wait a minute, I can explain that.
not_available I can explain! Get on the ground right now, or I'll put a bullet in your damn head.
not_available Cuff them.
not_available You belong to the Y? I play ball there twice a week.
not_available Who do you play with? I don't remember their names.
not_available Some live up the street from Greg.
not_available You show proof to the arresting officers? 
not_available Yeah, they took my ID.
not_available I told the arresting officer my ID was in the glove.
not_available Did you ever hear of a place called Magoo's? I work right across the street.
not_available Yes.
not_available We work right across the street from it.
not_available Did you ever own a firearm? I already told you no.
not_available No, I've never owned a firearm.
not_available Why are you hassling me? Just call County.
not_available Where'd you say you were? 
not_available You know, I told you where I was.
not_available What kind of a doctor are you? I'm a med
not_available I'm a med student.
not_available I'm a med student.
not_available What difference does that make? What kind of doctor are you? 
not_available I told you what I am.
not_available Look, we brought you in because you match the ID.
not_available Because I match the ID.
not_available What? Young, black and handsome? That's
not_available No, that's ridiculous.
not_available I'll send them over immediately.
not_available Jerry.
not_available Do we have photo IDs down here? 
not_available Yeah, bottom shelf.
not_available Messenger off personnel face sheets for Pratt and Gallant to Area Seven Headquarters.
not_available Really? Why? 
not_available Just do it.
not_available Susan, Sean Simmons is being discharged to home hospice care.
not_available I know, the cancer's back.
not_available While he's here waiting the mother has asked that you keep your distance.
not_available What? 
not_available She doesn't want you interacting with her son.
not_available What does Sean say? She's a grieving mother.
not_available I think we need to respect her wishes.
not_available Look, we should get their names or something.
not_available How else are we gonna file a complaint against them? Why don't you just be quiet? Story checked out at the Y.
not_available County confirmed you' re employed there.
not_available It's not like we didn't tell you guys that.
not_available You can pick up your stuff at the front desk.
not_available Have a nice day.
not_available Is her crit stable? Holding at 29 with two units in.
not_available Luka, if you wanna take it easy for a while we can keep you out of the trauma rooms assign you to noncritical
not_available care cases.
not_available If you need me anywhere, Kerry, you need me in here.
not_available We all have times where we could use a little less stress.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available There's nothing wrong with admitting that you need some help.
not_available I don't.
not_available Even so, I've scheduled a meeting with Dr.
not_available Meyers up on seven.
not_available It's a formality.
not_available Unless you wanna make it something more.
not_available But it's mandatory.
not_available You shouldn't have let them search the car.
not_available That's what you do when you' re innocent.
not_available I don't usually ride around with a bloody shirt.
not_available You guys hear what happened? 
not_available I thought none of our people got hurt.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei was first on the scene.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available A little freaked.
not_available I don't get it, man, how you could just roll over.
not_available That's the way it works sometimes.
not_available Yeah, if you let it.
not_available What are you gonna do, file a lawsuit? 
not_available That's one way to fight it.
not_available There is no fighting it.
not_available You know, I don't buy that.
not_available Carter wants the output on Bed 4 before he leaves.
not_available Look, we could be perfect, you know, like Gandhi.
not_available But as soon as the crap goes down, we'll be the first ones laid out with a gun to our head.
not_available Now, where I grew up, you see it every day.
not_available And if it happens to you enough, you get the message.
not_available You are not equal.
not_available You are not a full citizen.
not_available You are first, last and, above all, one thing and one thing 
only A suspect.
not_available You sure you wanna wait out here? Yeah, there's too many sick people in there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You' re welcome.
not_available Hey.
not_available Cold enough for you? My mom went ahead to help set up stuff for the home hospice team.
not_available Then she'll be coming to pick me up.
not_available I think you' re doing the right thing.
not_available I think it doesn't matter what you think.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't know why I'm so pissed at you.
not_available Guess it all just feels so much more real now.
not_available I keep daydreaming about the stuff that I wanted to do.
not_available Get really drunk at a college party.
not_available Go windsurfing.
not_available Get married and have kids.
not_available Stupid stuff like that.
not_available It's not stupid.
not_available Even after I got really sick I kept talking myself into believing that I had more time.
not_available At least enough to do some of those things.
not_available Sean Simmons? You know what? Hold on a second.
not_available Sean, I can't get you into college, and windsurfing's nuts.
not_available But you know what? Come on, let's get out of here.
not_available For real? 
not_available Yeah, come on.
not_available Not unless you have someplace else to go.
not_available I'm supposed to get him home.
not_available Yeah, could you call his mom for us? 
not_available Tell her we went on a date.
not_available I'll have him back by curfew.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Say maybe.
not_available Abby.
not_available Abby.
not_available Listen, I got ahold of Sonia Riley and I told her to call you here if she hears from Eric.
not_available I'll keep my eye open for messages.
not_available Can you get this banana bag to that guy? My leg
not_available splint girl's screaming.
not_available The Soupbox for lunch? Oh, you' re busy.
not_available We could go to that place across the street.
not_available That's not really a good idea today.
not_available Abby.
not_available Triage needs extra bodies.
not_available They got 20 kids from Kelton Elementary with vomiting and diarrhea.
not_available I'll be there in five minutes.
not_available Abby.
not_available Abby, it's okay.
not_available I can get to the bus station by myself.
not_available No, I'll take you.
not_available I'll take you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Levine, what's your problem? I just got drunk at a Valentine's Day party.
not_available Five days ago.
not_available Yeah, it was a blowout.
not_available I wanted to tell you
not_available Hey.
not_available No.
not_available Why did you take that out? It was itchy.
not_available Altered mental status.
not_available Abby, send up admit labs two sets of blood cultures, and grab an LP tray.
not_available Meningitis? 
not_available Let's find out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay, I'll call you when I get home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Nurses shortage, you know.
not_available Working in the ER can be a very inconvenient job sometimes.
not_available I'm sorry, John.
not_available I just wanted Eric to come home so bad so that I could be with my family just for a second.
not_available Abby and I were getting along so well.
not_available You should stay longer.
not_available You know, she would love it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Thank you, John.
not_available I can catch a cab out here, right? I'm off in a couple of minutes.
not_available I'll drive you.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Dr.
not_available Meyers.
not_available Please.
not_available So, what brings you here? Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available She told me to come.
not_available Well, why do you suppose she wanted us to meet? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available Well, that's not quite how it works.
not_available Hey, you' re a doctor.
not_available Someone comes to me with a problem, I tell them how to fix it, so Let's start with you telling me
not_available My problem? What's on your mind? My family died during the war in Croatia.
not_available So I came to America.
not_available I had a relationship with someone I cared about, which I then ruined.
not_available So I started to look for the answers in the wrong places.
not_available You know, like sex, drinking, living fast.
not_available I killed a patient I should have saved, then I almost killed a medical student in a car crash, so
not_available Woke up one morning and everything I thought I had was gone.
not_available Gone or broken.
not_available So, what do you have for that? Well, Dr.
not_available Kovac, it's not something that I can really
not_available Yeah, that's what I thought.
not_available I should get back to work.
not_available Tell Weaver I showed up.
not_available Further complicating the commute, a highspeed chase is underway snarling a twomile stretch of the I
not_available 40.
not_available Police are in pursuit of a tan SUV suspected of being connected to the grisly murders of three people early this morning in a coffee shop off South Foundry.
not_available A fourth victim 
not_available Do they consider the collateral damage of a pursuit like that? They' re hoping they kill them, avoid the wasted time and money of due process.
not_available They might have the wrong suspects.
not_available Last time I checked, the police were still on our side.
not_available Well, what exactly is our side? 
not_available Tell her what happened.
not_available They laid us out on the sidewalk, they took us in, and they interrogated us.
not_available That's terrible.
not_available The real problem is you guys are guilty.
not_available Guilty of what? 
not_available DWB.
not_available Driving while black.
not_available Just forget it.
not_available The police play the odds just like us.
not_available They look for horses, not zebras.
not_available Tell me you don't think that's the same thing.
not_available Look, it's about percentages.
not_available Last time I flew to London they pulled two Arab men out of line for a security check.
not_available I hate to admit it, it made me feel more secure.
not_available You think they'd pull over two Arabs driving through Highland Park? No, because terrorist acts in Highland Park aren't high on the list of concerns.
not_available But violent crime by African
not_available Americans certainly is.
not_available Like I said, we should drop it.
not_available So you really believe racial profiling is a legitimate law
not_available enforcement tool? A lot of people do.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I don't know whose day's been worse, yours or mine.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You? I never thought I'd see something like that.
not_available It's different when they roll in on a gurney.
not_available Yeah, but you stepped up.
not_available That's all that counts.
not_available I did my job.
not_available At least we saved one of them.
not_available So I heard she gave an ID.
not_available Partial one.
not_available I filled in some details.
not_available What, you saw the guys? A glimpse as they drove off.
not_available They were black, huh? 
not_available I think so.
not_available You think so? Well, it was quick, you know? But
not_available And I only saw one of them.
not_available So that's why the cops are picking up brothers all over town.
not_available I told them what I saw.
not_available What you saw, or what you thought you saw? I was trying to help, Greg.
not_available Can't you see you fed right into what they always wanna jump to? Look, I'm really sorry for what happened to you, but that's on the cops, not me.
not_available It's all part of the same thing.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available So, what, now I'm a racist? It's just hard not to feel that everybody is when you' re lying in the street with a cop's foot to the back of your neck.
not_available I've never seen it like this.
not_available It's okay, there will be a later bus.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's not your music, that's Abby's.
not_available She always liked that noise.
not_available I'm getting used to it.
not_available There's an accident up ahead.
not_available Sit tight, we'll keep you posted.
not_available Thank
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Well 
not_available Thank you for this, John.
not_available I know it's a huge inconvenience.
not_available It's no problem.
not_available I'm sorry for getting so upset.
not_available I hate being so pathetic.
not_available Just the idea of going home alone and waiting 
not_available Eric will turn up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, but I worry about both of them.
not_available Abby's good.
not_available You know, we' re both good.
not_available You don't have to worry about that.
not_available She told me.
not_available She told me you might get married.
not_available Is that what she said? 
not_available No, she told me you proposed.
not_available I know she's work, it runs in the family, but she's so worth it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I spend 23 hours a day wondering whether we' re wrong for each other.
not_available Wondering whether we've got the energy that we need to get through everything that we seem to get into.
not_available Whether the baggage we both bring would sink a small ship.
not_available But in the 24th hour, I realize I've been thinking about her for 23 hours.
not_available And I come back to, there's something about her that I can't stay away from.
not_available Something about her that makes me wanna love her.
not_available Julia, my sister, read this story about a little Japanese girl who had cancer.
not_available And she tried to make a thousand paper cranes because she thought if she did, it would make her wish come true.
not_available What was her wish? 
not_available To get better.
not_available So how many paper cuts do you have? A lot.
not_available But my wish is kind of different.
not_available What is it? It's hard to explain.
not_available I kiss pretty good for a dead kid, huh? Not bad at all.
not_available Cop wounded in a multi
not_available car collision.
not_available BP, 124/68, pulse, 96, good sats.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei, take him in.
not_available I'll wait on the next.
not_available Find the guys? 
not_available The guys opened fire.
not_available We have a bunch of cops hurt.
not_available Mitch Palnick, 41year
not_available old officer.

not_available Or nothing.
not_available You never know what's gonna happen.
not_available Or you do.
not_available You mean drinking? I drank, I smoked when I was younger.

not_available Maybe Abby will be stronger.

not_available I hear it's bad for you.
not_available Yeah, thanks for the advice.
not_available No, you should be thanking this brother.

not_available You need cops like me to catch animals like that.
not_available "Sorry" would've been a whole lot easier.
not_available You gonna tell me what this is about? 
not_available I thought we both deserved a break.
not_available Especially after a day like today.
not_available Feels more like a month.
not_available But what's it really all about? So you think this is a keeper? The restaurant? 
not_available Us.
not_available You and me.
not_available Are you okay? I've spent a long time looking for a relationship that I thought would stick.

not_available But never make me ask you twice again, okay? Yes, ma'am.
not_available A couple of cops got real hurt trying to bring in those guys that killed those people.
not_available And that's why Mitch is here, because he won't let scum like that get away.
not_available Still, maybe we overstepped this morning.
not_available I think we did.
not_available But thanks for fixing up my partner.
