not_available But you looked at me and said that we were gonna do this together.
not_available And I know that you'll be back before the baby's born but I just hate that you wanna go.
not_available And I hate that I hate that you wanna go.

not_available You ready, kiddo? 
not_available I didn't know you guys moved.

not_available See you later, Luka.
not_available So, uh, do you guys live there now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Wow.
not_available That's a big change.
not_available It was either that or double up on my shifts here.

not_available Is this part of the deal too? I guess.
not_available We're good, Luka.
not_available Really.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Gallant? Is everything okay? Are you all right? Can I get you anything? No, thank you.

not_available And I see why Michael fell in love with you.
not_available I can tell you love him too.
not_available I do.
not_available Very much.
not_available And that's good.
not_available I just wish that love was always enough.
not_available God knows I love that man in the other room.
not_available But here I am.
not_available You know Michael always talked about what great parents you were.
not_available Maybe there's still a chance to workHave you any idea why Michael went back to Iraq? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available Mm.
not_available I guess he felt like he was needed there.
not_available He has a strong sense of duty.
not_available Ah! Duty.
not_available For years, I have sacrificed and compromised moving from one sorry little town to the next.
not_available All because of duty.
not_available The boy's his father's son.
not_available They're soldiers.
not_available And no matter how much you love them there's always another war.
not_available I'm not quite sure what you're trying to tell me.
not_available What I'm trying to tell you is that a strong marriage is about two people.
not_available Now, Michael's a good man.
not_available Michael is kind.
not_available He is loving, he is generous.
not_available Just like his father.
not_available But if staying here at County, in Chicago is something that you want to do, then that's what you should do.
not_available Never let anybody or anything make you ever forget who you are.
not_available Miss Taggart, please, come quickly.
not_available Mr.
not_available Elliot, you're awake.
not_available I couldn't get him to open his eyes.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Go make sure they don't ruin the duck.
not_available Mr.
not_available Elliot
not_available Regina, I've got 20 people waiting here.
not_available Please, go.

not_available You might wanna think about canceling your dinner.
not_available Transfusion's supposed to last three weeks.
not_available Well, not this time.
not_available You need blood.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available It'll take three hours.
not_available I got guests.
not_available Let's get you on some oxygen at least.
not_available Out of the question.
not_available How will I be able to sing, huh? With a tube up my nose? This is serious.
not_available You're obviously anemic right now.
not_available Really? Well, I'll be done by 9.
not_available You can transfuse me then.
not_available You hired me to take care of you.
not_available If you'll not let me do my job, I don't know what I'm doing here.
not_available What you're doing here, now, Samantha, is you're working for me.
not_available Maybe I shouldn't be working for you.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Rents are signing some paperwork for your transfer.
not_available I guess they want you at the highfalutin hospital in the suburbs.
not_available Yeah, that sounds like them.
not_available We were able to get ahold of your father, Deshawn.
not_available He should be here pretty soon.
not_available We called Dr.
not_available Christiano.
not_available He's going to meet us at Saint Helen's.
not_available So we checked it out.
not_available Guess the parents were all out of town, and they came home early saw the car gone, and called it in.
not_available They thought the daughter was at a friend's house.
not_available My guys here have something they wanna say to you.
not_available We just wanted to apologize for the misunderstanding.
not_available We thought you were flashing gang signs at us.
not_available Yeah, um, we had no idea you were, um We're
not_available We're really sorry.

not_available Yeah.
not_available And Gyn has a bed, but they can't take the PID for two hours.
not_available You get a chance to meet the Gallants? 
not_available No, I must have missed them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Probably better that way.
not_available Would've been weird.
not_available Why's that? Why do you think? Hey, to tell you the truth 
not_available I don't know how you do it, my man.
not_available What? Every girl I slept with won't give me the time of day.
not_available Neither one of them? I'm shocked.
not_available Ooh.
not_available I bet it was really freaky being at her wedding.
not_available Dude, what are you talking about? You know, you and Neela.
not_available The whole, uh, roommatewith
not_available benefits thing.
not_available You think I slept with Neela? You didn't? 
not_available No.
not_available I just assumed.
not_available Everybody did.
not_available Everybody did? 
not_available Pretty much.
not_available Hey, but, you know, don't sweat it.
not_available It's just a rumor.
not_available Pratt, Kovac left this for you.
not_available What is it? 
not_available You're headed back to the motherland.
not_available You better be careful, I'm having a very bad day.
not_available Maybe you woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

not_available Oh, really? About what, Greg? 
not_available What about? About us.
not_available That's a short conversation.
not_available Olivia, come on.
not_available Who was she? Nobody.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I really am.
not_available Come on.
not_available What? I just said I'm sorry.
not_available I heard you.
not_available I
not_available You know Explain to me why you did it.
not_available We never talked about being monogamous.
not_available We never said anything about not being monogamous.
not_available All you had to do was be straight with me.
not_available I never meant to hurt you, I
not_available You what? You played me, Greg.
not_available You acted like we were in this committed relationship.
not_available And if you thought that it was cool to sleep around you wouldn't have had your sorry ass at the door playing sick.
not_available Olivia, listen, I like you.
not_available I never was trying to mislead you.
not_available I just thoughtNo, you didn't think
not_available Pratt, I got a phone call from L'Alliance de Medecins.
not_available They got your number from Kovac.
not_available Yeah, just tell them to hold on, okay? 
not_available Listen, I really cannot do this right now.
not_available Why not? Because my boss is making me go to Africa, that's why.
not_available You just don't stop, do you? Stop what? 
not_available Right.
not_available Olivia.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I'm not lying to you.
not_available You know, you're right, Samantha.
not_available I feel much better with the oxygen.
not_available Did it affect your singing voice? Well, I didn't wear it for the party.
not_available I just stayed in my chair and never got up.
not_available Just did much more listening than talking.
not_available Wow.
not_available I was beginning to think you didn't know how to do that.
not_available Anyway, if you're ready, I'll take my blood now.
not_available Yo, Neela.
not_available I'm in here.
not_available Hey, I brought you a peace offering.
not_available Extra anchovies.
not_available And I promise, no more dirty dishes, okay? I'm gonna go and stay at Abby's for a while.
not_available Uh, she's at Luka's most of the time, so So, what, are you moving out, like, tonight? I'll get to the post office when I can, get my mail forwarded.
not_available Do you wanna at least wait until you find a new place? I don't think that's such a good idea.
not_available Yeah, you're probably right.
not_available Hey, um All good things, right? Sure had a lot of fun though.
not_available Well, maybe the next guy won't drink all my tequila, huh? Uh You need a hand with anything? 
not_available Uh, no, thanks.
not_available Pizza? 
not_available Oh, I better get going.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've been looking for this for, like, a month.
not_available I rather liked sleeping in it.
not_available I'll, uh, get the rest tomorrow.
