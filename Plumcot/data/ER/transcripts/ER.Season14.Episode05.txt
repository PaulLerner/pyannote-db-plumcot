not_available Not a mentor.
not_available You're their taskmaster.
not_available They need to be whipped.
not_available That's not my style.
not_available You should make it your style.

not_available You need to be Lou Gossett to their Richard Gere.

not_available You know what? Let's leave him here.
not_available If it's simple fainting, symptoms last a couple minutes.
not_available His dizziness only lasted a few seconds.
not_available Could indicate dangerous cardiac arrhythmia.

not_available Couple nights ago, I took a pill.
not_available Like speed? I don't know, my friend gave it to me.
not_available You think it messed up my heart? Well, you know, it probably wasn't that.
not_available Your, EKG has a different kind of abnormality.
not_available It could be a condition that you were born with.
not_available Want to have Cardiology come down? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wanna be a good dad.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available I'm really trying.
not_available Harold.

not_available Dr.
not_available Zelinsky, your progress notes and dressing changes? They're all done.
not_available Does the baby have ascites? 
not_available We're focusing on the placenta.
not_available Looks like pleural effusions too.
not_available I think you're right in the way of my screen.
not_available Step back, please.
not_available Is my baby okay? 
not_available No, the heart's beating well.
not_available Could be isoimmunization if the mom's Rh negative 
not_available She's Rh positive.

not_available Are you with children a lot? 
not_available I teach preschool.
not_available Can you page OB? The kids gave her a virus 
not_available I get colds.
not_available Twenty percent of hydrops is caused by parvo.
not_available It's an infection amongst toddlers.
not_available Is it serious? There's increased risk of fetal abnormalities and miscarriage.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Parvo is one of the few treatable etiologies of Hydrops fetalis.
not_available You're pretty lucky, if that's it.
not_available Harold.
not_available Lucky? You just said I could lose my baby.
not_available No, not with a UV transfusion.
not_available Look.
not_available I know this is hard.

not_available I got two boils, here, here.
not_available Okay.

not_available It looks like I'm gonna have to open 
SURl Sorry.
not_available Did you have a nice nap, Dr.

not_available Can you tell me why Gates has two patients on the board? Got stuck with a V
not_available tach arrest.
not_available Is the patient in Vtach right now? 
not_available Cardiology is on their way.

not_available I think there's benefit to his staying with the patient.
not_available Greg, you have something to ask me? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh, right, the boards.
not_available Don't know, antidote for aspirin overdose? Come on, you call that a ques? Okay, new deal.
not_available From now on, tough questions and only when we're stressed.
not_available That will re
not_available create anxiety of test day.
not_available Come on, let me check some labs.
not_available IceColdShower.
not_available Com? What the hell is that? Ordering herbal anaphrodisiacs.
not_available You need aphrodisiacs? No, no, no.
not_available Anaphrodisiacs.
not_available "Curbs your libido and puts the brakes on sexual energy.
not_available These tablets ensure a lust
not_available free day.
not_available " What? You've seen what's happening.
not_available I need this stuff.
not_available You wanna lose your libido? Get married and have a kid.
not_available Well, I'm impressed.
not_available It usually takes an OB to pick up hydrops.
not_available It wasn't that tough to diagnose.
not_available The ascites was a clear tip
not_available off.
not_available Tracy, this is Dr.
not_available Coburn from OB.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Your blood test shows you had a recent parvovirus infection.
not_available I had a bad cold in August.
not_available That was it.
not_available We're concerned about the possible effects " in" your baby's bone marrow.
not_available Blood velocity in the brain is 44 centimeters per second.
not_available That is not what we were hoping for.
not_available Indicates a severe anemia.
not_available I went to the clinic.
not_available My blood count was fine.
not_available You're not anemic.
not_available Your baby is.
not_available So we need to give a transfusion directly into the umbilical cord.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Without it, there's a risk of fetal death.
not_available Seventy percent.
not_available With it, there's a very high probability of a cure.
not_available Ninety percent.
not_available You wanna stick a needle in the umbilical cord? It's the only way to help.
not_available Although there is a slight possibility of a miscarriage.
not_available Seven percent.
not_available Well, just look at the numbers.
not_available The benefits outweigh the risks by a factor of 12.
not_available I wanna talk to Bevan.
not_available He's with the cardiologist.
not_available Can he be here when you do it? 
not_available Lf it's okay with Dr.
not_available Kayson.
not_available I need him with me.
not_available Okay, I'll go get things set up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Zelinsky will assist you.
not_available When I first found out " I" wasn't sure I wanted the baby.
not_available But then Bevan stepped up.
not_available He said we could do it together.
not_available It made us closer.
not_available Everything was really good.
not_available It can still be good.
not_available I thought it was a blessing getting pregnant.
not_available Now I'm not so sure.
not_available Is it sharp here? 
VINCENT Can't feel a thing.
not_available Let me know if anything hurts.
not_available That's a lot of pus.
not_available Good thing I came in.
not_available Smells anaerobic.
not_available You want a wound culture? 
not_available Jin Kim? Right here.
not_available Are you going to be my doctor? Nope, actually, no.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, can I take over, please? Lady with foot pain in Exam Two I need you to see.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available Heart sounds good.
not_available EKG shows ST segment elevation in V one, two and three.
not_available I'm thinking Brugada Syndrome.
not_available Hm.
not_available What? Dr.
not_available Gates will be back to discuss all of my recommendations.
not_available Please, can I go in with Tracy? 
not_available Yeah, soon as I get back.
not_available It's not Brugada.
not_available Ventricular arrhythmia in an Asian man, classic EKG findings? That's not ST elevation.
not_available It's early repolarization.
not_available How'd you explain the v
not_available tach? Gee, maybe it has something to do with the amphetamines in his urine.
not_available He took a pill three days ago.
not_available But nothing since then.
not_available And every drunk with an ETOH of 500 only had two beers.
not_available Repeat his cardiac enzymes.
not_available If they're negative, I'll clear him for discharge.
not_available Or jail for DUl.
not_available He had a cardiac arrest.
not_available Amphetamines.
not_available Think it can happen again? 
not_available Not unless he takes more drugs.
not_available I disagree with you.
not_available If it's Brugada, could happen any time.
not_available He needs an implantable defibrillator.
not_available Well, let's continue this discussion after you complete a cardiology fellowship.
not_available This is a good guy here.
not_available Why are you writing him off? He's had eight hours of normal monitoring.
not_available That's not enough.
not_available Keep him overnight.
not_available Don't tell me how to practice medicine.
not_available I am not admitting a speed freak.
not_available Can you hold it down? It was a mistake.
not_available A one
not_available time thing.
not_available A kid who's popping amphetamines doesn't need the CCU, he needs rehab.
not_available Better learn to take the advice of a senior consultant if you intend on finishing your residency.
not_available Any more pain, Mr.
not_available Greco? 
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, my daughter, Layna.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Uh He needs to be admitted to the IV antibiotics for the hospital.
not_available I mean You know what I mean.
not_available Let's get a dressing on this.
not_available It looks pretty bad.
not_available It's not that flesheating bacteria, is it? 
not_available No, this will clear up in a few days.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I've got your clinda.
not_available Are we out of Kerlix? I don't think so.
not_available So, doctor, may I ask, what kind of car do you drive? Yeah, a BMW 328.
not_available Not bad, but I'd love to see you in a Z4.
not_available I sell luxury cars.
not_available A man like you deserves something sexy.
not_available Anything else, Dr.
not_available Morris? Some tape.
not_available So, what's your wife in? Actually, I'm not married.
not_available Oh, really? So the ring's just to sweeten the pot? All we have is three
not_available inch.
not_available I've heard you can make that work.
not_available Hey, Sam, where'd you move the boyfriend? Bevan Wong? 
not_available Exam 3 with Chuny.
not_available We're waiting on Troponins.
not_available We have time.
not_available Will you talk to Kayson? Override the chief of Cardiology and demand admission? Yeah.
not_available Think about working with Dr.
not_available Kayson in the future.
not_available Think about saving lives now.
not_available You have to defer to the consultants.
not_available Yeah, well, what if they're wrong? 
not_available Get creative.
not_available Could the needle hurt the baby? 
not_available There's a small chance.
not_available But Tracy wants to have the transfusion.
not_available She decided on her own? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Can I talk to her about it? I don't think she wants to see you right now.
not_available Because of the speed? It was only once.
not_available It's not like I'm a tweaker or 
not_available She's a little disappointed.
not_available I won't listen to his crap anymore.
not_available I should have known.
not_available He used to deejay at warehouse parties.
not_available He'd be out all night.
not_available I thought he was different now.
not_available I think he is.
not_available He lied to me.
not_available He was 
like "I'm gonna work hard and support you and the baby and be a good dad.
not_available " 
not_available He's trying to step up.
not_available By getting high? By almost getting us killed? 
not_available People change, Tracy.
not_available I used to get high all the time.
not_available Made a lot of dumb mistakes.
not_available I straightened out when it mattered.
not_available He's not like that.
not_available He proved it.
not_available He messed up.
not_available You know, sometimes things aren't always right or "wrong " black or white.
not_available My baby's sick.
not_available Might not even make it.
not_available Can we not talk about this right now? Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available You look very lost.
not_available Yeah, I'm looking for Tracy Martinez.
not_available They pointed me in this direction.
not_available They said she was in Trauma 1.
not_available Yes, I'm Dr.
not_available Gates and the good news is you're very, very warm.
not_available Because Trauma 1 is right there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So you're a friend? Not exactly.
not_available Julia Dupree.
not_available I'm the on
not_available call chaplain.
not_available Right.
not_available So they called you for a consultation? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good, I'm very familiar with the "case " so if you have any questions No, I think I can manage.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Gates.
