not_available Or go see some distant relative someplace.
not_available Weeks on end.
not_available I hated it.
not_available Every minute, I hated it.
not_available Seventeen miles? Is that what you said? Sixteen and a half.
not_available Doug.
not_available Thanks.
not_available The highway patrol is down the road to the left.
not_available We can't miss it.
not_available What was your dad doing here? He was probably heading up to Tahoe or Vegas.
not_available He liked to gamble? 
not_available Yeah, you might say that.
not_available Got you a present.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Listen, we don't have to do this.
not_available We could find some air conditioning, get something to drink.
not_available We're in no hurry.
not_available Let's get this over with.
not_available When his name showed up in the paper a woman called from Barstow.
not_available He was renting a room there.
not_available Found you in his address book.
not_available Barstow? He was in a motel.
not_available You weren't in touch? No.
not_available No, no.
not_available We got the stuff from the trunk in the evidence locker.
not_available I couldn't tell what was his and what was hers.
not_available Hers? Yeah.
not_available A Sherry Fox.
not_available We're having trouble locating her next of kin.
not_available I was hoping you could help me with that.
not_available Was she killed? Your father ran a stop sign two nights ago, doing 120.
not_available Hit a pickup truck.
not_available Killed himself, Miss Fox, the driver of the pickup a Pedro Lopez, father of six.
not_available Blood alcohol level was.
not_available 33.
not_available Four times the legal limit.
not_available What a place to die.
not_available He never drove less than 70 miles an hour his entire life.
not_available He used to think it was funny to drive with his knees.
not_available With his eyes closed.
not_available He thought it was some sort of game.
not_available Idiot.
not_available He can't even kill himself right.
not_available He has to take other people with him.
not_available Leave me to clean up the mess.
not_available I don't think your dad planned on dying out here.
not_available He never planned anything his entire life.
not_available He never planned to lose our TV in a poker game.
not_available He never planned to be gone for more than a couple of days.
not_available He never planned to hurt anybody in his whole life.
not_available Your dad lost your TV in a poker game? I should've killed him myself.
not_available Saved everybody the trouble.
not_available He was paid up through Thanksgiving.
not_available So I figured I should leave everything where it was until the rent ran out or somebody showed up.
not_available Bathroom's in here.
not_available You're the doctor, aren't you? He talked about you all the time.
not_available So he wasn't here by himself? Oh, no, honey.
not_available He had his wife with him.
not_available Y'all want to stay in here tonight? I'll get some clean sheets and
not_available No, thank you.
not_available But if you have a couple extra rooms? Adjoining? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Such a nice couple.
not_available Terrible, what happened.
not_available Wife? 
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Who's that? I have no idea.
not_available Is that you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's high school.
not_available Look at that hair.
not_available Played varsity? We went to state that year.
not_available I played JV.
not_available I wasn't very good.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Your mom? Yeah.
not_available For a guy who didn't care, he sure had a lot of photos of you guys around.
not_available You hungry? Want something to eat? There's a taco stand.
not_available No, I'm not hungry.
not_available You go ahead.
not_available I found this in the closet.
not_available Home movies or something.
not_available I didn't find much to tell us about the wife.
not_available Just some clothes, cosmetics No letters or mail or anything.
not_available She was probably a hooker or a cocktail waitress.
not_available Any money in here? 
not_available No.
not_available Just a couple of pawn tickets.
not_available Well, there it is.
not_available There's my inheritance.
not_available Some women's clothes, a couple of half
not_available empty liquor bottles and two pawn tickets.
not_available Sounds like my dad.
not_available Well, here you are.
not_available Thirteen.
not_available Fourteen.
not_available Oh, honey! Down on the corner, huh? Away from the highway noise.
not_available Oh, I forgot to tell you earlier.
not_available Your daddy's car is parked around back.
not_available He didn't wreck it? No.
not_available It must've been her car.
not_available His car's still here.
not_available The son of a bitch.
not_available He kept it.
not_available He was always out here polishing it.
not_available Said he'd had it for years.
not_available Since the '70s.
not_available It's a beauty! Maybe the keys are with your dad's stuff.
not_available That envelope's in the car.
not_available Pull the garage door shut and lock it when you're finished.
not_available All right? Yeah.
not_available I learned to drive in this car.
not_available Yeah? My dad, we wouldn't see him for months and then he'd just show up.
not_available He'd just bring my mom a present, and he'd bring me a signed football from Joe Namath, Bob Griese, somebody like that.
not_available Then he'd gather me up and tell my mom we were going to a ball game.
not_available And then we would just hit the road.
not_available We'd disappear for days.
not_available We'd be driving to Vegas.
not_available Sometimes we'd drive to Atlantic City.
not_available It was back before my mom remarried.
not_available So we were still living in Kentucky at the time.
not_available I was maybe 13, 12, I think.
not_available We'd be in Oklahoma or Indiana, middle of the night.
not_available My dad would wake me up and say, "Okay, you're driving.
not_available " We'd get off on some side road and I'd slide in behind the wheel.
not_available Just floor it, you know? Just feel those 426 horses and just I just felt like I was flying.
not_available Sounds pretty great.
not_available He had his moments.
not_available Gas? 
not_available We got a quarter of a tank.
not_available What? Hang on a minute.
not_available Now what? My dad used to keep a gas can in the trunk.
not_available You usually don't see that much baby stuff all in one place.
not_available No gas.
not_available I'm doing fine.
not_available Looks like you had a long night, though.
not_available Sure this is the right place? I don't know about that last left.
not_available Hello! Maybe everybody's working.
not_available Hello? Anybody here? Hey! Hey! How are you doing? You're a Broncos fan, huh? 
not_available Dallas.
not_available Dallas? I'm looking for the Lopez family.
not_available Which one? We got two of them.
not_available Pedro Lopez.
not_available Died in a car accident.
not_available We're trying to find his family.
not_available Not here.
not_available Not here as in he doesn't live here? Or not here like he's not here right now? Who are you? I'm Doug.
not_available Listen, do me a favor.
not_available Will you stop that for a second? Where are they? Everybody's at the funeral.
not_available They're burying Mr.
not_available Lopez today.
not_available Saints of God, come to his aid.
not_available Hasten to meet him, angels of the Lord.
not_available Eternal rest grant him, O Lord.
not_available To You, our Lord, we commend the soul of Pedro, your servant.
not_available In the sight of this world he is dead.
not_available In your sight, may he live forever.
not_available Forgive whatever sins he may have committed through human weakness.
not_available And in your goodness, grant him eternal life.
not_available We ask this through Christ our Lord.
not_available Amen.
not_available In peace, let us take our brother to his place to rest.
not_available You want to say something to the family? I don't know what I'd say.
not_available We could find a florist.
not_available Send some flowers.
not_available Doug, it's not your fault.
not_available It's tragic, but it had nothing to do with you.
not_available You were thousands of miles away.
not_available I know You know, I just 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yeah? Were you planning on joining us for the internment? No.
not_available Thank you, Father.
not_available Did you know Pedro or the family? No.
not_available I didn't think
not_available My father was the drunk that ran the stop sign and killed him.
not_available But you came.
not_available It doesn't change things.
not_available It shows that you loved your father.
not_available I have to go now.
not_available Take care.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Come on.
not_available I always wanted a pocket watch.
not_available I don't know if I'd use it, but I like the idea of it.
not_available An heirloom to pass on from generation to generation.
not_available I don't think Rachel would be excited about it.
not_available Well, not for Rachel.
not_available But for a son it would be great.
not_available Do you have something to tell me? I don't have a son, but If I had my greatgreat
not_available grandfather's pocket watch, that would be cool.
not_available My family's only heirloom is my grandfather's fraternity beer stein.
not_available This must be it.
not_available It's got the right tag number.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's a movie projector.
not_available Hope you didn't pay much.
not_available Ten bucks.
not_available I didn't even want it, but I figured, what the hell? How much is this? 
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Which one? 
not_available That one.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available Shut up! It's a real diamond? 
not_available Sure, they're real.
not_available Which one you looking at? Let's see.
not_available That's 75 bucks.
not_available "Cynthia"? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think she'd like it.
not_available You buy that, you're walking back.
not_available Here we go.
not_available We got a Rolex.
not_available That's nice.
not_available My dad loved this.
not_available He'd brush his teeth first and then use the toothbrush to clean the watch at night.
not_available Pinky ring.
not_available That is a big one.
not_available Three and a half carats.
not_available He talked her into giving it up.
not_available They kept their wedding rings.
not_available Wouldn't even think about giving them up.
not_available Carol, it's Doug.
not_available I was hoping to catch you before work.
not_available We're here in Barstow, and still we're cleaning up.
not_available I was just thinking about you and wishing you were here.
not_available I just miss you.
not_available I just wish you were here, is all.
not_available So I'll call you tomorrow.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Who was that? Somebody I've been seeing the last couple months.
not_available Sounds serious.
not_available You want any of these ties? I only wear ties at work.
not_available Is it anybody I know? Got an Armani.
not_available I believe it's double
not_available breasted.
not_available You won't tell me who it is? He had a set of clubs somewhere.
not_available Why don't you want to tell me? Because I don't.
not_available It's not my exwife, is it? 
not_available No.
not_available It's not Jennifer.
not_available Cynthia? You're not, are you? No.
not_available And neither should you.
not_available Jeanie? Chuny? Anna? Are you planning on naming everybody who works in the hospital? She doesn't work in the hospital? It's Carol.
not_available What? 
not_available Carol Hathaway.
not_available Your mouth's open.
not_available I'm speechless.
not_available Well, I'm relieved.
not_available You're back together? She didn't want me talking about it.
not_available She didn't want it out at work.
not_available All right.
not_available Now, you are sworn to secrecy.
not_available She swore she'd never get back together with you after last time.
not_available Things change.
not_available Wow! You know, it's not that amazing.
not_available Wow! You can stop saying "Wow! " I can't believe it.
not_available You've said that.
not_available I'm happy for you.
not_available That's great.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks, buddy.
not_available It's just that after what happened last time, I can't believe it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available Does she make you take a lie detector test every week? Have you tried the beer? It's good! No! Hey, now that's not fair! Son of a bitch! Give me that! 
not_available Mother of God! Get off me! Any more beer? You can squeeze something out of the drapes.
not_available Smells like a brewery in here.
not_available Are you finding out anything about the mystery stepmom in there? She had a nice body and wore kinky lingerie.
not_available Lucky dad.
not_available Spent a lot of time in Laughlin, Flagstaff and Vegas.
not_available My dad collected these matchbooks.
not_available That's how we'd keep account of him.
not_available Matchbooks.
not_available Look at this.
not_available I think that's her.
not_available Look at the ring.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I found this at the bottom of her suitcase.
not_available A Christmas card with a return address to Long Beach.
not_available Now look at this.
not_available She had a baby.
not_available Almost every photo, it's her, the baby and look, there's my dad.
not_available Think the baby was his? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available That'd be kind of weird, huh? Where do you think the baby is now? I don't know.
not_available Maybe grandparents, friends.
not_available In a bassinet outside a convent.
not_available Knowing my dad it could be The hard part is that there was this power that he held over us.
not_available I would be so happy when he would come home.
not_available And I would tell myself that I wouldn't be.
not_available Then he'd come home and tell a story, give you a present.
not_available We would all be sitting there like we were some kind of a normal family.
not_available I just never told him.
not_available I just figured that there would be a right time.
not_available Son of a bitch even got control of that.
not_available Want to watch this? What? What's that? 
not_available The home movies.
not_available Come on.
not_available No! My chance to see you in diapers.
not_available Again? You know, my dad and I, we barely even speak.
not_available If I call the house and he picks up the phone he just says, "Hang on.
not_available Let me get your mother.
not_available " He put in 30 years, and for what? He still retired as a captain.
not_available He just kept getting passed over.
not_available I mean, he did every crappy assignment that the Navy wanted him to do.
not_available And it didn't matter.
not_available He never got the nod.
not_available Why not? Probably because of his winning personality.
not_available All right.
not_available Now all we need is popcorn.
not_available You ready? 
not_available No! You hit this and you hit that.
not_available Is that you? Yep.
not_available Your mom.
not_available Yeah.
not_available "1877.
not_available Alma Rodriguez Ruiz.
not_available She was only 3 years old.
not_available What are you thinking about, Doug? Carol.
not_available I'm in love with her.
not_available I used to think I knew what love was.
not_available I cared about women.
not_available I just don't think I've ever really been in love.
not_available I think about her all the time.
not_available I don't like it when I'm not with her.
not_available I don't want to be with anybody else.
not_available That's love, isn't it? Yeah.
not_available That's love.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It'll be hot today, huh? It's November.
not_available Can you believe it? That's what I liked about living in California.
not_available You lived here? San Diego.
not_available My parents still live there.
not_available In San Diego? Yeah.
not_available A lot of retired Navy down there.
not_available It's four hours from here.
not_available We could be there at lunchtime.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available When's the last time you saw them? 
not_available 18 months.
not_available Eighteen months? Okay, we're going.
not_available No, no.
not_available We got to see that funeral director.
not_available That can wait.
not_available I made an appointment for today.
not_available My dad's not going anyplace, Mark.
not_available Come on.
not_available Nice! 
not_available Let's go to the movies instead.
not_available We'll be in and out in a couple hours.
not_available Are you kidding? There's no such thing as a quick visit with my mom.
not_available She's gonna insist that we stay for dinner.
not_available Probably something fried.
not_available Sounds great.
not_available Don't drink her ice tea.
not_available You'll risk lapsing into insulin shock.
not_available I like sugar in my tea.
not_available Want to get on her good side? 
not_available Admire her Hummels.
not_available Hummels? Believe me, you'll know what it is.
not_available Still have time for a clean getaway.
not_available That's Jake.
not_available He doesn't bite.
not_available Hey, Jake.
not_available Hush, Jake! Quiet! Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

not_available You're so skinny.
not_available I'm running again every day.
not_available What are you doing here? Well, Doug
not_available Why didn't you tell us you were coming? Doug's father passed away suddenly, and so I came out with him.
not_available You poor thing.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available Well, sit.
not_available Sit.
not_available I was just going through the mail.

not_available I always promise myself that I'm not gonna look at them, but I do.
not_available You get on these lists and you just can't get off.
not_available You two must be thirsty.
not_available Can I get you a drink? I was having iced tea.
not_available Water for me, Mom.
not_available I'd love iced tea.
not_available When did you get in?

not_available Oh, absolutely.
not_available We have two guest rooms and never any guests.
not_available Too much sugar? Mark kids me about adding too much sugar.
not_available No.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available Oh, honey! How is my lovely Rachel? She's wonderful.
not_available And she misses you.
not_available You're a good liar.
not_available I bet she barely remembers me.
not_available My son always says that they'll visit.
not_available But I know that if I want to see my only granddaughter I've gotta get on a plane and go to Chicago.
not_available What's with the oxygen, Mom? It's your father.
not_available He's still smoking, you know? Doctor says he's gotta stop, but he just won't.
not_available Maybe you can talk some sense into him.
not_available You know the military.
not_available Everybody smokes.
not_available They used to give cigarettes out in C rations.
not_available Is it emphysema, Mom? Yeah.
not_available Well, the doctor says something like that.
not_available But it hasn't slowed him down an inch.
not_available Let me get another one.
not_available This is too sweet.
not_available I'm gonna run some errands.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available You're leaving already? Yes.
not_available I'll be back for dinner if the offer still stands?

not_available Beautiful.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available He's a lovely boy.
not_available Where's Dad? Dad? Hello, Dad! Mark.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? Came by with a friend.
not_available You look good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available House looks great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Keeps me busy.
not_available I repainted the trim a couple days ago.
not_available Looks nice.
not_available There's no wind.
not_available What? You're cupping your hand.
not_available There's no wind.
not_available Too many years on deck.
not_available Hard habit to break.
not_available You should quit smoking.
not_available That's another hard habit to break.
not_available Emphysema? You've seen your mother
not_available You're on oxygen? I need help living my life, Mark, you'll be the first person I call.
not_available Woodworking? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I needed a hobby.
not_available Tried gardening for a while, but it was too slow, you know? Waiting around for things to grow.
not_available So I decided to try furniture.
not_available Nice work.
not_available Making a dining set for your mother.
not_available For Christmas.
not_available I'm sure she'll like it.
not_available Rachel's great.
not_available She's gotten bigger.
not_available She's smarter than me.
not_available Or at least she thinks she is.
not_available That's kids for you.
not_available Well I better get back.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Dad doesn't look good.
not_available Well, we're all getting older.
not_available When was he diagnosed with emphysema? Here, honey.
not_available Make yourself useful.
not_available He's gotta start taking better care of himself, Mom.
not_available You know your father.
not_available How high is his blood pressure? He doesn't have high blood pressure.
not_available Mom, I saw the medications in the bathroom.
not_available Those are my pills, Mr.
not_available Nosey.
not_available When did you get high blood pressure? Last year.
not_available I'm fine now.
not_available at the commissary.
not_available At the base? Yeah.
not_available On one of those little machines.
not_available I check it every time I go shopping.
not_available Do you have your potassium checked? I'm sure I do.
not_available It's very important, and it's not something that you check at the base supermarket.
not_available I appreciate this, but I have a doctor.
not_available Has your doctor talked to you about controlling your salt intake? Your father won't eat bland food.
not_available Dad can live a lot longer without salt than he can without you.
not_available Mark, we are both fine.
not_available I take my walks.
not_available I watch what I eat.
not_available Now, stop being a doctor and finish shucking those peas.
not_available Mom, Mom, Mom! 
not_available Not a word! I'm sorry your friend wasn't back in time for dinner.
not_available I don't think he realized we'd be eating in midafternoon.
not_available I'll put a plate in the fridge for him.
not_available You remember the Orkins? Bruce and Christina? They live here now.
not_available They had two boys about your age when we were in Pensacola.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Bruce was in Intelligence, wasn't he? Communications.
not_available Their oldest boy, Carl, is a flier now.
not_available A lieutenant commander, stationed up at Whidbey.
not_available Has three little girls of his own.
not_available Well, say hello to him for me.
not_available You two busy tonight? I was thinking we'd go buy some ice cream.
not_available That place on Mission Bay, is it still there? I don't know.
not_available I haven't been there in years.
not_available I have to go to the club tonight.
not_available You could go tomorrow night.
not_available I'm meeting Frank and Harry.
not_available You can call them.
not_available It's Thursday.
not_available We always meet on Thursdays.
not_available Well, this week you'll meet on Friday.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available We'll do it another time.
not_available You two go.
not_available Have a good time.
not_available You go to the club with your dad.
not_available Mark wouldn't be comfortable.
not_available You should spend time together.
not_available You'd really enjoy it.
not_available You need the inhaler? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Albuterol? I know where it is.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available No! He doesn't like to be helped.
not_available You know that.
not_available He'll be all right in a few minutes.
not_available I'll make him some hot tea.
not_available It makes him feel better.
not_available The blaze near Lake Hodges destroyed two homes and 1200 acres.
not_available It is completely out tonight, but firefighters are still on the lines.
not_available Fire officials say they want new homes built without wood roofs and without landscaping within 100 feet.
not_available Arson investigators hope a $ 10,000 reward leads them to I'm quitting tonight.
not_available I promise.
not_available Good.
not_available You used to smoke.
not_available Yes.
not_available Until someone I know hounded me into giving it up.
not_available You were what? Seven or eight? We were living down in Kings Bay, in Georgia.
not_available Every time I'd come home with a pack, you'd flush it down the toilet.
not_available I was doing you a favor.
not_available You were ruthless.
not_available You wouldn't even lie to me.
not_available You'd just march right in and tell me you'd done it.
not_available I could've killed you! He's asleep in there, in front of the TV.
not_available You'd better wake him if he's gonna make his club.
not_available Well he only makes it about half the time anymore anyway.
not_available His friends are worse.
not_available Usually he goes down there and he's back home in less than an hour because nobody he knows shows up.
not_available You still like living near the base? It's convenient.
not_available All our friends live nearby.
not_available Your father's got the club.
not_available It's a nice life.
not_available I know you never liked it, but we do.
not_available He misses you.
not_available He'd never say so, but he does.
not_available He'd like to see you more often.
not_available You and Rachel.
not_available I love you, Mom.
not_available And I know you feel like you have to defend him.
not_available But Dad doesn't think about me or Rachel.
not_available Your father loves you very much, Mark.
not_available He may not show it in the way that you want him to, but he does.
not_available I've never seen him show it at all.
not_available He's just not built that way.
not_available You have to work harder with him.
not_available I have to work harder? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Of course, Mom.
not_available Dad doesn't have to do anything.
not_available You've got some wonderful traits, Mark.
not_available But you always assume that you know more about everybody and everything than you actually do.
not_available I've got vanilla ice cream and some fresh strawberries if you still feel like dessert.
not_available Hey! You missed dinner.
not_available Drove up to Long Beach.
not_available Checked out that return address.
not_available Anything? Yeah.
not_available It's not my dad's kid.
not_available He's living in Arizona with the ex
not_available husband.
not_available How's family life? My dad's got emphysema.
not_available I thought he was gonna cough himself to death over the fried chicken.
not_available Is he okay? He's on an inhaler, oxygen.
not_available He seemed all right.
not_available Is he getting decent care? 
not_available I'm sure it's fine.
not_available So why don't you stay here for a while? I'll go back up to Barstow, and you spend some time with him.
not_available Why bother? You didn't miss much, not having your father around when you were growing up.
not_available Believe me.
not_available That's kind of a crappy thing to say, isn't it? It wasn't my idea to come down here.
not_available Don't stay.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I won't.
not_available I'm confused.
not_available Your father's still alive? Still with your mother? So that's the criteria for a good father? Longevity? Did he smack you around? Did he smack your mom around? 
not_available Poor Doug.
not_available Wait.
not_available "Poor Doug"? Did your father throw up on your bed and pass out? Did he leave you in a hallway in Atlantic City while he screwed some hatcheck girl? Did he do that? Did he do that, Mark?! Your father was there for you every night, and that's love.
not_available Whether it's the way you want it or not it's love, Mark! You grew up in Ozzie and Harriet land.
not_available Get your head out of your ass! I wrote Carol a note this afternoon.
not_available It's a card that reminded me of her.
not_available Will you give it to her for me? You' re not going back with me? No.
not_available That woman in Long Beach gave me an address in Flagstaff.
not_available I think I'm gonna head over there look up my dad's wife's relatives and let them know what happened.
not_available And the kid.
not_available We should've stayed the night.
not_available It wasn't right to leave the way we did.
not_available I had no right to just lose it like that.
not_available No.
not_available You were right about me.
not_available I have been acting like a victim, feeling sorry for myself.
not_available Self
not_available pity isn't one of my more attractive personality traits.
not_available Don't sell yourself short.
not_available You're very good at it.
not_available I've spent my whole life holding my breath afraid that something was gonna spin out of control.
not_available I think that's why I got into medicine.
not_available I wanted to have power over chaos.
not_available I was always terrified that something awful was gonna happen.
not_available And then last spring, it did.
not_available I don't know who I am, Doug.
not_available That person who I was died in that bathroom.
not_available And I don't know what's gonna take his place.
not_available I'm beat! You want to grab some breakfast? Maybe a few hours of sleep before we have to go to that funeral home? Doug, you want to do that? This is it.
not_available Good.
not_available I don't want to climb any more damn hills.
not_available Doug, it's beautiful! Want to say something? A prayer? No.
not_available I hated the son of a bitch and I loved him.
not_available Never simple, is it?
