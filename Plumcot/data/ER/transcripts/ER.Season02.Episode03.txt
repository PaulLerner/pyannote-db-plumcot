not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available He's in.
not_available All right, bag him.
not_available Let's get that lavage.
not_available Come on, little guy.
not_available I need some Cetacaine.
not_available Grab some Surgilube with 30 grams of charcoal.
not_available You go in right over the top of rib number eight at the posterior axillary line, advancing and aspirating as you go.
not_available I gotta call home.
not_available Your wife? No, not for me.
not_available Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free? Take care to avoid the neurovascular bundle.
not_available I gotta call Olaf, my roomie.
not_available I left half a sandwich in the fridge, and I don't want anything to happen to it.
not_available Now is not a good time, because we're about to draw fluid.

not_available My bar.
not_available Voil√†.
not_available Oh, that's better.

not_available Sun.
not_available What's your little boy's name? Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available I'm gonna tell you what we're doing.
not_available We've washed all the medicine out.
not_available Now we're putting charcoal in his stomach to absorb what's left.
not_available Doug? Hey.
not_available Hi, buddy.
not_available Don't be scared, all right? You got a little sick, and your mom brought you to the hospital.
not_available She's right here.
not_available Come on.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I pushed it too far.
not_available You were supposed to tap his lung, not biopsy his liver.
not_available Let's get him up to the O.R., now! He needs a room.
not_available Move! I don't believe this.
not_available There goes next year's surgical residency.
not_available Carter! I've known Mark Greene since he was a wetbehindthe
not_available ears med student.
not_available He had the most beautiful curly blond hair, and so polite.
not_available All I'd do was ask, and he would be cleaning the bedpans and changing the sheets.
not_available He was the best scut
not_available puppy I ever had.
not_available So would you say that, back then, he was sort of "green"? No, Wendy, I would never say that.
not_available Okay, retract the liver inferiorly and rotate the right lobe.
not_available There she blows.
not_available Hit the hepatic vein.
not_available Nice shot, Carter.
not_available 5
not_available O proline.
not_available I'm really sorry, Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available When I felt resistance it felt exactly like an adhesion, and with the patient's history of emphysema Oh, one
not_available handed.
not_available Peter, you've been practicing.
not_available Carter, it happens.
not_available It's all right.
not_available My best student once did a sigmoidoscopy.
not_available Punched through and saw the appendix.
not_available Sound familiar, Peter? 
not_available Metz.
not_available I'm more concerned now with the condition of this man's liver.
not_available Feel that.
not_available Hard as a rock and shriveled like an old shoe.
not_available Gallona
not_available day drinker.
not_available At least.
not_available Look at the size of those mesenteric veins.
not_available What does that suggest, Carter? 
not_available Portal hypertension.
not_available What are the hallmarks of that? Caput medusa, esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, ascites, splenomegaly.
not_available Good.
not_available I wouldn't give this liver three weeks.
not_available NG's returning blood.
not_available Varices are bleeding.
not_available Lucky we're here.
not_available Portal bypass? We could, but with a liver this oozy Have you ever done a TIPS procedure? 
not_available No, but I'd like to.
not_available I bet.
not_available In fact, it's an excellent case for teaching.
not_available Sylvia, round up all surgical residents who aren't busy.
not_available Tell them we're starting a TIPS.
not_available Standing room only.
not_available What do you know, Carter? You did this guy a favor.
not_available Mr.
not_available Holthouse? Yes? 
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available What is that? 
not_available Tibetan singing bowl.
not_available I get anxious in hospitals.
not_available It helps me to relax.
not_available I understand you're feeling dizzy this morning.
not_available Yes, I've had these spinning sensations on and off all week.
not_available Headaches? 
not_available No.
not_available Some nausea though.
not_available Spots before your eyes? 
not_available No.
not_available Say, you're under a lot of stress right now, aren't you? Who isn't? 
not_available I can see the tension in your face.
not_available I could suggest some relaxation techniques.
not_available I'm a lot more relaxed than I look.
not_available Open your mouth.
not_available Hey, big guy.
not_available Love the tie.
not_available Thank you, Malik.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available What's the occasion? 
not_available Well, since you asked I've been promoted.
not_available To what? Supervising emergency

not_available More money, huh? Unfortunately, no.
not_available Better benefits? 
not_available No.
not_available More responsibility? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, congratulations.
not_available Mark, that big guy, Mitchell, he's seizing.

not_available Bite block.
not_available Point
not_available five Ativan IV push.
not_available Positive Babinski.
not_available Pinpoint pupils.
not_available Does not bode well.
not_available Pressure's up, 250/140.
not_available All right, jack up the Nipride.
not_available Load him up with Dilantin.
not_available How much? Let's see.
not_available He's about 400 pounds.
not_available Divided by 2.2 is 
not_available 181 kilograms.
not_available Times 12 milligrams per kilogram would be I have a facility for simple math.
not_available All right, we'll start with a gram and we'll titrate up.
not_available Come on, Mitchell, stay with us.
not_available Stay with us, Mitchell.
not_available Come on.
not_available Vitals are coming back to normal.
not_available Get him to Pedes ICU.
not_available Hey, there, Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available How you doing? I'm Doug.
not_available He doesn't like doctors.
not_available Bet he sees a lot of us.
not_available Where do you take him? 
not_available Pediatric clinic upstairs.
not_available Who's the doctor? 
not_available Always a different one.
not_available They're pretty busy.
not_available Yes.
not_available Very nice, but sometime we wait four, five hour.
not_available It's hard for him.
not_available I have to make sure this medication problem doesn't happen again, so I have to ask you I mean, can you read English? 
not_available Yes, I follow direction.
not_available This one from two week ago.
not_available And this one from yesterday.
not_available Two prescriptions for the same thing.
not_available You did exactly what they asked you to.
not_available I'm sorry that I was angry with you.
not_available This is not your fault.
not_available This is the doctors at the clinic's fault.
not_available Okay, all right.
not_available Next time bring Chia
not_available Chia here.
not_available You give this to the nurse out front, and she will bring you straight back.
not_available No waiting.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Oh, oh, I thought he didn't like doctors.
not_available Chia
not_available Chia, no.
not_available It's okay.
not_available He can hang on to it for a while.
not_available You can keep that.
not_available Mr.
not_available Holthouse? 
not_available Over here.
not_available I see you're feeling much better.
not_available Yeah, but I still have that spinning feeling, even upside
not_available down.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Tony'll take you for a CAT scan.
not_available Doesn't that cause cancer? 
not_available Susan, a word, please.
not_available Why are you ordering a CT for vertigo? Why are you questioning my orders? 
not_available Because it's a $ 1500 procedure.
not_available I have to rule out acoustic neuroma.
not_available He's had five bouts of dizziness in a week.
not_available Wouldn't know from his chart.
not_available I haven't had time.
not_available I've had other patients.
not_available So do I.
not_available I manage to keep track of details.
not_available So have I, on my note cards.
not_available Well, I don't have access to those.
not_available Here.
not_available Put them on the chart.
not_available And in the future, run all procedures by me.
not_available Hey, what happened? 
not_available Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
not_available He went just like that.
not_available What are you doing with him? 
not_available Landlady called animal control.
not_available They rounded them up.
not_available It was awful.
not_available This guy followed me down the hall.
not_available Is he clean? 
not_available Sure, he's clean.
not_available And he's soft too.
not_available Poor fat guy.
not_available He never hurt anybody.
not_available Just sat around with his bunnies, singing that nutty song.
not_available What was it? Vienna.
not_available No, he's a patient of yours.
not_available Chia
not_available Chia Loew.
not_available A 4year
not_available old with AIDS.
not_available Try to remember, because you almost killed him by giving him Dilantin when one of your cohorts already had him on phenytoin.
not_available Do you people talk to each other? Making friends again? Idiots at the Pedes clinic doubled up a kid's prescription.
not_available Almost killed him.
not_available Get her off my back.
not_available Her? Weaver.
not_available She just dressed me down in the hallway for ordering a CT.
not_available We're getting pressure from upstairs.
not_available She treats me with disdain.
not_available You want me to talk to her? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell her to cut me some slack.
not_available See how Peter's snaking the sheath through the vena cava to the right hepatic vein.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Now comes the fun part.
not_available Remove the guide wire.
not_available Rotate the needle counterclockwise 90 degrees.
not_available Pressure's dropping.
not_available 80/60.
not_available Give him pressors and keep me posted.
not_available Puncture the cirrhotic tissue and enter the portal vein, creating a new pathway.
not_available Balloon stent's in.
not_available Expand the balloon slowly Easy 
not_available We have circulation.
not_available Portal pressure's coming down.
not_available And the liver is reborn.
not_available Hallelujah.
not_available He's getting tachy, 180.
not_available Fixed his liver.
not_available Not much we can do for his heart.
not_available Run of five.
not_available Get out of there, Peter.
not_available I'm getting out.
not_available He's fibrillating.
not_available Carter, CPR.
not_available Come on, Ed.
not_available Come on.
not_available Charge it to 200.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Stand back.
not_available Hey, Kerry.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Pretty good.
not_available But there's something we need to talk about.
not_available Susan Lewis.
not_available This is a bit awkward.
not_available I mean, I know you two are friends.
not_available She seems to resent my being here, and it's creating some tension.
not_available You know, I've picked up on that.
not_available It has nothing to do with her ability.
not_available She's really quite competent, but her attitude is openly hostile.
not_available It's probably a communication thing.
not_available You're very authoritative, which is great.
not_available But your assertiveness might be off
not_available putting to some.
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available That's why I bend over backwards to be sensitive with Susan.
not_available I'd rather you not say anything, but this is a potential problem area.
not_available Right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Picture
not_available perfect procedure, Benton.
not_available Save the tape.
not_available We'll show it at M&amp;M.;
not_available Carter, you can present.
not_available It'll be your first time.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available My first official patient.
not_available Carter, the guy was a train wreck.
not_available He died of heart failure.
not_available It had nothing to do with you perfing his liver.
not_available If he hadn't been on the operating table Then his liver would've failed in a month.
not_available I'll tell the family.
not_available He didn't have any.
not_available Carter, it's how you learn.
not_available It'll make you a better doctor.
not_available What can I say about Mark Greene that hasn't been said? Everybody knows how he overcame adversity as a child of Quakers.
not_available His years in exile, his political writings and limericks his mod period with the turtlenecks, his blue period and of course his ruthless march to power and the silencing of his rivals.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? Dr.
not_available Ross! Which one do you think? It's for the nursing newsletter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You think this one? I'm looking for the supervising emergency
not_available service coordinator.
not_available You've found him.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hi, I'm Randi.
not_available I'm the new clerk.
not_available I understand I'll be working under you.
not_available Right.
not_available I was expecting a guy, because of the name.
not_available Randi, right.
not_available I get that a lot.
not_available Personnel said that you would have some immunization forms for me to fill out.
not_available You'll need a rubella and a Heptovax.
not_available Lab's on the second floor.
not_available They said I'd need a physical, and that somebody here could do it.
not_available Jerry, you got any charts for me? Any patients? Anything? All right.
not_available I'll be at Pedes ICU.
not_available Carol, quick.
not_available Threehundredpound angel
not_available duster broke out of restraints.

not_available What is this, crazyfatguy day? 
not_available I'm telling you, this dude is mad.
not_available Call security.
not_available Go find Mark Greene.
not_available The tests show nothing serious.
not_available I think your dizziness is caused by labyrinthitis.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Inflammation of the inner ear.
not_available Minor.
not_available Nothing serious.
not_available You swim? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't know how.
not_available But I do spend a lot of time floating in my sensory
not_available deprivation tank.
not_available Not for the next two weeks you don't.
not_available No standing on your head, either.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis I'd like for you to have this.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Please.
not_available It's a spare.

not_available He's cut.
not_available Stay here.
not_available I'm taking him in.
not_available Mara! Where the hell is security?! My God! I can't see! 
not_available Let's shoot him.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available Make it stop! Make it stop! Okay, okay.
not_available Hey, what you doing up there, big guy? Mara?

not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Breathe in.
not_available Breathe out.
not_available You're fine.
not_available Where's the form? Do you have my roommate as a patient? Ed Menke? Yes.
not_available You must be Olaf? I'm afraid I have some bad news about Ed.
not_available He He had fluid in his lungs.
not_available During the course of trying to remove it, we I accidentally punctured his liver.
not_available We successfully stopped the bleeding and did some additional surgery.
not_available But, unfortunately, his heart gave out, and he died on the table.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available Yeah, they told me that upstairs.
not_available They said you had his property.
not_available Property? He took the remote
not_available control doohickey.
not_available It's his TV, and he's kind of tightfisted about it, but I don't think he's gonna mind now.
not_available Double dose of Haldol.
not_available It's about time.

not_available Right.

not_available That's it.
