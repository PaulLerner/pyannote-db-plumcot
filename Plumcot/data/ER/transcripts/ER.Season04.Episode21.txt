
not_available ER Previously on ER It was really lovely last night.
not_available I would really like you to consider a date.

not_available Oh, I see.
not_available You have a policy.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available No fraternizing with people at work.
not_available He's in heroin withdrawal.
not_available The mother's stealing his methadone.

not_available I saw in the Tribune they' re having a jam session tonight.
not_available You don't wanna go to the South Side.
not_available It's a rough area? I mean it's not a good idea.
not_available When I was in Belfast, I went to the Bogside to hear Lick the Tins.
not_available It's an IRA stronghold.
not_available It's not the same thing.
not_available Plans for his discharge? Well, his vitals are stable.
not_available Any vomiting or diarrhea? 
not_available No.
not_available He's keeping down POs and is back on regular doses of methadone.
not_available I'd like to start a course of long
not_available term withdrawal.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Thorvaldsen from DCFS come up? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We had a team meeting.
not_available He can't live with a mother that steals his methadone.
not_available We all agree with your note.
not_available The home is unsuitable.

not_available Anything wrong? 
not_available No, everything's great.
not_available You met my friend the other night from Philly? Max? You showing him the town? Remember I told you I was involved with somebody and it wasn't over yet? 
not_available Yeah, I figured he was the guy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What about his heroin addiction? 
not_available Not heroin, painkillers.
not_available Percoset.
not_available He's okay.
not_available Actually, he's here for a job.
not_available He's coming in today to do a feasibility study on setting up a Pedes unit in the ER.
not_available That doesn't sound like a coincidence.
not_available Listen, Carter, before you run into him I've given you a one
not_available sided picture of Max.
not_available He's smart.
not_available He's very dedicated.
not_available He's a really good guy.
not_available Want me to like him? Just don't judge him from things I've said in the past.
not_available Sounds like you're back together.
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available Honestly, I don't.
not_available Where is he now? 
not_available My place.
not_available Malik, who left this with my mail? Mr.
not_available Dougherty from Salutech.
not_available Yeah? See that it gets returned.
not_available A salesman from Salutech left me a pen.
not_available I got mine right here.
not_available He also left free samples.
not_available I won't be bribed into using their products.

not_available Rosher's a pediatrician and assistant professor at CHoP.
not_available He's evaluating the need for pediatric emergency centers at ERs.
not_available And we're fortunate he's responded to our call for a study here.
not_available I thought this was under discussion.
not_available It happens that Dr.
not_available Rosher is free at this time.
not_available I just finished a study at Hennepin County.
not_available I have to scrub.
not_available But give Dr.
not_available Rosher the support he needs.
not_available Sure.
not_available No problem.
not_available Thank you, doctors.

not_available Mark.
not_available Kerry.
not_available Could I stash my things? Get a cup of coffee? Randi, could you show him the lounge? Sure.
not_available This comes from Doug Ross lobbying upstairs.
not_available It's just a study.
not_available You think he doesn't have an agenda? It's to fault how we handle pediatric patients.
not_available We have nothing to hide.
not_available We take great care of kids.
not_available Jeanie, do you have a busy morning? 
not_available Not so bad.
not_available Why? Our talk on managing abdominal pain is next week.

not_available Meeting everyone? Yeah.
not_available I encountered the usual dynamic.
not_available The Attendings seeing me as the spy sent to undermine their authority.
not_available How are you doing? It's awkward, seeing you here.
not_available Was it awkward last night? No.
not_available No.
not_available But now you're nervous.
not_available I don't know.
not_available You show up and you're back in my life.
not_available And it's not how I planned it.
not_available I never planned it any other way.
not_available Peter? 
not_available Yeah? Have you got a presentation for morning report? Should I wait outside? When have you waited outside? You don't see me as a shy English rose? Elizabeth, I see you as many things.
not_available Shy is not one of them.
not_available Busy morning? A parathyroidectomy.
not_available I know you like jazz.

not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Peter? Hi, Lizzie.

not_available I got a backup.
not_available Did he see us? I don't know.
not_available At least one exam room with color murals and toys.
not_available And section chairs so kids don't have to sit near a nut case.
not_available You favor setting up a whole department? I'll get in trouble talking about this in front of him No need for caution on my account.
not_available I'm keeping an open mind.
not_available A department would be great.
not_available But I'd settle for a full
not_available time Attending.
not_available That's the position Doug's out for.
not_available Who gets it isn't important.
not_available I won't lie to you.
not_available I want the job.
not_available It's a problem? Set up Pedes and what's next? Geriatric Emergency Medicine? Dr.

not_available They thought he was fighting with his brother.
not_available He's current on his vaccines and tetanus.
not_available She says they attack all the children.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll start an IV, titrate morphine for his pain.
not_available It's through the palmar fascia.
not_available Plastics should do it in the OR.
not_available Let's irrigate this wound.
not_available I'll get the authorities to make sure there are no more rats.
not_available He says they never do anything.
not_available Well, this time they will.
not_available Hi, Bob.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available What's up? I had the flu and I can't seem to shake a cough.

not_available You want a quick chest film? 
not_available Could you? You know, two weeks ago I cut my hand.
not_available I just wanted a few stitches.
not_available Next thing, I'm on a gurney hooked to an IV for 6 hours.
not_available Some of these docs overreact.
not_available Should I flash your name? No.
not_available That's okay.
not_available No problem.
not_available No paperwork.
not_available That's what I like.
not_available Take a deep breath and hold.

not_available Now he can't walk to the toilet.
not_available He's scheduled for a fem
not_available pop bypass.
not_available You should review his films.
not_available Don't worry, Mr.
not_available Baumgartner.
not_available We'll put a spring back in your step.
not_available I've been meaning to ask you.
not_available Given more thought to that impressive offer you got recently? Which impressive offer? 
not_available There's been more? The Senior Lecturer position at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.
not_available I decided to pass.
not_available Really? Did you let them know? 
not_available I wrote them.
not_available Ouch! 
not_available What? Well, it takes guts, Lizzie.
not_available You don't know if you have a future here.
not_available And have him lay flat on his back for the next two hours.

not_available Sure.
not_available Oh, and don't forget to get a Gram's stain.
not_available What do you got? dry cough and intermittent fever.
not_available Is she a smoker? 
not_available No.
not_available Any travel outside the country? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Did you ask about her HIV status? I don't know if she's been tested.
not_available Why? Might be an early infiltrate at the right base.
not_available Or it may just be atelectasis.
not_available Where's the lateral? 
not_available That's all we have.
not_available Repeat the film and have her take a deeper breath.
not_available And get a lateral.
not_available Also there's no name.
not_available Let the techs know that that's really unacceptable.
not_available And Jeanie, the slides? 
not_available Sorry? This morning I asked you to get the slides.
not_available Did you forget? No, I haven't had the time.
not_available Should someone else do it? 
not_available I'll get them now.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need some help! We were visiting my folks in Saint Lioba.
not_available Our son just passed out.
not_available Gurney! 
not_available Got it.
not_available Here, Malik.
not_available We'll need high
not_available flow oxygen in 2.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available History of heart disease? 
not_available No.
not_available On any medications? 
not_available He's perfectly healthy.
not_available He never gets sick.
not_available My God! What's wrong with him?! He's tachy at 150.
not_available Resps high at 28.
not_available Why is he breathing so fast? Does he have asthma? 
not_available No.
not_available All right, Conni.
not_available Put him on a pulse ox and EKG.
not_available I want a CBC, Chem
not_available 7, blood gas, chest film.
not_available I'll start a line.
not_available Sam? Sam, can you hear me? What's wrong? 
not_available He's cyanotic.
not_available See how blue his lips are? 
not_available He's not getting enough oxygen.
not_available Why? That's what we'll figure out.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Just trying to look decent again.
not_available I don't think that's a good idea.
not_available I can't be seen on TV without my woolly bears and make
not_available up.
not_available You ever see us on the JGCN? 
not_available No.
not_available Jesus Gospel Cable Network? Makeup'll make it worse, Mrs.
not_available Chambliss.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Honey, you call me Tina
not_available Marie.
not_available Hello, doctor.
not_available Isn't she an angel? I see the power of prayer and modern medicine.
not_available Well, we have her blood test results.
not_available And there is reason for concern.
not_available My face? Actually, your kidneys are the problem.
not_available I'm passing water.
not_available Your BUN and creatinine are elevated, indicating kidney problems.
not_available Probably from your diabetes.
not_available Emmet? Doctor, what does this exactly mean? It could simply be dehydration.
not_available I'll give you IV fluids and hope your renal function improves.
not_available I'll also do a neuro exam for sensation in your extremities.
not_available Whatever suits you, honey.
not_available Feel that? Little pricks of pain.
not_available That's good.
not_available That means you're not losing feeling in your feet and toes.
not_available Look out, Emmet.
not_available She might test your heart.
not_available I'm just kidding, sweetie.
not_available Just kidding.
not_available So if my kidneys fail what then? If it progresses to renal failure, you'll need dialysis.
not_available This means a full prayer vigil, Emmet! Yes, we'll pray for those kidneys! Malik, know anyone in Public Health to deal with a rat problem? 
not_available Office for Rodent Control.
not_available I got a contact there.
not_available I'll put you through.
not_available They were eating this kid alive.
not_available In Philly, Animal Control was better than Public Health.
not_available This woman, Miss Weldon, is a real crusader.
not_available She'll get them in there.
not_available Poison, traps, whatever they have to do.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Dr.
not_available Carter wants to see you in Trauma 2.
not_available Thanks, Yosh.
not_available Here.
not_available Mention my name.
not_available I treated her son once.
not_available Come on.
not_available You picked a good day for Pedes cases.
not_available He seems a little better.
not_available Why won't he wake up? Isn't the oxygen helping? 
not_available It's helping.
not_available And for now, he's stable.
not_available I just haven't found what's wrong.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, meet Dr.
not_available Rosher.
not_available We've met.
not_available Yep.
not_available Hi.
not_available What do you got? This is Sam Adams, 11 years old, altered.
not_available Presented with cyanosis, tachypnea, tachycardia driving back from the farm.
not_available Still cyanotic despite O2, 10 liters.
not_available What are you thinking? Either a VQ mismatch or something toxicmetabolic? Pulse ox? 
not_available 92.
not_available It's pretty good.
not_available Was he in a camper or a pickup? 
not_available He was in a car with us.
not_available Chest and cardiac exam? 
not_available No wheezing or rales.
not_available Regular without murmur, rub or gallop.
not_available Blood gas? 
not_available PCO2's 35.
not_available PO2's 380.
not_available Suggesting 
not_available Oxygen in blood, but still cyanotic.
not_available What kind of farm was it? 
not_available My father raises tulips.
not_available Greenhouses.
not_available I already asked about that.
not_available Some of the pesticides in a hothouse contain cyanide.
not_available He'd have pinked up with the oxygen.
not_available Besides, I've got good pulses and there's no smell of almonds.
not_available So your best educated guess? Methemoglobinemia.
not_available Do another blood gas.
not_available Check that.
not_available Go for it.
not_available Tough case, leaving it with an intern.
not_available Is it illadvised? 
not_available You know Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I don't.
not_available He just figured it out.
not_available Diagnosis was correct.
not_available But you didn't tell him.
not_available He's here to learn.
not_available Not to be told.
not_available Is that a mark against me? Not in my book.
not_available 500 cc fluid bolus is onboard.
not_available TKO the line.
not_available Okay.
not_available I got it.
not_available There it is.
not_available There's the answer.
not_available Look at that arterial blood.
not_available That's blood? Looks like chocolate.
not_available It's methemoglobin.
not_available What? A form of hemoglobin that can't carry oxygen into the body.
not_available How'd he get that? From a drug or toxin.
not_available We can treat it.
not_available Take that to the lab and bring back methylene blue.
not_available Peter.
not_available Hey.
not_available I thought you had a fem
not_available pop? Done.
not_available I'm assisting on a lung biopsy, then on a triple A.
not_available Look, I think Romano saw us.
not_available What did he say? 
not_available You know him.
not_available He didn't say it directly.
not_available But he told me I should've accepted the position at the Royal.
not_available He was saying he wasn't going to continue my sponsorship.
not_available I suppose it's a matter of insult to injury.
not_available Because he came on to you? Peter, the man has an elephantine ego.
not_available I'm not going for that.
not_available Maybe it was inevitable.
not_available Being sponsored by him was difficult at the best of times.
not_available Elizabeth, listen to me.
not_available He doesn't own you.
not_available He can't do this, okay? We'll talk later.
not_available I have to scrub.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll explore to see if there's flexor tendon injury.
not_available Chuny, take the parents to the waiting room.
not_available See if Pedes has a post
not_available op bed assignment.
not_available Doug, Dr.
not_available Nagarwala's here.
not_available All right.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Sorry to bother you but a woman came from DCFS, a Miss Neuman.
not_available She said the case status had changed and she's taking Josh back to his mother.
not_available When? 
not_available Just now.
not_available I came down when she left.
not_available None of the doctors agree.
not_available We're going to make a formal appeal.
not_available No, there's no time for that.
not_available I need the County Health Department in Saint Lioba.
not_available Home of the White Corn Festival.
not_available I went there with bikers once.
not_available They had pig
not_available calling.
not_available Ever see that? Can't say I have.
not_available When you get that number, will you page me? How's it going? 
not_available I got a kid with methemoglobinemia.
not_available That's a great case.
not_available What was the inducer? Tox screen was negative.
not_available But he was on a farm.
not_available So I'm getting the local health authorities to check it out.
not_available Are you taking care of TinaMarie? 
not_available Yes.
not_available My mom watches them and she said they announced they're broadcasting live and she's dying.
not_available No, that is not happening.
not_available She's not dying? No, and they're not broadcasting from here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene said no way.
not_available She and my aunt are by the TV with their credit cards.
not_available Talking about those televangelists? 
not_available Yeah, Dr.
not_available Emmet and Tina
not_available Marie.
not_available They have some clout.
not_available I just got a call from Administration saying we're to let them do a broadcast.
not_available Adele? Hey, Adele! Hey, you're tough to catch up to.
not_available Josh is my patient.
not_available I read the report.
not_available You know the situation with his mother.
not_available Sure, but there's been a change in the environment.
not_available His mother now lives with her aunt.
not_available We feel that the aunt can take care of Josh.
not_available He's addicted to methadone.
not_available I know his medical history.
not_available But my obligation is to return the child.
not_available Can you hold this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll carefully monitor his progress.
not_available We understand the situation.
not_available As long as he needs methadone, she'll steal it from him.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He has to go home.
not_available Okay, how is the aunt gonna pay for the meds? 
not_available He's on Medicaid.
not_available Okay.
not_available Some of the meds are formulary.
not_available I'll have to fill out an authorization.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross
not_available We examine him and give him everything.
not_available How long is this gonna take? Just long enough to fill out some forms.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, come here.
not_available I got him.
not_available All right.
not_available Just give me a second to lock up my car.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Got it? 
not_available Got everything.
not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available All right, Josh.
not_available Deep breaths for me.
not_available I'm hearing basilar rales on the left.
not_available Get a CBC, blood culture and a chest film.
not_available Why? What's wrong? 
not_available Could be pneumonia.
not_available Pneumonia? 
not_available Want to hear for yourself? What do I say to the mother? How long does he have to stay? Four hours for test results.
not_available If it is, we'll put him on IV antibiotics.
not_available That means he'll spend the night? Could be, yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Kid looks pretty good.
not_available No fever.
not_available You sure you heard rales? There's no rales.
not_available I'm keeping him.
not_available What's going on? We got a 7month
not_available old baby admitted twice for withdrawal.
not_available I'm not sending him home to be a methadone source for his mother.
not_available Can't Child Services take care of it? 
not_available I'll do an ultrarapid detox and end his addiction today.
not_available Ultrarapid? What does that mean? 
not_available Quick withdrawal under deep sedation.
not_available He's going cold turkey right here? I spoke to a pediatric anesthesiologist.
not_available I know the procedure.
not_available It can be done safely.
not_available How long will it take? You're gonna hide him here for 12 hours? I don't have a choice.
not_available You can't do it alone.
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available Don't put anything at risk.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, if we get caught we'll both help each other through real
not_available estate school.
not_available Put him on cardiac monitor and pulse ox.
not_available I'll do an arterial line.
not_available We'll need a ventilator.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Here's the second dose.
not_available Let's run that over five minutes.
not_available How you doing? I feel a bit tired, but otherwise I'm okay.
not_available Are my mom and dad around? Yeah.
not_available They went to go make some phone calls.
not_available I can go get them.
not_available No hurry.
not_available How is your patient? Aside from his color? He's improving.
not_available Good call, John.
not_available Gotta figure out its cause.
not_available See who else is at risk.
not_available I've heard a lot about you from Anna.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She told me you've become close friends.
not_available I heard about your cousin.
not_available I'm sure she was a big help.
not_available She told you about that? 
not_available You know Anna doesn't keep secrets.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't really see how that concerns you, though.
not_available Well, what she's learned about drug addiction she had the misfortune to learn through me, John.
not_available I know it's private.
not_available I meant no offense.
not_available No, forget it.
not_available Dr.

not_available No.
not_available So, what's up? What Elizabeth and I do in our personal lives should not impact her career.
not_available In your personal lives.
not_available What's that? You saw us in the lockers, then hinted that she won't receive sponsorship next year.
not_available Now, we both know that's not right.
not_available Look, I had no idea you and Lizzie were an item.
not_available I swear I didn't.
not_available But don't worry.
not_available I mean, I'm happy for you.
not_available So you didn't see us? No.

not_available Brothers and sisters, the Lord has put another trial before us.
not_available TinaMarie just learned from this lovely lady
not_available No, she's not a movie star.
not_available This is Tina
not_available Marie's doctor.
not_available Will you tell us the nature of her illness? She has cellulitis and renal insufficiency.
not_available And what does that mean? She has a problem with her kidneys.
not_available But she will survive? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes! She will survive through the power of Christ Jesus and by your prayers and offerings.
not_available Emmet, Emmet, Emmet! I can feel the power of prayer right now! I can feel it! It has started! We all feel it, honey.
not_available Do you feel it, doctor? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, come on.
not_available Here, take Tina
not_available Marie's hand.
not_available We will have a prayer interface.
not_available People are watching and waiting for you, honey.
not_available Yes? Feel the power of the love that courses through us.
not_available God, through you will save my life! Kerry? Got another set of x
not_available rays.
not_available Let's have a look.
not_available Is there a name on these? They're mine.
not_available These are much better images.
not_available Did you look at these? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, it looks clean.
not_available Why'd you order them? Cough? Fever? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Night sweats? 
not_available No, but I have trouble sleeping.
not_available Forgetfulness? Those slides, I put in your mailbox.
not_available But yeah, there's been forgetfulness.
not_available I want you to know something.
not_available Whatever your status, even if you have a measurable viral count no one's going to overreact.
not_available There's going to be a job for you here.
not_available We should draw some blood.
not_available He didn't see us? 
not_available That's what he claims.
not_available I misread him, and you told him about us.
not_available I told him that nothing we do should affect your standing here.
not_available You got heavy with him? Yeah.
not_available Maybe I should've kept my mouth shut.
not_available Taking up my cause was very gallant of you, Peter.
not_available But it seems we've gone public.
not_available Good breath sounds bilaterally.
not_available Heart rate's down to 100.
not_available Pulse ox 99.
not_available He's stable.
not_available Start a second line and be ready before we give him the Narcan.
not_available Are there gonna be side effects? 
not_available It'll make him hypertensive.
not_available We have Nipride, but no esmolol.
not_available I want to have both ready on drips.
not_available I'll go get them.
not_available No.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Kerry Weaver might wonder why you're here after your shift.
not_available Suction.
not_available Lizzie, can you retract distally? Good.
not_available I got the room I need.
not_available Now we can all settle back.
not_available Shirley, let me ask you something.
not_available Suppose you asked someone on a date
not_available I'm married.
not_available Hypothetically.
not_available It's a long procedure.
not_available You ask them out and they beg off, claiming they don't get involved with work colleagues.
not_available Got some oozing.
not_available Got it.
not_available Then you find out they're having an affair with a colleague.
not_available Now, why do you suppose they lied? The colleague is married.
not_available Married person's response.
not_available But say he's not married.
not_available They didn't want to offend an overblown ego.
not_available It's a thought.
not_available But suppose this person made up that story about keeping sex and work separate so they could continue playing the field.
not_available That's absurd.
not_available Clamp again.
not_available Right here.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Shirley? I agree.
not_available They're probably still shopping around.
not_available Your shift ended hours ago.
not_available I got involved.
not_available Esmolol? 
not_available Teenager with a tachy arrhythmia.
not_available How about adenosine? 
not_available I already tried it.
not_available Lasted for a few seconds.
not_available It's under control.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, I just got this fax for you.
not_available This is the explanation for the methemoglobinemia.
not_available Really? It's from a local health service near the farm.
not_available "Ground water from several areas has been found to have heavy nitrite concentration from inorganic waste contamination.
not_available " Test the parents.
not_available They might be borderline.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I did that already.
not_available I'm just waiting on the test results.
not_available Are the labs back on Chambliss? 
not_available Here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Pedes case? I'll put it in my study.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's a repeat glucose on the televangelist.
not_available I heard you look great on TV.
not_available Someone saw me? 
not_available The nurses had it on in the lounge.
not_available What a nightmare! Total frauds.
not_available Not serious? But I phoned in a big pledge! The woman used her disease to milk money out of poor people who probably believe all of it.
not_available It's a living.
not_available At least they're not practicing law or polluting streams, selling insurance What's the deal on getting a genuine Philly cheese steak? I've looked.
not_available They don't exist.
not_available Italian? I'm on a substantial per diem.
not_available And I'm on call.
not_available Chinese? How about a candlelit dinner in the lounge? I'd love to.
not_available Jeanie, could I see you? Sure, Kerry.
not_available You can go.
not_available I'll bandage him.
not_available Thanks, Yosh.
not_available I got your labs back.
not_available I'm very happy to say it's all good news.
not_available Your viral load remains non
not_available detectable your white count's normal and you're not even anemic.
not_available Guess I was worked up over nothing.
not_available I can understand.
not_available But I took responsibility for monitoring your health.
not_available You shouldn't be on your own looking at x
not_available rays.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available That won't happen again.
not_available What about the forgetfulness? You complained of sleeplessness.
not_available I haven't slept much this month.
not_available Are you taking anything? 
not_available Lately I've been taking Halcion.
not_available Which could explain Okay.
not_available The fact is, Jeanie
not_available I mean, you've had such a rough time.
not_available With Al moving away and Scotty That alone could explain your symptoms.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available If you ever wanna talk Thanks, Kerry.
not_available I'd like that.
not_available Good.
not_available Figures are 10 percent above projections.
not_available I think there'll be real cassette sales.
not_available Well, what about next time? Do I die on the TV? Don't make stupid jokes.
not_available Your blood sugar's still elevated.
not_available I need to give you more insulin.
not_available I'm gonna make some phone calls, sweetie.
not_available How often do you test your blood sugar at home? What's that you're supposed to do? Four times a day? I don't know.
not_available To prevent complications, yes.
not_available Well, what kind of complications? Blindness, heart attack, loss of peripheral circulation.
not_available Those are all good prayer vigils.
not_available I'm not joking.
not_available Take responsibility for your health.
not_available Take your problems seriously.
not_available Honey, my problems are all I got.
not_available You wouldn't make a living without them.
not_available Well, I sure as heck wouldn't have Emmet.
not_available You're a lovely thing.
not_available Are you married? 
not_available No.
not_available Emmet and I were married when we were in high school.
not_available Oh, we were crazy in love.
not_available You'd never know it now, would you? It's not for me to make a judgment about that.
not_available I'll tell you one thing.
not_available Emmet won't leave me.
not_available Ever.
not_available God has given me the way to keep him close.
not_available He may not love me.
not_available But he loves the way caring for me makes him look.
not_available I wouldn't be in a marriage without love.
not_available Oh, honey, everyone thinks that.
not_available But things change.
not_available And you make do.
not_available So be careful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So I suppose the Coq d'Or's a bit dressy? Yeah.
not_available But actually, I didn't make reservations there.
not_available Our date's off? 
not_available No, no.
not_available We're going to the Velvet Lounge.
not_available That's fantastic.
not_available They'll look at us like we're crazy.
not_available You know that doesn't bother me.
not_available Wish I could say the same.
not_available Look, I can't change what I am any more than you can.
not_available Whatever feelings I have for you are based on who you are not what I want you to be.
not_available Elizabeth, you're not from here.
not_available I mean, you didn't grow up the way I did.
not_available I wish I could say my feelings about your skin color would disappear.
not_available But it doesn't work like that.
not_available Do you understand? Yes.
not_available But I don't want to subject you to something you're not ready for.
not_available You know, I've never met anybody that makes me laugh or blush, or whatever, the way you do.
not_available I'm trying to work through this.
not_available You gotta trust me, all right? Come on, let's go to the Velvet Lounge.
not_available Hey.
not_available Philly cheese steaks.
not_available I found them here.
not_available And they deliver.
not_available Can you believe that? Want one? More than enough.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Oh, come on! You get a free angioplasty with a small order.
not_available Free quadruple bypass with the dinner special? No? I was wondering.
not_available Maybe you'd like to join Anna and I for dinner sometime.
not_available You really want an ally.
not_available No.
not_available It's about your friendship with her.
not_available I don't want her to cut herself off from people she likes.
not_available Make it easier to go back to you.
not_available Am I hearing jealousy? Maybe once.
not_available Not now.
not_available I just think you're trouble.
not_available Maybe I'm wrong.
not_available I sort of hope I am.
not_available But that's what I think.
not_available I might laugh at your jokes, never giving an indication of how I feel.
not_available But I wanted you to know that.
not_available Enjoy your dinner.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available I've been thinking.
not_available This storage area off the hallway could be made a pediatric exam room.
not_available The janitor's closet? 
not_available Children's beds are small.
not_available We could hang the IV bags on the hooks used for brooms.
not_available This is a joke.
not_available Maybe I'm facing reality.
not_available You're obviously behind the idea.
not_available You gave Rosher a grand tour.
not_available He was very impressed at how we handle our Pedes cases.
not_available Doug's your friend.
not_available You think Rosher's report will get him an Attending position.
not_available I appreciate loyalty, but not at the expense of the ER.
not_available That has nothing to do with it.
not_available I don't believe a Pedes unit or Attending is a big improvement.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Jeanie wants you to sign off on a suture job.
not_available Will you go on record with that? Absolutely.
not_available When the time's right.

not_available A collapsed lung? Should I get a portable x
not_available ray? Can't be.
not_available Pressure's not that high.
not_available I'll give him 100 percent oxygen.
not_available Could be a mucus plug.
not_available I'll get a suction catheter.
not_available Looks good.
not_available Infected abrasion? 
not_available Here.
not_available She cleaned it good.
not_available I'll change it when you come back.

not_available I'm going too.
not_available You're damn right! You're gonna explain to the Administration and the Executive Committee! Let's go! You lied to me.
not_available You looked me in the face and lied.
