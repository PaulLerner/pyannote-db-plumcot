
not_available Previously on ER Rejoice, lost man! Chaos is your destiny! You scare this baby, he won't come out.
not_available Two of the best transplant surgeons let us look over their shoulders, and you just leave? Is that a problem? 
not_available Okay, I'll stay on the couch.
not_available Me too.
not_available I'm looking for a head doctor.
not_available Which one? Bald white guy, little glasses? Great! Just walk away! Is Dr.
not_available Benton done with that thyroidectomy? So he's still in there? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Carter, what are you doing here? Let's get an ABG in 20 minutes.
not_available I thought you were covering the ER.
not_available I'm on in a few.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Make it fast.
not_available I've got two admissions, a clinic and an aneurysm.
not_available I've been thinking about that kidney case when I left to check on the patients during the debriefing.
not_available Instead of listening to two of the finest surgeons in the country? I guess so.
not_available And I've just been wondering.
not_available Maybe I'm in the wrong place.
not_available If you're still here in two minutes, you are.
not_available I mean surgery.
not_available Obviously, I love it, and I feel challenged by it.
not_available But are you ever not quite satisfied? Carter, sometimes the patient dies.
not_available I know.
not_available But otherwise.
not_available Otherwise what? Well, it just feels like sometimes they exist for us to do procedures.
not_available That's why they're here.
not_available We don't need to know anything about them? Like how worried they are or where they went to high school or whether they like cats or dogs? What are you talking about? I like to know the other stuff.
not_available What for? I mean, if you Damn! Listen, we'll talk later.
not_available It was at least 50 questions about my family background.
not_available Nothing like the head of Security to make you feel insecure.
not_available He almost withheld my ID because I didn't know my stepmom's maiden name.
not_available He didn't cut you slack on that picture either.
not_available You'd think I was trying to enter the White House.
not_available Which is easier.
not_available I've done it.
not_available Can you get these over to Radiology? 
not_available Now? Unless you're doing something urgent that I can't quite see.
not_available Go.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, Pedes called.
not_available You're covering deliveries for John Lavagnino.
not_available Broken kneecap.
not_available All right.
not_available Good morning to you.
not_available Not for Anna.
not_available She just had her security clearance interview.
not_available Did you get strip
not_available searched? Checked for track marks? Practically.
not_available They're cracking down because of what happened to Mark.
not_available He starts back today? 
not_available I wish he'd take another week.
not_available Let's make sure we keep his load light for the first few days.
not_available I want him helping me plan Carol's surprise birthday party.
not_available Doug! 
not_available Happy birthday, Carol.
not_available I got vomiting and diarrhea in 4.
not_available Happy birthday.
not_available And I'm taking the quadruple bounce
not_available back migraine in 5.
not_available Nothing like a little drug
not_available seeking behavior to start your day.
not_available You promised you wouldn't tell anybody about my birthday.
not_available That was last year.
not_available You told everybody then too.
not_available At least I'm consistent.
not_available All right, coffee can wait.
not_available What's this? It's a coffeepot.
not_available That is not a coffeepot.
not_available It's called a French press.
not_available No more aluminum percolator? We're gonna have great coffee.
not_available Which can wait.
not_available What's that? 
not_available The microwave.
not_available I'm heating up some cinnamon buns.
not_available The microwave.
not_available I always wanted a microwave.
not_available I know.
not_available You wouldn't let me get one.
not_available You said it broke down the vitamins.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available Come back over here.
not_available This is nice.
not_available I mean, this is really nice.
not_available What happened? 
not_available It's getting close, 9 centimeters.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available She failed tocolysis.
not_available Her contractions are strong.
not_available They went from 4 to 9 in no time.
not_available Why didn't you call me? Last time they gave me that stuff, and it was fine.
not_available Couldn't you have done something else? 
not_available This baby's coming.
not_available It's coming? Two months early? 
not_available I know that.
not_available You should've called me.
not_available I just did, hoping you'd want to participate in the birth.
not_available If that's what you'd like to do, I suggest you gown up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, right? How are you? 
not_available I'm fine, thank you.
not_available Who are you? Anna Del Amico.
not_available We met last week.
not_available We didn't actually meet.
not_available I was there when you were attacked.
not_available In the men's room? 
not_available In the Trauma Room afterwards.
not_available I don't remember either room, so I don't remember you either.
not_available I start my Emergency Residency in July.
not_available I'm doing ER Pedes until then.
not_available That was my first day.
not_available I'm sorry it had to be so exciting.
not_available I'm just glad you're okay.
not_available So welcome back.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where is everybody? What you doing here? 
not_available Getting back to work.
not_available Doug and Carol are bringing in an MVA.
not_available Hey, how are you doing? 
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Nice to be back.
not_available What do we got? 
not_available Bicycle versus tour bus.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We got it.
not_available Just take it easy.
not_available Settle in.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Here we go! Dr.
not_available Greene! You look great.
not_available OB needs you for that delivery.
not_available Find Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available See if she can take it.
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available She's at the desk.
not_available Who? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available She's at the desk.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Help me shift her down.
not_available Breathe, Carla.
not_available Come on, baby.
not_available You can do it.
not_available How much mag you give her? 
not_available Six grams.
not_available I gave three an hour until she hit 4 centimeters.
not_available Dorgan, scalp electrode.
not_available Keep breathing.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Dorgan? What kind of name is that? Irish, through and through.
not_available We've experience having a lot of babies.
not_available Is she at risk for chorioamnionitis? Come on, breathe! Don't yell at me, damn it! You give her antenatal steroids? 
not_available Twelve milligrams betamethasone.
not_available And her blood sugar? She's got gestational diabetes.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available Not much longer.
not_available You'll be able to push soon.
not_available What about a second dose? This baby's gonna have RDS! What is RDS? It's okay.
not_available It just means the baby's lungs haven't matured yet.
not_available What? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Hold her hand! Help her breathe! Help her focus! That's your only job here.
not_available Get over there and help the mother of your child.
not_available There'll be two additional security cameras here.
not_available And two at the employees' entrance.
not_available Right.
not_available The ambulance
not_available bay doors will be changed to bulletproof glass which we'll also add to Triage.
not_available The hospital agreed to additional armed security in your waiting room.
not_available And the bathrooms? Any cameras in there? Unfortunately, privacy issues won't allow us to do that.
not_available My assailant's privacy would've definitely been violated.
not_available We can only do what we can do.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Biggers.
not_available It's nice to see you, but what are you doing here? Working.
not_available It's nice to see you too, Chuny.
not_available These additional security measures may not help, but they can't hurt.
not_available Everyone's overreacting.
not_available What we should change is the way we deal with patients and their families.
not_available They're a pain in the ass.
not_available Your compassion knows no bounds.
not_available Detective Warrington called.
not_available Can't make it by till later this afternoon.
not_available You think a patient or family member did this? I think that gives them a good reason.
not_available Look.

not_available That's why.
not_available Number for Respiratory Therapy? Threethreenine
not_available four.
not_available I brought some stuff in today because I knew you'd be starting back.
not_available What are you doing? I know you'll be a little resistant to this but you'll feel safer if you carry something on you.
not_available What is this stuff? I've got cops in my family, so I can get anything.
not_available Electronic stun gun, personal taser.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available At least take the pepper spray.
not_available I appreciate it, really, but it's not for me.
not_available I'm not suggesting you pack a gun, although that's what I do.
not_available You carry a gun? 
not_available Under the front seat of my car.
not_available I was at the drive
not_available in once, waiting for fries and this punk sticks a knife in my face.
not_available He wants my wallet.
not_available So I reach under the seat, grab the.357 stick it up his nose, and could that kid run! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, welcome back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Listen, thanks, Maggie, but I'll pass on the armaments.
not_available Are you in the ER all day? Because I'll need your help.
not_available I don't have full mobility yet for procedures.

not_available I was trying to get Dr.

not_available I know it's not funny, but 
not_available No, it's funny.
not_available My whole life is just one big funfest.
not_available Anspaugh hates me, Benton looks at me like I'm some kind of an alien.
not_available Those things are in your favor.
not_available Right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When you were thinking about med school you were willing to start over? All that work? As opposed to the 6 more years of Surgical Residency ahead of you? I see your point.
not_available You back among the living? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available We've got an MVA coming in six or seven minutes.
not_available It's not my place to say, but he looks kind of bad.
not_available You okay there? I'm just going to get everything ready for you.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Just hang in there.
not_available You're almost there.
not_available What are we gonna do? Have you seen him? I'll check on him as soon as you're settled.
not_available Just take it easy.
not_available Just be a couple of more minutes.

not_available What's he ordered? 
not_available Everything.
not_available CBC, lytes, blood cultures, what? 
not_available Yes.
not_available All that.
not_available ABG, chest xray? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Your son is stable at the moment.
not_available What labs have you ordered? We've done a complete septic workup.
not_available I need to know exactly what you've ordered.
not_available What labs, what antibiotics, what Dr.
not_available Benton, your son's heart rate is 170 and his pulse ox is 91 on 100 percent oxygen.
not_available We've taken a chest xray, drawn blood for CBC, lytes and ABG sent off blood, urine, endotracheal aspirate and spinal
not_available fluid cultures and started him on 100 milligrams of ampicillin and 6 milligrams of gentamicin.
not_available He was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 30/18 so he's received 5 percent albumin, 10 cc's per kilo.
not_available And we've started dopamine, And we'll titrate to a M.A.P.
not_available Of 40.
not_available Now, what you need to know.
not_available What you need to share with this child's mother is that at the moment, the baby is stable but critically ill.
not_available Probably has a serious infection in his blood.
not_available We don't know if his lungs can provide enough oxygen to sustain life.
not_available Unfortunately, we have no choice but to wait and see how he responds to the present therapy.
not_available Let's see how he's doing in an hour.
not_available And that's when we should talk again.
not_available What's your son's name? He doesn't have one.
not_available All right, I got some good news and bad news.
not_available You're gonna tell me both.
not_available The bad news is, they're planning a surprise birthday party for you.
not_available You did this joke on me this morning.
not_available This one's real.
not_available I got invited.
not_available I'm not listening.
not_available The good news is, I know you hate your birthday, so I got you out of it.
not_available I do not hate my birthday.
not_available So I told them you cannot make it because you're having dinner with me.
not_available I do not believe a word of this.
not_available How many people have wished you happy birthday? Just Kerry, this morning.
not_available And how many people know that it is your birthday? You know theirs, right? 
not_available We've worked together for years.
not_available What is the one reason why you don't wish someone happy birthday when it is their birthday? 
not_available They're planning a surprise party.
not_available That's all I'm saying.
not_available Why do I feel you've trapped me into this? Trapped you? I saved you.
not_available You should be buying me dinner.
not_available I'll pick you up anytime.
not_available You name the place and You got some gauze out here.
not_available I'm out of here as of an hour ago.
not_available Can you send that Carla Reece chart up to OB, please? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I got it.
not_available Did you say Carla Reece? She just delivered her baby.
not_available Carla? 
not_available You know her? Not really.
not_available I remember her.
not_available She came through the ER a month ago.
not_available She wasn't near being due.
not_available I know.
not_available The baby's only 32 weeks.
not_available A little boy.
not_available Was he okay? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available He's in the NICU.
not_available Apgar was poor.
not_available Had to intubate.
not_available It's touchand
not_available go.
not_available Is she doing all right? She had no other complications, if that's what you mean.
not_available I don't know how many preemies I've resuscitated but I'm still not used to it.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available See you.
not_available Is Maggie taking that woman with the eye pain? No, I'm taking her.
not_available I'm just heading in.
not_available Don't keep the patients waiting.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's on a rampage about that.
not_available He'll settle back in.
not_available He just needs a couple more days.
not_available I keep missing you.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Feels good to be back.
not_available Not too soon? 
not_available It was nice having time with Rachel.
not_available But a week at home is about all I could take.
not_available Any word from the police? 
not_available They're gonna come by this afternoon.
not_available I gave them a list of patients and family members who might have had a reason to be that angry.
not_available The ones I could remember.
not_available So you're okay with this? 
not_available Yes and no.
not_available It hasn't been the most pleasant experience but it's a wake
not_available up call.
not_available A reminder that I can be abrupt with people, and it'll backfire.
not_available I don't know if that's You've got a fiveyear
not_available old with a wrist fracture.
not_available A child in pain.
not_available Music to my ears.
not_available Get some lunch later? I'm so sorry.
not_available The chest xray showed a diffuse, patchy infiltrate and the endotracheal aspirate showed gram
not_available negative bacteria.
not_available He's got pneumonia, sepsis, premature lungs Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
not_available They just gave him surfactant to try to open up his lungs.
not_available How's Carla doing? She asked me to wait outside in the hall.
not_available You probably haven't shared this with anyone, have you? Your family, people you work with.
not_available You do have friends.
not_available A community.
not_available I hope everything will be all right.
not_available And you need to stop standing in the hall.
not_available Just keep your hands at your sides.
not_available It hurts! 
not_available Yes, I think we know that.
not_available Pulse is 130.
not_available BP is 180 over 95.
not_available Pre
not_available op labs? You been taking a lot of ibuprofen lately? About eight tablets a day.
not_available But that's because I twisted my knee, not because of this stomachache.
not_available You have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Let's get an upright chest x
not_available ray and give 10 of morphine slow IV push.
not_available That'll help with your pain.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I'm just checking.
not_available This is the groaning guy in Exam 2 that Dr.
not_available Greene was concerned about? He's concerned? He's worried the guy's waiting too long for a Surgical consult.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lensky's got a board
not_available like abdomen and guarding in all four quadrants.
not_available A perfed ulcer? 
not_available Sounds like it.
not_available I ordered a film.
not_available Have Anspaugh check it out.
not_available Colles' fracture.
not_available Do a closed reduction? His dad still too flipped out to watch? He's sacked out in Curtain 3, having self
not_available medicated with Valium.
not_available That's helpful.
not_available Maybe we should get a lollipop for Russell.
not_available Fentanyl Oralet? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm out.
not_available I'll have to order it.
not_available It may take a while.
not_available We can try it without.
not_available All right.
not_available I tell you what we're gonna do, buddy.
not_available We're gonna 
not_available I'll get that lollipop.
not_available Get right on it.
not_available I want to give it a little longer, but the surfactant didn't do much.
not_available He still requires 100 percent oxygen with high pressures on the ventilator.
not_available His mother's gonna want to know everything that might happen.
not_available Every parent in here wants to know what might happen.
not_available We just can't know for sure.
not_available You know I did a Pedes Surgery elective this year but I'm not up to speed on all the sequelae.
not_available Like retinopathy? Exactly.
not_available Although, his eyesight should be the least of our worries.
not_available We need to be more concerned about intraventricular hemorrhage periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis and in a few weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
not_available All right, what do we do? I'm concerned about the high vent pressure's causing lung damage.
not_available So I want to switch him over to an oscillating ventilator, and we wait.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, you got a second? 
not_available What is it? I got the head CT back on Harry Smith.
not_available Harry Smith? 
not_available The MVA from this morning? It's negative.
not_available No bleed.
not_available But I was talking to his mother.
not_available She said Harry was on his way to a pre
not_available employment physical for a new job.
not_available She also let it drop that she was relieved that the cops didn't find marijuana on him.
not_available Is this leading to helping the patient? His urine is like water.
not_available Check this out.
not_available "Specific gravity, 10.05." I think we should give him Lasix for hyponatremia.
not_available Water intoxication? If he's worried about a urine drug test maybe he thinks he can dilute it or wash out his system.
not_available Transfer that LOL back to her nursing home.
not_available Did you hear from that detective who said he was coming by? Haven't heard, haven't seen.
not_available That's a good thought.
not_available Call the lab and see if his lytes are back.
not_available Does that hurt? That's why Dr.
not_available Ross gave you that shot.
not_available Nurse Hathaway is gonna pull down on your arm I'll push, and we'll pop that bone right here right back in place.
not_available Ready to start? 
not_available Where's my dad? Taking a nap.
not_available But he wanted us to be here with you.
not_available He sings to me.
not_available He sings to you, does he? So you'll do it? I think Dr.
not_available Ross would love to sing to you.
not_available You know, Nurse Hathaway would like to join in but she doesn't know the words.
not_available I believe I do too know the words to whatever it is Dr.
not_available Ross is gonna sing to you.
not_available He//o, Muddah He//o, Faddah Here I am at Camp Grenada It is very entertaining Pop it right there.
not_available And they say we'// have some fun If it stops raining Wrap that up.
not_available I went hiking With Joe Spivy He did develop Poison ivy You brought me here for this? 
not_available I think he perfed his stomach ulcer.
not_available Of course.
not_available It's free air under the diaphragm.
not_available It's a slam dunk, no
not_available brainer.
not_available All right, drop an NG, consent him and redline him to the O.R.
not_available I realize you needed backup, but any Senior Resident could've handled this.
not_available So please think twice next time.
not_available Good news.
not_available We'll be able to fix you up right away.
not_available What is it? 
not_available You have an ulcer which has eaten through the lining of your stomach but with surgery can be easily repaired.
not_available Surgery? It's a fairly routine procedure 
not_available I can't do surgery.
not_available It really is the only option.
not_available No.
not_available I feel better already.
not_available That's the morphine.
not_available Nothing's changed with your condition.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You listen to me! I will not have surgery! And you can't make me! Now leave me alone.
not_available I wanna go.
not_available Can you tell me why you feel so strongly? Did something happen to you? To somebody else? I'm trying to help you here.
not_available But I can't help you if you leave.
not_available Or if you won't tell me what the problem is.
not_available Of all the stupid things.
not_available Gallbladder.
not_available My dad was such a believer in modern doctors, modern medicines.
not_available "They'll pop this thing out.
not_available I'll be home tomorrow." Fifty
not_available eight years old, and he dies having his stupid gallbladder taken out.
not_available And the surgeon.
not_available All he could talk about was how simple it was, no big deal.
not_available Afterwards, he couldn't even look my mother in the eye.
not_available He gave us the news and just spouted some fancy medical words.
not_available All I could think was, "You lying son of a bitch!" We shouldn't have believed him.
not_available How can I believe you? I talked to him about his father's gallbladder operation.
not_available I explained why his surgery was different.
not_available I couldn't get him to budge.
not_available Not much you can do.
not_available He needs to get to the O.R.
not_available Not to mention, Anspaugh's gonna take my head off one more time.
not_available We can't override the consent for emergency surgery.
not_available No, we can't.
not_available But I read a paper about forme fruste ulcers that spontaneously seal off.
not_available Do a paper
not_available chase search.
not_available See what you find.
not_available Maybe a Hypaque upper GI, see what's going on.
not_available Good idea.
not_available These labs came back for you on Harry Smith.
not_available Sodium, 115? I don't believe it.
not_available I was right.
not_available He's been drinking buckets of water.
not_available He's also waking up if you want to talk to him.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Greene? Anything to drink? Sure.
not_available I'll take a pop if you've got one.
not_available Good news.
not_available All the leads you gave us came out clear.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Everyone checked out.
not_available Patients? Families? Everyone you gave us.
not_available There wasn't anything on anyone? Usually people are glad to hear that.
not_available They don't like things happening in their own back yard.
not_available Right.
not_available Right.
not_available You okay? Sure.
not_available I see you made a pretty quick recovery.
not_available It wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
not_available We'll keep investigating, of course.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Later, Carter.
not_available I was right about the water
not_available intoxication guy.
not_available His sodium is 115.
not_available He drank 3 gallons.
not_available That's great.
not_available Great.
not_available Terrific.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Admit to Medicine.
not_available It's not that it's a better or a worse option.
not_available It just may be the only other thing to consider.
not_available Babies can respond to inhaled nitric oxide and it can improve their oxygenation.
not_available In full
not_available term babies.
not_available Correct.
not_available It's still being studied in premature infants.
not_available We're participating in a national multicenter trial.
not_available There is a small series which shows that nitric improved oxygenation by 50 percent on average.
not_available Now, half of those kids did develop bleeding of the brain but no one knows if the gas caused that.
not_available Bleeding in the brain.
not_available There would be a risk of retardation and cerebral palsy.
not_available But if we keep doing what we're doing now, there's a risk of lung disease.
not_available Yes.
not_available And possible brain damage if the oxygen level falls too low.
not_available That's a hell of a choice.
not_available How do I make that decision? I wish I could answer that question for every parent I talk to every day.
not_available Dr.
not_available Tabash? I'm sorry.
not_available Talk it over with the baby's mother, and let me know soon.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm an idiot, Kerry.
not_available I'm a complete idiot.
not_available Was that the detective you were waiting for? It wasn't an angry patient.
not_available It wasn't a family member of an angry patient.
not_available It wasn't Chris Law.
not_available It wasn't Mr.
not_available Gunther.
not_available It wasn't that crazy guy who was yelling about Krishna.
not_available They checked everybody out? I thought I was remembering it like a puzzle that would come together.
not_available But the Chicago Police Department was nice enough to inform me that I am simply the victim of random violence.
not_available Well, you knew that, patient or no patient.
not_available What I knew is that everything I do I do because I am not the victim.
not_available I treat the victim.
not_available I cure the victim.
not_available I watch them roll the victim out like a piece of meat.
not_available But the truth is, I'm the piece of meat.
not_available We can't think about that.
not_available We're the ones who see what goes on out there.
not_available We know that every day some child won't make it home from school.
not_available Some father won't make it home from work.
not_available But if we allowed ourselves to think that could be us we couldn't walk out our front door.
not_available The problem is, that is us.
not_available No, the problem is, it makes us like everyone else.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, I was just coming up to see you.
not_available Where's that perfed ulcer? He should've been out two hours ago.
not_available That's why I wanted to talk.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lensky doesn't want surgery.
not_available Well, nobody wants surgery.
not_available So what? But he doesn't need it.
not_available Of course he does.
not_available There's a hole in his stomach.
not_available If we don't repair that perf, he's at risk for peritonitis, sepsis, death.
not_available If you look, there's the ulcer.
not_available But there actually is no leak.
not_available It sealed itself off against the liver.
not_available This patient was redlined to the O.R.
not_available Who ordered an upper GI? I did.
not_available You were supposed to consent him.
not_available He doesn't want surgery.
not_available He needs surgery.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available I found an article that shows he could be treated medically.
not_available Which is what he wants.
not_available You think this is about what he wants? I guess.
not_available A little bit.
not_available Well, you're wrong.
not_available This job is about determining what a patient needs and the best way for us, as surgeons, to meet that need.
not_available And as surgeons, we cut.
not_available As a doctor, if I can find a way to do what my patient wants that's medically acceptable, that's what I should do.
not_available I don't believe I should cut somebody open just because I can.
not_available It bothers me that this patient is willing to risk death rather than undergo a simple surgical procedure.
not_available But it bothers me even more that you're so willing to help him do that.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Mark, I still need you to sign off on these QA reviews.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available But I'm off in five.
not_available I just Why don't you just leave them at the desk for me? All right? Done.
not_available Done.
not_available Done.
not_available You look very nice tonight.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Can you file these for me? I'll ask Miss Kelly.
not_available Miss Kelly? 
not_available Our temp clerk tonight.
not_available Why do we have a temp? I'm sorry, but I don't think that's any of your business.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Want to grab a burger? He is so strange.
not_available Where did we find him? Nina, hi.
not_available Damn! I was supposed to call you.
not_available I hate having you think of it that way.
not_available It's been really busy.
not_available Good first day back? 
not_available Completely fabulous.
not_available Did you call Dr.
not_available Gillum? That PTSD guy? Well, you are post
not_available trauma.
not_available I know I need time to settle in but it's not like I'm a postal worker with an AK
not_available 47.
not_available I know you're not.
not_available I'm just trying to help any way I can.
not_available I know, and I appreciate it.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Everything's getting back to normal.
not_available I don't like you trying to cover with me.
not_available I don't like you trying to be a shrink with me.
not_available How's Rachel doing? She's sleeping over at a friend's house tonight.
not_available Great.
not_available Tell her I say hi.
not_available Sure.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available How is she? Remarkably well, considering.
not_available She's pretty strong.
not_available I wanted to apologize for my behavior this morning in the delivery.
not_available Thank you, but it's unnecessary.
not_available I've never met a father who could handle it sensibly, calmly, maturely.
not_available If I ever do, that's the guy I'm really gonna slap around.
not_available Today was the first day I was ever afraid.
not_available Well, I'm glad to hear that.
not_available Better get back in here.
not_available I'll check on her before I leave.
not_available I made the bed.
not_available Isn't that the stupidest thing you've ever seen? I spoke to Dr.
not_available Tabash.
not_available He presented another option for the baby we should consider.
not_available There are a lot of serious risks involved.
not_available So I'm going to try to explain them to you.
not_available Then we have a decision to make.
not_available You don't have to change for me.
not_available I'm not changing for you.
not_available You said we were gonna grab a burger.
not_available We can get some burgers at the Pump Room.
not_available I'm not wearing scrubs to the Pump Room.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I think it'd be rather daring.
not_available Surprise! Happy birthday! Oh, God! I hate you for this.
not_available It worked out well, don't you think? Surprise, girl! That was great.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Waiting for you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Right this way.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just come over here.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's this? 
not_available A little something for you.
not_available A garage
not_available door opener! Go ahead.
not_available Try it.
not_available I always wanted one of these.
not_available I know.
not_available You always said they were stupid.
not_available They are stupid.
not_available I don't get why a person can't just open the damn door.
not_available This is the nicest thing you've ever done for me.
not_available That's pretty pathetic.
not_available I love it.
not_available I love it.
not_available Let's have a beer.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available This is special.
not_available I love having 20 people over especially when I have so much to serve them.
not_available Peel an orange.
not_available Would you lighten up? They brought booze.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll lighten up.
not_available I'll just have a sip of this milk.
not_available You just drink that right out of the carton? What's wrong with that? Well, it's just kind of a guy thing to do.
not_available You know.
not_available So what is all this about? What is what about? This little dance you did today.
not_available This party.
not_available You.
not_available I know you haven't had very good birthdays the last couple of years.
not_available The ones I spent with you? 
not_available The ones I forgot.
not_available I just thought it was time for you to have a nice one.
not_available You want a sip of milk? Yes, I would love a sip of this milk.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Can I talk to you for a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I know this isn't the right time or place, but I was curious.
not_available What would be involved with getting into Emergency Medicine? What do you mean? To change one's Residency, would you have to redo your intern year? Has "one" talked to Dr.
not_available Greene about this? You saw how he was in the hall.
not_available Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Caro/ Happy birthday to you Oh, my God! Come on, blow them out! There are so many candles on this cake.
not_available What am I, 55? Wait! Hold on! One second.
not_available Almost forgot.
not_available Wait a minute! Beautiful.
not_available What's that? It's so your wishes come true.
not_available Make it a good one.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, Carol.
not_available You go, girl! Oh, my God.
not_available You still look so young.
