not_available I don't believe it.
not_available He's a good boy.
not_available You know, he's stealing Dr.
not_available Morris' credit card he's disrespecting you.
not_available I don't know what to think.
not_available If he did do it, I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.
not_available Do you think Alex started that fire by accident? I think you should continue to take him to that therapist lady.
not_available As far as the police go, they think it was a candle.
not_available Let it go at that.
RAY Well, I'm glad to hear he's doing okay.
not_available Yeah, he just needed a little time for the hand to heal.

MORRIS Pratt.
HEATHER Scum.
not_available Pratt.
not_available What? The Medical Board suspended your license.

not_available Excuse me? 
not_available I helped him at the clinic.
not_available What? 
not_available I know, I know.
not_available It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available Look, I told Pratt that he didn't have to protect me but he wants me to stay out of it.
not_available Well, you listen to Pratt.
not_available I'm gonna burn in hell, aren't I? 
not_available No.
not_available I mean, you might have some explaining to do.

not_available Tempting, but no, thanks.
not_available No, really, l Aah.
not_available I thought that's why you put the gloves on.

not_available Didn't work, but I got into Hustler as one of those guys who has three 
not_available All right, I get it.
not_available Ever had food poisoning? I puked once after biting into a Red Hot with stretch marks.
not_available Okay, uh, we have to run some tests to rule out anything serious like appendicitis, but after that, hopefully, we can discharge you.
not_available What's up with this guy? 
not_available Vomiting, low fever, exam is equivocal.
not_available Doc, doc, you gotta get me out of here, man.

not_available Our exchange pool paired them up with two cousins who are in the same situation.
not_available Yup.
not_available Kidneys for everyone.
DUBENKO Hi.
not_available You guys set? You bet.
not_available No more dialysis, no more infected shunts.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available She'll be assisting on the transplant.
not_available I am? Well, someone's about to get some A
not_available 1 kidney meat.
not_available I'm like a racehorse.
not_available I could drink a six
not_available pack without peeing.
not_available Honey, gross.
not_available Micturation capacity is related to bladder size and neural sensitivity not renal function.
not_available Then we'll give them some bladder too.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Okay, I'll see what I can do.
not_available You guys have any questions? Concerns? No? Okay.
not_available I'll see you in the O.R.
not_available Our goal is to enroll By mixing and matching, we'd find kidneys for almost 50 percent of them.
not_available I'll introduce you to the Herrero cousins.
not_available Marina's getting a kidney from one cousin and Thomas is giving his to the other.
not_available Yep, kind of like a kidney key party.
not_available Key party? Except donors and recipients aren't allowed to meet.
not_available That could get messy.
not_available It's the ER.
not_available I'll catch up to you.
not_available What's a key party? Oh, it's a little gimmick to help swinging couples pick their partners.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Before your time.
not_available It sounds dirty.

not_available Okay, Jessie, come on.
not_available Hold still.

not_available You got this, right? Hey, no, no, no.
not_available Don't leave me here.
not_available Did you give him the Reglan? 
not_available An hour ago.
not_available Okay, it's probably just gastroenteritis.
not_available And if your labs are okay, we'll get you home.
not_available Forget home.
not_available I got a gig at 
10 15.
not_available The big room at Zanies.
not_available I've been trying to get in there for a couple of years.
not_available You're a comedian? Aspiring.

ABBY We're trying to get you better.
not_available Oof.
SAM How long you been doing standup? Moved out here from Detroit a couple of years ago.
not_available Very courageous.
not_available Yeah, my old boss pushed me into it.
not_available Because you were funny at work? No.
not_available Because he fired me twice.
not_available Hated my guts.
not_available My dad also had a lot to do with it.
not_available He hated you too? No.
not_available He died.
not_available Life took on a whole new perspective.
not_available I'm gonna call the lab and see what's taking so long.
not_available Just relax.
not_available I will try to relax.
not_available I will.
not_available We spent four weeks e
not_available mailing each other.
not_available We finally meet and he sticks me with the bill? So you chased after him and you fell into a hydrant? Would've caught him had I been wearing flats.
GATES All right, breath sounds are perfect.
not_available Lay back.
not_available So what if I told him I looked like Cindy Crawford? 
not_available He said he looked like Matt Damon.
not_available Did he? More like Matt Damon's fat uncle's ass.
not_available Pulse ox, 98 on room air.
not_available Tell me if this hurts.
not_available Aah! Yeah.
not_available All right, you have a broken rib.
not_available I'm gonna give you something for the pain and take an x
not_available ray.
not_available Percocet, CBC and two
not_available view chest.
not_available Hey.
not_available So you out of here, man? Yeah, guess so.
not_available Well, hopefully, it will just be temporary.
not_available Yeah, that will be too bad for you.
not_available Good luck, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Thanks, Timmy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Yeah? You're gonna be okay.
not_available God is on your side.

not_available Okay, I could go with you.
not_available I just did the overnight.
not_available I'm almost off.
not_available Hope, go home.

not_available No, I'm okay, really.
not_available Please.
not_available Hope, come pull the PICC line for the guy in 2.
not_available Okay, I gotta take this.
not_available What about it, Greg? The church's support couldn't hurt.
not_available You're still operating the clinic that got me in this mess.
not_available Look, I'm just trying to better the community.
not_available Yeah? What are you doing about black
not_available male incarceration? I have a sermon on it next week.
not_available Make sure you tell them how you got me there.
not_available Greg, I just wanna help.
not_available My license is suspended, I'm facing jail time.
not_available I think you've helped enough.
BEN So how did it go with the counselor? It wasn't what I expected, but nothing in my life ever is.
not_available What did she say? She, uh, wants me to enroll Alex in an academy for at
not_available risk youth, which is code word for nutjobs.
not_available My kid is not a nutjob.
not_available He's just going through some stuff.
not_available Well, maybe it's some stuff that he can't handle.
not_available I know about those places.
not_available They starve them and beat them.
not_available I can't send him there.
not_available I could help you check some out, see if there's any that might be okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But I, uh, need to do it alone.
not_available I'm sorry that I dragged you into everything in the first place.
not_available Don't worry about it, Sam.
not_available I rea I really like you but I have to focus on Alex right now and I don't have time for any kind of a relationship.
not_available All right.
not_available I get it.
not_available You do? 
not_available I do.
not_available Your kid comes first.
not_available So take as much time as you need.
not_available Is there any discomfort here? No.
not_available Do you have a boyfriend? Uh 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available We're still defining it.
not_available Mm.
not_available A girl like you doesn't need the Internet.
not_available I haven't had a valentine since Jimmy Bachner in sixth grade.
not_available Ouch! She's into S &amp; M.
not_available If you want her to stop, say " mayday.
not_available " It's the safe word.
not_available Mayday.
not_available Mayday.
not_available There's no right upper
not_available quadrant tenderness, liver is fine.
not_available Let's observe her for two hours check another CBC and follow serial exams.
not_available Hey, wait up.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available You? Yeah, came home from Wisconsin yesterday.
not_available How is Sarah holding up? It's not gonna be easy.
not_available I can imagine.
not_available Listen, I should've called.
not_available Look 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, I should've called.
not_available The funeral was awkward, the relatives 
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, Neela.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available I'm sure you've got a lot on your plate.
not_available I mean, you've probably got two plates and a little saucer.
not_available Yeah, a heart
not_available shaped saucer.
not_available Valentine's Day, Wednesday.
not_available Let's have a quiet dinner, huh? 
not_available Yeah, we'll see.
ABBY Hey, guys.
not_available I've got surgery.
not_available Neela? Is she all right? I don't know.
not_available What about you? Lockhart, your comic's CBC is back, and it ain't funny.
not_available White blood count 32,000 with 60 percent blasts.
not_available He has leukemia? With immature white cells, he's anemic, neutropenic.
not_available Oh, great.
MITCHELL Did you see the AMJ's article on integrative medicine? You know the world is falling apart when a study on Reiki makes it into the journal.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available It's sexy, but the Dana wouldn't touch it.
not_available The design is totally flawed.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hi.

NEELA I've isolated the artery.
DUBENKO All right, Neela, clip it.
CRENSHAW You're letting her? 
DUBENKO She knows what she's doing.
not_available What are the pertinent anatomical relationships? 
NEELA Anterior to posterior, it goes renal pelvis, renal vein and then artery, which is clipped.
DUBENKO Good.
CRENSHAW Any third
not_available year medical student could've answered that.
CRENSHAW What structures make up the cortex? 
NEELA The what? Cortex.
not_available It's that bean
not_available shaped thing you're cutting into.
not_available You mean, like, the proximal tubules and the distal tubules? 
CRENSHAW And renal corpuscles.
not_available Medulla? Loop of Henle and Mm
not_available hm.
SHIRLEY Your valentine needs a surgical consult.
NEELA My valentine? Gates? Oh, young love is so sweet.
not_available He's not smart enough for you.
not_available You don't even know him.
not_available Come on, Gates is easy math.
DUBENKO Okay, that's enough.
NEELA Artery is ligated.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko, the donor kidney is prepped and ready to go.
not_available Excellent timing.
not_available Have them send it in.
not_available How did Mr.
not_available Herrero do? No complications, minimal blood loss.
not_available They're closing now.
not_available That's great.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, where you going? Where you going? Is that where you do the anal probe? Sam, can you grab the Zosyn? I liked the other room.

ABBY Yeah.
not_available Simon.
not_available Yeah.

not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Your blood tests show that you have leukemia.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I thought you were gonna tell me I had cancer.
not_available Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells in the bone marrow.
not_available That's great.
not_available So give me Viagra, send me home and we are all good.
not_available This isn't funny.
not_available I know.
not_available You're gonna need IV antibiotics.
not_available I know, I know, I know.
not_available I got leukemia about a year ago.
not_available I had induction chemo and a bone
not_available marrow transplant and now a year later, it's back.
not_available Why can't cancer be like herpes? I got that once and it never came back.
not_available Herpes doesn't go away.
not_available This is Zanies, doc.
not_available You jam there, you get invited to Second City, to SNL.
not_available You could get a spot on Letterman.
not_available You know, my dad, he put hubcaps on Buicks.
not_available Buicks.
not_available Before he died, the last thing he told me 
was " Don't be another auto worker wishing you could've, would've, should've.
not_available Don't be like me, son.
not_available " 
not_available I have to get you started on antibiotics.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available I go on at 
10 15.
not_available At 10:35, I'm all yours.
not_available There's not gonna be a show tonight.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available If you wanna make it to next month I have to get a CT, a surgical consult, and check on chemo.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hey, Timmy, can you call GI and order an EGD report for me? No problem.
not_available Hey, you got time for coffee? Yeah.
not_available Everything good? Yes.
not_available I just had the coolest surgery and I figured we could talk.
not_available Sure.
GATES Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Hello.
not_available I thought you weren't coming.
not_available I heard you were short Attendings and I got bored.
not_available You okay? You look good.
not_available You good? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What are you doing here? I talked to Timmy and he said you guys could use some help.
not_available Um, Neela, can you look at this? My patient Simon's CT is back.
not_available Gates, some school principal's on the phone for you.
not_available Appendicitis? 
GATES Hello.
not_available She's crying? No, I understand.
not_available I understand.
not_available Let me talk to her, please.
not_available Look at his cecum.
not_available There's wall thickening and distension.
GATES Hey.
not_available No, I told you you didn't have to go to school.
not_available I'll get you.
not_available Let me talk to the principal.
not_available Hello? It's typhlitis.
not_available Immuno
not_available compromised hosts can get a cecal infection.
GATES Yeah.
not_available Surgery? Treat with IV antibiotics unless he perforates.
not_available And then, would you operate? Well, normally.
not_available Given his leukemia, I doubt he'd survive, so So? 
GATES No, no.
not_available Thank you for calling.
not_available So nothing.
not_available No surgery for him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Sarah's having trouble at school.
not_available Gotta pick her up.
not_available I'll call you later? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Um I'm gonna go and grab a coffee.
not_available Do you want anything? Yeah, I'll tag along.
not_available These people don't have insurance, can't afford a doctor.
not_available Some can't even buy medicine.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available I thought, with some guidance, the clinic could be a good thing.
not_available Why not send them to County Hospital? Have you ever been to County? Trained there 20 years ago.
not_available Well, nowadays, we're filled with critical patients.
not_available People come in for a prescription refill, they wait up to 12 hours.
not_available So this was about convenience? This was about helping people.
not_available There are programs for that.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available If you're over 65 or you have dependent kids.
not_available Regular folks with low
not_available paying jobs, they don't qualify.
not_available This clinic took care of those who fell through the cracks.
not_available Four O.R.
not_available S, four patients, four kidneys, all being worked on at the same time.
not_available Went like clockwork.
not_available We were this fine
not_available tuned machine.
not_available I mean, this morning, two people were wasting away waiting for a kidney they thought would never come.
not_available Now they're upstairs with their donors, eating Jell
not_available O, done with dialysis.
not_available It's amazing, right? 
not_available It's pretty cool.
not_available This is what it's all about, man.
not_available This is why I became a surgeon.
not_available Hey, Ray, you wanna give us a hand? I need to take this, okay? I thought, " What's a 14year
not_available old doing with strokes?" I figured there's gotta be more to the story, so I went back to the parents and, yes, kid's adopted.
not_available And? 
not_available Undiagnosed sickle beta thal.
not_available Kid didn't get screened at birth.
not_available Wow.
not_available Nice pickup.
MORRIS Thank you.
not_available Oliver Miles, burned his hands trying to cremate his dead cat in the microwave.
not_available I tried the fireplace, but I couldn't get it lit.
OLBES Partial thickness to the hands and forearms.
not_available Tachy at 120.
not_available BP, 130/78.
not_available Pulse ox, only 91.
not_available Okay, let's start him on five of albuterol by neb.
not_available So I thought a crematorium is just a big oven, right? 
MORRIS Another four of IV morphine.
not_available I don't know what he ate last.
not_available It was like he just exploded.
KOVAC Oh! I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Do you know if someone has my cat? ABG with carboxyhemoglobin level, portable chest and 125 of Solu
not_available Medrol.
RAY No problem.
not_available Trauma 2.
not_available I'll be there in a second.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine, Morris.
not_available Your hand is not.
not_available No, this was just an accident.
not_available Go home.
not_available Rest.
not_available I promise we'll be okay.
not_available Yoo
not_available hoo.
not_available Haha
not_available ha.
not_available Hey, Luka.
not_available I didn't know you were back.
not_available I'm not.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Better now.
not_available Take care, Gracie.
not_available Sure you don't wanna wait till I get off? I don't really feel like sending you home by yourself.
not_available I'm not going home, Sammy.
not_available I'm taking a little cruise.
not_available This way, you and Alex can bond.
not_available We can bond with you here.
not_available You need time to sort through all this.
not_available Oh, God, Grandma.
not_available All I ever wanted to do was raise a good kid.
not_available He got the crazy gene.
not_available Oh, thank God, it skips a generation.
not_available You and I were both spared.
not_available You think? Haha
not_available ha.
not_available It's gonna be all right, Sammy.
not_available He's going through a phase.
not_available It's rebellion, and then he'll come back around.
not_available The good ones always do.
not_available Yeah, well, what if he's not a good one? He's yours, isn't he? 
not_available You're going with Timmy? The lido deck awaits.
not_available Only old people take cruises alone.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Which one do you like 
better " Thank you, folks.
not_available It was great to be here" or just, " That's all, folks.
not_available Now go home and beat the kids"? You have an infection in the cecum where the small and large intestines join up.
not_available Maybe I'll just 
say " Go home and beat the kids, but don't forget to tip the wait staff.
not_available " Listen, did you hear me? What I said to you earlier? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available I feel better.
not_available I just need you to buff me up.
not_available Well, I can't, because you have no immune system.
not_available You cannot fight this infection.
not_available I don't need my immune system tonight.
not_available I need my funny bone.
not_available I spoke to your oncologist.
not_available You're out of treatment options.
not_available You have a poor prognostic karyotype.
not_available ElevenQ
not_available 23 translocation.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And because leukemia's recurred twice you don't have any options for chemotherapy.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Okay, so just put me in some trial.
not_available Make me a guinea pig.
not_available I've always wanted to run on a wheel, drink from a drip bottle.
not_available There isn't any trial.
not_available And it's probably a matter of weeks, not months.
not_available Is there anyone you want me to call? Yeah.
not_available A cab.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm getting the hell out of here.
not_available Look, you can't, Simon, you can't.
not_available What do I have to lose, huh? I don't wanna walk on the moon or bang Barbara Bush.
not_available Look I wanna get on that stage and make an audience laugh.
not_available You can't go.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Have you ever wanted to do something that just scared the hell out of you but you knew you had to do it? Well, this is it for me.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Maybe a blood transfusion will give you some more energy.
not_available Come on.
not_available I just need to be able to stand up.
not_available Or sit down.
not_available Maybe I could be a sit
not_available down standup.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm gonna have to have you sign out against medical advice.
not_available If I just took anyone's advice I'd still be checking taillights in Detroit now.
not_available And if anybody asks, this is not my idea.
not_available Shh 
HIGGINS How do you keep track of your patients? I used 5by
not_available 7 cards for patient information.
not_available And you have a complete H &amp; P on a 5by
not_available 7 card? Well, we had limited records, just the important information.
not_available Where did you keep them? 
not_available In a box.
not_available A box? And if your patients had medical care other places was there a system for other health professionals to access this box? No.
not_available But they could have paged me, I guess.
not_available Would you say your records system met the standards the Medical Board has set? Come on.
not_available We were in a church.
not_available And did you log the drugs you dispensed? Did you record the lot numbers? 
not_available No, not fully.
not_available Not at all, isn't that right? Are you aware that this is a violation of the Medical Practice Act, Dr.
not_available Pratt? I never claimed that this was a full
not_available service medical center.
not_available I didn't charge any money.
not_available I was trying to help these people.
not_available And do you think you helped Edgar Dixon when you prescribed him Renuvium? GI bleeding is a common side effect of NSAIDs.
not_available The same thing could've happened to him if he'd been prescribed the med anywhere.
not_available But it didn't happen to him anywhere.
not_available He went to you, and it killed him.
not_available Are you aware that diversion of narcotics is a felony, Dr.
not_available Pratt? I didn't steal You don't recall providing hydrocodone and ibuprofen to Ms.
not_available Nancy Campbell? Mrs.
not_available Campbell had gallstones.
not_available So you took a narcotic medication sample logged into the Emergency Department.
not_available This is a felony punishable by imprisonment, doctor.
not_available Yes, she was suffering.
not_available I wanted to help her.
not_available I volunteer for a free clinic myself and we follow the rules.
not_available We keep accurate records we dispense medication with proper safety precautions and we're there for our patients, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available You remember the part about doing no harm? Well, that applies to you too, sir.
not_available Excuse me, I'm sorry.
not_available We're in a meeting.
not_available I'm Pastor William Watkins of First Mission Baptist.
not_available I'd like to speak on behalf of Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Sorry they haven't taken you back to your room yet.
MARINA I just got a new kidney.
not_available I'm not gonna sweat the small stuff.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hello.
not_available Happy Valentine's Day.
not_available Nothing says " I love you" like a bag of urine.
not_available How did my donor do? They're fine.
not_available But because of everybody's privacy, we're not really allowed to discuss it.
not_available Listen, this person saved my life.
not_available I wanna see him.
not_available Or her.
not_available Just once.
not_available So I have a face to think of in my prayers.
not_available How is it going? Okay, so the Democrats took over the House and the Senate.
not_available How long before the Republicans jack up the rent and evict them? 
SAM That's pretty funny.
not_available Why aren't you laughing, then? 
not_available I am.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available HemoCue is up to 11 after two units.
not_available Antibiotics? 
not_available Zosyn is in, tobra's infusing.
not_available Oh I gotta go pee
not_available pee.
not_available That's good.
not_available Your kidneys are working.
not_available Aah.
not_available Hello? Hello? Quiet on the set.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Doc, I can't pee in bed.
not_available I've been standing up since I was 4.
not_available Pressure's been pretty good, 101/68.
not_available All right, get him a screen.
not_available Sit up and dangle your legs.
not_available All right.
not_available Let us know if you're feeling dizzy.
not_available I'm good.
not_available I'm good.
not_available I got a little flop sweat, but that happens to the best of them.
not_available Someone's gotta go with you.
not_available No.
not_available I got a nervous bladder and a neurotic sphincter.
not_available Seriously, it sucks.
not_available I can't pee in public and I'm afraid to fart in case I start a fire.
not_available We'll wait on the other side.
not_available It'll be a good test.
not_available Of what? The Emergency Broadcast System.
not_available Oh That is good.
not_available Man, this will work.
not_available Pee is funny.
not_available Bedpans, funny.
not_available Catheter, not so funny.
not_available Maybe we can downgrade to Tele from ICU.
SAM Oh, God.
MORRIS Okay, I got him.
not_available Get him on the bed.
not_available Come on.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Pressure's down, 60/40.
MORRIS Great, he's septic.
not_available Another two units of packed cells.
not_available Start dopamine at 10 mics.
ABBY Simon, can you hear me? 
MORRIS Open your eyes, come on.
ABBY Hear me? 
SAM Sats are dropping.
not_available Put him on 100 percent non
not_available rebreather.
not_available Open an intubation kit.
not_available Come on, buddy.
not_available Come on, there's a spotlight on the curtains and they're calling your name.
not_available Hey, baby girl.
not_available Dopamine at 12 mics.
not_available Systolic's up to 110.
not_available Good.
not_available Run in the fourth unit.
not_available Hey, am I on next? How is it going? What happened? 
not_available You took a little nap.
not_available Okay, little prick.
not_available It's just because it's cold in here.
not_available All right, you gotta keep that on, okay? You know, sats are a hundred Hey.
not_available Why don't we try a nasal cannula? Five liters.
not_available Hey, Abby, how about our deal? Working on it.
not_available What deal? I thought we could try to buff him up so he could perform tonight.
not_available He's septic.
not_available His BP's dropped so low, he needs continuous IV pressors.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available It means you're not going anywhere.
not_available Can we talk outside? Please? You realize you are asking me to break the most central rule of this entire program? It's a dumb rule.
not_available Why is this so important to you? Because it's important to her.
not_available Part of him is gonna be part of me for the rest of my life.
not_available Oh, come on, Manish.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available If Dubenko finds out 
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra, what are you doing? We're just waiting on some labs.
not_available What? Doesn't even make sense.
not_available Couldn't you do better than " waiting on labs"? I'm not a doctor.
not_available Can I talk to you for a minute? I know we're not supposed to do this 
not_available Yeah.
not_available But this guy saved her life.
not_available She wanted to be able to see him in her prayers.
not_available Yeah, Nee 
not_available Dr.
not_available Crenshaw Dusty, I mean.
not_available I know it's unethical, but it's nice and sometimes people like to do things for other people, just to be nice.
not_available Neela, have I mentioned how well you're coming along? Yeah.
not_available Okay, we're good.
not_available Okay.
not_available They're right over here.
not_available Which one is he? He's the one on the left.
not_available Your husband's kidney went into the other guy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know, Morris, it's his dream.
not_available He's gonna die.
not_available He's gonna do it here, not on some comedy
not_available club floor.
not_available Blood count's okay.
not_available He's had antibiotics.
not_available His pressure's dopamine dependent.
not_available What about intermittent pressors? 
not_available There isn't one.
not_available Epinephrine? 
not_available He can't leave here.
not_available I could give him six EpiPens.
not_available Point
not_available three mgs each.
not_available Gives himself Are you out of your mind? Why not try it? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm not doing it.
not_available I'll find another Attending.
not_available I'm running the floor.
not_available Then get some balls.
not_available I've got balls.
not_available They're no good unless you use them.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine, you wanna play Superdoc? Great.
not_available Turn off the dopamine, give him epi, show me his pressure can stay for 20 minutes.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine.
not_available Nobody builds hospitals or clinics in the inner city because they know these people don't have any money.
not_available They're leeches on the system.
not_available So they go out to the burbs and put up medical facilities on every corner like Starbucks leaving us with a hospital that's overrun, understaffed and underpaid.
not_available There are free clinics.
not_available Most think they're for people with drug problems and sexually transmitted diseases.
not_available We're talking about regular folk here black and brown people who just need prescriptions.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt knew the system was flawed and tried to help mend it.
not_available I've got a whole congregation who will attest taking away this man's license would just be another demerit on a system that has already failed them.
not_available The EpiPen is spring
not_available Ioaded so all you have to do is press it against your thigh and it fires off a shot.
not_available Ah.
not_available Sounds like my high school years.
not_available Can I use it during my act? As long as you pull your pants down.
not_available Luckily, that's my big finish.
not_available Or should I say my average
not_available size finish? 
MORRIS Oh! All right.
not_available His pressure dropped again.
not_available How long since his last epi? 
not_available Six minutes.
not_available Push 0.2, start dopamine, mix up Levophed.
not_available Damn.
not_available This was a dumb idea.
not_available Epi has a oneminute half
not_available life.
not_available I have a body part with that same problem.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available That was a good joke.
not_available BP, 89/64.
not_available You know what the best thing about getting leukemia is? 
MORRIS Hang another liter of saline and a unit of packed cells.
not_available Everybody comes to see you.
not_available The guys from the plant came, my ex
not_available soccer coach came.
not_available Even Father Dunleavy came.
not_available Took three orderlies to get him out of the Pedes ward.
not_available That's a keeper.
not_available You know, I was gonna kill tonight and instead, I'm dying.
MORRIS Sats are dropping, 92 on five liters.
not_available I would've left your name at the door but something tells me I'm not gonna make it.
not_available Finish your act.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, I, uh, bought you some food.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's sweet.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sorry I couldn't talk earlier.
not_available Oh, it's okay, forget it.
not_available Everything all right? Yeah, I just, uh, came by to say hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Uh Is Sarah okay? We're just sitting down to watch a movie.
not_available Wanna join us? Uh No.
not_available I'm not gonna stay.
not_available Listen, can I talk to you a second? Yeah.
not_available I've been wanting to tell you this.
not_available You remember the night we were out there with Meg in the car? At one point she grabbed me and pulled me down to her and she said, " Tony, Sarah is yours.
not_available " " Sarah is yours.
not_available " Is it possible? It was 13 years ago.
not_available You know, we were messed up, the three of us, high.
not_available Keith would disappear for days and, you know, Meg and I It just happened.
not_available It wasn't a secret.
not_available So you mean she could be your? And that never occurred to you before? Yeah.
not_available I mean, I thought about it at first, but then years went by and I just believed what everyone else believed.
SARAH Tony? 
not_available That she was Keith's.
not_available I should go.
not_available That's who I used to be.
not_available It's not who I am anymore.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Go watch your movie.
not_available You know you didn't have to do this.
not_available Well, you know, that whole black
not_available male incarceration bit got to me.
not_available You'll be okay, Greg.
not_available There are laws in this world that we have to follow but then there are God's laws.
not_available He'll have the last word in this.
not_available Just you watch.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available You covered for me.
not_available The least I can do is support you.
not_available All right, come on, sit down.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available The board finds that you have violated the Medical Practice Act and believes that these transgressions are adequate justification to suspend your medical license.
not_available However, in light of your attempt to help your community we have decided to put you on probation for one year.
not_available Practice will be monitored you will need to perform Perhaps finding a way to legalize a certain church
not_available based clinic would be a good use of your time? 
PRATT Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Hey, how did I do? You brought the house down.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You've been such a great audience.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Hey.
not_available I decided to put our CDs on the iPod.
not_available We don't need all these anymore.
not_available I need to talk.
not_available Is everything okay? 
not_available Um You know, when you were on the roof, I was thinking about what I would do if Joe didn't have a father and if we didn't have each other.
not_available I realized if we could get through this, we could probably get through anything.
not_available What's going on? I mean, have you ever wanted something so much but it scared the hell out of you? See, here's the thing.
not_available I just Well, I changed my mind and I was wondering if you could ask me again.
not_available What? Ask me again.
not_available Ask me to marry you.
