not_available You'd be a good person to say something.
not_available Say something? 
not_available You know, at this thing for Romano.
not_available Oh, you're kidding, right? No.
not_available I think it would be nice coming from a nurse.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? Tell me you did not put a splint on my kid's arm.
not_available I'm sorry, we are busy trying to find a man's finger now.
not_available The reason it's missing is because instead of studying, he's off with you playing doctor.

not_available I was just
not_available Oh, what, he told you his Osama Kendrick, evil wrestler story? Please.

not_available He won't tell me.
not_available Alex? 
not_available It's in the refrigerator in the lounge.
not_available What? I put it there because I know it needs to stay cold.
not_available In the fridge or the freezer? 
not_available Fridge.
not_available Behind the juice.
not_available You give it up to him like that after stonewalling me?

not_available Neela Rasgotra.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is somebody coming for them? 
not_available He said he'd notify their parents but he wasn't sure how soon they'd be able to hire a car.
not_available What was your call about? In the trauma room? Oh, my sister and her husband in Chandigarh have had a baby.
not_available Well, congratulations.
not_available You're an aunt.
not_available There's a Sikh ritual, a naming ceremony.
not_available My parents want me to go to India 
not_available so I can be there.
not_available You don't wanna go? I can't just take two weeks off.
not_available Anyway, guilt calls are just their way of keeping me close.
not_available Well, it's nice to know that they miss you.
not_available Yeah, and at times, suffocating.
not_available They don't understand that doctor thing, huh? They run a restaurant in South Hall.
not_available I'm the first professional the first to live anywhere other than India or London.
not_available On the one hand, they're proud.
not_available On the other, it scares them.
not_available How are you feeling, Thomas? 
not_available Like I have a tube in my chest.
not_available I spoke to Mr.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Said he'd pass the word to your families.
not_available They'll make us go home.
not_available Are you runaways? You wouldn't believe it if we told you.
not_available Thomas, shut up.
not_available Try me.
not_available We're Amish.
not_available Know what that is? 
not_available It's a religion.
not_available It's a good one.
not_available It's all about taking care of each other 
not_available protecting each other.
not_available Living separate from the outside world.
not_available So you did run away.
not_available We're on rumspringa.
not_available When you get to be 16, you can do whatever you want for a while 
not_available experience stuff.
not_available You decide whether you wanna be in the community or not.
not_available A little dose of teen rebellion so you won't be tempted later? After it's over, you'll be a good Amish.
not_available She's in V
not_available tach.
not_available Charge to 60.
not_available What do you have? 
not_available Jane Doe found in the park.
not_available Hypothermic.
not_available We gave two rounds of epi, only access is IO.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still V
not_available tach.
not_available Up to 120.
not_available How long was she out there? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Clear.
not_available Got a pulse.
not_available Rate's 67.
not_available Pratt, get a central line kit and throw in a femoral.
not_available Couldn't find any reports matching her description.
not_available Abby, prep for a peritoneal and pleural lavage.
not_available Now what? They're checking old reports 
not_available one week at a time.
not_available Let's hear a BP and a repeat temp.
not_available Maybe she's from another state.
not_available Check with AMBER Alert.
not_available We'll get in touch with other agencies if we don't turn up anything.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available She's still here.
not_available Get a DPL kit and chest tube tray, and more blankets.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available I think the police are handling this in the right way.
not_available Somebody threw her away.
not_available Maybe the parents are in trouble.
not_available Maybe they're sick or injured.
not_available Maybe she's a foster kid that got passed around from place to place until her case worker loses track of her 
not_available and she falls through the cracks.
not_available That's possible.
not_available So check the CPS foster files, the federal database.
not_available I wanna help, but there's not much I can do without a name or an ID.
not_available There must be pictures of these kids.
not_available Not that I have access to.
not_available Ken, come on.
not_available You're a smart guy.
not_available Get access.
not_available Before we go snooping around in the foster system, let's explore our more likely 
options Ditched by her parents or abducted by relatives 
not_available or maybe she's even a runaway.
not_available Oh, she's 6 years old.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get a fingerprint card, and I'll see what strings I can pull at CPS.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Fourth one I've ever smoked, and already it's getting old.
not_available Your mom's on her way.
not_available I love my family.
not_available I love where I'm from.
not_available But the coolest thing that happened to me was placing second in the annual cheese festival.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She'll want me to go back.
not_available She'll see this as a sign from God.
not_available It's up to you, isn't it? It's not so easy.
not_available If you choose not to be Amish, you're shunned.
not_available The community turns its back on you.
not_available Even your family? Everyone.
not_available See, out here it's scary but it feels full of possibilities.
not_available How can I go back there and pretend that this doesn't exist? How does Thomas feel about it? He's had enough.
not_available He wants to go home.
not_available Do you love him? What would you do? I may not be the best person to advise.
not_available I'm a Chicago medical student of Punjabi extraction by way of London, England.
not_available A bit of a mess, really.
not_available If I were you I'd go home.
not_available Your chest pain may be something serious 
not_available called a pulmonary embolism.
not_available What's that? A blood clot in the lungs.
not_available I'm gonna send you to Radiology 
not_available for a pulmonary angiogram.
not_available More x
not_available rays? I know, I'm sorry.
not_available This is the last time, I promise.
not_available I sure hope so.
not_available Could you take Mrs.
not_available Benitez and her son to the family room? 
not_available Come.
not_available See you later, Dad.
not_available Order some pizza, amigo.
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available So if this angio thing is positive, then what? It would confirm he has an embolism.
not_available We'll stop the clot with a drug called heparin.
not_available I'll let you know when he comes down.
not_available You can wait in here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You sent that guy up for a pulmonary angiogram? Dr.
not_available Lewis wanted to be sure before heparinizing.
not_available What's your opinion? I'm not sure my opinion matters.
not_available Luka, you got a minute? If you don't think it matters, then it doesn't.
not_available I took a half
not_available shift.
not_available I've gotta get home before Alex.
not_available I'm sorry about the splint.
not_available Look I appreciate you trying to be his friend.
not_available I don't want things to get weird.
not_available You're a good guy, I'm sure, but you don't know crap about raising kids.
not_available So thanks for the help, but no, thanks.
not_available I got it covered.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Abby, where's Lewis? 
not_available Exam 3.
not_available Do we have premixed heparin drips? 
not_available I'll check drug lockup.
not_available Hey, so the police found a couple from Rogers Park.
not_available Their 4year
not_available old daughter disappeared two years ago, hasn't been seen since.
not_available The profile matches.
not_available She's missing that long? Yeah, they're bringing them in.
not_available I wanted you to know.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I got a page my sister was down here.
not_available Frank took her to the lounge.
not_available You guys meeting us later? 
not_available Definitely.
not_available Abby? Neela? 
not_available Soon as my shift's over.
not_available I'll try.
not_available See you there.
not_available And what am I, invisible? I believe my daughter Johanna is here.
not_available She's with a boy named Thomas.
not_available I'm the one who left the message.
not_available How was your trip? 
not_available Fine.
not_available You're losing time, Susan.
not_available I can take you to them.
not_available Heparinization's not a benign therapy.
not_available Neither is all this testing.
not_available He has a history of GI bleeding from ulcers.
not_available A high probability of pulmonary embolism.
not_available By the time you wait for Radiology, you're gonna end up with bigger problems.
not_available Or I could give him heparin, and if it's not PE, he'll be puking blood from taking a dangerous drug he didn't need.
not_available Next time you feel like discussing my orders with another doctor 
not_available don't talk to Kovac.
not_available No, I
not_available Both families agreed it's time for you to come home so that you can be baptized and married.
not_available I thought that we get to decide when.
not_available You got yourselves in trouble.
not_available You could've been killed.
not_available I know you're mature enough to see that this isn't the life for you.
not_available Is everything all right? 
not_available The Amish lady's working on them.
not_available Who, the religious cultists? 
not_available It's not a cult.
not_available More like a club.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hey.
not_available Here you go.
not_available How did I do? 
not_available Oh, pretty good.
not_available Ninetyseven 
not_available Yep.
not_available percent.
not_available What? 
not_available Neela.
not_available So? Not bad, 93 percent.
not_available Sorry, I haven't finished yours yet.
not_available I'll find you when I'm done.
not_available It's so good to see you.
not_available Hey, Val, I'm sorry.
not_available I got hung up with a patient upstairs and
not_available It's okay.
not_available My plane got in early.
not_available So everything went fine? Yeah, you know, crappy flight, but it's all good.
not_available It's all good.
not_available Hey, listen.
not_available I was thinking, after my shift that we'd go to this place, Ike's, and catch dinner? 
not_available Great.
not_available Hey, Mike.
not_available Kinsey in 4 is waiting on a wound check and a doggy bag of Percocet.
not_available And why am I the last one to hear that your sister's hot? I'm sure he's got his reasons.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't see you sitting there.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greg Pratt, your brother's mentor.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Pleased to meet you, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available No, call me Greg, Valerie.
not_available Call me Val, Gregory.
not_available Okay, hey, I'm all over this Kinsey thing.
not_available Is there anything else? Yeah, in fact, I was thinking about heading over to Ike's after work you know, play some pool, get some drinks.
not_available I was wondering if you'd like would go.
not_available Actually, we were planning 
not_available on getting some dinner there already.
not_available What a coincidence.
not_available Well, I actually spread the word around a little bit.
not_available Really? It didn't get to me.
not_available It all works out, then.
not_available Great.
not_available Look forward to seeing you later.
not_available He'll need to stay upstairs for a few days.
not_available Is there a phone I can use? That's okay? You can do that? We don't hate technology.
not_available We just don't allow it to take over our lives.
not_available There'll be a phone in his room.
not_available I'll be back down once I have him settled.
not_available What's up with the Pilgrims? Thomas is going back to Arcola once he's recovered.
not_available And Johanna? 
not_available She's thinking it over.
not_available Abby, this is Larry and Judith Anderson.
not_available You're the nurse who's been working on Kendra? Kendra.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available Can we see her? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Kendra hasn't spoken yet.
not_available We'll have a better idea of how she's doing once her temperature comes up.
not_available ER.
not_available That the Jane Doe girl's parents? Guess she's not a Jane Doe anymore.
not_available Hold.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, do you have a patient up in Angiography? 
not_available Yeah, Hank Benitez.
not_available He's crashing.
not_available Lost his pressure after the first dye injection.
not_available He's in PEA.
not_available Had an amp of epi.
not_available Okay, let's tube him.
not_available He's got urticaria.
not_available Must've thrown a big clot.
not_available Probably an anaphylactic reaction to the dye.
not_available Benadryl and steroids? He should have been heparinized.
not_available He has classic signs of an allergic reaction.
not_available What does this look like, Neela? 
not_available Hives? I'm not certain.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available Last BP was 78/44.
not_available Best we've had so far.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Oh, God, no.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I think she's gonna be fine.
not_available It's her.
not_available It's her.
not_available No, honey, it's not.
not_available Well, it could be.
not_available It's not, Judith.
not_available It's not.
not_available Maybe she just changed, you know? 
not_available Maybe she's different.
not_available No, Judith.
not_available Judith, no.
not_available This is not our daughter.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Still V
not_available fib.
not_available Clear.
not_available Asystole.
not_available It's been 45 minutes.
not_available Okay, I'm calling it.
not_available Time of death, 7:08.
not_available One shot of heparin could have prevented this.
not_available That's crap, Luka.
not_available He was killed by an anaphylactic reaction to the dye.
not_available Because of an unnecessary test.
not_available Stop.
not_available It's not about PE, and it's not about anaphylaxis.
not_available It's about this man.
not_available I'll go and inform his family that they've lost him.
not_available Hey.
not_available I heard.
not_available Yeah.
not_available A woman I know at CPS has been letting me go through past foster
not_available care records.
not_available I haven't come up with anything yet.
not_available A little girl disappears and nobody notices? I'll keep looking.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've had enough.
not_available You wanna go get a drink with Gallant? Thought I'd hang around, make sure she gets up to the PICU.
not_available Can't a nurse do that? I am a nurse.
not_available And you're a med student.
not_available Hey.
not_available You guys headed over to Ike's? Yeah.
not_available Gallant's sister's in town.
not_available He's buying.
not_available So I hear.
not_available I'll catch up.
not_available Johanna? Tell Thomas I said to get better.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available I'm sorry, Mrs.
not_available Lambright.
not_available She's the oldest.
not_available I have six other children.
not_available They were so happy when I told them she was coming home.
not_available She's a good girl, ma'am.
not_available She'll be all right.
not_available You can't make them stay if they don't want to.
not_available Someone will be back for Thomas when he's better.
not_available Stern is ready to be DC'd soon as the UA's back.
not_available Kovac is here.
not_available Hey, Kovac, it's Sam.
not_available Her son is MIA.
not_available Sam? What? No, hey, listen, just calm down.
not_available How long ago? 
not_available Hey, Kovac.
not_available No, no, I haven't.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Kovac! He's here.
not_available How was school? I had to go to gym.
not_available I got pinned by some kid in, like, ten seconds.
not_available I don't think you should go back to Africa.
not_available No? 
not_available I heard it's dangerous.
not_available Your mom's worried.
not_available She's a loser.
not_available Hey.
not_available She does a lot.
not_available Is that why we're always moving around? Leaving places as soon as I've got friends? She does what she needs to take care of you.
not_available She wishes she never had me.
not_available Mike.
not_available I see you got here before me.
not_available You guys met my sister, Val? 
not_available Frank introduced us.
not_available Neela and Abby, right? How long are you in Chicago for? 
not_available A month.
not_available I teach special needs kids in DC.
not_available I'm taking a seminar at Northwestern.
not_available Very nice.
not_available You guys gonna stay for a while? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be back in a minute.
not_available So Mike never told me that your mother was so beautiful.
not_available Our mother? 
not_available Yeah, well, she'd have to be to have a daughter like you, right? Don't hold back, Greg.
not_available Drink? 
not_available I'm with you.
not_available Do you think it's bad I'm not going home to the Punjab? Personally, I never miss a Sikh naming ceremony, but that's just me.
not_available They're going to choose a name for my niece.
not_available They don't even need me there.
not_available Do you have nieces or nephews? 
not_available My brother's single.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Minnesota.
not_available Do you see him much? Not now, no.
not_available I'm trying to let him get his stuff together 
not_available while I get my stuff together.
not_available Me too.
not_available I'm trying to get my stuff together too.
not_available Let's all of us get our stuff together.
not_available Do you miss them, your family? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Me too.
not_available Did you ever get around to scoring my test? Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available Fifty
not_available two? I got a 52 percent? Think of it as half full.
not_available I'm sorry I wasn't there, Elizabeth.
not_available You weren't the only one.
not_available He had nothing but this place, Kerry.
not_available No wife, no kids.
not_available Everything he ever had, he lost here.
not_available At the end of a life, you'd think there'd be more to say.
not_available He'll be missed.
not_available Whether we realize it or not.
not_available You got pissed off at Kovac and Lewis? 
not_available I didn't mean to.
not_available So, what did they do? They looked at me like they couldn't believe it.
not_available Like, "You're not supposed to get angry." What's happening to our little girl? 
not_available That's how it is.
not_available Except there's different versions of it.
not_available What's she talking about? 
not_available I have no idea, but she's on a roll.
not_available "Oh, she's a sweet Indian girl.
not_available Poor thing probably grew up begging for scraps in Calcutta.
not_available " You mean you didn't? 
not_available I've never even been to Calcutta.
not_available Or, "She's the welleducated British girl, proper, soft
not_available spoken and docile.
not_available " 
not_available With a very good vocabulary.
not_available I'm not
not_available I'm not any of those things.
not_available I'm not Indian.
not_available I'm not British.
not_available I'm not American.
not_available So, what the hell are you? 
not_available Well, that's the question, isn't it? Do you ever feel like you don't know who the hell you are? No.
not_available But I'm very well
not_available adjusted.
not_available You about ready to go? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks, everybody.
not_available It's been fun.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I've completely monopolized the intercourse.
not_available Yeah, I think it's about time for me to go too.
not_available I'll walk out with you guys.
not_available Discourse.
not_available Do you want your chair from the car? 
not_available No, I'll be fine.
not_available I'll use the sticks.
not_available I need a little help sometimes.
not_available Do you have a cigarette? 
not_available No.
not_available Thank God.
not_available The car's just around the corner.
not_available I'm a little tired.
not_available Can you pull it around? You want me to go get it? 
not_available Yeah, do you mind? Michael.
not_available Get the car, okay? Yeah, be right back.
not_available Hope I didn't come off sounding too insensitive.
not_available You know, I'm just doing me, talking my crap.
not_available I didn't realize
not_available What, how easy it is for me to get a seat on the subway? You flirted, I flirted back.
not_available I know.
not_available I still think I sounded kind of wack because Greg, I was diagnosed with MS when I was 22 and before that, I was a normal girl.
not_available Very normal.
not_available I didn't grow up limited, so I don't think of myself that way.
not_available How advanced is it? I have a couple of relapses a year but I'm still fully functional.
not_available How's that for a pickup line? Don't get me wrong, okay? You look good.
not_available Very good.
not_available But I just don't want to complicate
not_available It's not killing me.
not_available At least not anytime soon.
not_available So I'm just getting on with things.
not_available Get ready for bed.
not_available I'll be back in a minute.
not_available Don't ever do that to me again.
not_available Brush your teeth.
not_available Is he okay? Silent treatment.
not_available He'll be fine tomorrow.
not_available Look, I didn't mean to be a bitch before.
not_available You weren't.
not_available You know, I don't worry about not having a man in my life but maybe he needs one.
not_available Maybe I'm not paying enough attention to that.
not_available Better no man than the wrong one.
not_available Yeah, his father wasn't much of a father or anything else.
not_available But he had a truck and a pierced tongue and an endless stash of weed.
not_available I was 15 years old.
not_available So you and Alex grew up together.
not_available Oh, I'm a good big sister, but I'm not sure how great a mom I am.
not_available Parents always worry about that.
not_available I see him sitting in some shrink's office in ten years talking about what a job his mother did on him.
not_available Kids are resilient.
not_available Look, I know I said I didn't need any help but tonight I did.
not_available So thanks for the help.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Just one more stick.
not_available No pain here? How about here? Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available It's okay, sweetie.
not_available Haleh, airway box and bag mask.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available You don't need that to help you breathe anymore, do you? Let go.
not_available Ready when you are.
not_available Good.
not_available I want you to cough, and then I'm gonna pull this tube out.
not_available On three, cough for me.
not_available Ready? One, two, three.
not_available Good.
not_available Good girl, good girl.
not_available There we go.
not_available All right.
not_available Clear breath sounds.
not_available Sats look good.
not_available It's okay, honey.
not_available You're in a hospital.
not_available What's your name? Can you tell us your name? Dr.
not_available Weaver, LOL in 3 is coughing up blood.
not_available Haleh, check an ABG on 14 liters.
not_available Amanda.
not_available I love you, kiddo.
not_available More than anything.
