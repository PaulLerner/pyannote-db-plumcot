not_available Damn! I thought you guys were gonna work it out.
not_available I thought I could crash with you.
not_available You're 14.
not_available You stole my wallet.
not_available You're a pain in the ass.
not_available Some folks are getting a little too fond of the "manager" part of "nurse manager." I'm not management.
not_available I know you're trying to help, but you didn't.
not_available You made it worse.
not_available You're a very good surgeon, Peter but I can't give up a space that could possibly be filled by a future pediatric surgeon.
not_available My God, it is cold! It must be 20 below with the wind chill.
not_available This is no place for a Mexican.
not_available I thought you hated night shift.
not_available I'm filling in for Haleh.

not_available I hate the smell when they thaw.
not_available Place looks dead.
not_available Well, this guy certainly is.
not_available Randi, you know we got a DB in the hall? The morgue's slow.
not_available I put him near the door to keep cool.
not_available Good thinking.
not_available Is this right? Not a single patient.
not_available It's too cold to be sick.
not_available I guess I'm gonna have time to work on my curriculum vitae.
not_available What's that? It's a fancy word for r Ásum Á.
not_available I've got tenure review this week.
not_available You wanna join the faculty? 
not_available It'd be nice.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Legal sent you this letter and charts to be signed.
not_available They're writing me up for not co
not_available signing charts.
not_available Won't that hurt your chance? Won't help.
not_available Competition pretty stiff? About 5'4", red hair, with a limp.
not_available Lydia? How'd you like to make an easy 50 bucks? How? I'm studying how exercise affects the circadian rhythms of night shift workers.
not_available Is that why ERay's doing jumping jacks? 
not_available Yes.
not_available But we need one more subject.
not_available My publishing deadline's in two days.
not_available So I'm kind of in a bind.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Not interested.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll keep looking.
not_available Wendy.
not_available Very good! How much are a dozen bananas? Very good!

not_available We've got a crisis conference tomorrow morning.
not_available Crisis conference? 
not_available ER nursing's $94,000 over.
not_available Can't we add to it? You're gonna have to let two nurses go.
not_available But I'm understaffed as it is.
not_available Name me a department that isn't.
not_available The county's out of money.
not_available You've got three junior 
RNs Maylik 
not_available Malik.
not_available Malik McGrath, Chuny Marquez and Conni Oligario.
not_available You can keep one.
not_available Which two get the ax? That's your decision.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I've never done this before.
not_available I gotta have an answer by tomorrow.
not_available Are you on tonight? Leave it on my e
not_available mail.
not_available Make sure I get it by If you could choose how to die, how would you do it? That's morbid.
not_available If I could choose how to die, I'd go by OD.
not_available A stroke is better.
not_available Lf you survive, you're an end table.
not_available Still no patients? 
not_available Nope, but we got takeout.
not_available We ordered you your usual.

not_available Come on.
not_available Conni? 
not_available We got you covered.
not_available Thanks.
not_available My hands cold? 
not_available Oh, God! Sadist! I'm sorry about that surprise Christmas morning.
not_available Santa didn't come? I opened my door to a homeless street urchin.
not_available You opened my door.
not_available Right.
not_available I opened her door.
not_available She stole Mom's silverware.
not_available I'll pay for it.
not_available She won't take your money.
not_available I won't offer again.
not_available My New Year's resolution is to resist charitable impulses.
not_available Risk Management said we're overdue for a safety check.
not_available Why tell me? You're the safety officer.
not_available They want it done tonight.
not_available I got 50 charts to do 
not_available Carol and I will take it.
not_available What happened to resisting charitable impulses? Speaking of, anyone wanna sign up for a night shift study? Boy, it is dead! Finished my charts.
not_available It's not even 9:00.
not_available Want some action? 
not_available What do you got in mind? Edson's sick, you can take his place on the code team.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Hey, John.
not_available He boned me, man! Benton wouldn't let you off? Two days is all I asked for.
not_available Son of a bitch! You know, Dennis if Monique's with this other guy, there's nothing you can do even if you did fly down there.
not_available I'd sure as hell like the chance to try.
not_available You wanna go to that place and get some fries with gravy? I wish I could.
not_available I got all these charts to do.
not_available Okay.
not_available I hear you.
not_available If Benton asks, I'll be back in an hour.
not_available I thought you finished the charts.
not_available I've listened to him moan about that girlfriend for two weeks.
not_available Tonight is slow enough.
not_available Who's our first lucky customer? Lady fell asleep at McGoo's.
not_available Waitress brought her in.
not_available She's kind of loopy.
not_available No I.D.
not_available Says her name's Shelly.
not_available No needles! I just wanna sleep.
not_available Temp's 103, and look at this.
not_available Photophobia.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I need to examine you.
not_available Leave me alone! You have symptoms of meningitis, which is really serious.
not_available We need to do a spinal tap just to be sure.
not_available Let me give you a shot of antibiotics.
not_available No needles, I said! If you do have meningitis and we don't treat you, you could die.
not_available Die, cry, let me fry.
not_available Do you know where you are? In the hospital, talking to Dr.
not_available Greene with a head like a bean.
not_available Do you know what day it is? Thursday, January 16th.
not_available Bing! Correct! Alex Trebek, 
next Stupid Questions for $ 200.
not_available I'm 90o/o sure it's meningitis, which is probably causing her mental status.
not_available She won't let me take blood.
not_available She can't make her own decisions.
not_available I need a consent override.
not_available Run it by Risk Management.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Yeah, you do.
not_available All consent overrides go through Legal.
not_available Fine.
not_available Tell them I'm doing a spinal tap on a demented woman without her consent.
not_available Well, we've got some loose tile here.
not_available And some crumbling grout.
not_available Faulty tile and grout.
not_available This could be trouble in an open wound.
not_available Trouble indeed! Good catch.
not_available Did you note the wobbly IV stands? Roger that.
not_available You got a flair for this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know this clock could fall right off the wall.
not_available I don't know how you do it.
not_available It's established that night work disrupts circadian rhythms.
not_available I've heard that.
not_available I hope to prove moderate physical exertion can switch circadian rhythms back into phase.
not_available When you say "moderate physical exertion" A few minute's exercise.
not_available Jog around the block.
not_available Not strenuous.
not_available It's all set up.
not_available I don't know, I'm not in good shape.
not_available You look plenty healthy to me.
not_available Oh, my God! Are you okay? 
not_available What were you doing? Safety check.
not_available You okay? 
not_available I'm bleeding.
not_available I can stitch it up.
not_available I would prefer Jeanie.
not_available And you were doing so well.
not_available Maggie, you got anything good? Carol Hathaway dropped a clock on Weaver's head.
not_available Deliberately? 
not_available I'm foggy on the details.
not_available We got paramedics pulling up.
not_available Now we're talking! 
not_available Nobody called for a surgical consult.
not_available I'm saving you the trouble.
not_available Found him on the floor in acute distress.
not_available Chest and belly pain.
not_available Vitals, normal.
not_available Wouldn't let us start an IV.
not_available Does this hurt? Looks like a surgical abdomen.
not_available I haven't made that assessment.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available Should I call for an Attending? Up and over! Let's get an IV started.
not_available I think I hear a rub.
not_available I may have a pulsatile mass.
not_available Give me a 12
not_available lead and a chest film.
not_available Get me a cross
not_available table abdomen.
not_available Which first? 
not_available Chest.
not_available Abdomen.
not_available He could have an aneurysm.
not_available I don't want to miss an acute MI.
not_available I don't want to miss a triple
not_available A.
not_available If it's an MI, he needs TPA.
not_available If it's an aneurysm, he goes to O.R.
not_available Time is heart muscle.
not_available Ever have an aneurysm blow up in your face? Hey, guys.
not_available I'm feeling much better.
not_available You need to lie down.
not_available You need x
not_available rays.
not_available No.
not_available I'm fine except for a stuffy nose.
not_available Could I have a flu shot? I remember this dude.
not_available To get a ride to the hospital, he calls 911 and plays possum.
not_available But I'm on Social Security.
not_available I can't afford a cab.
not_available And it's too cold for the bus.
not_available You want a flu shot? If it wouldn't be too much trouble? It's all yours.
not_available Gee, thanks! I'm just saying, there's no point in me going back to general surgery.
not_available You learned all there is? I want another Pediatric rotation.
not_available Why? 
not_available I want to be a pediatric surgeon.
not_available She said that my technique was excellent.
not_available You're in luck.
not_available He's doing a jejunal atresia tonight.
not_available If he'll take you, you're back in Pediatric.
not_available Could I cover Pedes Sick
not_available U? Anything else? No, thank you.
not_available Chuny, you got that LP tray? 
not_available By the door.
not_available Can you give us a hand? We may need you.
not_available There's someone Why won't you tell me your address? Excuse me.
not_available Who are you? Dr.
not_available Greene? Pat Guinet, Hospital Counsel.
not_available You want to do a spinal tap on this patient? 
not_available That's right.
not_available She's not keen on the idea.
not_available I've assessed her as mentally incompetent.
not_available We just had a fairly coherent conversation.
not_available Is that a medical diagnosis? Look, doctor, she's clearly a borderline case.
not_available We have been sued by these patients in the past.
not_available I'm saving her life, and you're talking legal exposure.
not_available That's why I'm paid.
not_available I'm paid to help sick people.
not_available I'm not gonna wrestle with you, doctor.
not_available I'm writing on the 
chart "You're advised against treating this woman without her consent." And you and anyone who assists you, will be putting your jobs in jeopardy.
not_available Get a psych consult.
not_available If they agree she's incompetent, put her on a hold and proceed.
not_available Until then, don't touch her.
not_available Just one more stitch.
not_available Have you given any more thought to participating in my study? I've got paperwork I need to do.
not_available It won't take much time.
not_available Just 15 minutes every couple hours.
not_available Lf we get busy, it'll be a problem.
not_available It's been slow so far.
not_available My being HIV
not_available positive won't skew the results? Won't make a bit of difference.
not_available Tonight's my last night to collect data.
not_available And if l My findings will be incom well, worthless, really.
not_available But see, if you're too busy, I respect your decision.
not_available Just as I've always respected and supported your decisions.
not_available What would I have to do? He scores! We finally get a bonafide patient? 
not_available But we can't touch her.
not_available She asked for another blanket and a snack.
not_available So we're not a hospital, we're a bedandbreakfast? Psych come down? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Try again.
not_available I'll be in the lounge.
not_available Call Missing Persons? 
not_available Yeah, but no one's missed her.
not_available We got a wheelchair with no brakes and three IV stands I think are wobbly.
not_available What do we do with them? Ugly! If it isn't my favorite thief.
not_available You got your wallet back.
not_available My mother's silverware? I didn't take it.
not_available I swear.
not_available Do I call Security, or will you leave by yourself? No, listen, man.
not_available I need some bread.
not_available No, serious.
not_available There's this dude trying to pimp me.
not_available And I don't wanna He says I gotta pay him Maybe we should tell the cops.
not_available I don't deal with cops.
not_available And I don't deal with liars who take advantage of people who help them.
not_available You're a creep.
not_available You know that? A creep and a pervert! That's right! This doctor made me go down on him! He gave me VD.
not_available He got me pregnant! And now he wants me to pay for the abortion! Child molester! Lovely girl.
not_available I wanted to ask you about a Pediatric surgical rotation.
not_available This isn't a good time.
not_available I'll be in Pedes Sick
not_available U all night.
not_available You were looking for me? You're on Sick
not_available U with me.
not_available Isn't Zeidenberg on? Order everyone's labs and advance the drain on Bed 3.
not_available Here's one for you.
not_available "Longing for your embrace.
not_available Financial officer seeks life of adventure with very special lady." 
not_available Forget it.
not_available Sounds like money, honey.
not_available What are we gonna talk about? Dow averages? "Sensual M.D., 35.
not_available 6' 1 ".
not_available I like tall.
not_available Makes up in passion what he lacks in hair." Not me.
not_available I'm not so desperate to use personals.
not_available You calling me desperate? No.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available So where do you find all your dates? 
not_available I haven't had one in a while.
not_available See? Don't knock it till you try it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, psych's here on that lady.
not_available Who is it? McDonald? No, some intern.
not_available I didn't realize we were coming down this hallway.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available Which room was it, anyway? I don't know.
not_available It was either this door or this one.
not_available No, Doug.
not_available It's this one.
not_available Right.
not_available Lots of stolen moments in there, huh? Yes, there were.
not_available So should we? What? 
not_available Open the door.
not_available Oh, yeah, sure.
not_available Why not? Come on.
not_available You got it? Did it always smell like this? 
not_available I think it did.
not_available Now, if I remember I bet we still got some candles.
not_available What? 
not_available Yep! Look at this.
not_available Got a match? Oh, my God! Shelly, I'm gonna ask you to commit three things to 
memory A fire engine, a mobile home and a pen.
not_available Why? Just try to remember them.
not_available Can you tell me the date? Get away! Temp's up to 103.5.
not_available Look, we're running out of time.
not_available Shelly? The date? I already told Dr.
not_available Greene
not_available bean.
not_available Was she oriented to time? More or less.
not_available Oriented to time.
not_available Shelly, can you spell "world" backwards? UOY WERC
not_available S.
not_available Screw you.
not_available Backwards.
not_available Right.
not_available Good concentration.
not_available Can you remember the things I told you earlier? Yes.
not_available What are they? A fire engine, a pen, a mobile home.
not_available Now leave me alone, cornpone.
not_available She's oriented to person, time and place.
not_available Her mental status exam is normal.
not_available She's uncooperative, she speaks in rhyme and doesn't care that she could die without treatment.
not_available There are criteria for competence.
not_available She doesn't meet them.
not_available She's a woman with no I.D., found passed out in a restaurant.
not_available She doesn't meet the criteria.
not_available Do you realize your decision could kill her? That kind of hyperbole isn't very helpful.
not_available Patients have a right to make bad decisions.
not_available Not when they're demented.
not_available That's where we disagree.
not_available Get McDonald down here.
not_available Tell him it's life or death.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? The Serena kid's in second
not_available degree heart block.
not_available Where's his chart? Kenner's patient? 
not_available Yeah, but Kenner's back in surgery.
not_available Where are the labs? 
not_available On the chart.
not_available The calcium's not here.
not_available It wasn't picked up.
not_available Give him 30 of Lasix, IV push, and run a liter of saline to diurese him.
not_available Where's Gant? I don't know.
not_available Dr.
not_available Fogg at Cambridge did a similar study with rodents and could double serum cortisol with five minutes on the treadmill.
not_available How many more minutes do I have? 
not_available Fifteen.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, I'm getting a reading of 500 lux.
not_available Put the goggles on her.
not_available Goggles? The lights approximate daylight.
not_available We wanna make sure your body thinks it's night.
not_available What else do I have to do? One more exertion test, heart and lung readings, and that's it.
not_available Wendy, let's take the RPMs up to 90.
not_available I met the guy once last summer.
not_available Some type of mortgage broker.
not_available I don't know when she started seeing him.
not_available Why are you here when a kid is dying of hypercalcemia? You're supposed to monitor his calcium.
not_available I sent the labs in.
not_available Why, if you don't check them? It takes an hour.
not_available Look at this.
not_available 13.5! 
not_available He went into a bradyarrhythmia.
not_available I was going to get them.
not_available Gant, that kind of excuse kills patients.
not_available If you can't do the job, then you don't need to be here.
not_available Make another stupid mistake like that, you won't be.
not_available Hey, you okay? It's a code.
not_available I'm on the code team.
not_available Listen, we'll talk, all right? We'll talk when I get back? It's weird, being down here again.
not_available Makes me realize how unhappy I was.
not_available When you were with me? It wasn't your fault.
not_available I just didn't think much of myself.
not_available I'm sure I didn't help.
not_available A lot of stuff didn't help.
not_available But it's just different now, you know? I actually feel good.
not_available What's different besides us not being together? I used to think I couldn't do things.
not_available Now I'm taking a pre
not_available med course.
not_available I trust you did well on your midterms.
not_available B plus.
not_available Clearly, you're not trying hard enough.
not_available I guess it's about feeling in control.
not_available I guess.
not_available Of course, there's things you can't control.
not_available Such as? Administration's making me fire two nurses.
not_available Really? 
not_available But don't tell anyone.
not_available They don't know, and I don't know who it'll be.
not_available I'm not gonna say a thing.
not_available You know what's really depressing? Being here right now makes me realize how much happier I was back then.
not_available God, you're pathetic.
not_available Yes.
not_available You on the code team? 
not_available I was gonna ask you.
not_available Where the hell is A360? 
not_available I was gonna ask that too.
not_available Do you know where A
not_available 360 is? Somebody's having a heart attack.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Have you seen the men's room? A toilet overflowed.
not_available Nope.
not_available Can't help you.
not_available "290, 310.
not_available 330." 
not_available It must be this way.
not_available I'll do the central line.
not_available I will.
not_available Have you run a code before? 
not_available More than you have.
not_available Well, here's the toilet.
not_available Code team? You're late.
not_available Oh, no! 
not_available I'll take over.
not_available I got it.
not_available He's got a rhythm.
not_available I got a good pulse.
not_available Thank God! CPR course finally paid off.
not_available Now, if I could just find that john! Dr.
not_available Carter will show you.
not_available Know why I hate going to a shrink? 
not_available Why? Because you have to talk about yourself.
not_available That's the point, Doug.
not_available It's embarrassing.
not_available I tell her about my patients.
not_available She lets you? She says I prefer talking about them because solving their problems is easier than solving my own.
not_available It's probably true.
not_available Sometimes, yeah.
not_available Sometimes, no.
not_available You thinking about Charlie? I was tough on her today.
not_available Well, you know, you gave her a chance.
not_available Several.
not_available There's a certain point you just gotta say, "No.
not_available It's over." Why do those words sound familiar to me? Conni and I wrote a personal ad for you.
not_available Wanna hear? Sure.
not_available "Sensitive doctor.
not_available Tall, white and handsome." Handsome? Really? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Why not? "Loves the Cubs and Kawasakis." Hold on.
not_available I own a bike, I don't know if I love it.
not_available Chicks love guys with bikes.
not_available I got mine in the garage.
not_available Your bike? They let me keep it here.
not_available But I haven't run it.
not_available Your battery's gonna die.
not_available I gotta start it up.
not_available Don't mention the bike.
not_available I don't wanna attract motorcycle chicks.
not_available Someone like me? No.
not_available I didn't mean Shelly's gone and so are her clothes.
not_available Check the restrooms.
not_available I did that already.
not_available Did you see a female patient leave here? Brown hair and red hat? She just left.
not_available I'll get Security.
not_available Could you grab my coat? Shelly? Shelly? Shelly, you need to come back inside.
not_available I want the bus.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You're very sick.
not_available We need to treat you.
not_available Right away.
not_available Go away.
not_available Shelly, come on.
not_available Put me down! I wanna go on the bus! Put me down! Help! Help! Why are you hurting me? Grab her legs.
not_available Chuny, take her shoulders.
not_available Malik, bring her knees up to her chest.
not_available What are you doing? I'm gonna give you a shot to numb the skin.
not_available No! No needles, please! I don't see a psych hold.
not_available Help me.
not_available I got tired of waiting.
not_available Hold still.
not_available I want everyone's names.
not_available Chuny Marquez.
not_available Lydia Wright.
not_available Malik McGrath.
not_available No, please! I got fluid.
not_available There I was, baring my soul in a way I never really had before.
not_available All of a sudden, I hear snoring.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so tired.
not_available Oh, God! I've got 51/2 hours to make my big staff decision.
not_available What am I gonna do? 
not_available Sorry, what? You're hilarious.
not_available Oh, my God! Charlie? Get a gurney! Let's go! What happened? 
not_available He found me.
not_available The pimp? Hang on.
not_available Get the gurney, Conni! Benton was out of line.
not_available Was he? 
not_available Way out of line.
not_available I feel like punching out the bastard.
not_available Well, that would be unwise.
not_available I suppose I could tell Anspaugh but then again, I don't know.
not_available I think Benton's right.
not_available Lately, I've been one step behind, five minutes too late.
not_available See you.
not_available Aren't you covering the ER? 
not_available It's dead.
not_available What I wouldn't give for a good five
not_available car pileup.
not_available It's 3:00.
not_available Time for the Charlie Chan Mystery Movie.
not_available What's the point of this exactly? To compare your cortisol after indoor and outdoor exertion.
not_available That's it? 
not_available No more sweating after this.
not_available Get your knees up, like a drum major.
not_available That's it.
not_available There you go.
not_available Go! Go! Go! Okay, sweetheart.
not_available Squeeze this hand.
not_available Good.
not_available All right.
not_available Now squeeze this hand.
not_available That's okay.
not_available That's all right.
not_available I think she's got a broken right ulna.
not_available Ears are clear.
not_available Can you move your jaw for me? Side to side.
not_available It hurts.
not_available That's okay.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Let's get a panorex.
not_available She's got a broken jaw.
not_available Let's get a film of the chest, right arm, orbits.
not_available She has bruising around her groin.
not_available She may have been raped.
not_available All right, kiddo.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Your idea's gonna make you a millionaire? 
not_available Money in the bank.
not_available Let's hear it.
not_available Flypaper in a can.
not_available Like aerosol.
not_available You spray it on your car so bugs stick to it.
not_available You peel off one big sheet.
not_available Then boom! 
not_available Your car is clean.
not_available You're kidding, right? I'll call it "Bug Off." 
not_available That's the dumbest idea ever.
not_available Why not just clean it off with a hose? Okay, I got another one.
not_available Stethoscope condoms.
not_available I don't even want to know.
not_available Take my advice.
not_available Don't quit your day job.
not_available How's it going? Dr.
not_available Kenner.
not_available We had a scare.
not_available His calcium went up to 13.5 which sent him into heart block.
not_available I had to diurese him.
not_available I got him back to a normal sinus.
not_available Well, it looks fine now.
not_available Good work.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd like to do another Pediatric rotation and I'd like to do it with you.
not_available Correct me if I'm wrong.
not_available I understood that Dr.
not_available Keaton isn't recommending you.
not_available She told you that? Well, it is a pretty small club.
not_available We do talk occasionally.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kenner, I learned a lot from Dr.
not_available Keaton but our styles were very different.
not_available We didn't quite mesh.
not_available Why don't you talk to her and tell her your perspective about not meshing and so on.
not_available Maybe she'll reconsider.
not_available And if she did? Then we could talk.
not_available Without a recommendation, I really can't help you.
not_available Where am I going? To Radiology to take x
not_available rays.
not_available We'll use a machine called a CAT scan to make sure your head's okay.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll come with you.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Want me to get a rape kit? I'm gonna talk to her and see what happened.
not_available Which bone would you choose? 
not_available Maybe a finger.
not_available If I had to choose a bone to break, I'd choose a clavicle.
not_available That's good.
not_available No surgical intervention.
not_available I'd go with a skull fracture.
not_available Oh, you would! Crazy! "Venture to Karachi on the rugged Grand Trunk Road which, while breathtaking is prone to landslides and firefights by warring sectarian factions." Abby, don't go.
not_available Put the book down.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton? Did you lock the door? 
not_available I thought you did.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton, l Peter, could you wait outside, please? Anything? 
not_available Just doing the ink stain now.
not_available I admire you, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available That took guts.
not_available Thank you for your support.
not_available Don't worry about that lawyer.
not_available I'm going to take full responsibility.
not_available They can't fire all of us.
not_available Sorry if I offended you earlier with that motorcycle crack.
not_available It takes a lot to offend me.
not_available But seriously, I'd be lucky to find someone like you.
not_available Wanna get the lights? Is it meningitis? Cryptococcus.
not_available You were right.
not_available Randi, have you seen a black binder? The nursing budget? It fell out of the cubby, so I looked at it.
not_available Well, where is it? Bad news for some people, huh? 
not_available You shouldn't have looked.
not_available I was curious.
not_available I took an accounting course.
not_available Well, that's no excuse.
not_available It's the overtime that's killing you.
not_available What? ER nurses work 12
not_available hour shifts.
not_available After eight hours, they get overtime.
not_available It's screwing with your budget.
not_available I don't know what else we can do.
not_available Put everybody on 8
not_available hour shifts.
not_available You'll save a hundred grand a year.
not_available I know teacher/intern relationships can undermine reputations.
not_available The innuendo and rumors.
not_available I need to know if you'll be discreet about this.
not_available I came by to see if you'd reconsider writing me a recommendation.
not_available You've always complimented my surgical skills and with a recommendation, I could get another Pediatric rotation.
not_available And if I don't? What do you mean, if you don't? Will you report my relationship with Dr.
not_available Carter? You think I'm threatening you? Are you? If your recommendation isn't based on my abilities as a doctor I don't want it.
not_available I can't do that, Peter.
not_available You've got the makings of an excellent surgeon but not a pediatric surgeon.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, another letter from Legal.
not_available What do you know? I've been written up again.
not_available Twice in one night.
not_available They cc'd Anspaugh.
not_available That was very thoughtful.
not_available Jerks.
not_available Why don't I just get some frames and put these up on the wall? You should do it.
not_available This is George Dunleavy.
not_available What can I do for you? The police said that you may have found my sister, Shelly.
not_available A couple of days ago, she said she was sick.
not_available I told her to see a doctor.
not_available I haven't heard from her since.
not_available Does your sister have any psychiatric problems? She was pretty incoherent.
not_available Meningitis can cause temporary dementia.
not_available Will she be all right? Take a day or two, but she should be fine.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Sure.
not_available I want you to know, Dr.
not_available Keaton and I never talked about you.
not_available We never said anything about you remotely negative, ever.
not_available Carter, it never occurred to me that you had.
not_available We were just talking about you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gant feels that you've treated him inappropriately in public.
not_available Calling him lazy and stupid, I understand? I said what he did was lazy and stupid.
not_available It wasn't inappropriate.
not_available His inattention almost killed a child.
not_available That's not true.
not_available You neglected your duties.
not_available If you feel that way, speak to me.
not_available Don't yell at me in public.
not_available All right, settle down.
not_available You were there, weren't you? Do you feel Dr.
not_available Benton's reaction was inappropriate? His language was strong, and I can understand how Dennis feels.
not_available But given the circumstances I'm not sure I'd call it inappropriate.
not_available Sounds like you have to develop thicker skin, Dr.
not_available Gant.
not_available And if similar issues arise in the future I suggest you take them up with Dr.
not_available Benton directly before you come crying to me.
not_available The hard truth is, there's no money.
not_available They want me to let people go.
not_available So who gets fired? 
not_available Nobody.
not_available I sent up a proposal that solves our problems without losing jobs.
not_available You cutting back hours? 
not_available No.
not_available Instead of three 12hour shifts, everyone will work five 8
not_available hour shifts.
not_available For the same money? A little less.
not_available But we have to work four hours more a week.
not_available That sucks.
not_available Or two of you are history.
not_available I don't buy that.
not_available They got the money.
not_available I'm not giving up my OT.
not_available None of us are.
not_available We got a contract negotiation coming up.
not_available Management pulls this, we walk.
not_available That's right.
not_available I didn't think you'd really go to Anspaugh.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I didn't know what to say.
not_available And with Benton standing there John, it's okay.
not_available I didn't mean to put you on the spot.
not_available So we're cool? Yeah, we're cool.
not_available I'd better get back to the ER.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available It's like an x
not_available ray of your head.
not_available There's nothing to be afraid of.
not_available Will you stay with me? 
not_available I'm gonna be in the next room.
not_available Charlie, were you raped? Promise you won't tell the cops? I'm not gonna tell anybody.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Okay, let's see.
not_available Hey, Mark! Mark! You forgot your curriculum vitae.
not_available Thanks! After tonight, I figure my chances for making tenure are about nil.
not_available But I did my job, and I can do my job somewhere.
not_available Tenure or no tenure.
not_available Same here.
not_available They're messing with our overtime.
not_available I'll go someplace else.
not_available That's the spirit! 
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Chuny, you hungry? Wanna grab some breakfast with me? Sure.
not_available First I gotta take the bike for a spin just to charge the battery.
not_available Why don't I charge it up with you? Sure.
not_available Hop on! You want me to get in this box? "This box" is a body plethysmograph.
not_available It accurately measures lung capacity.
not_available Why is that important? I need accurate specifications, or I can't correlate the data.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I get claustrophobic.
not_available Look at all the windows.
not_available You can look out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't.
not_available If you don't, I have to throw out two months' work.
not_available I'm not getting in.
not_available You're getting $50.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Please? I'm sorry.
not_available It's final.
not_available I can't.
not_available How about that? 
not_available Wendy.
not_available What? 
not_available Get in the box.
not_available Me? We'll test lung volume.
not_available Then get on the bike.
not_available But it's almost daylight.
not_available Here, wear the goggles.
not_available You won't know the difference.
not_available How is she? She's got a broken arm, a lot of bruises.
not_available A concussion.
not_available She was raped.
not_available I'll get a kit and call the police.
not_available When does the social worker get here? They should be on now.
not_available You want me to call? No.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available The eggs are burning.
not_available Oh, well.
not_available We'll just have to make some more.
not_available I didn't call a surgeon.
not_available We finally got a good one.
not_available Some guy got hit by the EI.
not_available What you got? 
not_available You got a mess.
not_available Take a look.
not_available Yuck! Which end is up? Jumped or fell in front of a train.
not_available Open skull fracture, multiple extremity fractures, flailed chest.
not_available Any signs of life? 
not_available He's got a weak pulse.
not_available Now all he needs is a face.
not_available He's 60/40.
not_available He ain't gonna last.
not_available Everybody, grab hold on my count.
not_available 1, 2, 3! What is this? 
not_available Man versus moving El train.
not_available Suicide? He either jumped or tripped.
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available Put O
not_available neg on the rapid infuser.
not_available Set up a central line.
not_available Page Gant.
not_available He's supposed to be covering the ER.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available How are his eyes? He's lost one, and the other's swollen shut.
not_available Gray matter in the hair.
not_available Increased breath sounds.
not_available I'll put in a tube.
not_available It's a surgical procedure.
not_available 32 French.
not_available Whose beeper? It's coming from him.
not_available 10 blade.
not_available What number did you page Gant to? This room, 3376.
not_available That's the number on this pager.
not_available Oh, my God! The patient.
not_available It's Gant.
not_available Dennis? Oh, sweet Jesus! Carter, put the tube in! Seal him with thoraseal! Move! 
not_available Flat line.
not_available Give me an amp of epi and atropine.
not_available Let's go, Carter! I'm trying! Get it in! Get it in! It's in.
not_available Come on.
