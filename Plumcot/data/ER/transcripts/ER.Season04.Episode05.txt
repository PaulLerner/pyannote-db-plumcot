not_available " Seven inches.
not_available Seven inches.
not_available "Fold that distal end upward to form a J
not_available pouch.
not_available " You like that? You like that, Reece? You like forming a Jpouch? Do you know how to form a J

not_available Goodbye.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Peter.
not_available Thought you didn't drink caffeine.
not_available I do now.
not_available You had your kid when you were in med school, right? Sure did.
not_available What a mistake that was.
not_available See you around, Peter.
not_available We got Ernesto Ruiz in Curtain 2.
not_available Throughand
not_available through GSW to the right shoulder.
not_available The same knucklehead was in here before, shot in the chest.
not_available He must wear a bull's
not_available eye.
not_available I gave him a gram of Ancef and called Surgery.
not_available Three is a 40year
not_available old gentleman with urinary retention.
not_available And Jeanie's working up a 65year
not_available old woman in Exam 2 with abdominal pain.
not_available We'll do rounds at about 8.
not_available And I'll drum up more business.
not_available Mark, take a look at a patient for me? Female, 65, recurring right upper
not_available quadrant pain becoming increasingly worse.
not_available Temp's 101, white count's 15,000.
not_available She's vomiting bilious material.
not_available Sounds like cholecystitis.
not_available I think she needs surgery.
not_available Let's look.
not_available Haleh, ¿está por aquí? Hi, Pablo.
not_available No, Haleh is not here.
not_available Is Haleh here? 
not_available No.
not_available She called in sick today.
not_available But today's Thursday.

not_available But she'll be back tomorrow, okay? She'll be back later? She'll be back tomorrow.
not_available She'll be glad to see you then.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Hey, Anna.
not_available You got any procedures? Can't wait for the next one, huh? No.
not_available It's for Fu's benefit.
not_available I swear I'll turn him into a functioning med student.
not_available How many times has he puked in Trauma? Twice.
not_available But the second time was really dry heaves.
not_available How's yours doing? He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he hasn't puked yet.
not_available You got anything we can do? 
not_available You can cath the guy in Curtain 3.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tell me if this hurts.
not_available You're good
not_available looking.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available Does this hurt? Last night it was so bad I couldn't sleep.
not_available How about here? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Here? 
not_available No, higher.
not_available Can I have my hand back? Ma'am, come on.
not_available Give me my hand back.
not_available Wait, handsome.
not_available You can handle this.
not_available She's got a hot gallbladder.
not_available We should get a consult.
not_available Do it.
not_available But
not_available I don't have time for this today.
not_available The average male penis uses a 16 French Foley catheter.
not_available Those French think of everything.
not_available It refers to the circumference.
not_available One French is a third of a millimeter diameter.
not_available Check the Foley balloon for leaks by injecting some saline.
not_available And you lube up the tip with lidocaine jelly.
not_available Now you are ready to insert applying gentle, constant pressure.
not_available Isn't this a nurse's job? You need to know how.
not_available So grab that penis and show it who's boss.
not_available Yo! When can I go home? Who's your doctor? 
not_available I don't know her name.
not_available Go back to your bed and wait for her.
not_available What're you doing to that dude? Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Back to your bed.
not_available Sometimes it's tricky to get it past the prostate.
not_available You all did this to me last time.
not_available I wish I knew who it was too.
not_available Do I have to call Security? Back to your own room! It's in, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Balloon's inflated.
not_available Hook it up to the bag, Ivan! Hi.
not_available Who peed in your corn flakes? What? You're in a bad mood.
not_available I'm just caught up in this lawsuit.
not_available I have to give a deposition today.
not_available Lawsuit? Over what? Family of a gunshot victim who died last spring.
not_available It's a shakedown.
not_available They're just looking for money.
not_available I'm pretty good at back rubs.
not_available Might help you relax.
not_available Thanks, I'll take a rain check on that.
not_available Okay, sure.
not_available I hope that wasn't inappropriate to say at work? Don't worry.
not_available I won't sue.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Hey.
not_available So where's that going? What? 
not_available You and the desk clerk.
not_available There is no me and the desk clerk.
not_available A girl like that.
not_available If you get into something think ahead how to get out.
not_available A girl like what? Pretty needy.
not_available You don't know anything about her.
not_available And 
B If I was interested in her or anybody else I don't need your advice.
not_available Brett Nicholson, 20.
not_available Has shortness of breath.
not_available No fever, a little tachy at 100.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available Hi.
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available I was running and got so out of breath I had to sit down.
not_available Ever had shortness of breath before? No, just the last few weeks, but it's getting worse.
not_available Any history of asthma? No.
not_available Okay, let's listen to your chest.
not_available All right.
not_available You're an athlete? 
not_available I'm a runner at De Paul.
not_available Take deep breaths, please.
not_available What's your event? 
not_available 400 meters.
not_available Again.
not_available Best time? 
not_available 46 flat.
not_available Man, that's good.
not_available Deep breaths.
not_available You listening, James? I'm freaking out.
not_available Not being able to run is like not being able to walk.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What do you hear? Scattered rales, bilaterally.
not_available I agree.
not_available What do you want to do? Get a chest film and a CBC to check the white count.
not_available That won't change the management.
not_available What do you think it is? We'll have to wait for the x
not_available ray.
not_available Call Radiology, and next time, make sure the nurse gets them into a gown.
not_available Kerry, do you have a minute? 
not_available Half a minute.
not_available Can I bounce an idea off you? Sure.
not_available I see a need for some patient follow
not_available up in the ER.
not_available Services, like psych counseling.
not_available We patch people up and throw them out without any help of staying well.
not_available I thought of a women's and children's clinic, all volunteer
not_available staffed.
not_available A women's and children's clinic? We could designate an exam room, two or three days a week.
not_available It's an interesting idea.
not_available I'd volunteer.
not_available Lots of docs and nurses would.
not_available I'll add it to the list of ideas we'd implement if we had the money.
not_available Stoney Island's ER got $100,000 from the Department of Public Health for a wound
not_available check clinic.
not_available If they can do it
not_available I'm going to a budget meeting to see that we don't compromise basic patient care.
not_available I'm not looking to take on any new side projects.
not_available But my door is always open.
not_available Going someplace, Ernesto? 
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available Where's my shirt? Surgery's seen you? Bullet went through.
not_available A surgeon has to explore the wound.
not_available Nothing's wrong with me.
not_available You need a wound explored? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Now you're a tough guy? Last time you yelled for Mama.
not_available I'll help.
not_available You're not a surgeon.
not_available I've done it 50 times.
not_available What are you doing? Bye
not_available bye, chica.
not_available You think I can't débride a wound? Put some pressure on that so you don't bleed all over! 
not_available See you next time.
not_available I could've helped.
not_available I called Surgery.
not_available Who's supposed to cover the ER? You're not gonna be sick, are you? We'll start with the colectomy at the cecum and proceed distally.
not_available This bowel's very friable.
not_available Metz.
not_available How do you make a W
not_available pouch, Dr.
not_available Benton? Measure seven inches from the transected distal and fold it upwardThat's a J
not_available pouch.
not_available I said W
not_available pouch.
not_available I assumed we were doing a
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, Wpouch? It's like the J
not_available pouch, but with two extra loops.
not_available You fold the distal ileum back three times instead of one.
not_available Quite right.
not_available Didn't get that far in your reading, Dr.
not_available Benton? I understand you're behind with your reports and discharge summaries.
not_available I'll get caught up this week.
not_available Perhaps you should be in Medical Records.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, I'm prepared for this.
not_available Step out, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Catch up on your dictations.
not_available Don't worry about the patient.
not_available I'd say that he is in quite capable hands.
not_available What are those things? Cannonball infiltrates.
not_available Probably testicular cancer.
not_available Testicular? 
not_available It metastasizes to the lungs.
not_available Who's the unlucky soul? presented with shortness of breath.
not_available Sweet guy.
not_available Athlete.
not_available He won't know what hit him.
not_available Did you do the testicular exam? 
not_available That's next.
not_available If it's better, I'll do it.
not_available Why's that better? In case he's more comfortable with a male doctor.
not_available If a woman needed a pelvic exam, would you give it to me? 
not_available I was just offering.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine.
not_available Great.
not_available Cynthia, how long has Pablo been sitting out there? That guy? Ten minutes.
not_available Will you tell him Haleh's not coming in, try back tomorrow? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Somebody called for a surgeon? 
not_available Three hours ago.
not_available I called, Dale.
not_available Something about a gangrenous toe? Joseph Kupchak, 49year
not_available old diabetic male noticed an infection on his left baby toe, but put off coming in.
not_available This is why you quit surgery.
not_available How's the internship going? 
not_available Going great.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kupchak, I'm Dr.
not_available Edson.
not_available I'm a surgeon.
not_available I'm here to take care of this toe.
not_available Oh, Carter.
not_available This looks like something you could've handled.
not_available Tell me if you feel this.
not_available I don't believe that they don't trust you to clip a toe.
not_available I clipped a couple of toes when I was a student.
not_available Feel that? 
not_available No.
not_available How's Benton treating you? 
not_available Piece of cake.
not_available I got him handled.
not_available Rocket's back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano? I heard that.
not_available He's letting me scrub in.
not_available Lap choly with a laser.
not_available Ever work with him before you washed out? I didn't wash out, Dale.
not_available You're sticking to your story.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available Head lac, MVA.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Head lac? Gosh, golly.
not_available Feel that? September 5, '52.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Tom Angevine.
not_available What happened, Mr.
not_available Angevine? Going to a lunch appointment then I get this sudden, blinding headache.
not_available Straight into a tree.
not_available Pressure's 210/160.
not_available Do you have history of hypertension? Yeah.
not_available I'm taking Vasotec and Lasix.
not_available Let's bring that pressure down.
not_available Let's start nitroprussides, Get an EKG and keep monitoring his pressure.
not_available Call for an abdominal CT.
not_available Abdominal CT? 
not_available Right.
not_available For a hypertensive emergency? Do it please, Conni.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Brett.
not_available You find out what's wrong? We have an idea, but we need to do a further examination.
not_available I need to examine your testicles.
not_available I'm short of breath.
not_available Why my testicles? I have to check for abnormalities.
not_available My student can leave the room if you like? 
not_available No, he can stay, I don't care.
not_available All right.
not_available Could you take down your pants and underwear, please? Alrighty.
not_available It's a good thing I put on clean drawers.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Oh, man! Hey, I'm sorry about that.
not_available It's a normal male reaction.
not_available Oh, God! I'm sorry, doctor.
not_available I'm sorry, I can't do this.
not_available There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
not_available Okay, just wait.
not_available Just wait.
not_available It's really not a problem.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available It's important we finish
not_available Just give me a minute, okay? All right? Jeez! Tell me about your hypertensive crisis, Mr.
not_available Angevine? A minor trauma case, head lac from an MVA.
not_available Upon exam he was tachycardic, diaphoretic, BP was 210/160.
not_available We got his pressure down.
not_available Why'd you do an abdominal CT? History of flushing and palpitations.
not_available Classic findings for a pheo.
not_available You're fishing with pretty expensive bait.
not_available What'd the CT show? 
not_available It hasn't come back.
not_available It's tempting to reach for a surgical cause, but in the ER we can't run expensive tests based on hunches.
not_available Just check with me in the future.
not_available Carol.
not_available Yeah? I didn't mean to be short earlier.
not_available I think an ER clinic is interesting.
not_available You might be able to get some funds for it.
not_available I might? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here's the place to start.
not_available What are these? 
not_available Grant application manuals.
not_available This is a good book on fundraising strategies.
not_available Oh, no, Kerry.
not_available I didn't mean me.
not_available I don't have the time.
not_available What do I do with these? The only way a good idea comes to life is if somebody chooses to see it through.
not_available If you need help with these, we can talk later.
not_available Kerry, I've got a problem with this case.
not_available Could you tell Mark? Mark is the problem.
not_available I worked up this LOL, and Mark left during the exam and refused to finish.
not_available Why? 
not_available The woman's a little flaky.
not_available She put Mark's hand on her breast.
not_available But she's sick.
not_available Ultrasound confirms cholangitis.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Maybe he's got a lot on his mind.
not_available She's a Medicare patient? I was reluctant to bring this to you.
not_available If somebody's in a bad mood
not_available I'll talk to Mark.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Brett, you have a mass on your left testicle.
not_available Chest x
not_available ray shows spots on your lungs, which is why you're short of breath.
not_available Spots? What? The growth on your testicle may have spread to your lungs.
not_available What? Cancer? Before we determine that, I must draw some blood and you need a CAT scan on your abdomen.
not_available Could I have a pen and paper? I want to write this down.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, so What happens now, once you draw some blood? Right.
not_available Then I'll send you back to Radiology for the CAT scan.
not_available And then I'll call an oncologist down to see you.
not_available Okay.
not_available So how bad is the cancer? We're not certain it's cancer.
not_available What happens if it is? You should discuss this with an oncologist.
not_available I don't want to wait for someone else if you can tell me now.
not_available Okay.
not_available If it is cancer, treatment is removal of the testicle plus chemotherapy, probably radiation as well.
not_available Cut one of my nuts off? With successful treatment, there's a 70% survival rate.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Mark? Hi, Alan.
not_available You didn't get my page? Yeah.
not_available No, I got it.
not_available I just I was just on my way up.
not_available If you're gonna lie to an attorney, try harder.
not_available I know you don't feel the need for final preparation, but I do.
not_available We're not prepared? For a deposition, there's no such thing.
not_available Any question they ask, you answer what? "Yes," "no" or "I don't recall.
not_available " That's right, and nothing else.
not_available Why haven't we settled this already? They won't come down from eight figures.
not_available They say they're entitled to what Kenny Law might have earned if he'd made it to the NBA.
not_available And a jury could go for that.
not_available Their lawyer, she'll try to rattle you.
not_available Can't rattle me.
not_available I did all I could to save the boy's life.
not_available I'll page you when they come.
not_available Answer it this time.
not_available "Primary surgeon, Dr.
not_available Peter Benton.
not_available Attending, Angela Hicks.
not_available " Oh, boy.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Papa don't Hey, hey, hey Hey! Papa don't All right, come on.
not_available Do this.
not_available " Clinical narrative.
not_available Patient presented to the emergency department with a gunshot wound and a systolic blood pressure of
not_available " Hey, how are you doing? Dr.
not_available Peter Benton.
not_available Vinay Radhakrishnan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's the way to do it instead of letting them stack up.
not_available It's like falling off a freight train.
not_available Do you have kids? Yes.
not_available Three boys, two girls.
not_available How do you balance it with work? I mean, if you don't mind me asking? My wife handles everything with the children.
not_available Pardon me, please.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Vinay Radhakrishnan dictating a summary on Stella Klein.
not_available Medical record 
number 8498
not_available 29.
not_available I didn't know what to say.
not_available He had an erection, and I needed to finish the exam.
not_available Don't beat yourself up.
not_available You like the spicy string beans? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All of it's good.
not_available How much was it? 
not_available No, my treat.
not_available How much do I owe? 
not_available Why can't I treat? Thirty dollars? Where is this place? It's on Wacker.
not_available You keep spending like that, you're gonna be in big trouble.
not_available I got in over my head.
not_available Maxedout my credit cards
not_available Mr.
not_available Angevine's CT.
not_available You're right.
not_available It's a pheo.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Good pickup, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available There it is.
not_available DC the Nipride and start him on phentolamine, 5mg IV.
not_available I'll call down a surgeon.
not_available Way to go, Dr.
not_available Carter! Here, I owe you a $1.50.
not_available I gotta go check on my track star.
not_available Ding Dongs? Want a bite? 
not_available No, I'll just watch you eat it.
not_available These are my all
not_available time favorites.
not_available In Virginia they didn't call them Ding Dongs, they called them King Don's on the package.
not_available Why not call them Ding Dongs in Virginia? What law does that violate? Maybe you can help me with 
this Ding Dongs, Ho Hos.
not_available Same food, just different shape.
not_available How'd they get away with that? Right! Why pretend that they're different? Ding Dong
not_available Ho Ho conspiracy.
not_available Mark, can I see you for a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available What's up? You saw a patient this morning.
not_available Marian Rice? Horny old lady.
not_available Medicare won't reimburse 100% unless an Attending examines the patient and writes out a note in detail.
not_available You walked out during the exam.
not_available Who told you that? Jeanie? We can't write "seen and agree" notes on Medicare patients.
not_available You didn't read the memo? Which memo was that? What do I have to do so we can get paid? Examine this patient and chart your findings in detail.
not_available If I have to examine every Medicare patient, why do we have P.A.s? It's not about the P.A.s.
not_available All right.
not_available No problem.
not_available Jeanie, football.
not_available What? 
not_available Bears play tonight.
not_available Want some squares for Al? 
not_available No, not this week.
not_available Y'all quit rooting for the Bears? 
not_available We're rooting, not betting.
not_available You know where to find me.
not_available What's all this stuff? 
not_available Grant applications from Weaver.
not_available Might start a clinic in the ER.
not_available Like Stoney Island? That's where gangsters go to get wounds looked at.
not_available They got $100,000 state grant.
not_available Weaver's got you panhandling for her? No, it was my idea.
not_available A nurse started that clinic.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yep.
not_available ER charge nurse.
not_available Angevine's in shock! His BP crashed! 
not_available My pheo? He's tossing multiple PVCs and desaturating.
not_available Get four units of O
not_available neg, and find out why Surgery's not here.
not_available What? He's in V
not_available fib.
not_available His tumor's infracting.
not_available Where's Surgery? 
not_available Charging 200.
not_available Clear.
not_available Go again.
not_available Charging 300.
not_available Clear.
not_available Let's move him straight into Surgery.
not_available Shocked him out of V
not_available fib.
not_available You Romano? 
not_available Call me Rocket.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter made the diagnosis.
not_available Great.
not_available Don't wait for me.
not_available Let's go.

not_available Ten months a year he's in Europe.
not_available He's performing an operation tomorrow with an extraordinary

not_available Are you interested in robotics? 
not_available No.
not_available I can get you on the team.
not_available It's a robotic arm with a camera.
not_available Rocket will be directing it with a headset, like Madonna or whoever.
not_available Fascinating.
not_available How could you get me on the team? Rocket's sponsoring my BTA.
not_available BTA? 
not_available Been to America.
not_available In order to come here, I needed a sponsor.
not_available And now you want to broaden my surgical horizons, huh? You really should get to know him, Peter.

not_available I want to know about a patient named Angevine.
not_available Emergency incision of a pheochromocytoma.
not_available Romano took him up.
not_available Romano? What's wrong? My testicular cancer guy ran away.
not_available The oncologist never saw him.

not_available No.
not_available I'll try this number.
not_available I think he lives on campus.
not_available Use this phone.
not_available I can't get anywhere with Surgery.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, I can't find a vein on the patient in 4.
not_available Really? 
not_available Well, he's blown them all.
not_available If you'll all excuse me, I'll put my education and training to the test by drawing blood from a heroin addict.
not_available Come on, Ivan.
not_available Is Haleh here? No.
not_available She's sick, remember? No, because today's Thursday.
not_available I know, Pablo! Haleh's not here today.
not_available Come back tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available I come back later, huh?

not_available Friday, okay? Mañana.

not_available Summer of '77, never will forget it.
not_available I was at Charlie Wilson's house.
not_available Old Charlie boy down in the basement, banging.
not_available Like we just invented something.
not_available Told you you wouldn't find nothing.
not_available Warm compresses or a dab of nitro paste can dilate a hidden vein.
not_available But before we do that, let's find one in a lower extremity like the saphenous vein in the leg.
not_available The femoral vein? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Dorsal venous plexus of the foot? Give it here.
not_available I'll find you one.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Cotton? Don't you ever, ever try this.
not_available I screwed up with my testicular cancer patient.
not_available He ran away.
not_available Ran away? I sent my student out to look for him.
not_available The guy likes to run along the lakefront.
not_available He's not running with those mets in his lungs.
not_available I left a message at his dorm.
not_available He'll show up, but The thing is, when we do find him it would be good if he could talk to a man about the orchiectomy.
not_available Explain that his life's not over because he's losing a testicle.
not_available Let me know when you find him.
not_available We got a wild one! 
not_available Give it to me.

not_available Got a nasty lac here.
not_available Tough throwing him into restraints.
not_available Hard leathers! You can't tie me up like this! We need as many as we can.
not_available Hold his head down! Ready to move him? What's his name? 
not_available McNamara.

not_available Who are you? I was kidnapped from my houseDamn you people! Hold him down! Son of a bitch!

not_available All right, we're gonna move him on the count of three.
not_available Hold him down.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available I'm sorry I embarrassed you, Dr.

not_available You didn't.
not_available Well, I embarrassed myself.
not_available You get used to this stuff, Ivan.
not_available How? Eventually, it doesn't faze you.
not_available What if I can't cut it? You need to see more.
not_available Get a few more traumas under your belt.
not_available What if my whole life is a wrong decision? Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available How are those dictations? 
not_available Almost finished.
not_available I want to thank you for the time to catch up and apologize for this morning.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available I should hope not.
not_available You know, when your son was in the NICU, everyone gladly bent over to accommodate you because we all felt sympathy for you.
not_available But now your baby's out of the hospital and as you've probably noted Dr.
not_available Corday has raised the bar considerably for surgical residents.
not_available Yes.
not_available She's talented.
not_available If we don't stay on our toes, she could make us all look bad.
not_available These grant applications are making my eyes glaze over.
not_available Who's the nurse at Stoney Island who started their clinic? 
not_available Ellen Buckley.
not_available Maybe she'd show me the ropes.
not_available I'll tell you how she got her grant.
not_available Really? No big mystery.
not_available Her dad's a state senator.
not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico? Your patient? Yeah, that's him.

not_available Hey, Brett.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where'd you go? 
not_available Just walking around.
not_available I know this great doctor.
not_available He's a pediatrician but he's a good person to talk to with questions you might have.
not_available You won't answer more questions? No.
not_available I thought you might be more comfortable with a male doctor.
not_available Will he tell me that my left nut's got to go? If that's the diagnosis, yes.
not_available I don't care if it's you or whoever.
not_available I just I just needed to walk around, get this all straight in my mind.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you want me to talk to that oncologist? Yeah.

not_available I don't know about that.
not_available Nobody else could control him.
not_available You did.
not_available I was watching.
not_available Yeah, well Can I tell you something, Mark? I understated when I said that I give good back rubs.
not_available I give great back rubs.
not_available It's one of the things I'm best at.
not_available Want me to show you? Here? Turn around.
not_available Oh, man! You are so tight! I knew you'd have a really strong back, though.
not_available That feels great.
not_available It's Alan McConaugha.
not_available The hospital lawyer.
not_available I'd better get going.
not_available Can I walk with you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I could never do this.
not_available What was I thinking? What did you say? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Still thinking about a clinic? You could spend your life getting this money.
not_available From the government.
not_available You should look into private foundations.
not_available Private? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah? No, no, no.
not_available I just want to know if Thomas Angevine is out of surgery or not.
not_available I was just on hold.
not_available I was just on hold.
not_available Private foundations? They exist to give money away.
not_available It's that or pay taxes.
not_available Do you think a private foundation would consider this clinic? You should hear the nutty ideas that get pitched to my grandmother.
not_available Wait one second.
not_available Yeah? What do you mean, nobody knows? Just go down the hall! Wait, wait.
not_available Just tell me what O.R.
not_available they're in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Your grandmother's involved in a foundation? 
not_available I gotta go to Surgery.
not_available Wait, Carter! Would your grandmother consider this clinic idea? If you put something down on paper, she'd probably look at it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have there been previous lawsuits alleging malpractice by you? Yes.
not_available One.
not_available Isn't it true that in the spring of 1995, a Mrs.
not_available Jodi O'Brian a healthy 29year
not_available old, pregnant with her first child died from your misdiagnosis? No.
not_available Her medical course was

not_available Did you, in fact, feel guilty? 
not_available Guilty? No.
not_available What word would better describe your state of mind? Regret.
not_available Did this regretful feeling reflect the quality of care you provided? No.
not_available It happens here all the time.

not_available You felt horrible when Kenny died? 
not_available No! Mr.

not_available Yes.
not_available It's a lie! Do something about your client.
not_available He's lying! 
not_available Be quiet! You're in no position to accuse me of anything! You of all people! Dr.
not_available Greene, do you hold the life of a black man to be of lesser value than that of a white man? What kind of question is that? Will you answer it? People die.
not_available I'm human.
not_available I'm fallible.
not_available You see yourself as fallible? 
not_available Don't twist my words.
not_available About your fallibility.
not_available When this black man was brought into the ERYou want me to say that I'm a racist? I'm a racist, all right? Do you feel better about almost beating me to death? Will that bring your son back? 
not_available Don't point at her! We're taking a break.
not_available We're stopping now.
not_available Talking about regret? You never expressed regret to my mother! You belong in jail.
not_available I wish it was me who kicked your white ass! Dr.
