
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available The surgery went well.
not_available So they say.
not_available You were lucky.
not_available Is that what I think it is? I was going through a religious phase.
not_available It's not America.
not_available You may have to adjust your approach somewhat.
not_available Okay, then, he's all yours.
not_available Watch the pericolic gutter.
not_available He's had some adhesions from an appendectomy.
not_available We're going home.
not_available Q
not_available 101 time is 8:30 under partly cloudy skies.
not_available We'll be back with the news on the hour after this 30
not_available minute music mix.
not_available You realize you've been in there for 20 minutes? You miss me or am I wasting water? Both.
not_available How much longer are you gonna be? Your shift doesn't start for two hours.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's an 8:00 meeting near here.
not_available You gonna go? I was thinking about it.
not_available Hello? Something wrong? Carter? What are you doing? We really can't help you anymore, sir.
not_available I'm not a junkie.
not_available The stuff just finds me, you know? How convenient.
not_available I need another room for Mr.
not_available Hudlin.
not_available He says Exam 3 is full of ectoplasm.
not_available Did you cut yourself shaving? 
not_available What? Never mind.
not_available Lipstick.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Breeland, you need to stay in bed.
not_available Otherwise, we might be tempted to put somebody else in it.
not_available Okay, I think weÂ’re getting there.
not_available Hardly.
not_available Board number two is for the patients in the halls.
not_available We have heat exhaustion, barbecue
not_available smoke inhalation, and boils.
not_available All up for grabs.
not_available I love my job.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Why are you dressed like that if you can't prescribe nothing? The smell of fresh med students in the morning.
not_available What is it about them? They all seem so Gullible? Immature? Vapid? 
not_available I was going to say sweet.
not_available Bee sting in 1 is asking for you.
not_available Have them start the orientation manuals.
not_available I'll be with them soon.
not_available Carter, MVA, two minutes.
not_available But not to hold their breath.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, so there's a trauma coming in.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why don't you take the bee sting in 1, the wrist fracture in 4 and the burning rash in 2? Care to give me a hand? Help me! Why not? Help me! 
not_available Hey! That's just been mopped, damn it! You don't talk if you're having a real seizure.
not_available Remember that for next time.
not_available Come on, man! Think it's always this crazy here? 
not_available Probably.
not_available They need to bring you back to the VA hospital, sir.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Your driver will explain.
not_available You guys suck, you know that? 
not_available Don't bother.
not_available We don't have any beds.
not_available So, what else is new? 
not_available No, I'm serious.
not_available Try Mercy.
not_available They' re refusing patients too.
not_available Then try Rush.
not_available We' re filled.
not_available I've been bounced all over town with this guy.
not_available I'm out of gas and so is he.
not_available If I don't get him into a bed his UTI's turning into urosepsis.
not_available I got to make water! Yo, doc! 
not_available You are one sadistic bitch.
not_available Now give me your middle finger.
not_available I would if I could.
not_available Any emergency meetings get scheduled? Just one, about this spate of ER closures in the area.
not_available I've advised the board that preliminary figures show an increase in our patient load by 34 percent.
not_available Who'd you take to La Scala's? Sorry? Which board member's ass are you kissing? 
not_available Now the ring finger.
not_available Robert, I simply compiled a report.
not_available Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
not_available I'm not kissing ass.
not_available It's not my dominant hand.
not_available In fact, I only agreed to take on your responsibilities out of necessity.
not_available I'll be in my office in two weeks 
not_available and back in the OR in two months.
not_available I hope you are.
not_available Thought about upping your Vicodin? Ibuprofen.
not_available I want to stay clear

not_available That's enough for today.
not_available No, keep going.

not_available All true, I'm afraid.
not_available The one face I missed seeing in Recovery.
not_available I'm so sorry, Robert.
not_available What, about my arm or about not being there? How are you healing? 
not_available Hurts like a son of a bitch.
not_available You? Any sensory function yet? Nope.
not_available It's a motorcycle accident.
not_available I have to go.
not_available I'm sorry.

not_available come down for portables.
not_available You got it.
not_available Hold the CT till we eyeball the patient.
not_available Hey, welcome back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So do you know any of the specifics? Sixteenyear
not_available old girl, motorcycle versus utility pole, no helmet.
not_available Carter's bringing her in.
not_available What's a chick doing on a motorcycle? 
not_available What's anyone doing on a motorcycle? Have the rapid infuser primed and ready, draw her up 100 of fent four of Ativan.
not_available Make sure the airway drugs are out of the box.
not_available It's like you never left.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Vital sign.

not_available Just let me know when they arrive.
not_available if it'd be easier for you.
not_available I could pull the trigger right now if I wanted to.
not_available Because it's all right here.
not_available Welcome back, Elizabeth.
not_available Do you have time for a consult? As it turns out, yes.
not_available What's he have? Belly pain? Only because he swallowed a handful of nitroglycerin.
not_available No sudden moves unless you want me to blow! Milo has right upper quadrant tenderness with rebound.
not_available I'm a human time bomb.
not_available He needs to be cleared before we move him upstairs.
not_available I could go off.
not_available He could get hypotensive.
not_available Are you scared? I'd be scared.
not_available No! Give him two liters of saline 
not_available and monitor him for a few hours.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Gallant hasn't turfed a case to Psych all day.
not_available You wanted the consult.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available We' re to capacity? Every bed, every day since Mission Hospital closed.

not_available Do you have pain anywhere else? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I can't tell.
not_available How about your legs? 
not_available No.
not_available I can't feel them.
not_available Gallant, need a hand here.
not_available We' re talking smithereens here! Have you ever seen smithereens? I'm on Psych rotation.
not_available I really shouldn't be helping you.
not_available Haleh, this is a dead body.
not_available You ought to go to med school.
not_available Can't take her to the morgue yet.
not_available We' re waiting on family.
not_available Why am I not exploding? No movement below the umbilicus.
not_available What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel anything? You might have bruising to your spinal cord.
not_available I need 30 mgs per kilo of methylprednisolone, IV bolus.
not_available Where the hell's Xray? 
not_available Behind you.
not_available Start with the chest.
not_available Please.
not_available I need Ricky.

not_available Wouldn't hold still long enough.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available Full trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis.
not_available He's a regular customer.
not_available Through and through to the right triceps.
not_available You were lucky.
not_available Yeah? You should see the other guys.
not_available No fracture or deformity.
not_available So, what? Just go back and forth shooting each other till all of you are dead? 
not_available An eye for an eye, man.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Meanwhile his girl gets shot.
not_available They got Alma too? 
not_available She was hit in the neck and it's pretty serious.
not_available Where you going, dog? Let me go! Calm down! 
not_available I'm gonna kill those bitches! You already did! Repeat hemogram and update tetanus.
not_available Keep your hand there and don't take it off until you get upstairs.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, when you have a chance? 
not_available Be right there.
not_available Make sure the blood bank sends type
not_available specific straight to the OR.
not_available Have the anesthesiologist call me with any questions.
not_available Are you the one? 
not_available A neurosurgeon will perform it.
not_available He'll talk with you shortly.
not_available I'm sorry? 
not_available Don't let me die.
not_available You' re one coldhearted bitch, you know that? I don't have any damn pity for you, whore! I'm talking to you, pissface! Don't you dare turn your back on me, you stuckup little ass

not_available You still here? Can't leave till my patient gets a bed.
not_available Them's the rules.
not_available Don't sound upset about it.
not_available Up to level 12.
not_available Turn that off, disturbs the patients.
not_available Frank, what'd I miss? 
not_available County HHS needs to talk to you.
not_available Ditto, Human Resources.
not_available Anything from Dr.
not_available Romano? He called half an hour ago, an hour before that.
not_available Somebody from Dr.
not_available Rydell's office called to confirm your appointment
not_available Frank, 2 needs a janitor.
not_available What the hell is this? Why is Stella Willits still on the board? I called to have her admitted to Psych hours ago.
not_available I haven't evaluated her yet.
not_available Save yourself the trouble.
not_available She's nuts.
not_available She's a frequent flyer with a history of bogus medical complaints.
not_available With all due respect, I'd like to determine that myself.
not_available The ER doesn't have time or manpower to deal with hypochondriacs.
not_available That's what you' re for.
not_available Get her off my board.
not_available It's part
not_available I said, get rid of her.
not_available Stubborn.

not_available There are no beds.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver, Chief of Emergency Medicine.
not_available I will give you a brief tour of the ambulance bay, after which our Chief Resident will give you his attention.
not_available Because, as you'll learn, it's his primary responsibility.
not_available Come on.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What was that? Demolition

not_available tender.
not_available Vitals normal, tachy at 120 with a liter in.
not_available Gave him ten of MS.
not_available Don't touch! It hurts! Okay, bear with us.
not_available We'll give you something.
not_available Oh, God! I see a light.
not_available You're not dying.
not_available It's just your ankle.
not_available Oh, God! You're supposed to help me! Watch where you're going! You ran into me! 
not_available Haleh? Where's the trauma? Throw a rock, honey.
not_available Blunt chest in 2.
not_available You look wonderful, by the way.
not_available Eighty
not_available five pounds and counting.
not_available Good for you.
not_available You cut your hair? 
not_available BP's falling, 70 systolic.
not_available Keep squeezing that bag.
not_available Where are we? 
not_available Flail and crepitus.
not_available Needs a tube.
not_available Who has an angio cath? 
not_available Right here.
not_available How can I help? Given there's only one, I don't see how you can.
not_available What is that? What are you doing? 
not_available It's a tube to help him breathe.
not_available He has a collapsed lung, this will re
not_available inflate it.
not_available I need a thoracostomy tray.
not_available All right, let's see how much air he's got in here.
not_available Oh, God! That any better, Mr.
not_available Chambers? Sats 88.
not_available He's not talking anymore.
not_available Why is he not talking? Because he can't.
not_available Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
not_available You need any help? 
not_available Yes.
not_available With his wife.
not_available She's bleeding.
not_available I'm not his wife.
not_available Then you shouldn't be here.
not_available Where's the rapid infuser? 
not_available Got it.
not_available We need that blood.
not_available Let's get her on a monitor.
not_available She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Come with me.
not_available No.
not_available Somebody needs to be with him.
not_available Okay, I'm in.
not_available Hook me up.
not_available Let us take care of him and Dr.
not_available Kovac will take care of you.
not_available Please.
not_available What are you doing down there? Lewis, what are you doing up there? This guy's got no DP pulse.
not_available It's called a trauma assessment.
not_available Lungs clear, chest tones normal.
not_available Got the Doppler.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Sweet Jesus! 
not_available Explains no pulse.
not_available Okay, let's get a CBC, chem seven, dip a urine, chest and pelvis x
not_available rays.
not_available Chen, give me your hands.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Hold tight.
not_available Ken! Have you ever been to Hawaii before? 
not_available Well, pretend that you' re there now.
not_available Pratt, wait! I can't believe you! I feel better.
not_available I feel totally better! I feel totally sick.
not_available Why would you reduce an ankle with no pain meds? No pulse is no blood is dead tissue.
not_available In other words, I just saved your foot.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You' re wonderful.
not_available Subclavian's in.
not_available Is that the film? 
not_available Five hundred cc's are out the chest tube.
not_available He's holding his pressure.
not_available No pneumothorax.
not_available Looks like a widened mediastinum and loss of the AP window.
not_available Hard to tell.
not_available The pulmonary contusion is impressive.
not_available One of us should go with him to CT.
not_available Not unless you' re ready to crack the chest.
not_available Flail chest, pulmonary contusions, and labile hypotension.
not_available Could also be from a splenic fracture.
not_available Carter, I'd like an aortagram.
not_available Better yet, a TEE.
not_available The fact he's still alive argues against aortic injury.
not_available Page me with the result, okay? 
not_available Elizabeth, I think there's more to discuss.
not_available Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon.
not_available The last time I checked, you weren't chief of staff.
not_available Keep me apprised of his condition.
not_available Okay, the last one.
not_available Can I go see him now? No.
not_available We have to make sure you didn't bruise your heart or damage your lungs.
not_available They' re not doing anything.
not_available Probably just waiting to go up to surgery.
not_available I'm sure he's stable.
not_available I told Mr.
not_available Chambers we were 10 minutes late.
not_available It's a trick I use to get him to meetings on time.
not_available You don't call him by his first name? 
not_available He's kind of formal.
not_available How long have you been working for him? Two years.
not_available Six days a week, 10 hours a day.
not_available Probably spend more time with him than his wife does.
not_available They' re really happy though.
not_available I mean, she's lucky to have him.
not_available He's a good man.
not_available Luka no fragments in the x
not_available ray.
not_available Ready to irrigate? Yeah.
not_available Put Polysporin on the wound.
not_available Where'd you get that one? A lowlife stuck me in the back with a switchblade.
not_available An inch to the left and you would have lost a kidney.
not_available Guy that did it to me got snuffed with a sawed
not_available off.
not_available Dude was bite
not_available size.
not_available That's funny? 
not_available Whatever, bitch.
not_available Hey, watch your mouth.
not_available Are you almost done, man? Why? You in a hurry to go to jail? We can check on Alma.
not_available She's probably in Recovery by now.
not_available That means she's okay, then? 
not_available No.
not_available She could wind up paralyzed.
not_available Like, all over or just her legs? 
not_available They' re not sure yet.
not_available Well, better if they just killed her, you know? An hour ago you were ready for revenge.
not_available Yeah, that was personal.
not_available It was about my name, honor.
not_available But paralyzed? That blows.
not_available Just dress the wound with Adaptic.
not_available Hey, Luka.
not_available Piece of work, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And she's pregnant.
not_available Who? 
not_available The girl.
not_available Says it's his baby.
not_available You want to tell him? No.
not_available Do you? Not really.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Michael Gallant from Psychiatry.
not_available Stella Willits from Ohio.
not_available Nice shiner.
not_available I understand you have quite a few medical complaints.
not_available I'll need to ask you a few questions.
not_available Knock yourself out, hon.
not_available Had any recent weight gain? I've been thinking about going on the Zone.
not_available How about dry skin? 
not_available Like the Sahara.
not_available Here.
not_available Give me this.
not_available "Intolerance to cold." Yes.
not_available "Arthritis, sore muscles, constipation." Yes, yes, and yes.
not_available " Fatigue.
not_available " Well, I have been kind of low
not_available energy lately.
not_available You have some delayed relaxation from the deep
not_available tendon reflexes.
not_available What about depression? Me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, I'm glasshalffull, I'm silver
not_available lining girl.
not_available I'm an optimist.
not_available Listen, I'll be back to finish.
not_available I guess I do get a little blue sometimes.
not_available Get this gurney out of the way.
not_available If you haven't talked to anyone, you need to go back to the nurse in Triage.
not_available Your food poisoning in Exam 4's been here for 11 hours
not_available Waiting on a consult.
not_available From the Naked Chef? He ate bad shrimp.
not_available Can I get something for my skin? 
not_available Yeah, sun block.
not_available Can I talk about Stella Willits? 
not_available If you' re admitting her to Psych.
not_available She may have a reason
not_available Just got word on Mr.
not_available Chambers.
not_available Aortic dissection.
not_available I'm taking him up to Surgery now 
not_available unless you have objections.
not_available No.
not_available Would it be possible for us to speak in private first? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Later.
not_available Yeah, but I need I wanted to talk to you about what happened earlier.
not_available Oh, for God's sake! Who left a cadaver in here? Sasha's a bit of a bad penny.
not_available She keeps being moved while they try to locate her family.
not_available I don't mind if you don't mind.
not_available I'm concerned that you might be taking on too much too soon particularly in the area of trauma.
not_available Based on? What I saw earlier.
not_available A pronounced inability to work with others.
not_available A lack of professional respect.
not_available You' re joking, right? Look, it's stressful, no question.
not_available Copping an attitude with me and my staff is not gonna make a trauma go any easier.
not_available Kerry, I saw a dissected aorta.
not_available In fact, it only adds to the intense pressure that we' re all feeling.
not_available Given my position, I didn't think it necessary to seek your approval.
not_available We all have our sensitivities.
not_available Quite frankly, if anyone has an attitude here, it's you.
not_available But we can't let them interfere
not_available No! It's you, with your insistence on being kowtowed to at every bloody opportunity! Oh, my God! Excuse me.
not_available I want some milk, I'm thirsty.
not_available His landlord found him in his apartment crying, hyperventilating.
not_available Apparently, his girlfriend left him.
not_available The term would be " mommy.
not_available " What? 
not_available Mommy.
not_available Well, he appears to be an Aby.
not_available You know, an adult baby? It's a fetish in which the baby is taken care of in every way by a " mommy" or a "daddy.
not_available " You're familiar with this condition? It's not really a condition.
not_available It's more like a form of relaxation.
not_available Are you kidding me? 
not_available No, it says right 
here "Abies like to relinquish control, get away from their stressful lives.
not_available " 
not_available Mr.
not_available Dwyer, what do you do for a living? 
not_available Shoe sales.
not_available A foot fetish too.
not_available This is an issue for the Psych Department.
not_available No offense.
not_available I am not so sure about that.
not_available Mr.
not_available Dwyer, when's the last time someone changed you? This morning.
not_available More than likely, he suffers from a diaper rash, which is a medical ailment to be treated by the ER.
not_available When are you done with this rotation? 
not_available Next week.
not_available Remind me to give you some serious scut work.
not_available "To Dr.
not_available Pratt, thanks from a grateful patient.
not_available Ken, the kiosk man.
not_available " Amazing.
not_available Too bad this guy didn't run a hot
not_available dog stand.
not_available I'm here for allergies.
not_available These things are pushing me over the edge.
not_available Can you get rid of them? Or give them to someone a little more deserving.
not_available Who saved flower boy's foot and moved more patients than anybody today? Me, that's who.
not_available You' re gonna miss me too, because I'm out of here.
not_available Banker's hours, Pratt? 
not_available Only if they work doubles.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available What's up with your boss? Is it true she was crying earlier? Weaver? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bad breakup or something? 
not_available Been pretty moody lately.
not_available Lately? I'm sorry! I think this man needs immediate attention! You gotta help my pops! 
not_available What happened? They came in the ambulance entrance.
not_available I saw he was diaphoretic.
not_available Not asking you.
not_available We were playing ball.
not_available He grabbed his chest.
not_available When did the pain start? 
not_available An hour ago.
not_available Thought it would go away! You have pain anywhere else? Scale of 110, how's your pain? 
not_available Forty.
not_available How you feel? 
not_available Talk to the elephant on my chest.
not_available It could
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You mind? What are your names? 
not_available I'm Pete and he's Derek.
not_available Can you take Pete and Derek to the TV room.
not_available One, Pratt! Okay, here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Is there any way that we can wait in the doctors' lounge? As soon as you' re a doctor.
not_available Tombstones in two, three and F.
not_available Better with the spray under your tongue? No.
not_available What do you mean by "tombstones? " It's a non
not_available medical way of describing the line tracings on an EKG.
not_available It's not good news, Mr.
not_available Royston.
not_available It looks like you' re having a heart attack.
not_available Aspirin? 
not_available Already gave him 80.
not_available Push five of Metoprolol, titrate morphine, start heparin and nitro drips.
not_available Call Cards and cath lab.
not_available What's going on? What's he gonna do? There's a blocked vessel.
not_available We open it with a balloon to stop your attack.
not_available We need your permission.
not_available It's called angioplasty.
not_available Sign for me.
not_available Cath lab will be ready in 30 minutes.
not_available He's a hot MI.
not_available They' re finishing a pacer.
not_available While they' re messing around, he's killing heart cells.
not_available It'll give us time to medicate.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Like I said.
not_available Charge paddles to 200.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Abby, open an intubation tray.
not_available Let's get Cardiology in here! And, clear.
not_available The doctors there will give you antibiotics.
not_available Make sure to get that wound checked in two days.
not_available Right.
not_available So he's good to go? 
not_available Later, I guess.
not_available She's pregnant.
not_available Who? 
not_available Your girlfriend.
not_available I told you, man, she's not my girlfriend! Well, whoever she is to you, she's carrying your baby.
not_available Why don't you care? Why do you? Three
not_available sixty again.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still fib.
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available Is this my consult? 
not_available Acute inferior Ml.
not_available Refractory V
not_available fib despite lidocaine and procainamide.
not_available Want to go TNK? Isn't gonna make it to the cath lab.
not_available I've been pounding on him.
not_available He'll bleed out with thrombolytics.
not_available Who's talking? Pratt, first
not_available year Resident.
not_available Then shut up.
not_available CPR as a contra
not_available indication to thrombolytics has been debunked.
not_available It's a myth.
not_available Forty of Tenecteplase, IV push.
not_available Charging to 360, and clear.
not_available A boatload from Lake Michigan just came with alcohol poisoning.
not_available Kids? 
not_available Worse.
not_available Parents.
not_available The 10year
not_available old was the only one sober enough to dock.
not_available Do you think it's too late to go into Dermatology? Excuse me, doctor? 
not_available Yes? I had a message that said my daughter was in a motorcycle accident.
not_available Her name is Sasha, Sasha Huffner.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll check on her for you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Wait right there.
not_available Susan, did you order a urine tox screen? 
not_available Check my orders.
not_available Elizabeth? This guy with the ringworm, he's
not_available Can you hang on a second? Elizabeth.
not_available And an abdominal CT with contrast and two grams of cefotetan.
not_available Can we talk? I'm on my way to the OR 
not_available with a bowel obstruction, if it can wait.
not_available Sasha Huffner's father's here.
not_available Your first patient, the DOA.
not_available Right, right.
not_available Look, if you want, I can tell him for you.
not_available Why would I want that? You' re on your way to surgery.
not_available It's depressing.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Paul.
not_available He's standing over
not_available I'll find him.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Fine V
not_available fib.
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available How long has it been? Forty
not_available two minutes.
not_available Okay, that's it.
not_available Call it.
not_available You can stop now.
not_available Time of death is 
7 11.
not_available Wife here? 
not_available She's on her way.
not_available You should still wait.
not_available Can't lie to them now.
not_available Want to turn off that monitor? Whoa! He's in V
not_available tach.
not_available What? I can shock that.
not_available They pronounced him.
not_available Yeah, well, now he's got a good rhythm.
not_available Two hundred.
not_available Clear.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Still V
not_available tach.
not_available That's enough, Pratt.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Do it! 
not_available No! He's dead! Three hundred.
not_available Clear.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Sinus tach.
not_available I said, bag him.
not_available We did everything that we could.
not_available We had three doctors working on him for over an hour.
not_available We gave him medicine and we shocked his heart, but it didn't do any good.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because his heart was very, very sick.
not_available And it was too sick to save.
not_available I shouldn't have made him play ball.
not_available I mean, he said he was tired.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available Your dad had a problem nobody knew about.
not_available Not you, not your mom, and not even him.
not_available You gave him the best possible chance he had by getting him to the hospital.
not_available He can't be dead.
not_available I'm sorry, Pete, he is dead.
not_available And it's very sad.
not_available And it's very unexpected.
not_available And it's okay to cry.
not_available It's just a sign of how much you loved your dad.
not_available Do you guys want to see him? You can say goodbye? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available You need to know your dad's gonna have a lot of tubes attached to him.
not_available And it might be a little scary.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Ready? Keep the lidocaine at two milligrams per minute and page the CCU team.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I got him back.
not_available What the hell's going on? BP's 90 palp.
not_available He's back.
not_available He's alive? 
not_available He's not dead.
not_available Daddy's alive! 
not_available Mr.
not_available Huffner? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I'm a surgeon here at County and I was your daughter's physician this morning.
not_available Did you operate on her? Is she all right? I mean, where is she? Can I see her? I'm afraid your daughter died this morning.
not_available She came in essentially DOA with massive internal injuries from a motorcycle accident.
not_available My God.
not_available Someone can take you to see the body.
not_available We've kept it in the department for your benefit.
not_available And afterwards you can make arrangements with the morgue.
not_available A nurse can give you information about grief counseling.
not_available She's my little baby.
not_available Is she gone? I'm sorry.
not_available Nobody walks out of a hospital after 40 minutes of CPR.
not_available There was improvement.
not_available From Vfib to V
not_available tach.
not_available He's either dead or should be dead.
not_available Which means your Resident is cruel, stupid, or both! He saw a shockable rhythm in the setting of thrombolytics.
not_available It could take 30 minutes for TNK to open the coronary artery.
not_available Are you defending this? He made a split
not_available second decision.
not_available He was acting in the interest of his patient.
not_available Well, he was wrong.
not_available And now we have a vegetable with a pulse on our hands.
not_available Well, our names are on the chart, not yours.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt and I will take full responsibility for any negative outcome.
not_available Oh, you bet your ass you will.
not_available Hey, I just want to say thanks for backing me up like that.
not_available A Chief Resident and a cardiologist with more than 25 years of experience pronounce a man dead.
not_available And you decide to resurrect him.
not_available Yes.
not_available But just like you said
not_available Think I defended you because I like you? Or I approve of the way you practice medicine? You are my responsibility.
not_available You are my job.
not_available And I'm doing mine.
not_available If you wanted to shock, you could have paged me.
not_available I could have been here in a second and we could have discussed it.
not_available Instead, you go off! Without regard for authority or the best interest of your patient.
not_available Now, that's not true.
not_available The guy's got kids.
not_available He's got a wife.
not_available I was trying to save him
not_available You brought the man back, Pratt, because you felt like it! Because you wanted to see if you could.
not_available Why's he still sleeping? He didn't get enough oxygen to the brain.
not_available So we have to wait and see if he wakes up.
not_available You know, there's a chance he might not.
not_available Why's that? He's just taking a nap is all.
not_available Pete, your dad's still pretty sick.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But you saved his life.
not_available Hey, you guys hungry? Come on.
not_available Let's go down to the cafeteria.
not_available I'll get you something to eat.
not_available All right? I'll take you where the doctors eat.
not_available My daddy doesn't like doctors, but I bet he'd like you.
not_available You tired? There's gotta be a better word for it.
not_available Enervated, asthenic, atonic? Pooped? 
not_available Bingo.
not_available Does that mean you want to stay home tonight? Not necessarily.
not_available Anything particular come to mind? You keep working that spot, I'll do whatever you want.
not_available You know, I do need my sock drawer organized.
not_available Can you help me? They told me my husband was back here.
not_available He had a heart attack.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Royston? Even though we got his heart beating again the neurologic tests showed that there's a lack of basic brain function.
not_available What that means is that
not_available I know what it means.
not_available How long can he last like this? Indefinitely.
not_available Did your husband leave any instructions? Did he ever express his wishes about what should be done in a situation like this? He's 42 years old.
not_available Then I need to ask you, if his heart stops beating again do you want heroic measures taken to save his life? Or do you want to sign a Do Not Resuscitate order? Is that the right thing to do? I can't make that decision for you.
not_available Is it the right thing to do? Yes.
not_available I want to thank you, Dr.
not_available Gallant.
not_available There's no need, Mrs.
not_available Teasley.
not_available No need.
not_available I just get, I don't know, panicky in public places.
not_available You know, that's why you need to keep taking your Klonopin.
not_available Well, I hope I wasn't too much trouble.
not_available Oh, not at all.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Gallant.
not_available You want to explain why Stella's still here? 
not_available I'm waiting on some lab work.
not_available Who said you could order labs? 
not_available No one.
not_available I thought
not_available You' re here to assess psychiatric problems, not do a medical workup.
not_available I realize that.
not_available I think she is really sick.
not_available You looking for these? What? 
not_available Her TSH level is over a hundred.
not_available Stella? Well, she's hypothyroid, which explains all of her symptoms.
not_available Depression, fatigue
not_available But not the fact that she's a con artist and a hypochondriac.
not_available Until your rotation is over, you are not a member of this ER.
not_available Stop doing our work, start doing the work of your current department.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available But good catch.
not_available You off soon? In a few minutes, yeah.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Discharge Stella before you leave.
not_available I feel like crap.
not_available I'm going home.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We sent the labs out this morning.
not_available She's been here for 24 hours
not_available Something's wrong with my dad! Hey, Pratt! Can you get in here? Mama, what's wrong? Mrs.
not_available Royston, did you sign the DNR? You gotta help my dad.
not_available He's in arrest.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Royston, did you sign the DNR? What's a DNR? It means that your dad is too sick for us to try to help him.
not_available Why can't she? 
not_available Because he's already gone, baby.
not_available No, he's not! No, he's not.
not_available He saved him.
not_available He said he was gonna be okay.
not_available Derek, we tried.
not_available Why are you letting him die? 
not_available Baby, please You gotta help.
not_available Mama, tell them to do something, please.
not_available Why are you doing this? Asystole.
not_available Why? Daddy? Rominger's not an appy.
not_available Twenty
not_available five, male, periumbilical to the lower right quadrant.
not_available He's a poster boy.
not_available You can bring him back in 12 hours.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Lewis asked that you take a look at the cholecystitis.
not_available Page the next shift.
not_available Do you want to take a call from Neuro? 
not_available If it's urgent.
not_available You forgot to sign off.
not_available So how are you feeling? It's about the GSW you handled earlier.
not_available Alma Salazar.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You wanted to know her status.
not_available What is it? You gonna tell me? She's a quad.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Oh.
not_available You' re not gonna wake him up? 
not_available No.
not_available Didn't you two come in together? Yeah.
not_available I'm sure he can find his way home without me.
not_available You need a lift then? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Oh, man! I don't know.
not_available This is the craziest movie! Hey, yo.
not_available What's all this? Payper
not_available view.
not_available Want some pizza?

not_available If I gotta come there, I'm gonna smack fire at you.
not_available Come here, man! Let me talk to you for a minute.
not_available Come on, man! Hurry up! Come here, man.
not_available What's your problem? I thought I told you, man, don't come here again! Stay away from him! You understand that? Yo, I'm saying, now you his mama, yo? What? Yo, man, chill out! You hear what I'm saying? 
not_available Why you tripping? Don't play with me, man.
not_available All right, that's it! The party's over! Everybody out! Come on, man, get up! You, too, get up! All y'all! Get up and get out! Yo, my man, are you stupid? 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available What you doing, G? Get out.
not_available Close the door behind you.
not_available What's wrong, G? Yo, I'll holler at y'all later? All right.
not_available Those are my friends, G! 
not_available Yeah? Well, this is my house.
not_available It's mine too.
not_available Oh, yeah? Oh, what? You pay rent? Come on.
not_available Watch out, man.
not_available No.
not_available Does that mean I can't have no friends? Just be quiet.
not_available I'm tired.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You tired, all right.
not_available Grouchy too.
not_available You know those guys are just using you, right? Yo, dog.
not_available How they blow up a whole town like that without killing anybody? They don't.
not_available And if you shot the gun that close, he'd blow his eardrums out too.
not_available Yo, G.
not_available It's just a movie, man.
not_available You ain't got to take it so seriously.
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available But she's hot, though.
not_available Most definitely.
not_available You right about that, G.
not_available Yo, you still want some pizza? Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
not_available How long have I been in there? 
not_available Since before my shift started.
not_available Is Abby here? Nope.
not_available But she left you a Post
not_available it.
not_available And you still have a med student waiting for you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available The day just kind of got away from me.
not_available Why don't we try again tomorrow? 
not_available No.
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available No.
not_available I have been here for 16 hours.
not_available I have been ignored and yelled at, and called " honey, " and "sweetie, " and " bitch" twice.
not_available I don't smell good.
not_available And all I've had to eat is gummi bears and Diet Coke.
not_available I'm not leaving until I get what I came for.
not_available This is the Admit area.
not_available This is the center of the ER universe, where you pick up your patients' charts order labs, spend the bulk of your life for the next three months.
not_available How do you know who's next? 
not_available You check that chart rack.
not_available We see people in the order they arrive unless the nurse feels they' re of high acuity.
not_available Then they' re moved ahead.
not_available Do you get to suture? If you' re supervised by an Attending
