Previously on ER I've been having a problem with Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Why didn't Genetics suggest this medication? It's brand
not_available new, part of a clinical trial.
not_available Do I need to fill any of this out? I wouldn't.
not_available He's not a candidate for the study.
not_available Breaking research protocol could damage funding.
not_available So you agree with them? 
not_available I see their point.
not_available Doug, don't walk away.
not_available Doug? Jerry, have you seen Doug? He dropped off some charts.
not_available He went up top for coffee.
not_available "Up top"? 
not_available As in keep your coat on.
not_available I missed you this morning.
not_available I tried not to wake you.
not_available One of us should get more than four hours of sleep.
not_available I love you.
not_available You know that? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Doug, what's going on? You all right? I'm not going to jump if that's what your afraid of.
not_available That's good.
not_available I'm attached here, so you'll take me too.
not_available All this just about helping a kid.
not_available All what? 
not_available You and me getting into it.
not_available Hey, it's over and done.
not_available It's not over for Mark and IKerry.
not_available Now, you don't know that.
not_available They don't want to make a big deal out of this.
not_available They have to do something.
not_available Why? To prove they never wanted a Pediatric Attending in the first place.
not_available Doug.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available No.
not_available You put the patient first.
not_available And that's what we're supposed to do, isn't it? You're good to me.
not_available You know that? Yeah, I know that.
not_available Largely, it's been innuendo.
not_available The slightly inappropriate phrase at the slightly inappropriate moment.
not_available You might not consider it sexual harassment.
not_available If you could give me some specifics.
not_available The more ridiculous one was when he spoke of "sniffing my tail pipe." Excuse me? 
not_available Well, I'd just parked.
not_available And he said words to the effect that had he known it was my car he would have "sniffed my tail pipe." When I asked him what he was talking about he said, "Oh, I thought we were talking about sex." But you weren't? No, of course not.
not_available I was coming in to do a gastroplasty.
not_available Did he ever give you any reason for terminating your fellowship? I was led to believe that he didn't have to give me a reason.
not_available But he didn't sponsor anyone else and funding didn't stop? No.
not_available Why do you think he did it? Well, I suppose he could've been punishing me.
not_available We went out to lunch once.
not_available He laid his heart on his sleeve, said he found me attractive and asked if we might go out together on a date.
not_available And how long after that did the fellowship end? A matter of weeks.
not_available We don't know for sure if the two are related, do we? 
not_available That will be for others to decide.
not_available What others? If a full investigation goes forward.
not_available How will that be determined? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I ordered up a high
not_available cholesterol breakfast.
not_available Three eggs, pigs in a blanket.
not_available May I join you? 
not_available Unfortunately, we just finished.
not_available Drains to pull, that sort of thing.
not_available Well, then I guess I'll have to administer CPR on myself.
not_available Doctors.
not_available I've been sitting for three days.
not_available I'd rather walk.
not_available I'd rather you sit.
not_available We're going in here.
not_available Carol, I got us a customer.
not_available S.O.B.
not_available With a cough.
not_available Who're you calling a son of a bitch? 
not_available No, it means "shortness of breath." Okay.
not_available Let's get you seated on the gurney, and take off this coat.
not_available No, it's cold in here.
not_available We promise to return your coat 
not_available Just give me some medicine.
not_available You need to help us Oh, Sparky.
not_available Get back up here.
not_available Animals aren't allowed.
not_available Give me some medicine and I'll get out of your way.
not_available Why don't you let Malik take care of Sparky while I examine you, okay? Are you a dog person? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Any fever? 
not_available Hey, Sparky.
not_available Coughing up yellow or green sputum? 
not_available No.
not_available All right.
not_available This might be a little cold.
not_available I hear a few crackles.
not_available I'd like a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Make sure you don't have pneumonia.
not_available Alice, you're a smoker? 
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available Breaks up the boredom on the road.
not_available I drove from Albuquerque.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available If I'd known it was this cold, I'd have gone straight to Miami.
not_available How much is this x
not_available ray? I don't have insurance or money.
not_available Alice, we're a county hospital.
not_available If you can't pay, it's subsidized.
not_available Do you have any family in Chicago you'd like us to call? Don't know a soul in Chicago.
not_available You stay here, keep an eye on Sparky, and Malik and I will be right back.
not_available I'll order a portable x
not_available ray.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Radiology won't want to deal with Sparky.
not_available Carol, Medical Records just sent these charts up for review.
not_available We sent them last week.
not_available Then why'd they come back? Just like they said, for review by the Interim Chief.
not_available That's you again, right? Thank you for straightening that out, Malik.
not_available No problem.
not_available Richard Tuggle, 35.
not_available Complains of 20 minutes of heavy chest pain with nausea and diaphoresis.
not_available Felt okay this morning.
not_available Coming through! 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'll come back later.
not_available No problem.
not_available BP's 140/88.
not_available Pulse 90.
not_available Chest pain was relieved by two sprays of nitro.
not_available CBC, Chem
not_available 20, cardiac enzymes.
not_available Here, help him out of that.
not_available Have you had pain like this before? 
not_available Never.
not_available Any history of heart disease? 
not_available No.
not_available High blood pressure? Diabetes? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm really healthy.
not_available When you're free, Doug's waiting.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Pulse ox is 99 on two liters.
not_available You weren't out shoveling snow? 
not_available No.
not_available I work at home.
not_available Telemarketer.
not_available So, what is it? Did I have a heart attack? Well, you're a little young for that.
not_available We'll do some blood work and monitor your heart.
not_available We'll figure it out.
not_available I hear an ejection murmur.
not_available I hope not.
not_available Carter? What are you doing? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available Meet Dudzik, Hilzig and Strauss.
not_available Second
not_available years.
not_available Patient/doctor class.
not_available Need something? I was hoping you could give me some time.
not_available But Never mind.
not_available Where's your student? Miss IKnight? 
not_available Surgery rotation.
not_available Right.
not_available Never mind.
not_available You don't want coffee? No, I'm not having any trouble staying awake.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's the verdict? No big verdict.
not_available We agreed to keep this quiet so that we don't jeopardize hospital funding.
not_available But Mark and I want some assurance this won't happen again.
not_available So anytime you want to prescribe schedule
not_available two 
narcotics Morphine, Demerol, Dilaudid, Fentanyl, we want to cosign the order.
not_available That's it? 
not_available That's it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, if it'll settle things down, I'll agree to do it.
not_available Believe me or not, I don't have some compulsion for breaking the rules.
not_available Sometimes they get in the way of helping a patient.
not_available If you'd seen the pain this kid was in, you would've done the same thing.
not_available Doug, we have seen that kind of pain.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, Carol needs you in Curtain 3.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available His contractures have been so severe.
not_available Worse than anything with Michael.
not_available His seizures have increased.
not_available Joi, come sit.
not_available Dr.
not_available Julian wants to admit him.
not_available But I just can't do that.
not_available Roger Julian? 
not_available He's a doctor up in Genetics.
not_available I know him.
not_available Joi spoke to him this morning.
not_available Michael, my oldest, was in the ICU his whole last week hooked up to all those tubes.
not_available I know Ricky doesn't have much time.
not_available But I just can't do that to him.
not_available Can we keep Ricky here? 
not_available Please, I just want to take him home.
not_available I'm gonna talk to Roger.
not_available But I think we should arrange for PCA Patient
not_available Controlled Analgesia.
not_available We would hook Ricky up to an IV that would deliver pain medication at home.
not_available Now, obviously, you'll have to control it.
not_available Will it be stronger medicine than what you gave me before? Dilaudid or Fentanyl.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll do whatever it takes, Dr.
not_available Ross, just so I can keep him at home.
not_available I know he probably won't know the difference, but you know.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We'll let you know as soon as we can set it up.
not_available Okay? All right.
not_available I'll go find Roger.
not_available You set up an IV.
not_available All right? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Getting near the end.
not_available If the survival rate's the same why not do a lumpectomy and save the breast? Because with a modified radical mastectomy you can save the patient.
not_available Although a lumpectomy can get around the tumor.
not_available And then you do radiation therapy.
not_available And there can be severe side effects.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There can be with removing a breast.
not_available I'm not discounting the psychological impact.
not_available Actually, I think you are just a bit.
not_available You'll see most male surgeons find it relatively easy to lop off a breast.
not_available That's clich Á, don't you think? Yeah, because it's true.
not_available It's a personal decision this woman must make.
not_available She's gonna worry about her sexuality, her self
not_available image.
not_available Listen, a patient comes in here with cancer, I say we cut it out.
not_available See? You think of her in terms of being a patient, not as a woman.
not_available You know what? It's not that complicated.
not_available Let's forget it.
not_available You don't want it to be complicated.
not_available Just cut to the chase, so to speak.
not_available Well, isn't this a scrub fest? Mind if I borrow your intern? I gotta do an appy.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available I've only got a biopsy.
not_available Lucy, you're with me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Appreciate it.
not_available You need my assistance on an appendectomy? Of course not, but I'd love the company.
not_available How was breakfast? It was coffee, actually.
not_available Women never seem to eat breakfast anymore.
not_available Now it's just coffee or maybe a muffin.
not_available Why? Are they worried about their weight, a reputation for eating like a horse.
not_available I really couldn't say.
not_available Can you say what people are talking about with IKerry Weaver over coffee? You can stop playing games, Robert.
not_available I know what's going on.
not_available I know someone's accused you.
not_available Falsely.
not_available But if IKerry digs and decides she's determined to dig up something you know, that's how people get hurt.
not_available Well, that's true.
not_available I mean, for instance, what if it came out that you were sleeping with Peter Benton while you were his intern and he was your supervisor in a position to evaluate you which, I'm sure you're aware, is a very big no
not_available no.
not_available Come on.
not_available Peter and I were together before I was his intern.
not_available And you made Anspaugh aware of that, right? That's grounds for dismissal.
not_available Not for you, of course.
not_available But for Peter, Dr.
not_available Benton, which would be a shame considering how much work he's put into getting where he is.
not_available You wouldn't dare.
not_available Well, I wouldn't like myself very much if I did that, would I? Anyway, it's not really in my hands, is it? The films are back on Alice Presley.
not_available She's antsy to go.
not_available I said I'd find meat for Sparky.
not_available Thanks, Malik.
not_available Hey, Steve.
not_available Nurse Hathaway, always a pleasure.
not_available I've kept these up so you can see for yourself.
not_available As you can see for yourself, there is no evidence of pneumonia.
not_available There's a raise in bronchovesicular markings which may be smoking induced.
not_available Although, it's more likely she simply has the flu.
not_available Not unlike half the techs in our department.
not_available What we have here is essentially a normal chest film.
not_available I'd like a V/Q scan.
not_available What makes you think she has a PE? She's a smoker, hypoxic, and been driving for 18 hours putting her at risk for blood clots.
not_available What's her heart rate? 
not_available 85.
not_available Respiratory rate? 
not_available 20.
not_available Any calf tenderness? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Nothing you've said suggests pulmonary embolism.
not_available She has pleuritic chest pain.
not_available So does everyone with bronchitis.
not_available Look, I know there isn't any hard evidence.
not_available It's just a feeling I have.
not_available Unfortunately, I cannot authorize an $800 test based on intuition.
not_available The patient has a cough and no insurance, I might add.
not_available So that's what this is about? Payment? No.
not_available Although, the hospital does like to cover its expenses.
not_available I'll pay for it.
not_available Your checkbook is my command.
not_available Thanks, Steve.
not_available One V/Q scan coming up.
not_available We got a couple more hackers.
not_available I'll stick them into Exam 2.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's not ready yet.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Your patient left.
not_available Alice Presley? Is she nuts? She talked about walking her Sparky.
not_available Oh, God! I promised Anspaugh I'd review charts for him.
not_available Am I a sucker or what? Hey, you don't have to agree with me.
not_available Hey, you okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's slippery.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Good luck, Mark.
not_available How's he doing? Pain
not_available free, normal sinus, no ectopy.
not_available Which is all good, right? Yes, but I got some of your blood work back.
not_available And I'm concerned because your cholesterol is 465.
not_available That doesn't sound good.
not_available It's not.
not_available Do you have a family history of high cholesterol? Did your father or any male relative have heart trouble in their 30s? I don't know.
not_available Some inherited conditions run in families and can cause high lipid levels.
not_available So you might want to check because they can put you at risk for a heart attack at an early age.
not_available I can't check.
not_available I was adopted.
not_available I haven't a clue about any medical history.
not_available I'd like to admit you so we can start you on a cholesterol
not_available Iowering agent and do a complete workup.
not_available Alice! Wait! Wait! You need to stay for one more test.
not_available I really can't.
not_available Miami calls.
not_available You don't want to get stuck on the road sick.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available I can't leave the pups in the cold.
not_available You can bring Sparky in.
not_available I won't tell.
not_available No, you really don't understand.
not_available It's not just Sparky.
not_available I didn't start out to collect them or anything.
not_available It just happened.
not_available Jules, we did our Residencies together.
not_available The old school tie won't work.
not_available I hated my Residency.
not_available There you go.
not_available So did I.
not_available Ricky can't control his analgesia, but the mother's willing to.
not_available Up in Genetics we prefer to admit these end
not_available stage kids.
not_available We're not experienced in home care.
not_available We do it with cancer kids.
not_available They send them home.
not_available Maybe Oncology can help you.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available This kid's in bad shape, he needs it.
not_available Doug, look 
not_available Jules, come on.
not_available I'll talk to the team about it.
not_available We meet the day after tomorrow.
not_available Ricky doesn't have until then.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Ouch.
not_available You're poking too hard.
not_available Strauss, stop your whining.
not_available These are the anterior chains and these are the posterior.
not_available As you examine, ask 
yourself "Do the nodes feel like BB's, like peas or sourballs?" 
not_available I got two BB's.
not_available I got one BB and one sourball.
not_available Quit goofing.
not_available It doesn't feel like a BB.
not_available It's not a pea.
not_available It can be tough to estimate the size at first.
not_available BB and a pea, right? You had any night sweats? Any weight loss? Jeez, what is this? Have you? 
not_available No, I feel fine.
not_available Noticed enlarged nodes elsewhere? 
not_available You're kidding, right? No.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
not_available I might get another doctor to look.
not_available Maybe do a biopsy.
not_available A biopsy? I'm Mark Greene.
not_available I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
not_available Mobalage.
not_available Mobalage Ekabo.
not_available You've done something to your back.
not_available Let me take a look.
not_available No, it's been like this for a long time.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available It might be a slipped disc.
not_available Let me take a look.
not_available Come on.
not_available It won't take long.
not_available Sit down right here.
not_available Did you start here recently? It's been several months.
not_available Really? I haven't seen you around much.
not_available I worked on other floors.
not_available Well, glad to have you down here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I closed the curtain for privacy.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can take your shirt off now.
not_available No, please.
not_available Stop, please.
not_available Stop it, please.
not_available No.
not_available Stop! 
not_available I'm not doing anything.
not_available Stop it now! Stop it! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Stop it! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Stop it! All right?! Malik, need help? No, I'm cool.
not_available I'm just going in here.
not_available How'd you do? It's all good.
not_available I hope they like Cheese Sliders.
not_available We ain't breaking the rules? 
not_available No.
not_available Sneaking dogs in and feeding them cheeseburgers Did you say cheeseburgers? That's their favorite.
not_available Shut the door! Please don't ask.
not_available I need to talk to you outside.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Malik, you okay in here? Oh, he's doing great.
not_available The pups love him.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available And after they eat, that's usually when they need to go outside.
not_available Make a little poop.
not_available Genetics bailed.
not_available We can't get a PCA for a couple of days.
not_available Maybe I can arrange it through the clinic, call a home health care agency.
not_available Jerry, did you find out about that guy Mobalage? No.
not_available Housekeeping hasn't called back yet.
not_available What happened? He flipped out.
not_available I hadn't started the exam.
not_available You know, Rachel called.
not_available She said she's going with the purple frames.
not_available Poor Rachel.
not_available She found out that she needs glasses.
not_available She couldn't see the blackboard.
not_available I hated when that happened.
not_available I felt like such an 8year
not_available old geek.
not_available It happened to me at 9.
not_available Same age as Rachel.
not_available Fiercely bad eyesight on my side of the family.
not_available You must've had fiercely red hair on your side.
not_available Yep.
not_available I hope that's the worst thing I pass on from my gene pool.
not_available It's not like she'll go bald Jerry, weren't you gonna check those labs for Mrs.
not_available Bolpec? Yes, I was.
not_available I am.
not_available You owe her, Jerry.
not_available Where's Carter? Suture.
not_available ER.
not_available Malik, where are you? I'll help you in a few minutes.
not_available I got it.
not_available On my second call.
not_available One of the agencies I used with PCA on a cancer patient a few months ago.
not_available Joi's health insurance will cover it.
not_available Did you tell her about it? No, I think you should.
not_available Joi, looks like we're able to provide that pain medication we talked about.
not_available Now? Today? A home health care agency will deliver the machine to your house.
not_available The machine will be set to deliver an amount of Dilaudid every hour.
not_available When do I push the button? 
not_available Whenever you feel he's in pain.
not_available How do I know how much to give? 
not_available You won't have to worry.
not_available There's only one booster dose within a two
not_available hour period.
not_available Then the machine will automatically lock out any additional dose.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross will write a prescription.
not_available A medi
not_available van will take you home.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you both so much.
not_available I just wish we could do more.
not_available It started snowing again! 
not_available Yeah, about an hour ago.
not_available Listen, IKerry, I've been thinking.
not_available I don't feel comfortable with what I told you.
not_available None of us are at ease with the situation.
not_available What I mean to say is, I don't feel there was any harassment involved.
not_available That's not our decision.
not_available When the full committee hears the testimony I won't be testifying.
not_available If I'm not convinced, then I shouldn't put it forth into an official record.
not_available Did something happen today? No.
not_available There's just no relevance to the incidents I mentioned.
not_available That being the case, I think it's only right that I withdraw my statement.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Sorry that I wasted your time.
not_available I hope you understand.
not_available Ready to go in here? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Labs are all okay.
not_available Upon physical exam, no significant findings in the head or neck other than the enlarged node in the right submaxillary area.
not_available You want to do the honors, Carter? I've actually never done a neck biopsy.
not_available Okay, well, here's your chance.
not_available You ready there, Mr.
not_available Strauss? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available So this V/Q thing was positive? Yes.
not_available Which means that small blood clots have traveled from your legs.
not_available If this isn't treated, a larger blood clot could lodge in your lung.
not_available That sounds bad.
not_available I'll have to get myself back soon to get that treated.
not_available Alice, you need to be admitted today.
not_available You need to stay for a few days so your blood can be anticoagulated.
not_available My dogs.
not_available I can't I don't know what we're gonna do, but we'll think of something.
not_available Jerry! Damn it, Jerry! Go! Go! Go get them, Jerry! 
not_available You gotta get them.
not_available Oh, God! Hey, Mark? Ricky Abbott, the kid with ALD.
not_available He's back and in pretty bad shape.
not_available I arranged a home PCA.
not_available I need you to sign off on the Dilaudid.
not_available He's a Genetics patient, right? 
not_available He's down here now.
not_available I can't sign off on that.
not_available He's not on our service.
not_available I thought it'd be easier.
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available But that's their deal.
not_available You'll have to have Genetics sign off on it.
not_available I should have thought of that in the first place, huh? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, did you have a breakout? Yeah, something like that.
not_available Hey, you're on.
not_available All set.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available I'll give it to her after I get rid of this guy.
not_available Jerry? 
not_available Sorry, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Hi.
not_available I was looking for you.
not_available I am very sorry.
not_available I can pay for the curtain.
not_available I don't care about the curtain.
not_available Are you okay? I won't cause any trouble, and I'd like to keep my job.
not_available You didn't cause any trouble, and no one's gonna take your job.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available I do think that you have a pain in your back.
not_available I'd like to help you if I can.
not_available I think my back is fine.
not_available But there's something.
not_available I'm hoping you can give it to me.
not_available What's that? 
not_available I believe it's called Viagra.
not_available That's medication used for impotence.
not_available I am impotent.
not_available IKerry? 
not_available Robert.
not_available May I sit down? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available I'd offer you something, but we don't have Did you speak with Dr.
not_available Corday today? She assisted me on an appy.
not_available Is that when you spoke to her about Maggie Doyle's harassment inquiry? Why would I do that? 
not_available To stop it from going forward.
not_available I'm eager for it to go ahead.
not_available I look forward to being vindicated.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, then you're gonna be disappointed because the investigation's been closed.
not_available Really? We'll have to go back to our humdrum lives then, won't we? Of course, all the testimony has been typed up.
not_available I've got it in a file.
not_available And the thing that really sticks out is that bad evaluation you gave Dr.
not_available Doyle.
not_available She's received such positive remarks on her other rotations.
not_available You think that perhaps I was a little bit hasty and that if I spent a little more time on it Yes.
not_available I'm thinking that if you took that time right now you might write something very different.
not_available Which you'd be interested in reading.
not_available Oh, absolutely.
not_available I imagine I'd want to put it in that file.
not_available So, Mobalage, where are you from? Nigeria.
not_available That's a ways away from here.
not_available How do you like Chicago? Okay.
not_available My wife does not like the cold.
not_available She works here in the cafeteria.
not_available Well, that must be nice for both of you.
not_available Watch my finger.
not_available To come to the same place for work.
not_available We need to pull the gown down now.
not_available All right? The burns seem to be well
not_available healed.
not_available Yes.
not_available They're not a problem.
not_available Had them for a while? You want to tell me how it happened? 
not_available No.
not_available I need to examine below the waist now.
not_available I understand.
not_available You're in early.
not_available I have no life.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, Sam Broder called back.
not_available He'll meet you at Doc Magoo's.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That sounds like a life.
not_available Hot date? At Doc Magoo's? 
not_available Even Dr.
not_available Weaver has standards.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available I think.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Path report's back on that med student, Strauss.
not_available Better let him know.
not_available Sent that kid up to the O.R.
not_available Hey, you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wanted to fill you in on something.
not_available Let's go in the lounge.
not_available Sure.
not_available I need to talk to you about the pathology report.
not_available You guys mind hanging outside? 
not_available No, they can stay.
not_available I already know it's crappy news.
not_available The biopsy shows Hodgkin's disease, which is a form of lymphoma.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Understand that it's very treatable with radiation therapy.
not_available Your chance of surviving is very high.
not_available Look, could I just? Could I have a few minutes here, please? Yeah.
not_available I'll check back.
not_available I contacted a pet rescue group that can take the dogs tomorrow.
not_available I need you to take two home tonight.
not_available I can't do that, Carol.
not_available I have cats.
not_available You have cats? Yeah, what's wrong with cats? Sorry, Carol.
not_available Well, I'm a dog person.
not_available I'll take two and one of Jerry's.
not_available I want the little one.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Sparky is my man.
not_available Hey, Sparky! I'll take two of the big ones.
not_available AI's sick of little dogs.
not_available What's up with that? I'll take the Airedale if no one wants him.
not_available Joi Abbott's on the phone for you.
not_available Work it out amongst yourselves.
not_available Give me two, any two.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Tie their leashes to my locker.
not_available Hey, Sparky.
not_available Thank you, guys.
not_available Hi, Joi.
not_available It's Carol Hathaway.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Joi, what's wrong? Did they hook it up? Can you tell if it's working properly? Joi? Joi.
not_available You need to calm down and just take your time, all right? Just take your time.
not_available The initial lab tests don't reveal anything like diabetes which may be related to erectile dysfunction.
not_available I understand.
not_available You're not on any medications that have that side effect? No.
not_available If it was psychological, you could still have a spontaneous early
not_available morning or midsleep erection.
not_available No.
not_available I do not.
not_available I think it's caused by trauma.
not_available If you were in an accident or maybe even beaten If your pelvis had been broken internal bleeding could have compressed the arteries and veins affecting the blood supply to and from the penis.
not_available If that is the case? A urologist would probably want to do a vascular bypass operation to try to restore normal function.
not_available I think you should see a urologist.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Romano? 
not_available I last saw him in the lounge.
not_available Was it you? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available There were a couple of names I gave Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available One didn't have anything concrete and the other backed out.
not_available Was that you, Elizabeth? Did you decide to protect your own place in the food chain? Stay in the club? Yes, I did.
not_available I'm sorry, Maggie.
not_available Sorry my ass.
not_available Then they hooked it up wrong.
not_available It's hooked up right.
not_available She doesn't know whether to give him a shot or not.
not_available Lf she thinks he needs it.
not_available She can't tell.
not_available If in doubt, she should give it to him.
not_available It's not gonna matter that much.
not_available I don't think he'll make it through the night.
not_available I told her we'd go over.
not_available Why? She knows how to work the machine.
not_available What are we gonna do? She's all alone, Doug.
not_available She's really scared.
not_available I don't know what good it'll do for us to be there watching her son die.
not_available I know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It probably won't do any good.
not_available I just I really want to be there.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll probably be home pretty late.
not_available Mobalage, they told me you were here.
not_available I didn't know what was wrong.
not_available IKobe, this is Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, this is my wife, IKobe.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available How do you do? I strained my back and Dr.
not_available Greene was kind enough to take a look at it and give me some pain medication.
not_available Yeah, it'll be better in a couple of days.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sometimes he tries to do too much at his job.
not_available He works too hard.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Thank you again.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available You're the only man sitting alone.
not_available I'm hoping you're Sam Broder, right? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Call me IKerry.
not_available My office says you've made a few appointments and always canceled them at the last minute.
not_available You'd think I was the dentist.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That's all right.
not_available It's pretty common.
not_available Deciding to track down your birth parents isn't something to do lightly.
not_available I've done that whole Internet thing.
not_available Most people start there.
not_available I do this for a living.
not_available My company handled several hundred cases last year.
not_available Sounds like a good living.
not_available I need your full name, date of birth, place of birth and the names of your adoptive parents.
not_available I'm glad you could step in on such short notice.
not_available I'm always happy to get a 16year
not_available old up get him back out there kissing the girls, making them cry.
not_available So how's this Interim Chief thing working out? Oh, miserably.
not_available Between my surgical duties and all the administrative crap down there It's a shame IKerry Weaver wasn't able to continue.
not_available Plus, you're Chief of Staff.
not_available I tackle that part of my job around midnight.
not_available Didn't it work out well when Morgenstern handled surgery in the ER? He did have it down.
not_available Well, Donald, I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't offer up my services.
not_available To be Interim Chief of the ER? "Acting Chief" has a bit more je ne sais quois.
not_available I don't care if you call yourself God if you're willing to take that on.
not_available We'd still be conducting a search.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, as long as you need me.
not_available I needed you today.
not_available Well, how does tomorrow sound? 
not_available Like a stroke of luck.
not_available Sorry it's only instant.
not_available I used to grind the beans.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Anything is fine.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
