not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available I never wanted to be around this type of suffering.
not_available I mean, who would? 
not_available I'm glad I came here.

not_available I've been evaluated by the committee.
not_available And you know what? I'm in the clear.
not_available You better start showing me some respect.
not_available Getting any sleep? Bobby, I'm not doing this.
not_available What time are you going home tonight? I haven't been getting any sleep lately.
not_available And the thing is that I've been really, really needing some.
not_available I wish I didn't feel how I feel.
not_available You're the best friend I've ever had.
not_available I am a soldier, remember?

not_available I just called the CASH.
not_available They're sending a chopper.
not_available That's not gonna work.
not_available How far are we from the aid station? FOB Eagle is only about four kilometers due north.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available On my count, we'll lift him up onto the truck.
not_available Keep pressure on his neck.
not_available Shouldn't we wait for the chopper? He'll bleed out before they get here.
not_available Let's go! One, two, three.
not_available I don't even think he's breathing.
not_available Just keep holding pressure.
not_available You're doing good.
not_available His pupils are fixed and dilated, sir.
not_available We can stop.
not_available Thanks for trying, sir.
not_available He just got engaged.
not_available You got a girl back home, captain? Me? Yeah.
not_available I'm married.
not_available My wife, Neela, is a doctor
not_available Oh, my Oh, yes.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mothers eat their own young in the wild and we think it's part of nature, right? But when women kill their children, it's a crime, and we think they're crazy.
not_available What? It just makes you wonder, right? Are the lions crazy too? Or are women like Susan Smith and Andrea Yates just acting upon some primitive impulse that's deep within our genetic maternal makeup? Am I interrupting something? 
not_available Just some girl talk.
not_available Dennis Young, 34, assault victim.
not_available Blunt trauma to head and face.
not_available Was he mugged? Looked like a home
not_available invasion thing.
not_available They tuned him up good.

not_available I swear.
not_available She invited me in for a drink.
not_available Door wasn't closed she was tearing my clothes off.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available To quote my man Rick James, "The girl is a super freak." Had sex toys I've never seen before.
not_available Must have been German or something.
not_available One took two hands to operate.
not_available Morris.
not_available Check it out.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I tapped that.
not_available What exactly am I looking at? 
not_available It's Albright.
not_available Where? 
not_available Right there.
not_available I've seen more convincing photos of Bigfoot.
not_available But it was dark, I couldn't use the flash.
not_available Any chance he'll talk to us? 
not_available Don't think so.
not_available Enlighten me, ladies.
not_available Open skull and facial fractures.
not_available And we got nothing to go on.
not_available Nobody saw anything.
not_available Glascow coma scale? Spontaneous eye opening.

not_available For a total of? 
not_available Twelve.
not_available And we intubate at? 
not_available GCS of nine.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Any blood in the belly? We were focusing on the primary survey.
not_available If I wanted excuses, I'd ask you directly.
not_available Give me the SonoSite.
not_available Any idea why CT scan on your trampoline guy, Margolis 
not_available never got to the O.R.?.
not_available I'll have a tech run them up.
not_available Dubenko wants you to bring them up.
not_available Hang a gram of Vancomycin.
not_available Is this about the oral contrast? 
not_available No idea.
not_available It increases the risk of anesthesia.
not_available If you want my opinion, I'd find those results and haul my ass up there.
not_available After we stabilize the patient.
not_available No.
not_available Now.
not_available We got this.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Belly's clear.
not_available Call me after the scan, Mo.
not_available And have Neurosurg and Head and Neck take a look.
not_available Did she just call you Mo? It's a nickname for Morris.
not_available Or homo.
not_available Hey, don't worry, okay? That little vixen's getting punished tonight.
not_available Oh, yeah, she's in store for a 
little MoMo
not_available Morris.

not_available Thanks.
not_available Glad to see you survived.
not_available How was it? Well, hot, sweaty, fly
not_available infested.
not_available It was a little overwhelming, to be honest.
not_available Did you save a lot of lives? 
not_available I tried.
not_available Threeyear
not_available old Eddie, good pulses.
not_available BP, 100/50.
not_available Decided to stop breathing as we pulled in.
not_available Can you open your eyes, Eddie? He's posturing.
not_available He was awake on the scene, but now this is all we can get.

not_available Pratt.
not_available I wanna stay with Eddie.
not_available He's scared when I'm not with him.
not_available Don't worry, we'll have you in the room right next to him.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Damn it, the IV blew.
not_available Tube.
not_available Who did this? It must have been the same guys who busted up the pops.
not_available Looks like the work of meth heads.
not_available What's this kid's story? Threeyear
not_available old, hypertensive and bradycardic.
not_available Looks like traumatic head injury.
not_available Okay, I'm in.
not_available Bag him at a rate of 40.

not_available Okay, throw me an IO needle.
not_available You don't wanna do that.
not_available Trust me.

not_available Go ahead.
not_available Grab a cup.
not_available Okay, look.

not_available I need you to be on the ball.
not_available Vic, I'm serious.
not_available Yeah, I'm serious too.

not_available Because if you don't wanna work with me, that's fine.
not_available I don't need you.
not_available Vic.
not_available Vic
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available What, Frank? These gentlemen are looking for Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available One of them is a Military Casualty Officer.
not_available Sats are falling, 89.
not_available Can't see the cords, too much blood.
not_available Need a surgical airway.
not_available Crike tray.
not_available Slow your roll.
not_available Open up a central line kit.
not_available Grab a McGill.
not_available We'll do a retrograde intubation.
not_available Never seen that work.
not_available You've never seen me do it.
not_available Today's your lucky day.
not_available I'm gonna do a Seldinger technique.
not_available I'll wire up through the cricothyroid.
not_available It'd be faster to crike him.
not_available No, you'll get infection and bleeding.
not_available Not to mention subglottic stenosis and a big, ugly
not_available ass scar.
not_available Sats down to 84.
not_available Hypoxia's not good for you either.
not_available Where's Neela? 
not_available She got called up to Surgery.
not_available We'll aspirate air, and then pass the wire through.
not_available There are soldiers looking for her and one of them is a chaplain.
not_available You need to find her.
not_available Yeah, I'm trying to page her.
not_available Everything okay in here, Abby? 
not_available Yeah, I think so.
not_available We'd be better if you stopped talking when I'm trying to show them how to save his life.
not_available Listen, Vic
not_available I'm all over this.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Go find Neela, please.
not_available Okay, Abby, look.
not_available Look for the wire in the oropharynx.

not_available You will, you will.
not_available Come on, you son of a bitch.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hey, can you give this CT to Dr.
not_available Dubenko? I think he wants to see you.
not_available I've been paged to ER.
not_available If you can make sure he gets them.
not_available He was very specific about speaking with you in person.
not_available Sats, 78, bradying down to 60.
not_available I still can't see your wire.
not_available Open up a crike tray.
not_available We don't need no crike tray.
not_available Vic.
not_available Stop staring.
not_available Focus on your patient.
not_available Ray, give her more suction.
not_available It's gotta be there.
not_available Wait, wait, wait.
not_available I got it.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep going, keep going.
not_available Stop.
not_available It'll guide you right through the cords.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's enough, Chuny.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hard to pass.
not_available Wiggle it, mommy.
not_available Side to side.
not_available Wiggle it, wiggle it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I think I'm in.
not_available All right, wire out and bag him.
not_available Call for a portable chest.
not_available We all good here? 
not_available We're doing great.
not_available Abby? 
not_available Why you asking her? I mean, I just told you we're doing good, right? I'll go find Neela.
not_available Can you believe this? It's ridiculous, huh? What percentage of liver injuries stop bleeding by the time surgical exploration is performed? About half? 
not_available How about 86 percent? It's okay, you have time to learn all that in five years.
not_available What? Seems all my complaining's finally paid off.
not_available We've been funded for an additional slot in a Surgical Residency.
not_available It's yours for the asking.
not_available Are you serious? Well, if you don't want it
not_available No, I want it.
not_available I want it.
not_available Sorry, it's the ER.
not_available Ignore it, you're a surgeon.
not_available We never answer the first page.
not_available I'm kidding, go.
not_available Come find me after your shift.
not_available We'll grab a beer at Ike's to celebrate.
not_available That'd be great, but the drinks are on me.
not_available So I guess congratulations are in order.
not_available Yes, thank you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko told me.
not_available I'm so excited, can't wait to get started.
not_available Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
not_available Look forward to being your Attending.
not_available Right.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Neela, Luka's looking for you.
not_available Yeah, I got his page.
not_available Hey, guess what.
not_available I got the Surgical Residency.
not_available Wow, that's great.
not_available You should really try to find Luka.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Hold up.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Hey, I got it.
not_available What? The Surgical Residency.
not_available That's good for you.
not_available That's really great.
not_available Well, try to contain your enthusiasm.
not_available I need to tell you something.
not_available Yeah, Luka's paging me.
not_available I know, and
not_available Because it's important.
not_available So is my news, but nobody seems to care.
not_available Neela, listen
not_available It's not like I'm leaving the hospital.
not_available I'm going into Surgery.
not_available I'd think you people would like having me up there.
not_available Abby, have you seen Luka? There are two men here to see you.
not_available From the Army.
not_available The Army? We tried to find you.
not_available Doctor Rasgotra? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Captain Evans, this is Father Marris.
not_available Is there someplace more private we can talk? Can you tell me why you're here, please? I really think it would be better
not_available Tell me.
not_available Ma'am, the secretary of the Army would like to express his deepest regret 
not_available There must be some mistake.
not_available that your husband, Captain Gallant, was killed in action.
not_available I'm sorry, you've got it mixed up.
not_available Michael is a doctor.
not_available He's not a "soldier" soldier.
not_available He was killed when his truck was hit by a roadside bomb.
not_available Again, the secretary extends his deepest sympathies
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm working.
not_available I can't do this right now.
not_available Please tell Dr.
not_available Rasgotra that we're here to help in any way possible.
not_available Have his parents been notified? No, but that's something we can do if she would like.
not_available What about Michael's? Her husband's remains? It will take seven to 10 days for the deceased to get here from Iraq.
not_available Arrangements will be made to fly him here to Chicago or wherever she decides.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll pass it on.
not_available All pertinent information is in the packet.
not_available If she has any questions, she can contact myself or Father Marris.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, was it friendly fire? Sir? How do we really know what happened over there, huh? Doesn't this whole war smell to you a little bit of rightwing cronyism? With the oil, and the multibillion
not_available dollar rebuilding contracts, huh? You know what real psychological warfare is? You coming in here, feeding us a bunch of lies to placate the masses.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Tell me about the deficit.
not_available Why do we have to go there and kill everyone? For democracy? 
not_available I need help with Mr.
not_available Engle's blood gas.
not_available Vic.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Come on.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm gonna go find Neela.
not_available Make sure she goes home.
not_available Okay, he's doing better.
not_available So why don't we lower the FiO2 to 70 and then we'll grab a Grab an ABG in 20, okay? 
not_available You want me to look at your nose? No, I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I just wanna say I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry about what happened over there but those guys coming in here like storm troopers and just It's like I'm a stigmata.
not_available Why don't you go crash in the lounge? 
not_available I'm fine, I'm fine.
not_available I'm really fine.
not_available You know there's no rest for the wicked.
not_available You, Abby, should know that.
not_available The intubation was cool, though, wasn't it? Gotta put that in your bag of tricks.
not_available I'm telling you, you got
not_available Look, I gotta take care of this.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you find Neela? 
not_available Ray's looking for her.
not_available You know, I came here today thinking about how nice it is to be back, you know? I figured I'd come back, maybe save a few lives.
not_available Maybe even bring somebody back from the dead, you know? I damned sure didn't expect to lose a friend.
not_available Yo, doc.
not_available The 10year
not_available old won't say anything, and we got nothing.
not_available Did you find mom? Yeah, she's been in rehab since November.
not_available Dad's out of it, and baby's in a coma.
not_available This kid's all we got.
not_available Can you try talking to him? Yeah.
not_available How we doing in here? 
not_available Oh, kind of quiet.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available You wanna see something really, really cool? That's your skeleton.
not_available And, see, look right here.
not_available This is where you broke your collarbone.
not_available Looks like old rib fractures.
not_available Do you remember hurting your ribs? No? I know you're worried about your dad and your little brother.
not_available But we got the best doctors helping them out.
not_available So now we need you to help them too, by telling us what happened.
not_available You do wanna help Eddie, right? Yeah? Well, then you need to talk to me.
not_available Eddie wanted to play with my Bionicle guy and I took it away from him.
not_available Then he started crying, and he wouldn't stop.
not_available So my dad started shaking him.
not_available Did your dad hit you? He punched me, then threw me into a chair.
not_available And what about your brother? Eddie kept crying and he kept shaking him.
not_available Telling him to shut up using the F
not_available word.
not_available And then he grabbed Eddie's head and slammed it against the wall.
not_available Then Eddie was crying so hard that he couldn't breathe.
not_available So I got my baseball bat and hit him.
not_available You hit your dad? I wanted him to leave Eddie alone.
not_available How many times did you hit him? Until he stopped.
not_available I was just talking to him four days ago.
not_available He was complaining about the food and I was complaining about how cold Abby's apartment is.
not_available I honestly don't even remember what else we were talking about.
not_available I'm so sorry, Neela.
not_available We all are.
not_available You know, I was probably ordering a latte or watching Celebrity Poker when he was being blown up by a bomb.
not_available Just like that, he's gone.
not_available Listen, if you need anything Or you want me to do anything
not_available No, Ray, I don't.
not_available I don't need you to do anything.
not_available I just
not_available I need to go back to work.
not_available No, Neela, look.
not_available You need to go home, take care of things.
not_available You need to take care of yourself.
not_available You know, I don't have a home.
not_available I don't have a husband.
not_available I don't have anything.
not_available All I have is this stupid hospital.
not_available Just stay the hell away from me.
not_available Are you hiding? Is it that obvious? I can't believe Michael's dead.
not_available You wanna go home? I'll cover for you.
not_available What about Neela? Well, we can take care of things.
not_available Who? You and Clemente? Weaver knew he had problems before she hired him.
not_available Now we're paying for it.
not_available Well, Luka, it's your ER.
not_available Let's go away someplace where it's warm and where nobody knows who we are.
not_available You mean like a vacation? 
not_available No, not like a vacation a vacation.
not_available A real one.
not_available Even if it's just for a couple of days before the baby's born.
not_available We could hang out by a pool.
not_available Or the ocean.
not_available I can dig a hole in the sand for your big belly.
not_available What is that? Some sort of Croatian mating ritual? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available What am I, a sea turtle? Neela.
not_available Neela? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, let someone take you home.
not_available I have patients to pass on.
not_available We can take care of that.
not_available You need to go home.
not_available Why is everyone so insistent that I go home? I have things to do.
not_available I haven't even told Michael's parents yet.
not_available The guys from the Army said they'd take care of that.
not_available No.
not_available I have to do it.
not_available It'd be better to do it from my apartment.
not_available Get some privacy? Doubtless they're both at work.
not_available I wanna tell them at the same time when they're together tonight.
not_available Neela, go home, please.
not_available Abby, Dennis Young's crashing again.

not_available Frank has it at the desk.
not_available Neela? 
not_available You know what? If it makes everyone else happy, I'll go home.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Push the damn atropine.
not_available You sure he didn't have an epidural? 
not_available No.
not_available Just diffuse brain edema.
not_available All right, a hundred grams of mannitol.
not_available We gave him mannitol.
not_available Bilaterally blown pupils.
not_available Check the ET tube.

not_available It's P.E.A.
not_available An amp of epi.
not_available Two angiocaths.
not_available Maybe it's a tension pneumo.

not_available A hundred per minute, deeper and faster.
not_available That's how you'll save a life.
not_available Okay, I need to perfuse his brain.
not_available I need hypertonic saline at 23.4 percent.
not_available We don't have that.
not_available Don't have that? You don't have that? Hypertonic saline reduces ICP when mannitol fails.
not_available That paper last fall in The Lancet.
not_available Or was it the New England Journal? It was Neurosurgery.
not_available That's right.
not_available I knew it.
not_available The author was Weston or Williams or something starting with W.

not_available Call it? Lockhart, I never figured you for a quitter.
not_available All right, he needs burr holes.
not_available We gotta reduce the ICP.
not_available He has an open skull fracture.
not_available Burr holes are not gonna help.
not_available Vic.
not_available Okay, he should have had an ICP monitor.
not_available Everybody knows he should've had an ICP monitor.
not_available Time of death, 1420.
not_available Oh, we could do better than this.
not_available We gotta do a lot better than this.
not_available Do a lot better than that.
not_available Vic, I need to talk to you.
not_available Yeah, and I need a cup of coffee.
not_available Not the crap they serve here.
not_available Not the effluence they pass at the roach coach.
not_available I need a real coffee.
not_available Vic, hey
not_available Ever been to this Italian place, Marrinacio's on Randolph? My God, best coffee this side of Milan.
not_available They even make their own biscotti.
not_available You walk through that door, it smells

not_available Had to kill his old man because there was nobody else there to help him.
not_available I guess that would be too much to ask, wouldn't it? It's much better that we spend
not_available What is it now? 6 billion dollars a month in a war all the way across the world to kill off a few more of the other kids who actually get to their teens.
not_available Did you tell the police? So they could arrest him? Yeah, because that's the one thing we do well in this country, isn't it? We got prison down to a science.

not_available You talk to her? Tried.
not_available I think she just wants to be alone.
not_available She'll have a lot of time alone.
not_available Probably best if she was around people now.
not_available Yeah, well, like I said, I tried, but it didn't seem to work.
not_available Whoa, Abby.

not_available I'll be back in a few minutes.

not_available You know, since your mom's away you're gonna have to go stay with a foster family.
not_available Probably until she gets back.
not_available The Fosters? No, their name's not Foster.
not_available That's what they do.
not_available They take care of kids.
not_available Eddie too? No, Eddie's gonna have to stay in the hospital.
not_available Because he's still sick? He's showing signs of improvement though.

not_available What about my dad? His injuries were very, very severe and, um the doctors, they couldn't fix him.
not_available He's dead? Yeah.
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available But I didn't mean to kill him.
not_available I know that.
not_available But I'm gonna go to hell.
not_available What? 
not_available For killing him.
not_available God sends you to hell if you kill someone.
not_available Sean, I think that God makes exceptions if you were trying to save someone else.
not_available Really? Really.
not_available How is he? 
not_available He settled down.

not_available Really? I could use a break from Luka's snoring.
not_available Michael used to snore when he was drunk.
not_available You know, I had to come home and find a photograph because I couldn't picture him in my head.
not_available One day, I'm not even gonna be able to remember what he looks like.
not_available That's not true.
not_available I'm gonna be fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm putting him on a 72
not_available hour.
not_available What are you calling it? Gravely disabled.
not_available He's blaming it on insomnia.
not_available Tox screen was clean.
not_available There's no history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
not_available But he's had prolonged sleep deprivation and was recently the victim of a violent crime so there's probably some PTSD going on too.
not_available But we'll know better in a couple days.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, Vic.
not_available What a day you had, huh?

not_available I'm a passionate man.
not_available That's what makes me a good doctor, right? Right.
not_available I just can't keep up my pace without spinning off the road at some point.
not_available I'm just sorry that it had to happen on your watch.
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available That's okay.
not_available The important thing is that you get some rest now.

not_available Well, maybe not wrong, but certainly not according to plans.
not_available I love you, Neela.
not_available Marrying you was the happiest day of my life.
not_available You just
not_available You make me strong.
not_available Now, I know you didn't want me to come back to Iraq.

not_available You 're the most beautiful and kind person that I know.
not_available I just
not_available I just want you to be happy.
not_available And just know that I'll always be with you.
not_available I want you to find somebody, get married, have babies.

not_available I love you, Neela.
not_available Forever.
