not_available Breath sounds are good, sats are fine, BP's normal.
not_available Try four of MS.
not_available I'll try to get an ETA on Ortho.
not_available So it's all good? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's normal to have pain when you have a tube in.
not_available The morphine should help that.
not_available You know, you seem distracted.
not_available Should I ask for another doctor? 
not_available Excuse me? I need you to fix this.
not_available Get things moving along.
not_available We're wasting time.

not_available Thank you, love.
not_available A little help, mate.
not_available He's hurt his ankle rather badly.
not_available And how did you do that? 
not_available Cheese rolling.
not_available Cheese rolling? It's an old, rather pointless pagan ritual that some of us in the local ex
not_available pat community periodically reenact.
not_available They roll the wheel down the hill and you tumble after it.
not_available The first one down wins the cheese.
not_available Morris, this one is all you.
not_available What can I do for you? He's hurt his ankle.

not_available ray, give you something for pain.
not_available Look, this won't take long, will it? We must be on our way.
not_available We've gotta pick up some biscuits and mustard at the market.
