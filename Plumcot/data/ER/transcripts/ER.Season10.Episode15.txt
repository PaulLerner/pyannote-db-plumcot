not_available No.
not_available I think I found a roach.

not_available Why are you? I'm going to that stupid aquarium thing with Oscar.
not_available The imagination you provide

not_available I can take the El.
not_available It's icy out.
not_available I wouldn't want the little Martin kid getting hurt.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available What? Make assumptions about last names.
not_available Little Petey, then? Little Jenny? Until my name changes, if it ever does, he or she is a Lewis.
not_available Whatever you say, Mommy.

not_available Okay, I gotta go.
not_available Bye.
not_available Okay, bye.

not_available I gotta go.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hey.
not_available Morning.
not_available Am I late or are you early? No point staying in bed if you can't sleep.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Chuck snores.
not_available Either I need earplugs or
not_available Separate bedrooms.
not_available You say that like it's a bad thing.
not_available So is this gonna be a rush, or depress the hell out of me? The latter.
not_available It's multiples all from the same address.
not_available Vicki Bennett, 38 weeks pregnant, in active labor and fully dilated.
not_available Why is this happening? I'd say your baby was ready.
not_available Breathe through the contractions.
not_available Set up a fetal monitor.
not_available So Mom's in labor.
not_available What's wrong with everyone else? Unknown.
not_available The family was found unconscious.
not_available Was the heat on? 
not_available It's 10 degrees.
not_available What's the story? 
not_available Possible CO poisoning.
not_available More family members coming in.
not_available Need some help here! How long has he been seizing? 
not_available Since we pulled up.
not_available Altered mental status prior, no signs of head trauma.
not_available He on anticonvulsants? 
not_available Not according to his wife.
not_available Eightand 10yearold 
not_available are behind, out cold at the scene.
not_available What is it? Looks like relative hypoxia.
not_available I got this one.
not_available Take the kids.
not_available Clay Bennett, altered, but coming around.
not_available Nausea.
not_available Vital signs normal.
not_available Feel sick, dude? This one nauseous too? 
not_available Complains of headache.
not_available Good vitals.
not_available You take the boy, I'll deal with the girl.
not_available What? Hi, my name's Abby.
not_available We're gonna try to make you feel better, okay? 
not_available She's crowning.
not_available Where's my family? 
not_available They're being taken care of.
not_available Fetal heart rate's at 105.
not_available I don't understand what happened.
not_available We're not sure but you need to stay here.
not_available Okay, let's get Mom on 100 percent 02 by mask.
not_available Labs? 
not_available No one would wake up.
not_available Neela, labs now.
not_available CBC, type and Rh, UA and ABG with carboxyhemoglobin level.
not_available When a family passes out in winter, we assume it's carbon
not_available monoxide poisoning.
not_available Happens if your heater doesn't vent properly.
not_available But I didn't pass out.
not_available Fetal hemoglobin has a higher CO affinity.
not_available What? 
not_available In English.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Don't apologize, just explain.
not_available The baby's blood took the carbon monoxide.
not_available That cleared it from your body and kept you well.
not_available Does that
not_available ? Does that mean the baby got it all? Okay, big push for the next one, Vicki.
not_available Oh, my God! Here we go.
not_available Stand by with a pediatric intubation tray.
not_available Enough.
not_available We need to get him on a non
not_available rebreather and draw an ABG.
not_available Neonatal laryngoscope? 
not_available Bottom right.
not_available That's six of Ativan.
not_available Push another two.
not_available How's Mom? Lucky she was pregnant.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Morris needs you in here.
not_available I'm a little busy.
not_available Let me rephrase that.
not_available His patient needs you.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I got this.
not_available Hang Dilantin after eight of lorazepam.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep Dad's airway secure.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available He won't listen.
not_available I want my mommy.
not_available Yeah, hold on.
not_available Girl with a headache.
not_available Pulse ox, 100 percent on two liters.
not_available Do I have to draw a blood gas? 
not_available You do.
not_available I told you.
not_available Her sats are normal.
not_available Pulse ox measures oxygen dissolved in the blood not bound to hemoglobin.
not_available It's normal in CO poisoning.
not_available I told him that too.
not_available Damn! Who's the resident here? You okay? Is my family dying? It sort of snuck up on us, you know? I mean, I don't
not_available I don't think either one of us planned it.
not_available Right? 
not_available Right.
not_available It happens.
not_available People date.
not_available You okay back there? Yeah.
not_available You want to talk about this? 
not_available No.
not_available He'll break down muscle cells.
not_available Open up the fluids.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Enough is enough.
not_available Dilantin's in.
not_available Any longer, we'll get irreversible brain damage.
not_available So, what do we do? 
not_available A drip and hope it works.
not_available How fast should I run it in? 
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Hold up, hold up, hold up.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bennett, can you hear me? Carboxyhemoglobin 35 percent.
not_available He needs the hyperbaric chamber.
not_available Only if it's over 40.
not_available Or has neurologic impairment.
not_available We don't know that yet.
not_available Keep him on oxygen.
not_available We'll give him 30 minutes.
not_available If he doesn't wake up quick, then we'll talk hyperbarics.
not_available Baby's distress probably induced labor.
not_available It's a good thing too.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Otherwise they'd all be dead right about now.
not_available Fetal heart rate's down to 80.
not_available Why us? Okay, you really gotta push hard with this next one.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Get ready with a receiving blanket.
not_available What did we do? Okay, head's out.
not_available Bulb syringe.
not_available One more push, Vicki.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's a boy.
not_available Clamp.
not_available We're good people.
not_available We go to church.
not_available Okay, hang in there, Vicki.
not_available Neela, deliver the placenta.
not_available Me? 
not_available Yes, you.
not_available How is he? 
not_available He's having a little trouble breathing.
not_available One for color, one for tone.
not_available Zero for respirations.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available His heart isn't beating well 
not_available because it's been deprived of oxygen.
not_available And his brain? Oh, God! We need to intubate.
not_available Point
not_available three of epi and draw an ABG.
not_available Let's see how much carbon monoxide he's taken in.
not_available Bad enough when residents are late but when Attendings are late it sends a message that time is amorphous.
not_available Seven a.
not_available m.
not_available is 7 a.
not_available m., people.
not_available When Kovac's in, I wanna talk to him.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Stop surfing the web on County time.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Fair warning.
not_available Henry's colicky, Sandy's pulling a 24 and I haven't had coffee.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Placenta's out.
not_available Neela, 20 of Pit.
not_available Why isn't he crying? He has a tube to give him oxygen.
not_available Good strong pulse and he's pinking up.
not_available We'll find out how your family's doing.
not_available Mom's carbon monoxide is in the safe range, 19 percent.
not_available How's our little hero? 
not_available He's at 48.
not_available Coma range? 
not_available Needs hyperbaric therapy.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Your son has a very high level of carbon monoxide we need to clear.
not_available Like scubadiving.
not_available He needs a pressure chamber.
not_available Equivalent to 66 feet of water to get three times more oxygen.
not_available Will he wake up then? 
not_available We hope.
not_available Can I hold him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can touch him.
not_available But the sooner we start the treatment, the better the results.
not_available He's He's beautiful.
not_available Yeah, he is.
not_available Sorry, we gotta go.
not_available We'll do everything we can.
not_available Neela.
not_available My baby Take this.
not_available You did a NICU rotation? I need you in the chamber.
not_available You sending me? 
not_available A nurse will be with you.
not_available They're waiting.
not_available I thought an Attending should
not_available No.
not_available A dive takes too long.
not_available How long? A couple of hours.
not_available Is that a problem? 
not_available Okay.
not_available There you go.
not_available Take off your gown.
not_available Put on booties.
not_available No lipstick, no makeup, hair spray, nail polish, perfume.
not_available What? 
not_available All flammable.
not_available Removing watches, jewelry, electronic equipment.
not_available Any unfinished root canals, temporary fillings? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? 
not_available Trapped air in the tooth socket.
not_available It can expand.
not_available Do you know how to clear your ears? 
not_available I can't do this.
not_available Pinch your nostrils.
not_available Blow against your glottis.
not_available I can't go in.
not_available Are you claustrophobic? 
not_available Is there time for a replacement? What do you think? Come on.
not_available All right, hook him up to the vent.
not_available I'll set the clock.
not_available Patient and attendant set? 
not_available Go for it.
not_available You're not gonna panic, are you? Initiating pressurization.
not_available Does it stay this loud? 
not_available You get used to it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Can we stop now? Ten feet.
not_available Do we have a problem in there? My ear's bothering me.
not_available Take us up two feet.
not_available Hold your nose.
not_available Blow to equalize.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please, can we stop now? Resume pressurization.
not_available You really should be on the postpartum floor.
not_available Mommy! It's all right.
not_available Mommy's here now.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available You're not helping by not taking care of yourself.
not_available How is he? 
not_available He's a little groggy.
not_available You just had a baby.
not_available If I can't be with my baby I wanna be with them.
not_available Vitals q.
not_available 30 minutes, CBC in two hours.
not_available Mom's good and cranky.
not_available How's Dad? Just woke up.
not_available Neuro exam's non
not_available focal.
not_available Oriented to person, place and time.
not_available He could still have longterm neuro
not_available psychological deficits.
not_available She know that yet? 
not_available No.
not_available She doesn't need to.
not_available The girl's headache subsided.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's the boy? Hungry, wants a snack.
not_available But he's worried about Mom and Dad.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Any word on the baby? 
not_available In the chamber.
not_available What's his PO2? 
not_available He has a name.
not_available Samuel.
not_available Can you make sure whoever's with him knows that? Of course.
not_available What's the verdict? 
not_available Four hours at 100 percent they should all be clear.
not_available The baby's another story.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So how are you doing with your pregnancy? Oh, fine.
not_available You know, tired.
not_available A little scared.
not_available About having one? 
not_available About what happens after you do.
not_available Every winter it's the same thing.
not_available Is there any sort of air conditioning? Temperatures go down, heaters get turned up, people asphyxiate.
not_available Why does it have to be so hot in here? When pressure rises in a fixed volume, it's gonna get warm.
not_available Ideal gas law.
not_available PV = nRT.
not_available What about it? Okay.
not_available Time to give the kid an air break.
not_available Prevents oxygen toxicity.
not_available I can hardly breathe.
not_available Too much and he could seize.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available Hour 40.
not_available Neela.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available His name's Samuel.
not_available Sorry? 
not_available The baby.
not_available The mom wanted you to know.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available I'll see you in a couple hours.
not_available Kerry, I examined Mrs.
not_available Krall and she won't require surgery.
not_available She passed her kidney stone half an hour ago.
not_available She wants to turn it into a brooch.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What? Okay, let me guess.
not_available Henry has colic and you're barely sleeping.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did Ella have it too? And terrible teething.
not_available It's no cakewalk now.
not_available Tantrums, a constant demand for toys, refusing to eat.
not_available I hate to say it, but in some ways, it gets harder.
not_available It must be twice as hard by yourself.
not_available You have any prospects? I met a teacher recently.
not_available He's a nice man.
not_available Nice is good.
not_available Yes, it's nice.
not_available Okay, open up.
not_available All right, there you go.
not_available Oh, with a minute to spare.

not_available Why don't you two take a seat, and we'll call you as soon as we can.

not_available We can talk, watch something on the big screen.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available I'll cook.
not_available Is this where I sign in? Can we talk about this later? I need to get back to work.
not_available How can I help you today, ma'am? 
not_available Kovac.
not_available Morning, Kerry.
not_available I should be grateful it's not afternoon.
not_available You're late, which makes me late for a meeting.
not_available Look for the deduction in your paycheck.
not_available Could be worse.
not_available She could have an M16 strapped on.
not_available What's this? Place across the street does dry
not_available ice shipments.
not_available It's a prenatal
not_available care package for Kem.
not_available Plus some stuff they need at the clinic.
not_available SusPhrine, terbutaline.
not_available Yeah, I hear they're really desperate for roses in the Congo.

not_available Couldn't have turned out different.
not_available They did their best.
not_available That's the scary part.
not_available Twenty
not_available something John Doe found down behind a building.
not_available Just like all weaklings! Where is all this blood coming from? GSW? Knife wound? He wouldn't exactly let us check.
not_available Fistfight maybe? 
not_available The other guy won.
not_available Just let me go, please! Altered and agitated.
not_available Tachycardic at 128.
not_available BP, 160/92.
not_available Gotta be on something heavy
not_available duty.

not_available And now my dad's got pneumonia.
not_available I've been taking care of him at home.
not_available With nursing care? He doesn't want anyone in the house.

not_available Ma'am, he'll be seen by a doctor, but I can't guarantee which one.
not_available Sandy and Dr.
not_available Weaver, they live together.
not_available It's evil.
not_available You hear me? Found a meth pipe.
not_available Wanna guess what the tox screen's gonna say? Do a full workup.
not_available He could just as easily be that way from a head bleed.
not_available It's everywhere.
not_available It's everywhere! 
not_available You want hard restraints? Try Ativan first.
not_available No free fluid, Morrison's is clear.
not_available No signs of trauma.
not_available Where's the wound? What? 
not_available I can't find anything.
not_available Like, nothing, not a scratch.
not_available It's demons! There's demons all around us! Hematocrit's normal.
not_available So he's not bleeding internally or externally.
not_available Hope he works in a meatpacking plant.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.

not_available These five are theirs.
not_available You're pretty young to be a grandma.
not_available You think it's the side effects from the St.

not_available We'll run some tests to make sure.
not_available Why are you taking it? Are you depressed? Just thought I'd be done raising kids by now.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be back.
not_available What? CBC, chem panel, UA? Could be pyelo.

not_available Run a psych history and make sure she's not clinically depressed.
not_available Dad's coming around.

not_available How are you feeling, Mr.
not_available Bennett? 
not_available Headache.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Do you know what today is? Wednesday.
not_available Vicki said that the baby saved our lives.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He did.
not_available Is he gonna be okay? Staring won't make it go faster.
not_available Why are these chambers so small? 
not_available I've been in smaller.
not_available We're over halfway there, okay? Relax.
not_available Don't.
not_available You have no idea how hard this is for me.
not_available You want some Valium? What? To calm your nerves? No, I just
not_available I need to get out of here.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available He's stable now.
not_available ButIf I don't get out, I'll lose it! Do you understand? Problem? 
not_available I'm stepping in the airlock.
not_available Bring me up.
not_available Are we okay with this? Yeah.

not_available Ascending.
not_available Tachycardia.
not_available Heart rate's 180.
not_available Is the other doctor en route? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I paged him.
not_available Breath sounds decreased on the left.
not_available P waves, not SVT.
not_available He's got a pneumothorax.
not_available Forty feet.
not_available Do you need a surgeon in there? 
not_available No.
not_available We need to re
not_available inflate his lung.
not_available Pulse is weak and thready.
not_available Bring me back down.
not_available Descending.
not_available Open the crash cart and prep the chest.
not_available PVCs.
not_available Are you coming back in? 
not_available Just until the other doctor arrives.
not_available Sixty feet.
not_available Sixty feet.
not_available My ear! I'm bleeding! You perfed your eardrum.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It grows back.
not_available Come on.
not_available We 're at depth.
not_available Subtle right
not_available middle lobe infiltrate.
not_available Sure makes me appreciate our healthcare system.
not_available I had to wait a week for a chest film in Zuzhou.
not_available Low
not_available grade fever.
not_available It's probably just early pneumonia.
not_available Or pulmonary embolus.
not_available Can he get a V/Q scan? Doesn't need one.
not_available D
not_available dimer's negative.
not_available He's low probability for PE.
not_available Does he walk at all? He can, but he won't.
not_available And I can't make him.
not_available Since his surgery, he's been depressed, a bit demented.
not_available Just stares at the TV.
not_available So, what happened? They skidded off some back road in the middle of nowhere.

not_available I'll get there as soon as I can.
not_available Five centimeters of water on the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available You'll be at depth in a minute.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Sleeping like a baby now.
