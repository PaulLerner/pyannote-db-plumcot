Previously on ER We'd be better off as friends.
not_available Mark, thanks again for dinner.
not_available God forbid you listen to me and learn! Yes, I was engaged once.
not_available To a really lovely man.
not_available And he was killed in a freak horseback riding accident.
not_available You bring a child into this world, and you think they're helpless.
not_available But, actually, I think it's us.
not_available We're the ones that are helpless.
not_available What time's that big do at your mom's? 
not_available Right after church.
not_available I promised her we'd be there for Christmas caroling with Uncle Ted.
not_available That the old guy with the banjo? It's a family tradition, kind of like going to Mass on Christmas Eve.
not_available If I go, I'll feel like a hypocrite.
not_available Kneeling and standing and 
not_available You could just sit.
not_available Everybody gives me dirty looks.
not_available Like I'm a pagan.
not_available You are a pagan.
not_available Oh, what a glorious day! Did you see the sky? 
not_available It's like a painting.
not_available Makes you glad to be alive.
not_available Unless you're being persecuted.
not_available What? 
not_available He doesn't like Dr.
not_available Lee's new system.
not_available What new system? Patients get two 
charts For docs and for nurses.
not_available We get to do our notes at the same time.
not_available Orders get in quicker, patients get meds faster.
not_available Docs don't waste time chasing charts.
not_available So, what's the problem? "Someone" has to keep track of twice as many charts as normal doubling his workload.
not_available Not that anyone cares.
not_available Good morning, gang.
not_available Oh, my God, Amanda! What have you done? Christmas 
nibblies Dried fruit, mixed nuts, little chocolate reindeer.
not_available Don't mind if I do.
not_available Wait.
not_available First dibs should go to Jerry.
not_available It's only fair since he's bearing the brunt of the new charting system.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available As you wish.
not_available Seriously, if you find yourself in the weeds, call me.
not_available I'll make sure you get support.
not_available Sure.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available That's a Christmas card image, the sight of you wrapping a book.
not_available Something educational for one of your nieces? No.
not_available Actually, it's for you.
not_available It's T.S.
not_available Eliot.
not_available I know you said you liked him, so I got it last month when we were still, you know Peter, that's so sweet.
not_available I can't think of a more thoughtful gift.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, please, forget it.
not_available Listen, I was wondering if we could finish our workups around noon.
not_available I need to get out of here early tonight.
not_available Oh, you've got big Christmas Eve plans.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My sister's hosting a dinner.
not_available Carla's gonna bring Reece by.
not_available I haven't seen him all week.
not_available I understand.
not_available I absolutely hate being away from my family during the holidays.
not_available In fact, I'm so desperate not to be alone this Christmas Eve that I bought a ticket to the Surgeons' Society Gala.
not_available Oh, golly.
not_available Yep.
not_available And you won't believe who's sitting next to me.
not_available Hey, there she is! So I checked around.
not_available We definitely have the coolest table.
not_available It's lucky we're both able to make it.
not_available A little trouble in paradise? Anyway, so tonight's dinner is semiformal so any slinky black number will do.
not_available If I may voice my preference something short and offthe
not_available shoulder would be ideal.
not_available Peter, by the way, that reminds me.
not_available I have a lot of charts and I want to get out of here early.
not_available I need you to cover my rounds.
not_available That'll mess up my morning.
not_available Look at it this way.
not_available I get a life and you earn a special place in my heart.
not_available Do you know a garage that's open? My crappy car died on the Dan Ryan.
not_available On Christmas Eve? Good luck.
not_available Lydia, is that? 
not_available Card from Jen.
not_available My exwife sent you a Christmas card? 
not_available No.
not_available She sent one to me.
not_available We've exchanged cards for years.
not_available Christmas, birthdays 
not_available I was reading the newsletter.
not_available "Merry Christmas from the Simons." What? 
not_available Their new house sounds amazing.
not_available I know.
not_available 5000 square feet? 
not_available Six bedrooms, three baths? That sounds just like Jen to be bragging about her house.
not_available I wouldn't call it bragging.
not_available She's sharing good news.
not_available Yeah, Jen made partner.
not_available Jen made partner? 
not_available The firm even got her a new Beemer.
not_available I love those convertibles.
not_available Oh, you know what? Mack's Garage on Wacker is open.
not_available They'll tow your pieceof
not_available crap car.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available "Dear Dr.
not_available Carter, I'm sure you don't remember me.
not_available I wouldn't be around this Christmas if not for you.
not_available You're a lifesaver.
not_available The Lord's instrument on earth." Pacer pads? 
not_available Third drawer on the left.
not_available "May God bless you and keep you.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Emily Ropella." Do you remember her? 
not_available Not a clue.
not_available It's a nice card, though.
not_available Does it bother you that God gets the credit? One can be called worse things than "an instrument of God." So you believe in? I give Him the benefit of the doubt.
not_available You? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Sometimes I think that God is just this comforting illusion.
not_available We want everything to have meaning, so we create this puppet master when everything is just 
arbitrary Life, death, natural disasters The Master is displeased.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I can't believe he foisted this on you.
not_available No use worrying about it now.
not_available I'll start the preops.
not_available That'll save time.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Gardner.
not_available I have the results of your MRI.
not_available Good.
not_available So, how's it look? Good news.
not_available It appears the cancer hasn't spread beyond the capsule.
not_available Great.
not_available So does this mean I can hold on to my prostate? I'm afraid not.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano does want to continue with the radical prostatectomy tomorrow morning as scheduled.
not_available But with the surgery, you stand an excellent chance of beating the cancer.
not_available It really is very good news.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Romano around? 
not_available He's in surgery.
not_available Is it something I can help you with? He had mentioned the operation could result in my losing sexual function.
not_available I take it that's still the case? We'll do our best to do a nerve
not_available sparing procedure.
not_available But there is that possibility, yes.
not_available How strong a possibility? Well, according to Dr.
not_available Romano's notes, as high as 75 to 80 percent.
not_available Eighty percent.
not_available Has Dr.
not_available Romano discussed your options about having children in the future? No.
not_available Well, you might want to consider paying a visit to a sperm bank.
not_available That way, if there's a loss of function you can still have children through alternative means.
not_available Right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lee? You startled me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh would like you to call him.
not_available What's wrong with Dr.
not_available Greene's locker? I found it ajar.
not_available I shut it before something walked away.
not_available Thanks for the message.
not_available Sure.
not_available I've got supraventricular tachycardia.
not_available It happens all the time.
not_available Rate's 160.
not_available BP's 100 palp.
not_available Just cardiovert me at 50 and I'm on my way.
not_available Let's put him on a monitor and get a strip.
not_available I'm trying to tell you, I've got SVTs.
not_available Just cardiovert me at 50.
not_available It works every time.
not_available I appreciate the tip.
not_available But I need to examine you myself.
not_available I'm trying to save some time here.
not_available Stop talking.
not_available Would you tell him that I have SVTs? I've got SVTs! 
not_available Let go.
not_available I've got SVTs! I heard you! I need to examine you myself.
not_available I'm gonna be late for work! 
not_available Let go! Are you one of Santa's helpers? The helpers just pass out the goody bags.
not_available I'm an elf.
not_available A singing elf.
not_available Oh, part of a choir? 
not_available There's four of us.
not_available But thanks to "Super Doc," the Elf Tones are gonna be a tenor short.
not_available Here you go.
not_available It says I have SVTs, right? I knew it! You want to shock me at 50 now, smartass? I got an 18yearold, flatline! How long down? 
not_available Unknown.
not_available Mother found him.
not_available Gave him two rounds of epi, two of atropine.
not_available Got any signs of life? 
not_available Got him back once.
not_available Get him on a monitor.
not_available Carter, check ventilation.
not_available What can I do? 
not_available Rectal temp.
not_available Great.
not_available All right.
not_available On my count.
not_available Watch your hand there.
not_available One, two, three, go.
not_available Any signs of drugs, suicide? Said he had a killer headache.
not_available Took a nap and never woke up.
not_available A subarachnoid hemorrhage.
not_available Killer headache is right.
not_available Monitor's up.
not_available No femoral pulse.
not_available Asystole.
not_available No spontaneous respirations.
not_available No response to pain.
not_available Anybody got any good news? Pupils are fixed and dilated.
not_available No corneal reflex.
not_available He's only 18.
not_available Zadro got him back once, maybe we can do it again.
not_available High dose of epi.
not_available Put him on a pulse ox.
not_available An endtidal CO
not_available 2 detector.
not_available Paddles, please.
not_available Crank it to 50.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available Let's start at 20.
not_available Twenty? Why? Because I said so, that's why.
not_available Oh, that's mature.
not_available Charged to 20.
not_available Clear.
not_available How did we do? 
not_available No change.
not_available Fifty? Do I hear 50? 
not_available Let's go to 30.
not_available Oh, for crying out loud! Why not just go to 50? Because he has a sensitive rhythm.
not_available I don't want to overshock him.
not_available Charge to 30.
not_available Clear.
not_available Anything? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I don't want to question your genius.
not_available But can we go to 50 while I still got some hair on my chest? 
not_available Let's go to 50.
not_available It's about time! 
not_available Charged.
not_available Clear.
not_available That did it.
not_available Back to normal sinus.
not_available Watch him for 15 and then let him go.
not_available Thanks for nothing, Dr.
not_available Mengele! Time? Twelve minutes.
not_available Check his rhythm.
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available Asystole.
not_available Keep at it.
not_available Ten of epi onboard.
not_available The boy's mother is in Chairs.
not_available She wants to talk to someone.
not_available Carter, you want to do that? Don't get her hopes up.
not_available All right.
not_available Give me another epi, 7 milligrams.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Richards? 
not_available My son? Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Your son's heart stopped beating.
not_available We're doing everything to start it again.
not_available We're giving him medicine and doing CPR.
not_available Why would his heart stop? He's 18 years old.
not_available There's a sign that he had a brain hemorrhage which could've caused the cardiac arrest.
not_available How? He's the picture of health.
not_available It could be a weak artery, possibly something that's existed since birth.
not_available The thing is, he's been down a long time.
not_available The longer he goes without oxygen, the less likely we can bring him back.
not_available We might need to have a conversation 
not_available Please don't give up on him.
not_available He's all that I have.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Hold it.
not_available Hold the compressions.
not_available Any sign of a rhythm? 
not_available Flatline.
not_available Let's call it.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Keep bagging.
not_available You got a reason to keep flogging him? He's 18, his mother's only child.
not_available And it's Christmas.
not_available Want a miracle? He's been down for 40.
not_available So, what's five more? 
not_available Okay, doctor.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available Keep bagging.
not_available And another round of high
not_available dose epi.
not_available Start a dopamine drip.
not_available Get those paddles ready.
not_available He's in asystole.
not_available He may be in fine V
not_available fib.
not_available Charge to 300.
not_available No, 350.
not_available Charging.
not_available Let's hold a really positive thought.
not_available Ready.
not_available Clear! Was that a beat? My God! 
not_available Two beats does not a rhythm make.
not_available Slap some pads on him.
not_available All right.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Can you roll him? 
not_available Set it at 80.
not_available You're on.
not_available It's not capturing.
not_available Dial up the gain.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just gotta get it to capture.
not_available He's throwing PVCs.
not_available Hold that lidocaine.
not_available Maximum gain.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available We got it! He's got a rhythm! 
not_available Take a carotid.
not_available Pulse? 
not_available Strong at 120.
not_available BP is 100.
not_available Send him to CT, find out where he's bleeding.
not_available How'd you? I'm an instrument! Way to go! 
not_available Hope he's got some brain left.
not_available You want contrast? No, but call Respiratory.
not_available Make sure they got a vent and scanner.
not_available Looks like we got our miracle.
not_available If he wakes up.
not_available Even if he does, he'll probably have brain damage.
not_available Carter.
not_available Better prepare the mother.
not_available Yes, Ma.
not_available Of course we're coming.
not_available Uncle Ted wants Doug to play "Silent Night" on the tambourine? I think he'd love it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, do you have any videotape left in the videocam? Yep.
not_available Yes, I am coming to Mass.
not_available No, he is not.
not_available But, you know what? We should probably respect his choice.
not_available It would be nice if we all went together.
not_available If I'm needed, I'll be out at the roach coach.
not_available I'll be here suffocating under a mountain of charts.
not_available That's odd.
not_available I swear I had my gloves in my pocket.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lee took them.
not_available What did you say? I saw her at your locker earlier.
not_available That is ridiculous, Jerry.
not_available What's ridiculous? He's accusing Amanda of stealing my gloves.
not_available I tell you she had your locker open, and she was very suspicious.
not_available I know you're angry at Amanda for the new chart system but to accuse her of being a thief You didn't see how weird she was acting.
not_available Can it, Jerry.
not_available I finished the work on Landis.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Two more preops, then postops.
not_available You may make your dinner after all.
not_available What'll it be? Goose in chestnut sauce or roast venison? We gotta call in our entr Áes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, Mr.
not_available DeMisa is coming back in with postoperative pain.
not_available What a pain in the ass! You assisted on his gastroplasty, didn't you? 
not_available What? Yeah.
not_available Great! When he comes in, take him.
not_available I'm already busy.
not_available I'm trying to get home for dinner.
not_available Sometimes being a Resident just sucks.
not_available So, what'll it be? Mother Goose or Bambi? Are these leads on? The leads are on.
not_available Nothing in the alpha, theta or delta frequencies.
not_available He's brain
not_available dead.
not_available Well, maybe he can be an organ donor.
not_available Not too likely.
not_available He has type AB blood.
not_available That's, what, 2% of the population? I doubt you'll find many compatible candidates.
not_available It's worth a try.
not_available Sure it is.
not_available Talk to the mother.
not_available If she won't go for it, try to persuade her to pull the plug.
not_available So much for my miracle.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, the fertility clinic just called.
not_available Your patient, David Gardner, is having an MI.
not_available His EKG was normal this morning.
not_available Is he upstairs? They're taking him to the ER.
not_available Okay.
not_available I just took an unusual complaint.
not_available An irate elf claims you tortured him with the cardioversion paddles? We differed over treatment strategies.
not_available I wouldn't quite call it torture.
not_available I know.
not_available I read the chart.
not_available He's clearly a nut case.
not_available I'm just making sure you're all right.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Although, to be honest, I could've handled it better.
not_available I'm a little off my game today.
not_available Blame it on the holidays.
not_available Is it a rough time of year for you? 
not_available Not usually.
not_available My ex
not_available wife, she sent out this newsletter saying how happy she is.
not_available I can't help but see it as her saying, "Look how well I traded up." 
not_available I got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's a tough time of year for me too.
not_available Really? This is the first Christmas since my brother committed suicide.
not_available Oh, jeez! I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was one of those apocalyptic cult things.
not_available The guys with the sneakers? Oh, yeah.
not_available I thought that was a couple of years ago.
not_available He missed the big event, so he decided to follow on his own.
not_available Wow! Sorry.
not_available I gotta say you're handling it better than I would've.
not_available I credit that to my Grandma Lee.
not_available She always 
said "Whatever life throws at you, greet it with a smile.
not_available There's nothing as contagious as a positive attitude." I think we'd all be better off if we followed Grandma's advice.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Coming through.
not_available Let's get him into Trauma 1.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gardner, how are you? My chest feels tight.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Is he your patient? Yes, and he's hyperventilating like crazy.
not_available Hook him up to a 12
not_available lead EKG and a pulse ox.
not_available Start a line.
not_available Get a mask on him.
not_available We need to get your breathing under control.
not_available Concentrate on the breaths.
not_available Let the breath out slowly.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Monitor's up.
not_available All right.
not_available Yep, pulse is up to 99.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Breathe in on the count of five.
not_available One.
not_available Two.
not_available Oh, my! You're David You're David Gardner, right? The trumpet soloist? I saw your guest performance with the Chicago Symphony.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm Kerry Weaver, season ticket holder.
not_available Breathe out.
not_available I just loved your featured performance in Mahler 2.
not_available It gave me shivers.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Where do you go next? 
not_available Boston.
not_available Breathe in.
not_available The BSO! Yes! I got your 12
not_available lead.
not_available Breathe out.
not_available David, your heart looks just fine.
not_available We'll run a few tests just to make sure.
not_available But I think that you were just having an anxiety attack.
not_available Are you a bit nervous about playing for Ozawa? Breathe in.
not_available How long have you had the pain? Ever since the surgery.
not_available I wish I'd never had it.
not_available I heard stapling my stomach would help me reduce, but I haven't lost a pound.
not_available Have you been sticking to the allliquid diet? What did you have today? 
not_available A little blended tea.
not_available What was in it? Bacon and eggs.
not_available Mr.
not_available DeMisa! But I blended it up.
not_available What else did you have? 
not_available A smoothie.
not_available And what was in that? Lowfat milk some butternut squash sweet potato pancakes, a honeyglazed ham and a caramel
not_available orange Buche de Noel.
not_available That's a full Christmas dinner.
not_available Oh, also, I'm a little backed up.
not_available What do you mean a little backed up? 
not_available Constipated.
not_available Okay.
not_available He probably busted a staple.
not_available Set him up for a gastrograph and give him a laxative.
not_available I like the chocolate ones.
not_available If that's all right? Dr.
not_available Carter I was talking to Steven and he moved his arm.
not_available He's having involuntary muscle spasms.
not_available I think he was trying to tell me something.
not_available I'm afraid that's not possible.
not_available We did a test on Steven to check for brain activity.
not_available We didn't find any.
not_available Well, then it'll take some time and Time isn't going to help.
not_available Steven is brain
not_available dead.
not_available No possibility of recovery.
not_available I know this is a really difficult thing to think about right now.
not_available One way to salvage something positive out of this is to donate Steven's organs.
not_available No, I I can't let you take out his organs when his heart is still beating.
not_available If that's the case, I'd ask you to consider signing a "do not resuscitate" order.
not_available That way, if Steven's heart fails again we won't subject him to overly aggressive procedures by prolonging his life in a vegetative state.
not_available I can hope for a miracle, can't I? Well, who do we have here? Mrs.
not_available Hutton fainted while shopping at Lakewood Mall.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry, we'll have you back on your feet in a jiff.
not_available All right.
not_available You been hitting the nitrous? You gotta greet life with a smile.
not_available I do? Yeah.
not_available A positive attitude is contagious.
not_available So why don't you tell me what happened? I went to Field's Night Before Christmas sale.
not_available It was crowded.
not_available It was hot.
not_available It was stuffy.
not_available I passed out.
not_available Very nicely put.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Why don't we order Mrs.
not_available Hutton some cardiac enzymes, CBC and a Chem
not_available 7? Hold it! How much do those things cost? Gosh! I don't know.
not_available You won't tell me? 
not_available No, I mean I really don't know.
not_available Please sit up.
not_available Oh, I got your number now.
not_available Excuse me? You think you're pretty smart, huh? Sweet
not_available talking me into buying all those expensive tests I don't need.
not_available Just trying to make a diagnosis.
not_available I'm trying to survive on Social Security.
not_available We can't all make a doctor's salary.
not_available Your insurance will pay for the tests.
not_available Oh, so that's your racket! Ripping off insurance companies.
not_available It's crooks like you that keep my premiums so high.
not_available Get me another doctor! He's the best doctor we have.
not_available Well, I don't like the look of him.
not_available The way he smiles and talks.
not_available I want another doctor! Any doctor as long as it isn't him! Mr.
not_available Gardner, your labs look stunning.
not_available We should probably wait on the cardiac enzymes before letting you go.
not_available At this rate, I should check in for the night.
not_available It would certainly save you the drive in for surgery tomorrow.
not_available No, the less time I spend here the better.
not_available No offense.
not_available None taken.
not_available So how are you feeling? Like an idiot.
not_available Here I thought I was having this big heart attack turns out I'm just a nervous wreck.
not_available If you want, you could postpone surgery.
not_available No.
not_available I have to be recovered by January 15th.
not_available I'm doing a televised special with the Boston Symphony.
not_available Oh, I'll have to mark my calendar.
not_available Symphony fan? I know very little about orchestral music.
not_available So, what do you like? Well I'm embarrassed to say.
not_available How bad can it be? I'm in a disco phase at the moment.
not_available Yes, well, I can see why you would be embarrassed.
not_available You paged me? 
not_available We've got a problem.
not_available He's stuck.
not_available Stuck? 
not_available He's wedged in.
not_available I can't get him out.
not_available What do you expect me to do? 
not_available Help me get him out? I don't have time for that.
not_available Have Maintenance take the chair apart.
not_available What? 
not_available I gotta go to the bathroom.
not_available You'll have to hold it.
not_available Help! Help me get him out, please? 
not_available Please! Okay, come on.
not_available Grab his arms.
not_available Oh, man! All right, on my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available What a waste.
not_available Why did I do it? Why did I do it? I know I know better.
not_available You tried to save a life.
not_available I let that "instrument of God" stuff go to my head.
not_available Maybe it is all arbitrary.
not_available Why does he deserve a brain hemorrhage? And why does it blow on Christmas Eve? What's the point? I got the tests back on that teenager in 1.
not_available A little Christmas present from the stork.
not_available Well, I'd better go give the good news.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available Here.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Weaver, you have to read this.
not_available Read what? A triple
not_available X sex fantasy.
not_available Excuse me? I found it in Dr.
not_available Lee's charts.
not_available It's her handwriting.
not_available "I took M.G.'s gloved hand and placed it on my heaving pink stippled breast." Why am I reading this? Don't you get it? "M.G." is Mark Greene.
not_available Come on! What about the glove reference? You have completely lost your mind.
not_available You found my notes on Mrs.
not_available Condrell.
not_available I've looked up and down.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Condrell?
