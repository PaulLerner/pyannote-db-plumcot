not_available You're probably too tired after your trip to dance.
not_available Kind of, but 
not_available So maybe later.
not_available Do you know what you're doing or not? If you have to keep confirming, you don't know what you're doing.
not_available I worked just as hard as everyone else.
not_available You have to work twice as hard, stay twice as late to be twice as good.
not_available Oh, God! The flight rotation was the highlight of my residency.
not_available I'll be thousands of feet in the air in something shaped like a potato.
not_available Well, actually, it's only hundreds of feet.
not_available Oh, God! Don't they have ambulances in this sticks? They don't have a trauma center in Boone County.
not_available If it's bad, we go.

not_available I'm flunking out.
not_available What are you working on? String theory.
not_available The multi

not_available The Riemannian manifold is "M" dimensional space that locally looks like "N" dimensional space when "M" is less than "N." Susan, take a look.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Hyperventilating.

not_available Splenic vein's repaired.
not_available What about this pancreas? I'd resect rather than do a subtotal pancreatectomy.
not_available I agree.
not_available Metz.
not_available How would you repair after resection? Interrupted horizontal mattresses and a figure eight in the pancreatic duct.
not_available 3.0 silk on a needle driver.
not_available Anything else to do? Irrigate.
not_available Run the bowel under control.
not_available Insert a Jackson
not_available Pratt drain through a separate stab wound.
not_available And use cautery instead of a scalpel to minimize bleeding.
not_available Then close.

not_available What shall we do? 
not_available What is it, Gant? Her abdomen's persistently distended.
not_available She keeps crying.
not_available Her resps are high.
not_available The BP, the pulses and color are okay.
not_available Why didn't you drop an NG? We considered it In such a small baby? 
not_available Do it off the rectal thermometer.
not_available You didn't do a full surgical evaluation of the patient, Dr.
not_available Gant.
not_available It's positive for blood.
not_available Prep a cutdown tray.
not_available Type and cross for two units and page Keaton.
not_available Where's her mother? 
not_available Trauma 1.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross and I thought it was an equivocal exam.
not_available If you don't know what you're doing, call someone who does.

not_available Your baby needs it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Cutdown tray.
not_available Use a volutrol.
not_available We may have to transfuse.
not_available Gant was on track.
not_available I talked him out of it.
not_available Hang D5, 40 normal.
not_available What do you think, Peter? 
not_available She has an acute abdomen.
not_available Hi, pretty girl.
not_available Vitals? 
not_available BP's 80 over 40, pulse 160.
not_available Resps 65, temp's 101.4.
not_available Oh, what blue, blue eyes! 
not_available 92 room air.
not_available Teacup, that's too low.
not_available Let's get her on O
not_available 2, four liters by mask.
not_available Did you appreciate the periumbilical redness? 
not_available The abdomen's a little tight.
not_available No, I missed it.
not_available Well, it's easy to miss.
not_available Why a cutdown? 
not_available No veins.
not_available Twenty
not_available two angio.
not_available This was a nice pickup, Peter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ah, yes.
not_available There we go.
not_available I couldn't see or feel a vein.
not_available It's just a matter of knowing where it is.
not_available Let's get her a cross
not_available table lateral and check for free air.
not_available Any thoughts on antibiotics? 
not_available Since you don't need anaerobic coverage on newborns, I'd go with amp and gent.
not_available Dennis, since you did the trauma assessment, why don't you scrub in? Peter, let's go talk to Mom.
not_available Good girl.
not_available There you go, Mr.
not_available Brazil.
not_available Shrimp cocktail time.
not_available Hubert Skinner, California Cryonics.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brazil.
not_available You got some kind of I.D.? 
not_available It's all there.
not_available Give him I'll pack him up, and we'll be on our way.
not_available Is he a doctor? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available What do we do? The heparin can't hurt, him being dead and all.
not_available In the newborn, I use a transverse abdominal incision.
not_available The rectus is thin so there's less pain post
not_available op.
not_available We're using a respirator, so atelectasis isn't an issue.
not_available Zap that little bleeder.
not_available Cautery.
not_available Fifteen blade.
not_available If there's a perforation we should get a gush of air when I nick the peritoneum.
not_available There it is.
not_available She's easier to ventilate.
not_available Dennis, why do we want to keep bleeding to a minimum? Transfusions are dangerous.
not_available You can't type and cross
not_available match blood because of the fetal hemoglobin.
not_available There it is.
not_available Perfed jejunum.
not_available You're teaching your interns well.
not_available He's in and out.
not_available MRI was normal.
not_available Dr.
not_available Herlihy, do you remember my name? Where's my wife and kids? 
not_available I'm Mark Greene.
not_available Your family was involved in a traffic accident.
not_available Your wife's in the ER, with a tib
not_available fib fracture.
not_available Zach had facial trauma and hemoperitoneum.
not_available He's out of surgery in ICU.
not_available Was it his spleen? 
not_available No.
not_available Pancreatic injury.
not_available What about Megan? Megan just went up to rule out intestinal perforation.
not_available Why? What happened to her? She was in the accident with you.
not_available What accident? Do you know my name? No.
not_available Should I? It's okay.
not_available Gently.
not_available To repair it, we use a 4.0 silk, interrupted Hufnagel.
not_available Field looks dry.
not_available You don't need a two
not_available layer in anastomosis.
not_available Cautery alone gives you hemostasis.
not_available Let's irrigate.
not_available Warm saline, please.
not_available Zach's abdomen is distending.
not_available Any changes in his vitals or pulse? 
not_available I think he's bleeding.
not_available Damn! Peter, do you think you're ready to finish alone? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nothing fancy.
not_available Just close.
not_available All right, people.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available One more.
not_available His abdomen is more distended.
not_available Has he regained consciousness? 
not_available No.
not_available Fourby
not_available eight.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available Completely dry.
not_available What's that? Looks like a little fiber and debris on the liver surface.
not_available Should I call Dr.
not_available Keaton? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll clean it out.
not_available Okay, got it.
not_available Let's close the peritoneum first.
not_available 3.0 Vicryl.
not_available Now, retract medially.
not_available Cut.
not_available Good.
not_available There's a little blood.
not_available Where? Oozing from the liver where you just touched it.
not_available I'll put a little pressure on it.
not_available Use suction.
not_available Gently, okay? Damn it! 
not_available It's still oozing.
not_available I'm not closing while it's bleeding.
not_available I'll put a stitch in for hemostasis.
not_available Retract caudally.
not_available Come on, Gant.
not_available Retractor.
not_available Is Anesthesia standing by? 
not_available I called them.
not_available He is distended.
not_available Vitals? 
not_available Stable.
not_available BP 90 over 60.
not_available Pulse is 96.
not_available Pulse ox is 99 percent.
not_available Should I clear an O.R.? Hang on.
not_available Disconnect the NG from the wall.
not_available Sometimes you get an erosive gastritis.
not_available Hook it back up.
not_available Clots can block the NG causing acute dilatation.
not_available Irrigate it out and crisis resolved.
not_available It's just experience, doctor.
not_available She's still bleeding! 
not_available I can see that.
not_available I'll put a gelfoam on the bleeding site.
not_available You apply pressure.
not_available Come on.
not_available Do you want me to get Dr.
not_available Keaton? 
not_available No.
not_available More suction.
not_available I'm gonna oversew.
not_available Heart rate's starting to fluctuate.
not_available Give me a bolus of normal saline, 40 cc's.
not_available The liver's so fragile, my stitch cut right through.
not_available I'm gonna take a bigger bite.
not_available Retract this way.
not_available You need to get this baby off the table.
not_available All right, bag her faster, damn it! 
not_available I'm getting Keaton.
not_available No! Go! Go! Do you think it'll help her to see her husband like this? Megan's in surgery.
not_available Zach's in ICU.
not_available Your husband got out of X
not_available ray.
not_available He's okay? 
not_available His tests are normal, but there's still memory loss.
not_available Could it be permanent? You can see these things in a concussion.
