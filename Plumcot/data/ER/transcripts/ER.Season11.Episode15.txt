not_available County? Great.
not_available Can you squeeze my hand? Yeah.
not_available Look, I don't know what that paramedic guy told you, but I'm fine.
not_available Good grip.
not_available So you can just stop doing all this and just let me up and call me a cab 
not_available and I'll be on my way.
not_available Now squeeze with your right.
not_available What did you just do?

not_available I caAnything? I caWas that my arm?

not_available Employee Health.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, do you have any dating tips for someone on a med student's budget? Yeah, don't bother.
not_available No, it's incredibly flattering.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available I'll let you know who'll be attending.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Good news? We're being honored at the Trauma Foundation dinner.
not_available Nice.
not_available Yeah, they're looking for an outstanding senior resident to accept.
not_available So why tell me? Pratt, don't fish for compliments.
not_available It doesn't become you.
not_available Eight p.
not_available m.
not_available on the 16th.
not_available Seven
not_available minute PowerPoint presentation with slides and video.
not_available Cozying up with management again? 
not_available Not in this lifetime.
not_available A bunch of us are meeting later to celebrate Weaver going on vacation.
not_available If third years are buying, I'm in.
not_available Well drinks only.
not_available Figure it'll help shore up support for my chief
not_available resident bid.
not_available Neela, what do you say? 
not_available Well, it beats going home.
not_available Is something wrong with home? Come on.
not_available We laugh, we bond.
not_available We do a little team building with our ducklings here.
not_available Sure.
not_available All right.
not_available Party on.
not_available What? The big kids aren't invited? It's like my lips are moving, but nothing's coming out.
not_available I don't feel sick.
not_available I don't feel anything.
not_available No carotid bruits.
not_available I feel something.
not_available Platelets are good.
not_available PT, PTT's normal.
not_available What do you think it is? 
not_available This is bad.
not_available Onset of symptoms is too quick 
not_available for a tumor.
not_available Aneurysm or AVM? 
not_available I'm healthy.
not_available I have three kids.
not_available I'm 35.
not_available Could be a hypercoagulable state.
not_available The kids.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available The kids! 
not_available CT's backed up.
not_available Neuro's on the way.
not_available We have a name on her yet? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Ellie.
not_available I've gotta
not_available Close your eyes for a second.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I have to tell you something.
not_available Somebody's got to pick up my kids.
not_available Orbicularis oculi deficit.
not_available Call my husband and have him do it.
not_available Think it's embolic? More than likely 
not_available to the proximal MCA.
not_available Okay? Please? I think she wants to write something.
not_available Go ahead and let her try.
not_available So TPA could reverse it.
not_available If there's no bleed and we're within three hours.
not_available But no one knows how long she's been down.
not_available Ellie, can you hear me? Yes, yes, yes.
not_available I can hear you.
not_available His name is Dan.
not_available This is his number.
not_available You had a stroke.
not_available Tell him he needs to take the kids.
not_available It's impossible to express language.
not_available So while you might be able to understand us we definitely won't be able to understand you.
not_available That's not what I wrote.
not_available What did you do? 
not_available Neuro's not coming without a CT.
not_available That's not what I wrote! We're trying to figure out what type of stroke you had 
not_available so that we can treat it.
not_available I had a stroke? See if you can track down any family members.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Old people get strokes.
not_available I mean, whatever this is it's just temporary.
not_available It has to be.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi, what's up? I'm just down on a surgical consult.
not_available Did I, by any chance, leave a watch at your place? Yeah, it's in my locker.
not_available Abby, do you still need that cath UA on Mrs.
not_available Russell? No.
not_available Clean catch.
not_available Negative dip.
not_available I brought in some lunch if maybe you'd wanna 
not_available meet up in the break room.
not_available Actually I was thinking that maybe we shouldn't be quite so together here.
not_available I thought everybody knows.
not_available I didn't tell anybody.
not_available Except maybe one person.
not_available You? 
not_available No.
not_available So, good.
not_available Your sofa getting much action these days? What? Living with Ray is
not_available How can I put it? Loud, messy and a bit crowded.
not_available I told you to take time moving out.
not_available It wasn't any better at your place.
not_available Who's next? Sixyear
not_available old with wrist pain.
not_available Is there a Clayton Davis? Over here.
not_available You Clayton? 
not_available I'm Tucker, his big brother.
not_available He's got a bump on his head.
not_available Show her.
not_available This hurts too.
not_available How did all this happen, Clayton? He fell off the kitchen counter.
not_available And who are you? 
not_available She's our sister, Bridget.
not_available Whole family's here, huh? My dad went to get some coffee.
not_available I can take Clayton in for now.
not_available But before he can be treated, your father has to sign forms.
not_available I'll go find him.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, young man, what were you doing on top of the kitchen counter? Reaching for a bowl.
not_available We were hungry.
not_available Let me find out where to go.
not_available Hi.
not_available My neighbor was brought here earlier.
not_available I have her kids with me.
not_available Her name is Ellie Shore.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available If by some chance this is a stroke it's minor.
not_available It has to be.
not_available I can think.
not_available I can hear.
not_available I can feel.
not_available CT's ready for her.
not_available Put on a monitor.
not_available Suction the secretion.
not_available Am I drooling? Yeah, I am.
not_available I'm drooling.
not_available This'll make you more comfortable.
not_available She's smiling.
not_available Maybe that means it's not so bad.
not_available She's a nurse.
not_available Maybe she doesn't know.
not_available Okay, Ellie, I'm gonna look in your mouth.
not_available All right? She's a doctor.
not_available She's not smiling as much.
not_available Maybe she's just more serious.
not_available No gag reflex.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Muscles are weak on the right.
not_available Now this one.
not_available He is gorgeous.
not_available What is he? Sixfour, 6'5"? 
not_available Tube her to be safe? Ellie, we're gonna have to put a tube in your throat to protect your airway.
not_available Can they come in? 
not_available Okay, just for a minute.
not_available Ellie, your kids are here.
not_available They are? She can hear you better if you stand there.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because your mom is having trouble moving the right side of her body.
not_available Hi, guys! Don't be scared, okay? Is that why her face looks funny? Is she dying? 
not_available No.
not_available No, she's not.
not_available Honey, Mommy's not dying.
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available When did you see her last? Right after school.
not_available She was fine.
not_available You should take them outside.
not_available Why is she doing that? Well, we just
not_available We need to help her breathing.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let the doctors take care of your mom.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Mommy.
not_available Push the etomidate and sux.
not_available You're going to sleep now.
not_available When you wake up, you'll be breathing with a ventilator.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Am I dead? Is this it? Is this death? No, something's wrong.
not_available I can't open my eyes.
not_available I can't move.
not_available Somebody help me.
not_available There's no evidence of hemorrhage, so it's probably a clot.
not_available It's too late for TPA? It can cause brain bleed if it's done after three hours.
not_available If her kids saw her a few hours ago had a rig ride ER assessment It's too close to take a chance.
not_available Well, what are our other options? Well, hope that collateral flow can develop.
not_available Get her into physical therapy.
not_available With a major stroke like this, her chances of a meaningful recovery aren't good.
not_available The only other option is the MERCI.
not_available The what? It's a catheter
not_available retrieval system.
not_available It takes you into the brain through an artery and allows you to corkscrew the clot out.
not_available And it reverses the stroke completely? It's not without risks.
not_available Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm blind! I can't breathe! Help me! Please, someone! Please, someone! Do something, please! 
not_available On my count.
not_available Someone! Can't anybody hear me? 
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Help me.
not_available Please, God.
not_available Help me! Hey, can I ask you a question? Yeah.
not_available Did you ever ask Luka about his kids? One time, I think.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available Sometimes I think
not_available Is she crying? Heart rate's up to 130.
not_available BP's 170 over 92.
not_available We have to get her to the ER.
not_available What's going on? When did we tube her? 
not_available About 10 minutes ago.
not_available Ellie, it's all right.
not_available We're gonna help you.
not_available The etomidate wore off before the sux.
not_available She's conscious but paralyzed.
not_available Okay, coming through! What's the story? Non
not_available violent demonstration got violent.
not_available Protestors went nuts downtown.
not_available That kid the cop beat up last week.
not_available This one got tear gas to the face.
not_available I was just picking up my grandma's medicine at the pharmacy.
not_available Crush injury, second
not_available degree burns, multiple minor lacs coming in behind.
not_available Mob torched cars, broke a lot of glass? Good vitals after four of morphine.
not_available I feel pretty bad.
not_available Could I get some more? Yeah.
not_available As soon as we make sure you're actually hurting, dude.
not_available Did he just withhold pain meds? I think it's safe to remove him from our shortlist.
not_available Too late.
not_available He's officially applied.
not_available What about Nichol? 
not_available Talks too much.
not_available Pattengill? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Skilled but aloof.
not_available We're in trouble.
not_available The pickings for next year's chief resident are slim.
not_available We're gonna have to look elsewhere.
not_available What about Pratt? Susan, he's the best we've got.
not_available With some serious caveats.
not_available Med students and interns already go to him with their questions.
not_available Doesn't make him a leader.
not_available Oh, God! Oh, God! 
not_available Need some help here.
not_available She's tachycardic and hypertensive.
not_available Sedative wore off before the paralytic.
not_available Help! Get her to curtain two.
not_available What? What are they saying? 
not_available She's panicking.
not_available Help! Help me.
not_available I don't want to snow her too much.
not_available We need to follow serial neural exams.
not_available Help me.
not_available Why? Help me! Why isn't anybody doing anything? I swear to God, I'm losing it! 
not_available Fent's on board.
not_available I swear to God, I'm losing it! 
not_available Ellie, it's okay.
not_available What you are feeling is a normal side effect.
not_available We gave you a narcotic called fentanyl that'll help ease your discomfort.
not_available It'll make you dizzy at first, but it'll help calm you.
not_available Okay? 
not_available What is that stuff? When the medication wears off, you'll be able to open your eyes again.
not_available Because it is good.
not_available Really good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, a moment of your time? It's okay.
not_available We got this.
not_available Neuro checks q.
not_available 10 minutes.
not_available Do you remember our abdominal wound yesterday? 
not_available Guess what we found during surgery.
not_available Liver lac? 
not_available Guess again.
not_available Spleen? Condom full of cocaine, lodged in the jejunum.
not_available Knife nicked the bag, releasing coke into the peritoneum.
not_available Explains the sympathetic overdrive.
not_available Totally fantastic case.
not_available If you write it up today there's a chance to get it into next month's issues.
not_available If Trauma doesn't bite 
not_available Annals of Emergency Medicine.
not_available You want me to? Us.
not_available I'll help you.
not_available It'll only take a couple hours.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm working.
not_available I'll talk to your superior.
not_available They're prepping my thyroidectomy.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available I'm sorry, butWhat intern doesn't want to publish? Of course, I want to get published
not_available Then it'd be idiotic to pass this up.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
not_available My office at 7.
not_available Your distal radius and ulna are fine.
not_available What's that mean? I don't think his wrist is broken.
not_available You still hungry, Clayton? We never ate.
not_available We were making dinner when he fell.
not_available So you were both helping out, were you? How very grown
not_available up.
not_available Hey, this is my dad.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, how's he doing? How's he doing? His neuro exam is normal.
not_available Looks like a mild concussion.
not_available He'll need observation at home over the next 24 hours.
not_available The wrist is probably just sprained but we'll get an x
not_available ray just to be sure.
not_available Well, whatever you need to do.
not_available Have you been drinking, Mr.
not_available Davis? I had a beer.
not_available I'll arrange for the children to get food trays while we're waiting on Radiology.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, I have a case involving a 6year
not_available old with a sprained wrist.
not_available Father appears to have been drinking.
not_available Present to Morris.
not_available I'd rather present to you.
not_available I've got six med students in my face every time I turn around.
not_available I'm not the only third year on the floor.
not_available Left side still works.
not_available Sort of.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available Try to write again.
not_available Come on.
not_available Move.
not_available Do it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Move.
not_available Twitch, jerk, anything.
not_available Your heart rate's down.
not_available Fentanyl must agree with you.
not_available Damn it! You okay in there? 
not_available The tube in my throat hurts.
not_available I can't pee by myself.
not_available Can't walk.
not_available Yeah, you got some gorgeous kids.
not_available Is she talking to me? 
not_available I cannot believe you've had three.
not_available You look great.
not_available Okay, you've seen my stretch mark.
not_available You're not talking to me.
not_available They're in our family room right now.
not_available They're hanging in there, okay? Can't they wait here? I mean, who's
not_available Who's watching? Have they eaten? Has their father come yet? Dear God, what is that? Y es.
not_available Pretty stinky, huh? Welcome to my world.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hey, Mrs.
not_available Lacy.
not_available How are you doing? Okay, let's put this up.
not_available Watch your leg.
not_available And let's get you out of this thing, okay? There you go.
not_available Must have been 500 people there.
not_available Add police presence, throw a bottle.
not_available All of a sudden there's looting going on.
not_available Not me.
not_available What are the odds I'd have gotten hit, you know? Eyes are pretty irritated.
not_available Can you follow my finger? That tear gas is some nasty stuff.
not_available Did you get a TV out of the deal? I told you, I was just walking by.
not_available All right? Extraocular movements intact.
not_available Running errands for granny during a riot.
not_available No septal hematoma.
not_available You don't believe me? Put it this way, dude.
not_available We've heard it all before.
not_available Right, Chuny? Heart rate's down to 90 after a liter.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep him in PO.
not_available D5, half of We're gonna do a CAT scan to define your injury.
not_available Then we'll send you to OR for repair.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available That guy's full of crap.
not_available Don't sweat it.
not_available I couldn't spot the con artists until my second year.
not_available I don't know the rest.
not_available Heart rate's still up.
not_available Did you give her more fent yet? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available More of that.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Twentyfive mics? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No wedding ring.
not_available Husband on his way.
not_available Can't do anything without consent.
not_available Sexy accent too.
not_available Wonder where he's from.
not_available Neighbor tracked him down.
not_available He's on his way.
not_available Feeling any better, Ellie? 
not_available What big strong hands you have.
not_available It's pathetic.
not_available This guy touches me, and my heart races.
not_available What am I, 14? 
not_available BP, 127 over 77.
not_available Actually, it's pounding now.
not_available Okay, this isn't so good.
not_available Heart rate's 240.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Looks like SVT.
not_available Get the crash cart.
not_available She's hemodynamically stable.
not_available Try meds.
not_available Six of adenosine.
not_available I'm getting dizzy.
not_available It's hard to breathe.
not_available Is it related to her stroke? No.
not_available If her atrium doesn't beat properly, there can be pooling of blood.
not_available She threw a clot, it went to her brain? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can't take this.
not_available Adenosine pushed at 18:57.
not_available Ellie, this is gonna slow your heart down.
not_available You may feel discomfort.
not_available But only for a few seconds, okay? Oh, God! What's happening? Are you her husband? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Back on SVT.
not_available Right now she's in an abnormal heart rhythm.
not_available We're trying to fix it.
not_available We believe something similar may have happened before.
not_available It would've allowed a clot to form, move to her brain 
not_available causing the stroke.
not_available She had a stroke? I need the rhythm strip.
not_available Double the dosage? 
not_available Wait.
not_available It's atrial flutter.
not_available Twoto
not_available one block.
not_available Adenosine won't convert that.
not_available Twenty milligrams Diltiazem? 
not_available Slow IV push.
not_available Can you tell me what's happening? Ellie, I'm so sorry.
not_available I know this was painful but this drug allowed us to figure out your heart problem.
not_available Now we can give you the proper medication.
not_available This one won't hurt, okay? Is she awake? 
not_available We can't be sure.
not_available But she has had spontaneous eye movement.
not_available Sinus rhythm at 76.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You can come closer.
not_available Honey? Ellie, can you hear me? 
not_available You're here.
not_available Sir? No, don't cry.
not_available No, no.
not_available There's a procedure we want to try called clot extraction.
not_available Dan? A catheter is inserted into the groin 
not_available and threaded up in the brain.
not_available The clot's identified 
not_available then a retrieval system pulls it out.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available If it works, the stroke can be reversed.
not_available If it doesn't? There are certain risks involved.
not_available Infection and complications 
not_available that may lead to coma or death.
not_available Your heart's back to normal.
not_available So she's not in a coma now? 
not_available No, no.
not_available The stroke affected the language center of her brain.
not_available So she can see and hear, but she cannot communicate.
not_available Do you want us to go ahead with the procedure? 
not_available Say yes.
not_available What happens if we don't do it? Well, her heart condition is treated, but she won't improve neurologically.
not_available But she won't die.
not_available No, Dan.
not_available Listen to what he's saying.
not_available This other thing might fix me.
not_available How long can she live like this? 
not_available I can't live this way.
not_available Indefinitely.
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available You do.
not_available Remember when we talked about your cousin? The one in the wreck? I said I'd rather die than live that way? She's not a vegetable, right? This is worse, Dan! I'm aware! I don't get to be braindead! 
not_available We can't do this without your consent.
not_available What about my consent? I consent, damn it! I consent! I consent! Is that what's best? 
not_available Dan, have some balls.
not_available If you love me, don't leave me like this.
not_available There's a chance she'll come out.
not_available Please, this once, hear me.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Ellie? Ellie? Give consent, please.
not_available Okay.
