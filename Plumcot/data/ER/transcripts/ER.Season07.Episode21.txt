not_available You should know you're being considered for chief resident next year.
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available Roger's out of town.
not_available Yeah, is he ever around? We haven't been getting along too well lately.
not_available What do you want, Kerry? 
not_available I thought you might be hungry.
not_available No.
not_available No, I'm not, and I have a ton of work to do.
not_available So Your mother was just transported to her commitment hearing.
not_available Aren't you supposed to testify? Mrs.
not_available Wyczenski is released on her own recognizance.
not_available She needs hospitalization! 
not_available I'm not debating it with you, Miss.
not_available Why do you think I'm here? Because you know she needs your help, even if she doesn't want it.
not_available I just hope you didn't order from that Thai place again.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 7x21 "WHERE THE HEART IS" Very good.
not_available My turn now? My turn? Did he finish his breakfast? No, but I got him to eat some strawberries.
not_available Cleo, he's supposed to have hot cereal before he gets treats.
not_available These are just as nutritious, if not more so.
not_available And they' re yummy too.
not_available Tell the babysitter to make sure he has a good lunch.
not_available I cancelled the sitter.
not_available What? I'm off today.
not_available Cleo, Reece needs a lot of attention.
not_available Peter, I'm a pediatrician.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, see you, man.
not_available Say, "See you at the game, Daddy.
not_available " What? I didn't say I was gonna play tonight.
not_available You're not.
not_available You're going to sit in the bleachers with Reece.
not_available Come on.
not_available It'll be fun.
not_available I'm playing first base.
not_available He doesn't have a jacket here.
not_available I'll go to Carla's and pick one up.
not_available No.
not_available You know what? I'll do it.
not_available I can go.
not_available I said I'd go.
not_available I'm on the cell.
not_available Okay.
not_available Want to play trains? God, I slept so great.
not_available And the dreams.
not_available It's so wonderful to be able to dream again.
not_available Obviously, the therapy sessions are helping, and these walks.
not_available Good.
not_available You know what? You don't have to stay home all the time.
not_available I'm sure Luka would love to see you.
not_available It's only been a couple of weeks.
not_available He's a good man.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So is your friend John.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Must be fun to have two men interested in you.
not_available Mom! 
not_available I've had men interested in me all my life, you know.
not_available Just not good ones.
not_available Actually, I think your father was the best compared to all the rest.
not_available But I certainly blew that.
not_available Think we should head home? Why is it we can't talk? 
not_available We're talking.
not_available No.
not_available I mean about important things.
not_available You know, Dr.
not_available Legaspi says it might be easier for us to do it in a therapy session.
not_available Do what? 
not_available Talk.
not_available She wants you to come to one of the sessions.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I want you to come too.
not_available You could come during lunch break.
not_available I'm gonna head back.
not_available Abby, will you come? 
not_available I'm gonna go to work.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just think about it.
not_available All right? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Can I help you? I was just dropping something off.
not_available For Kim? She's in the shower.
not_available I can give her that if you want.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I'll pass it on later.
not_available You're welcome to come in and wait.
not_available No.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Give me your name.
not_available I can tell her you stopped by.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Yeah, sorry.
not_available I need to get some lab slips.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Baby keeping you up, huh? 
not_available Not really.
not_available She slept for six hours last night, ten minutes at a time.
not_available I've been in the hall for five minutes.
not_available I can't find a doc to save my life.
not_available What do you got? Sevenyear
not_available old boy tried to put out a fire in a can.
not_available Thickness burns on both hands.
not_available Need some help? 
not_available Sure.
not_available BP, 110/60.
not_available Get it out! 
not_available Is that him? He sounds agitated.
not_available You could say that.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available You want to tell me your name? No! 
not_available It's Ben.
not_available I want this out of my nose! 
not_available That's to help you breathe.
not_available It's only for a little while.
not_available You his mother? 
not_available Neighbor.
not_available He's a friend of my son's.
not_available No answer at the kid's house.
not_available Good air entry.
not_available Both lungs are clear.
not_available Any way to contact the parents? 
not_available He just has a father.
not_available I left a message.
not_available I want to go home! 
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get it out! What do you see me in? A Beemer or a Porsche? 
not_available Most of the time I see you walking.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can forget about a ride.
not_available Carter, buy or lease? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Dave behind the wheel, huh? This is topaz
not_available blue metallic.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available I think it's out of your price range.
not_available I'm moonlighting at a doc in the box, my friend.
not_available Three months, I got my down payment.
not_available Then what happens? Fake my own death.
not_available You playing ball tonight? We'll kick Sanitation's ass.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Neck pain in Curtain 1 is asking for you.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Black or sand interior? I hope you're not keeping patients waiting while you shop for a car.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I'm all over that board, chief.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He still has to pass his driver's test.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, can I speak to you a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning, Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Hey.
not_available Deb.
not_available Could you excuse us a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Your application was intercepted by administration.
not_available Processing time has improved.
not_available You realize you're still in a probationary period? Which will be completed by the time the chief resident's slot needs to be filled.
not_available Why do you want to do this? It gets me closer to a junior faculty position.
not_available Looks good on the CV.
not_available No.
not_available I mean why risk compromising your recovery by taking on a new and very demanding position? I guess I don't see it as a risk.
not_available Having teaching and administrative responsibilities along with your clinical shifts? 
not_available I'm in the program.
not_available I've been managing my stress.
not_available I got myself back up to speed.
not_available Carter, you'd all but give up nights and weekends.
not_available It's a tremendous amount of work.
not_available I'm ready for it.
not_available We can't just gloss over what happened last year.
not_available Neither can the committee.
not_available You're returning my application? Did you honestly think that you'd make the first cut? Get your hands off me! 
not_available He's all yours.
not_available Here.
not_available Let me take a closer look.
not_available Don't touch me! 
not_available It'll feel better in a second.
not_available I promise.
not_available Mild erythema, no blistering.
not_available It hurts! Stop! 
not_available Let the doctor finish.
not_available Okay? You want to tell me what happened? No! 
not_available I think he lit the fire himself.
not_available Shut up! Why don't we get a burn tray for Ben? 
not_available Sure.
not_available He's home by himself a lot.
not_available I said shut up! I just wish he would stop hanging around my son.
not_available Hey.
not_available Good news.
not_available Our second baseman has the stomach flu.
not_available Luka, I'm not playing softball.
not_available Well, you don't have to be great.
not_available It's just for fun.
not_available Actually, I happen to play very well.
not_available So go.
not_available It'll be good for you.
not_available I can't.
not_available One night away from your mother isn't gonna do anything.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Have a good time tonight.
not_available Conni, can you dispense some ketoconazole to Exam 1? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Emergency ringworm, huh? 
not_available Pretty hard to avoid.
not_available The guy has 40 cats.
not_available You might want to give him a flea bath.
not_available So, what was going on between you and Weaver? Not much.
not_available Except for her denying my application for chief resident.
not_available Apparently, I still have a scarlet A on my chest.
not_available Wow.
not_available I'm really sorry, John.
not_available Don't be.
not_available It makes you a shoo
not_available in.
not_available There are other candidates.
not_available Not really.
not_available I guess congratulations are in order.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You deserve it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Not as much as me, but 
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's on the chair.
not_available I put a cap in there too.
not_available Good.
not_available Just stay a while, and have some coffee, maybe.
not_available You know what? I need to get back.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Roger moved out a few days ago.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available Are you sure? It would have saved us both a lot of trouble if we had just stayed together.
not_available You know, Peter? Would have been better for Reece, anyway.
not_available He said he never loved me.
not_available Carla, people say a lot of things they don't mean when they're fighting.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I think it's true.
not_available Maybe we never had anything.
not_available It will work itself out.
not_available You and I we had something.
not_available Didn't we, Peter? 
not_available Sometimes I think we still do.
not_available I'm not doing this, Carla.
not_available Peter, don't go.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available That's a nice hello.
not_available Cleo.
not_available Did you make it to Carla's yet? 
not_available A few minutes ago.
not_available Hey, how about picking up deli on the way home? 
not_available We can have a picnic on the field.
not_available Sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, why? I don't know.
not_available You sound funny.
not_available Is she giving you a hard time again? Who? 
not_available Carla.
not_available You know, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just in a rush.
not_available Reece, wait! 
not_available What's he doing? Hang on, Peter.
not_available Oh, my God! Cleo, what happened? 
not_available Is there something wrong? Read it and weep.
not_available No bleeding, no hydrocephalus, no midline shift no subarachnoid hemorrhage.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do an LP.
not_available You got a chronic neck pain patient.
not_available Wait.
not_available You want me to give a Demerol junkie a spinal tap? CTs are only 95 percent sensitive, Dave.
not_available What are you two? A tag team? I know what I'm doing.
not_available Oh, to be a junior resident again.
not_available Not.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen, can I see you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Chief residency is typically an extra year completing the emergency medicine program.
not_available In rare cases, we make an exception and allow a senior to be in the position.
not_available Right.
not_available Unfortunately, your maternity leave put you three months behind on shifts and procedures keeping you just shy of senior status.
not_available But I'm in the process of making that up.
not_available Yes, but the academic year ends June 30.
not_available And I'm planning on working every weekend and every holiday until then.
not_available Hospital policy actively discourages work weeks in excess of 60 hours.
not_available And given that limitation, it doesn't seem feasible that you'd succeed in making the deadline.
not_available And as a result, I'm afraid you won't be a candidate for chief resident this year.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know it doesn't seem fair.
not_available Wait.
not_available This is completely sexist and discriminatory! Excuse me? You all but offered me this position 
not_available prior to my pregnancy.
not_available Yes.
not_available And at that time I anticipated your completion of the program.
not_available I had a baby.
not_available I think I made a choice that was both legal and responsible.
not_available Of course you did.
not_available I made a sacrifice, largely for the sake of my career and becoming chief resident is a huge part of that.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available I'm a good doctor.
not_available I've offered to make up for lost time.
not_available And I didn't screw up.
not_available Under the circumstances, I think I deserve a chance.
not_available I appreciate your thoughts.
not_available And I'll take them under advisement.
not_available I'd hope you would.
not_available What is that stuff? 
not_available Thermazine cream.
not_available Make you feel better, and it helps keep it from getting infected.
not_available My fingers feel funny.
not_available How? 
not_available I can't feel the ends.
not_available No? 
not_available Maybe with this hand.
not_available Hey! 
not_available You know, that's not funny.
not_available Everything okay in here? Yeah.
not_available Little Ben here just tried to grab me.
not_available She was hurting my hand.
not_available Oh, yeah? Let me take a look.
not_available He says he can't feel his fingers.
not_available Here, let me see your hand.
not_available What's wrong? It hurts there, huh? Did you fall? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Let's get an x
not_available ray of this left hand just in case.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Settle down.
not_available My head.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, let me take a look at your head.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you remember when you hurt your ear? Huh? 
not_available You got a pretty bad bruise back here.
not_available Six
not_available disk CD changer, tinted windows.
not_available That'sHello? 
not_available There's an ACL tear in Exam 2.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was on my way, chief.
not_available Yeah? Dr.
not_available Malucci, you're a resident.
not_available You can't afford a car! What was all that about? Misguided sense of job security.
not_available Lot of that going around.
not_available I heard you came by the house.
not_available Yeah, I was in the area, and on a whim, I thought I'd stop by.
not_available Lori said that you had a letter, but that you didn't leave it.
not_available It just didn't seem like the timing was very good.
not_available I can see how you would feel that way.
not_available How long have you two been seeing each other? Not long.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know this must be painful for you.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available I mean, it's fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available Kerry? 
not_available You take care of yourself.
not_available You too.
not_available I've got an AMA form I need you to cosign.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to interrupt.
not_available You didn't.
not_available You two okay? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I was wondering if you could tell me how it's going with my mother.
not_available I'm sorry, Abby.
not_available I really can't discuss her therapy with you.
not_available Even if she said you said I should attend one of her sessions? I think that it would be mutually beneficial.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Could you give me a little bit of an idea what to expect? Well, it's not an ambush.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's just that she lies a lot.
not_available We meet at 1.
not_available You don't have to come if you don't want to.
not_available Still hurt? I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, baby! Look at you.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Your mommy's here.
not_available How bad is it? He's got a fracture of the fifth metacarpal.
not_available His hand is broken? 
not_available He's gonna have to wear a cast.
not_available How is he gonna sign? 
not_available He's not.
not_available All right.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Mommy's here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just looked away for a second, and he was at the piano.
not_available Listen, why don't you give us a few minutes, okay? Of course.
not_available Hey.
not_available This is your fault, you know.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Reece is not like other children.
not_available I know.
not_available Then how come you didn't stay in his eye line? It was an accident, Carla.
not_available I don't know what else to say.
not_available I feel horrible about this.
not_available I want you to stay away from my son.
not_available Carla, can we just? What would have happened if you turned away again? What would have happened if Reece had run out into the street? He is deaf! You cannot just call him! You have to be with! 
not_available All right, Carla.
not_available I don't want to see this bitch I said back off! 
not_available anywhere near Reece again! Go.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hit and run.
not_available ETA's five minutes.
not_available Kind of like waiting for thunder after the lightning strikes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi and I It ended.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Something changed? Yes.
not_available Do you love her? Then you should go forward, not back.
not_available Fiftyyear
not_available old male changing a blowout got sideswiped by a car.
not_available LOC at the scene, but started coming around in the rig.
not_available Obvious femur fracture.
not_available Vitals? 
not_available Initially, 90 palp.
not_available BP's up to 115/70 after 1500 cc's of saline.
not_available Sir, can you tell us your name? 
not_available Jim Vogel.
not_available God! My legs! 
not_available Trauma 2.
not_available Go.
not_available Serial crits, type and cross times 4.
not_available We got one more, doc.
not_available She won't come out.
not_available Restrained, but got a forehead lac from the mirror.
not_available Brother says she's developmentally challenged.
not_available What's her name? 
not_available Won't say.
not_available I'm not sure she understands the question.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Can you tell me who you are? 
not_available Jim's sister.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need to make sure you're not seriously hurt.
not_available Can you come out? 
not_available I want to go again.
not_available I'm sorry? 
not_available On a ride.
not_available It's fun.
not_available She's been smiling like this ever since I got her in the rig.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Crepitations on the right, with decreased air entry.
not_available I need that chest tube.
not_available Tachy at 110.
not_available I'll set it up.
not_available God, I can't stand it.
not_available What do you got so far? Pneumo on the right, unstable pelvis 
not_available fractured right hip.
not_available Where's Bonnie? Is that your sister's name? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Another doctor's checking.
not_available She appears to have only minor injuries.
not_available Does Bonnie have any medical conditions other than her developmental delay? 
not_available No.
not_available She's always been healthy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available It's fine.
not_available We're glad you could join us.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Please know that we both understand how awkward it can be 
not_available to step into someone else's therapy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Maggie, do you want to continue? 
not_available Sure.
not_available So Dr.
not_available Legaspi and I were talking about We talked about a lot.
not_available But we were talking about ways I could stay healthy.
not_available You know, how to position myself to get it together, keep on track.
not_available And part of that is that I've decided to go home.
not_available Have you talked to Eric? 
not_available No, not Florida.
not_available "Home" home.
not_available I'm going back to Minnesota.
not_available You haven't been to Minneapolis in 15 years, Mom.
not_available I know that.
not_available I know.
not_available I haven't.
not_available But I grew up there.
not_available And I feel like I belong there.
not_available I've got a little bit of family and some friends.
not_available What friends? 
not_available Gina.
not_available You remember Gina? Well, I'm gonna stay with her.
not_available She has a spare room.
not_available She thinks she could get me a job in the convalescent hospital where she works.
not_available Really? When did you arrange all this? Last week.
not_available I She accepted a collect phone call from me.
not_available She was glad to hear from me, Abby.
not_available She was glad to talk to me.
not_available Anyway, I'll save enough money, and I'll get a place of my own.
not_available A place of your own? 
not_available Yes.
not_available A place of my own with no roommates, no men.
not_available Just me.
not_available Maybe a cat.
not_available A cat? That would be a great pet.
not_available Cat.
not_available Are you reacting to your mother's plans? I'm not reacting.
not_available I'm just Just what? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Abby, I can't stay here in Chicago.
not_available I don't want to go to Florida.
not_available It's just too easy for me to be a drain on you and
not_available You know, I think we're way past that at this point.
not_available What is your objection to your mother going home? Nothing.
not_available It's very romantic.
not_available You're not happy about it? I don't know what you want me to say.
not_available Yippee, she's going home? Fabulous, that solves all the problems? What? Then what is your solution? 
not_available I don't have a solution.
not_available I don't I don't think there is a solution.
not_available To talk about this as if it were some life
not_available management problem that you can plan your way out of, well, it's absurd.
not_available Then what do you suggest? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You know what? I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available So I guess you're right.
not_available You have to do something, Mom.
not_available Good luck.
not_available So, what? You're leaving? 
not_available You wanted to tell me.
not_available You told me.
not_available Well, I'm not going for a week or so.
not_available Okay, great.
not_available See you later.
not_available When did Ben Fossen's father arrive? 
not_available While ago.
not_available Someone should have told me.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Derek Fossen.
not_available Thanks for taking care of him.
not_available Sure.
not_available Can we talk outside? Yeah.
not_available We'll be right outside, Ben.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Shayatovich told me about the fire.
not_available Your neighbor? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's always getting into trouble.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available His mom's out of the picture.
not_available And I think it makes him act out.
not_available Well, those burns will heal.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm just waiting on the psychiatrist to come talk to Ben.
not_available Psychiatrist? Why? We found some unusual bruising on your son, Mr.
not_available Fossen.
not_available Do you know about that? 
not_available No.
not_available You've never noticed the bruises? 
not_available Well, he gets into scrapes at school.
not_available Fights? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Any serious injuries? No more than any kid.
not_available I'm sure he'll tell that to the doctor.
not_available Look, he doesn't need a psychiatrist.
not_available And I have to get back to work.
not_available So 
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available This won't take long.
not_available We're supposed to be at the park.
not_available Is that where you were driving? Two to 4:00 we go to the park.
not_available But we had a crash.
not_available I know.
not_available My parents had a crash.
not_available When's Jimmy coming back? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Did they die in the crash? Your parents? So, what do you do in the park, Bonnie? The slide.
not_available Anything else? The swing.
not_available You know, Jimmy pushes me.
not_available Not too high, though.
not_available Do you have any other brothers or sisters? Nope.
not_available C
not_available spine is clear.
not_available No perihepatic fluid 
not_available but I can't see the spleen.
not_available Where's Bonnie? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's getting some sutures.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Minimal blood in the Thora
not_available Seal, but his repeat crit is 34.
not_available He's bleeding from somewhere.
not_available Probably here.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available You shattered your pelvis.
not_available That'll heal though, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available But the bone may be cutting an artery.
not_available We need a CAT scan to see where the bleeding is coming from.
not_available Lydia, call Radiology.
not_available Tell them we need abdomen and pelvis with contrast.
not_available Will I need surgery? 
not_available We'll know after the scan.
not_available I can't be laid up.
not_available My sister 
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available We'll try to stop the bleeding by injecting a clotting agent into the artery.
not_available BP's down to 95/60.
not_available Okay.

not_available Reece, he needs special attention.
not_available Peter, I know that.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available All right.

not_available I'm sorry about what happened.
not_available Carla gets upset.
not_available Well, I don't get called a bitch by anyone.

not_available Finding my brother.
not_available Okay.
not_available JingMei? 
not_available You're supposed to stay in that room.
not_available I have to tell my brother what I want for dinner.

not_available 0 tube.
not_available Bag him on 100 percent.
not_available Get in that line! Luka, if the tap is positive, he goes to the O.R.
not_available If not, maybe we can embolize the pelvic bleeders.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Squeeze all the blood you can.
not_available Call for eight more units.
not_available Well, the hand's okay.
not_available Look at the wrist.
not_available Is that a Colles' fracture? 
not_available Ben says he never hurt his wrist.
not_available Maybe he's too young to remember it.
not_available His dad doesn't remember, either.
not_available How did your talk go with him? 
not_available Well, he's a pretty hostile kid.
not_available Clammed up when Dad showed up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was hard to talk to him.
not_available His dad was standing outside the whole time, and Ben knew it.
not_available He's terrified of him.
not_available I think he is.
not_available But he says there's no violence in the home.
not_available You saw that bruising.
not_available That's him getting pulled by his ear.
not_available He says he doesn't remember how it happened.
not_available You don't forget a broken bone or bruising like that.

not_available sixty.
not_available Clear.
not_available I'm starving.
not_available We could pick something up from Doc Magoo's.
not_available If I were smart, I would have gone to lunch instead of getting reamed by my mother and Legaspi.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available A week ago she wanted her committed.
not_available And now she's completely on her side.
not_available It's not about sides.
not_available Well, it felt like it was.
not_available All of a sudden it was all about me.
not_available What was my problem that I couldn't get onboard with this plan she figured out? Would any plan have made you happy? 
not_available No.
not_available When was the last time your mom was in therapy? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Like ten years ago.
not_available That's different.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So you got a choice.
not_available You can either hope that she makes it this time 
not_available or give up.
not_available Right.
not_available Doesn't seem like you want to do that.
not_available I don't know what I want to do.
not_available Weaver dropped a bomb this morning.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She bagged me for chief resident.
not_available Really? Apparently my rehab has caught up to me.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available Not exactly.
not_available I guess part of facing the problem is accepting some people won't get over it.
not_available I'm sorry, John.
not_available Me too.
not_available For you.
not_available Get a 10
not_available pack of platelets.
not_available Heart's not filling.

not_available 35 minutes.
not_available Charge to 20.
not_available Jimmy? 
not_available Bonnie, you have to go outside.
not_available Clear.
not_available I don't like that.
not_available Charge again.
not_available Lydia? 
not_available I don't want you to do that.
not_available We're trying to help him.
not_available But it hurts him.
not_available Clear.
not_available It hurts him.
not_available Charge again.
not_available Clear! Heart's empty.
not_available Asystole.
not_available Should we try pacing him? Okay.
not_available That's it.
not_available Time of death 
17 10.
not_available Can you close the chest up? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Clean him up but leave the tubes in for the coroner.
not_available I'll tell the sister.
not_available Want me to come with you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm tired of it here.
not_available I think Jimmy and me should go home.
not_available The doctors are going to talk to you now.
not_available Hi, Bonnie.
not_available Hi.
not_available Bonnie, this is your brother's doctor.
not_available Is he ready to go? Bonnie, Jim was very hurt.
not_available And he couldn't recover from his injuries.
not_available Cover? 
not_available Get better.
not_available Your brother died, Bonnie.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Do you understand? Like Ernie.
not_available He died.
not_available Who's Ernie? 
not_available My hamster.
not_available We put him in a box.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, like your hamster, Jim won't be with you anymore.
not_available I got a new hamster.
not_available His name is Ernie too.
not_available You know how your parents went away? In the crash? Jimmy went away like that too.
not_available But it's library night.
not_available I know.
not_available And I get scared at night.
not_available Bonnie, you're gonna have to be very brave.
not_available Where's Jimmy? There you are.
not_available Hi.
not_available Do you have a minute? Sure.
not_available Am I in trouble or something? I don't usually do this.
not_available But I think it's important.
not_available I think you need to give your mom one more chance.
not_available Didn't I do that today? 
not_available You started to.
not_available And then you ran away.
not_available Maybe because I've heard it about 100 times before.
not_available I think this time's different.
not_available Do you? Why? Well, she hasn't been willing to go to therapy for 10 years.
not_available Now she's embracing it.
not_available I'd love to believe that meant something.
not_available Don't let your mom go away without being able to talk to you.
not_available That won't make either of you happy.
not_available I don't think "happy" is on the table.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Look, I'm not in therapy.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available But I'll consider it.
not_available What you said.
not_available Okay.
not_available She has the mind of a 7year
not_available old.
not_available And no other relatives? Her brother was her only family.
not_available I've tried ARC, Protection, and Advocacy.
not_available No luck.
not_available The facilities are all full.
not_available She'll have to take a place at a group home.
not_available No.
not_available I don't want her sent to a place like that.
not_available They've got four or five people in every room.
not_available Unless you take her home, this is all I can offer.
not_available Okay.
not_available But I don't want her sleeping on the couch or on the floor.
not_available Well, I'll pass that along.
not_available You'll have to get her there.
not_available They're too backed up to pick her up.
not_available Oh, come on! 
not_available I'm just the messenger.
not_available Look, in time she'll adjust.
not_available Adele, this stinks.
not_available They have got job
not_available training programs.
not_available Hopefully she'll learn a skill.
not_available Adele, ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's about time.
not_available Ben has not eaten since noon.
not_available We'll get him something.
not_available We'd rather go.
not_available This is Adele Neuman.
not_available She's a social worker.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, Ben.
not_available Hi.
not_available My kid does not need any more counseling or whatever.
not_available I'm afraid Ben's gonna have to stay for a few days.
not_available What? 
not_available We're taking him into custody.
not_available What are you talking about? I'm not comfortable with the bruising I found.
not_available God forbid you're not comfortable.
not_available I also found evidence of a broken wrist which neither of you mentioned.
not_available I told you that he fights! Would you tell them? 
not_available I fight a lot.
not_available If that's true, then you'll get to go home in three days.
not_available But now I need you to come with me.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available You're not doing this to us! Security! Get your hands off of me! 
not_available You don't have a choice here.
not_available If you think I hurt my kid, you're crazy.
not_available I suggest you contact a lawyer.
not_available To sue your ass! 
not_available It's for your protection.
not_available I don't want to! Let me stay with him! 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Leave him alone! No! Dad! Please! You bastard! Please! Dad! Why are you doing this to us? Dad! 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Guess what? The super finally fixed the stove fan.
not_available So I cooked dinner.
not_available Cucumber soup, a little salmon.
not_available Why don't you invite Luka to dinner? 
not_available He's playing softball.
not_available That sounds like fun.
not_available Are you gonna go? 
not_available I don't want to play.
not_available The reason why I ran out today like that is because it's just It's scary to hope too much, you know? Yeah, I know.
not_available I know I might not make it.
not_available But, Abby something happened to me in that ICU room.
not_available I realized I don't want to die.
not_available And more than that I don't want my little girl to watch me die.
not_available I can't do that to you.
not_available Not ever.
not_available That's what I wanted to tell you today.
not_available I'm gonna handle my life.
not_available And I want you to get on with yours.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can't put your life on hold anymore.
not_available It's not on hold.
not_available You won't play softball with your boyfriend.
not_available So? I don't want to play.
not_available Stop sitting things out, Abby.
not_available I don't.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available You can't use me as the reason for not doing the things you want to do.
not_available Go to medical school.
not_available That's not so easy.
not_available Get married.
not_available I was married! 
not_available Get pregnant.
not_available I was pregnant! What happened? What happened? I had an abortion.
not_available Some people aren't meant to be mothers.
not_available Abby I was a lot younger than you are now when I had my first manic episode.
not_available I've watched you since you were a little girl.
not_available You're not bipolar.
not_available No.
not_available But my kids could be.
not_available But they might not be.
not_available They could be anything.
not_available And you will just love them.
not_available That's all.
not_available You never even told Richard, did you? No, I think that was the beginning of the end for us because we just stopped talking about everything.
not_available I just was too scared.
not_available I couldn't risk it.
not_available I justI didn't want to Turn into me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Or have to end up taking care of another me? Oh, honey.
not_available Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.
not_available That's all there is is risk.
not_available You just have to take a chance and leap into life.
not_available Otherwise, sweetheart, you're gonna miss out on all the great things.
not_available Abby, you deserve all the great things.
not_available Do you hear me? But I like my home.
not_available Someone there will take good care of you.
not_available This man's gonna drive you, okay? Jimmy was gonna make me hot dogs.
not_available Take this woman to this address.
not_available Make sure she's met by an adult before you leave.
not_available Yeah, all right.
not_available Will they have hot dogs? I don't know.
not_available But I'm sure they'll have something good.
not_available Here you go.
not_available I had better go to my home.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You can't.
not_available But I like my home.
not_available I like my bed and my blanket.
not_available Bonnie, you can't live alone.
not_available But I need my blanket.
not_available Jimmy always gives me my blanket.
not_available Someone there will give you one.
not_available And he gives me hot dogs when I want.
not_available I like my home.
not_available I don't want a new one.
not_available Bonnie Zip your jacket, sweetie.
not_available It's chilly.

not_available old.
not_available Bone survey turned up bilateral healed spiral fractures of the radius.
not_available So you were right.
not_available Pin a rose on me.
not_available Kim? Hi, Kerry.
not_available This is for you.
not_available What is it? It's how I feel about things, about you.
not_available And I never really told you.
not_available And maybe it doesn't matter now.
not_available But I wanted you to know.
not_available Okay.
not_available You broke both your arms, Ben.
not_available No, they're fine.
not_available These are your x
not_available rays.
not_available These lines are fractures.
not_available That was a long time ago.
not_available I tripped at school.
not_available No.
not_available You don't get these kinds of breaks from falling.
not_available After I tripped, I fell down the stairs.
not_available No, Ben.
not_available You know what I think happened? I think somebody grabbed your arm with two hands and then twisted it like you do with a wet towel.
not_available I'm bad a lot.
not_available You are? I make too much noise playing.
not_available I leave messes.
not_available And Dad punishes you? Well, how does he punish you? Sometimes like you said.
not_available He calls them Indian burns.
not_available Yeah? It's my fault.
not_available He wouldn't do it if I wasn't bad.
not_available No, Ben.
not_available Nobody should break your arm no matter how bad you are.
not_available You understand? I don't care.
not_available I just want to go home.
not_available You can't go home right now, Ben.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Come on, Malik! Show them where you live! Run, Abby! Run, Abby! Abby, go! Abby! Way to go!
