not_available Inspiratory stridor.
not_available Aeration is terrible.
not_available Sub
not_available Q epi and get her in a trauma room.
not_available Howard? Could be an allergic reaction.
not_available Was there any food on scene? You see any bee stings? Hurry up, Howard.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Sub
not_available Q epi's in.
not_available Finally.
not_available Any medic alert bracelet? Asthma inhaler? 
not_available Didn't see any.
not_available Periorbital petechiae.
not_available Luka? Ecchymosis on the neck.
not_available Well, what's that mean? It means someone tried to strangle her.
not_available God bless America.
not_available Kerry.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available I've been calling you all day.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've been in meetings and I've got another one three minutes ago.
not_available Call my office, tell them I said to fit you in tomorrow.
not_available I need to talk about Dr.
not_available Dubenko today.
not_available How's he working out? 
not_available He's not, to be quite frank.
not_available I haven't received any complaints.
not_available Consider this your first.
not_available No one even bothered to tell me you'd hired him.
not_available That's what search committees do.
not_available You should've attended more meetings.
not_available Kerry.
not_available I missed one meeting.
not_available What did you do? Hire the only candidate I didn't endorse? Why are you taking this so personally, Elizabeth? I've got to go.
not_available I'm sure the two of you can work this out.
not_available Oh, hey, Dr? 
not_available Dubenko.
not_available Right.
not_available Sorry.
not_available John Carter.
not_available You remember the GSW this morning? Yeah, brain
not_available dead biker.
not_available His girlfriend says he wanted to be an organ donor.
not_available Great.
not_available But he's HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Well, no can do.
not_available Well, his buddy needs a liver ASAP and he's the same tissue type.
not_available It's against the law to harvest organs from an HIV
not_available positive patient.
not_available You know that.
not_available The recipient is HIV
not_available positive.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available UNOS won't approve and no surgeon's gonna operate.
not_available What's that smell? 
not_available Stink bomb.
not_available Frank! 
not_available Got it! They warned me about this place.
not_available They weren't kidding.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Carter.
not_available Maybe you can help me.
not_available I need help with a patient.
not_available I believe Dr.
not_available Dubenko is covering
not_available I don't think that he wanted to.
not_available And what is it? Too mundane for our new superstar? 
not_available I think it may be too illegal.
not_available Oh, so he's cowardly and cocky.
not_available He's the perfect complement to Weaver's treachery and ambition.
not_available I'm sorry, Carter.
not_available But I have to deal with him, so do you.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Stridor seems to be improving.
not_available Keep an eye on her pulse ox.
not_available Come and get me if she de
not_available sats.
not_available I'll notify the police.
not_available What happened to her? Hey, Luka.
not_available Hey.
not_available Alex, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be with Steven and Monique at the soccer game.
not_available I gotta find someone to cover me.
not_available Don't bother it's probably gonna suck anyway.
not_available I can take him.
not_available I'm off in 20.
not_available I was filling in for Pratt.
not_available You can pick him up at my place after work.
not_available Hey, are you busy? I need your expertise.
not_available Have Alex meet me in the lounge.
not_available Thanks.
not_available JOB HUNTERS You worked at a restaurant from the time you were 6 until 16? 
not_available It was a family restaurant.
not_available What kind? Indian.
not_available I never want to work in a restaurant again.
not_available I don't even like eating in them.
not_available You haven't worked since then? 
not_available I've been in school.
not_available Studying? Medicine.
not_available Oh, wow.
not_available I'll be honest.
not_available We don't get many doctors looking for jobs.
not_available So you placed very high on your placement test but you haven't got a lot of experience in any other service industry.
not_available No retail, no sales.
not_available Secretarial? 
not_available No.
not_available Bookkeeping? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Horticulture? Mechanics? Electrical? Perhaps we'd have better luck if you told us what you can do.
not_available Let's see.
not_available I can crack open your chest re
not_available inflate your lung and squeeze your heart back to life.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dubenko was right to pass.
not_available Why are you pushing so hard for this? Because we're this guy's last hope.
not_available Because I couldn't save his friend.
not_available Because some good should come out of this.
not_available And what if they sue? Who? His buddy wants the liver.
not_available He's not gonna live long without it.
not_available The hospital could fire me.
not_available The guy's gonna die without the liver, he's never gonna get another.
not_available They could pull my license.
not_available Unlikely.
not_available Acting in the patient's best interest.
not_available Or jail.
not_available There's already legislation allowing this.
not_available It's waiting for the governor's signature.
not_available It'll still violate regulations.
not_available I know.
not_available But it is ridiculous to let a perfectly good organ go to waste.
not_available The liver's not gonna affect the recipient the recipient's got the virus.
not_available He's got a good heart, good lungs low viral loadHow's Weaver gonna react? Well, she
not_available Yeah, she might have a little issue with this.
not_available She'll have a bloody conniption fit.
not_available Which in itself is almost worth the risk.
not_available Screw it.
not_available Screw it.
not_available Prep him.
not_available I'll mobilize the team.
not_available Sneaking tests on other doctors' patients? Ray? 
not_available You totally boned me.
not_available I felt like an idiot.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Well, you were right.
not_available Really? Check out the serum salicylates.
not_available I'll let you know next time.
not_available Don't do it next time.
not_available Where's he going? 
not_available To the O.R.
not_available Corday agreed to do the surgery.
not_available You talked her into it? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, maybe a little.
not_available So you never responded to my offer.
not_available I'll take a rain check on dinner.
not_available What about the meeting? Do you still go to meetings? 
not_available I'll go if you go.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Yeah? I see how hard you're throwing yourself into the job, Carter.
not_available It's a hard job.
not_available So is sobriety.
not_available And so is losing a child.
not_available Hey, where's Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What's wrong? I think Jane Doe's having trouble breath
not_available Call Respiratory Therapy.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Talk to your patient.
not_available And you might want to add an amp of bicarb to his IV.
not_available You need to alkalinize his urine.
not_available What? He's got a toxic aspirin level.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing here? Oh, pediatrician visit.
not_available Somebody was being checked for Pyloric stenosis.
not_available Hey, Cosmo.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Just reflux.
not_available Oh, hi, Frank.
not_available Hi.
not_available So, wow, you look great.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available How's it going? Twelve new med students.
not_available How do you think? Is Chuny or Haleh around? Yeah, Chuny's around.
not_available Why? You need a nurse? I need somebody to watch him.
not_available I could do it.
not_available Well, are you sure? Because he can be really cranky.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, yeah, of course.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, you'll need this because he spits up.
not_available That's what he does 
basically spit, poop, eat, sleep, repeat.
not_available Yeah, just like his daddy.
not_available How is Chuck taking to fatherhood? You mean motherhood? The guy's more maternal than I am.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Okay.
not_available She'll be right back.
not_available The IV's blown.
not_available I need to start another line.

not_available Oh, he should be.
not_available He doesn't stop eating.
not_available Where have you been? I was parked.
not_available I had to pee and everybody wanted to see him.
not_available What's wrong with you people? You've never seen a baby? Can you give him room? No one's wearing masks.
not_available Relax.
not_available There's germs everywhere, babe.
not_available It's good for his immunity.
not_available I called for a consult and I don't think I should have.
not_available What patient? 
not_available Which of you is Carter? I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available You know what otitis media looks like? 
not_available I do.
not_available Then teach it to your students.
not_available So they don't call me for a ENT consult every time a kid comes with an earache.
not_available She's closing up.
not_available You're not gonna get any sized tube in if you don't move.

not_available You've done that.
not_available She's gonna end up cricked if you don't move.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Now look what you've done.
not_available You ruined everything.
not_available Howard, get it together.
not_available You can do this.
not_available She messed it all up.
not_available She's bradying down.

not_available There we go.
not_available Shoot.
not_available Tough break.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You played a good game.
not_available My team blows.
not_available Every team has good and bad days.
not_available The most important thing is to try your best.
not_available Want to grab a pizza on the way home? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I can help you practice someday if you want to kick around.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I don't mind.
not_available I played football in school.
not_available I mean, soccer.
not_available I was pretty good.
not_available We could go to the park near my place.
not_available Look, Luka I'm glad we're friends.
not_available But I've got a dad.
not_available And he's coming back.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Abby saved Kovac's patient.
not_available Delayed laryngeal edema.
not_available And a freaking intern.
not_available Have you seen Howard? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Hey, Abby? 
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Could you show me how to use the slit? 
not_available Not now.
not_available You need something? Think you could get me her phone number? What's going on, Howard? Just needed some air.
not_available Sometimes it's olfactory overload.
not_available I was talking about the trauma.
not_available You were looping in there.
not_available Checking things three or four times, repeating your actions.
not_available I like to be thorough.
not_available Come on.
not_available What is it? Sometimes I get nervous.
not_available It didn't seem like nervous to me.
not_available Do you have OCD? I've got to get back to work.
not_available Yo, doc.
not_available The freak in the cape just put his hand through the window to Exam 2.
not_available All right.
not_available Set him up for sutures in Curtain 1.
not_available I gave Mr.
not_available Ogilvie too much oral contrast.
not_available Can I ask you a question? 
not_available No.
not_available My patient has a 2
not_available inch head lac.
not_available Should I use 3.0 Prolene or 4.0 to suture? Doesn't anyone knock anymore? Chuck? What are you doing? Oh, it's a supplemental nursing device.
not_available What? You've never seen a father breastfeed his kid? 
not_available Can't say that I have.
not_available I tell you, these things are amazing.
not_available It allows the father to bond the same way the mother does if you can get past sore nipples.
not_available You want to give it a shot? 
not_available No.
not_available My patient has a head lac.
not_available Should I use 3.0 Prolene or 4.0 to suture? Hey, Rockheart.
not_available What did you call me? 
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Are you heading home? That's what most of us do 
not_available at the end of our shift.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, I'm sort of in between places right now.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.
not_available Can I buy you dinner? Make it up to you? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available You were right.
not_available It was altered from an aspirin overdose.
not_available The more he popped, you know, the more his knee hurt.
not_available He was popping them like M&amp;M;'s.
not_available You might want to suggest endoscopy.
not_available He probably ate out his stomach lining.
not_available How well do you know Howard? 
not_available Not very.
not_available Why? He doesn't seem a little strange to you? 
not_available How so? Maybe a little obsessive or compulsive.
not_available He froze in a trauma today.
not_available You've been in thousands of codes he's probably seen six.
not_available Cut the guy some slack.
not_available You don't think I should mention it to an Attending? What are you? The hall monitor? Brauts? 
not_available I like to live dangerously.
not_available Come on, you got to wolf down a few dogs on the Fourth.
not_available It's tradition.
not_available Didn't she used to work in the hospital? Neela? Hello, and welcome to Jumbo Mart.
not_available Can I help you? What are you doing? 
not_available Working.
not_available Here? We have a special on our cupcakes.
not_available Buy two, get one free.
not_available Oh, sweet.
not_available When you said you were looking I thought you meant at another hospital or a clinic maybe.
not_available Well, I didn't have much luck.
not_available You only looked for one day.
not_available This is the only job I can get because I'm a loser.
not_available You are not a loser.
not_available At least you're close to the hospital.
not_available Which is as close as I'm ever gonna get.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I blew it.
not_available I blew everything.
not_available I've got no job, no apartment, no money.
not_available I mean, look at me.
not_available I'm not even American.
not_available Oh, you are going down, you little freak.
not_available You suck.
not_available You're worse at this than at soccer.
not_available Bite me, you Slav bastard.
not_available Alex.
not_available What did you just say? What? What did you say? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I heard you.
not_available You heard him.
not_available What did he say? 
not_available I didn't hear.
not_available Might have been the game.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm pretty sure you heard the game, Mom.
not_available Yeah, well, I don't want to hear that kind of talk out of you or you.
not_available How was the game? 
not_available We lost.
not_available Yeah, but he played well.
not_available Still lost.
not_available Well, maybe next time.
not_available Come on, grab your stuff.
not_available After this game.
not_available Alex, please, now.
not_available Or else I'm gonna fall asleep right here on this couch.
not_available You can stay here for tonight.
not_available Plenty of room.
not_available Actually, you can stay as long as you like.
not_available Well, that's something that me and Alex would have to talk about first.
not_available Talk about what? Talk about you getting your butt in gear.
not_available Kramer can go home.
not_available Balmore's waiting for a transfer to the jail ward.
not_available Henderson needs a monitored bed or the morgue if he doesn't get admitted soon.
not_available Where is Ray? 
not_available Try the roof.
not_available What's he doing? 
not_available I think he lives there.
not_available He lives in the call room.
not_available He just cooks on the roof.
not_available What are you doing? Just chilling.
not_available Looks like you're all moved in up here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, the rent's right.
not_available And, hey, you can't beat the view.
not_available While you've been up here on your little cookout your patient has been circling the drain.
not_available He needs dopamine and a trip to the ICU.
not_available He's a DNR.
not_available His daughter's bringing the paperwork from Milwaukee.
not_available Want a beer? No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I can throw on a dog.
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available I heard about your son.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's got to be hard.
not_available Sometimes.
not_available You aren't living in the hospital, are you? Why? Would that be a problem? Might be a problem for Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available She has the place sprayed for interns.
not_available Hey, dude.
not_available Check it out.
not_available Happy Fourth of July.
not_available Yeah, you too.
