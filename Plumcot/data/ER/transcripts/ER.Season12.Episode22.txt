not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available What's with the cross? 
not_available The chaplain gave it to me.
not_available Are you keeping up on your Bible studies? 
not_available I wasn't faking.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Get it off me! Weaver knew he had problems before she hired him.
not_available Now we're paying for it.
not_available Well, Luka, it's your ER.
not_available Have you any idea why Michael went back to Iraq? The boy's his father's son.
not_available Soldier's gotta go where they tell him to.
not_available Why don't you explain why he's not here with his wife? The secretary of the Army would like to express his deepest regret that your husband, Captain Gallant, was killed in action.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 12x22 "21 GUNS" So we can't even send anything, or? 
not_available Flowers? Donations? There's gonna be a memorial next week.
not_available For today, Neela and the Gallants wanna have a private graveside ceremony.
not_available Family only.
not_available And you.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available She needs somebody to lean on right now.
not_available Plus, Mike and I were tight.
not_available Let her know we're with her.
not_available And tell her to not even think about coming back until she's ready.
not_available All right.
not_available I should get out of here.
not_available Car's picking me up.
not_available I need to be there by 9.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, that was Dr.
not_available Anspaugh's office.
not_available He's waiting for you upstairs.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Yep.
not_available This is Mary Warner.
not_available She's an EMT trainee from Mitchelson.
not_available Hi.
not_available My program sent me over to spend the day taking vitals or whatever.
not_available For credit.
not_available Of course.
not_available Somebody needs to sign this at the end of the shift to say that I was here and did stuff.
not_available What would you like to do? 
not_available Let her shadow.
not_available See how different nurses do the primary.
not_available That's what my instructor suggested.
not_available Well, patients come in through the triage desk here.
not_available Waiting's out there, and ambulance runs come in just outside those doors there.
not_available Right, I got it.
not_available How long you wanted to be an EMT? Oh, not long, actually.
not_available I got tired of retail.
not_available Christmas sucked.
not_available Sam, this is Mary Warner, she's studying to be an EMT.
not_available Hey.
not_available I've got to irrigate a full
not_available body road rash on an unfortunate Vespa driver.
not_available I got the mother of all meth mouths here.
not_available So? Can you let Mary observe you for a while? 
not_available Haleh.
not_available I'll come and get her as soon as I'm free.
not_available Haleh.
not_available Bye.
not_available Yuck.
not_available Yep, that's the magic of meth.
not_available Corrosive substances in the drug eat away at the tooth enamel.
not_available Plus, I have a feeling Mike here hasn't been flossing.
not_available Have you, Mike? It's not really a priority.
not_available Dude, you gotta floss every day.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available So how's she doing? I left messages, but haven't heard back.
not_available Amazingly well, actually.
not_available Well, she's tougher than she looks, huh? Yeah.
not_available I'll try calling her again.
not_available Ray, I think she needs some space, man.
not_available Yeah, but I just thought that
not_available Look, she I just don't think that you should, uh What? Complicate it.
not_available You Dr.
not_available Pratt? 
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Where's Neela? Dr.
not_available Rasgotra has asked that we go on to the cemetery without her.
not_available She said she's not feeling up to it today.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Bob Vila, look out.
not_available It's not finished yet.
not_available Looks pretty finished to me.
not_available Well, either I've been sleeping for days, or you're working really fast.
not_available How's the insomnia? I kept thinking about Gallant and Clemente.
not_available It's a lot.
not_available I went with yellow.
not_available Because we don't know is it gonna be blue or pink.
not_available What's it gonna be, huh? Blue or pink? Hello.
not_available Is it just me, or are pandas kind of creepy? Wow, they're terrifying.
not_available Hey.
not_available Steady.
not_available Hello.
not_available Listen, I know we don't say it, because I guess that's just how we are but I hope you know how much I love this.
not_available All of this.
not_available But since we are on the cusp of this hugely lifealtering event and we haven't been as specific as we could be about us about our relationship
not_available You're right, let's get married.
not_available Donald, oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
not_available I didn't realize we were having a pre
not_available meeting.
not_available I went to your office
not_available Have a seat.
not_available I wanted us to talk prior to the session with the Medical Executive Committee.
not_available The fallout from Clemente may be more significant than I thought.
not_available I've been hearing things.
not_available What kind of things? This is a letter from an attorney representing Mr.
not_available Fred Fong a patient Clemente saw a few weeks back.
not_available Yes, diabetic with a gangrenous toe.
not_available I've reviewed the case.
not_available Ended up needing an amputation.
not_available A reasonable outcome for which Vic was completely blameless.
not_available The family sees an opportunity.
not_available You know, can we talk in private? I'm sorry.
not_available Hospital policy.
not_available I need this conversation documented.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente was cleared by the Impaired Physicians' Committee.
not_available He never once tested positive for drugs.
not_available I don't believe he compromised patient care.
not_available I'm not sure that that matters.
not_available The state board posts a bad
not_available doctor list on their website, and Clemente's on it.
not_available Any idiot with a computer has access.
not_available Doesn't give them legal cause.
not_available Let's let the lawyers determine that.
not_available In the meantime, the board feels let down.
not_available They expect their chief of staff to exercise the utmost discretion in hiring.
not_available I needed an Attending, Donald.
not_available I hired the best doctor I could find.
not_available Even when you knew his history? What happened in Newark? I'm tired of hearing about Newark.
not_available That was a very complicated situation.
not_available Very unclear.
not_available There were lots of unsubstantiated allegations.
not_available You should have kept your eye on him.
not_available You know, I'm not down there, Donald.
not_available I don't run the ER anymore.
not_available Which leads me to a second issue.
not_available The board has concerns about Dr.
not_available Kovac's ability to manage the department.
not_available You're not serious.
not_available Are you satisfied with the job he's doing? He's doing the best he can with what he has.
not_available Keep him on 100 percent.
not_available Six of Pavulon.
not_available I gave him Norcuron.
not_available Fine.
not_available Dopamine to a systolic of 100.
not_available Did you call the ICU? 
not_available Ten minutes ago.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Let's find him a monitored bed until we get a room.
not_available I'll put him in 2.
not_available Cold shoulder, huh? Well, not exactly the answer I was hoping to hear.
not_available Well, not exactly the best proposal I've ever heard.
not_available How many have you heard? Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Okay, so you don't know what you want this to be.
not_available I don't wanna get married for the sake of getting married.
not_available I tried that.
not_available Don't we love each other? It's not about that.
not_available Of course we do.
not_available Don't you think we should stay together forever? I don't know if anybody should, or can
not_available Paging Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available I just
not_available Let me get through one humongous life change at a time, okay? Luka, got a minute? Yeah.
not_available Sometimes it's easier if you lump them all together.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's the hip? 
not_available Good, thanks.
not_available Better all the time.
not_available Looks like you'll be short an Attending after all.
not_available I have to attend an emergency Med Exec Committee meeting.
not_available Risk Management is coming to advise us on the Clemente situation.
not_available What situation? He's gone.
not_available Well, there's potential litigation.
not_available We're getting some heat about it.
not_available We are getting some heat? It's your department.
not_available Kerry, he was your hire.
not_available He was on staff even before I moved up to this job.
not_available Yeah, I know that, I'm the one who moved you up.
not_available So, what, I should have fired him sooner? The warning signs were there.
not_available You had the authority.
not_available Am I gonna lose my job over this? Look, all I'm saying is, if I weren't chief of staff I'm not so sure you'd be department head.
not_available So let's just get through this, okay? Neela.
not_available You know, I'm not used to getting stood up.
not_available I'm not going, Greg.
not_available It's gonna be fine, I promise.
not_available Well, going means saying goodbye, and saying goodbye means forgetting.
not_available It doesn't have to.
not_available I can't help it.
not_available It's started already.
not_available I can't remember his hands, his voice.
not_available Can I come in? I keep asking myself why he went back.
not_available It's like a hammer in my head.
not_available He did what he wanted to do.
not_available What he needed to do.
not_available It's not a bad way to go.
not_available He was 29 years old, Greg.
not_available He was blown up by a bomb.
not_available It's a tragedy, and believe me, I'm not saying it isn't but Michael, he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself.
not_available Now, two months ago, I would have laughed at that.
not_available But now Look, he put himself out there, and sometimes that means taking risks and doing things that you could never imagine yourself doing because you have this crazy idea that you just might be able to make a difference.
not_available Nobody wants to forget Michael.
not_available We all wanna remember him.
not_available And that's exactly what today is all about.
not_available Smart, uh, efficient, um 
not_available Loyal friend.
not_available Something sexier.
not_available Sexier? 
not_available Something about my charm.
not_available Like a man whose charm with women is matched only by his sensitivity to his patients.
not_available Yes, action.
not_available This is stupid.
not_available Forget it.
not_available What? Abs, this is it.
not_available Don't call me Abs.
not_available I am out of here.
not_available You're not gonna have Archie to kick around.
not_available Abs? Can't blame a guy for wanting memories.
not_available You're not going to Kilimanjaro.
not_available You're going to Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.
not_available Seven city blocks from here.
not_available Six and a half.
not_available Besides, people don't make memory videos unless they're getting married.
not_available I'm a sentimental guy.
not_available And they don't film them themselves so the person is held hostage to say nice things.
not_available Really? You didn't seem held hostage.
not_available I expected better material out of you.
not_available Well, you were feeding me the lines, Fassbinder.
not_available Oh, what was that? Some kind of nasty Croatian word? Something about me and a goat? 
not_available This is Timmy Jankowski.
not_available Overindulged at the buffet at his school's spring pageant.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Fruit salad.
not_available You must be the funny guy.
not_available School nurse brought him in.
not_available As this is my last day, and seeing that I am chief resident, I designate Lockhart.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available I'm out of here in 10 hours.
not_available I call no kids for the duration.
not_available I'm sick of getting bit, kicked and pissed on.
not_available Guess you stopped dating too, huh? We got a 71year
not_available old male found slumped over in a parked car.
not_available GCS, 224.
not_available Okay, put him in Curtain 1.
not_available I'll try to be right back.
not_available Take it easy, Timmy.
not_available Easy? I'm a freaking strawberry.
not_available Stomach hurts pretty bad, huh? 
not_available Kind of.
not_available Hm.
not_available Well Here.
not_available Try pinching yourself.
not_available Here, let me do it.
not_available Ow! That hurts.
not_available Well, you're not thinking about your stomach now, are you? When Mitch didn't show up for the bus trip to Bloomington we knew something was wrong.
not_available They're part of the same church group.
not_available Mitch.
not_available Mitch, can you wake up for me? We prayed and prayed, and then we started seeing things.
not_available Everybody thought he was dead.
not_available But we found him.
not_available Our visions led us right to him.
not_available A half a mile from the church.
not_available Can you save him? 
not_available We're gonna do our best.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available And, uh You should be very, very proud, Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Morris.
not_available Okay, cut.
not_available Mama Morris is dead, so can we take that one more time? 
not_available Holly says they need us in Exam 3.
not_available Holly? You know, that other nurse.
not_available Haleh? I gotta go.
not_available The old lady in 3's still waiting on her rectal.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Not on my last day.
not_available No rectals, no geezers.
not_available Any patients you're willing to examine? Yeah, hot chicks.
not_available I got the vitals like you asked, on the medium timer.
not_available Mediastinum.
not_available Mediastinal mass.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Had to pry her cell phone off her ear to check her temp.
not_available Mary
not_available She thinks I'm a bitch but this is a hospital, we've got a job to do.
not_available Did you write this? BP, 28/17? Did I do it wrong? not eating Jell
not_available O or chatting on your cell phone.
not_available Sorry, I'm new to this.
not_available Is that her? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She look dead to you? 
not_available Not right now.
not_available Before you take more, you need to know what's normal and what's not.
not_available And if you're not sure, then get some help, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's see what we got in here.
not_available Hey, what do you have? 
not_available Obtunded with bradycardia.
not_available I need 0.5 of atropine, CBC, Chem
not_available 7, ABG, tox screen and set up for transcutaneous pacing.
not_available Okay, got it.
not_available No gag, I have to tube him.
not_available What happened? Eight
not_available oh and a Mac 2.
not_available He must have passed out at the wheel.
not_available Not from drinking.
not_available He's not like that.
not_available Atropine's in.
not_available Have another dose ready.
not_available I need suction.
not_available Is he taking any medications? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Maybe something for his pressure.
not_available Yes.
not_available Right? Pressure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Heart rate's down to 38.
not_available Damn it, his IV blew.
not_available We lost the pulse.
not_available Start compressions, he needs to be paced.
not_available You know CPR, right? 
not_available Uh, yeah, a little.
not_available Good, go.
not_available So how did you audition for this role? I didn't.
not_available I wanted to be the bad bunny.
not_available I wanted to be the Cowardly Lion once, but I had to play a Munchkin.
not_available They cast you as a Munchkin? It was before my growth spurt.
not_available Okay, no tenderness, guarding or rebound.
not_available Think you could eat a Popsicle, help settle things down? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Strawberry? Ah, and here comes our trusty paramedic, Brian Dumar wheeling in another needy patient.
not_available Twentyeightyear
not_available old, blunt head trauma, altered LOC, vitals stable.
not_available Bitch
not_available sucker.
not_available Rabid dog, I'll send you to hell! Nasty fight in detention.
not_available Partner's behind me.
not_available Okay, Trauma 2.
not_available Ray will be right there.
not_available What? 
not_available No prisoners, man.
not_available I called it, last day.
not_available I'll send you all to hell! You kiss your cellmate with that mouth? 
not_available I'm right here, you dumb bastard! that opened up a recent surgical scar.
not_available BP, 124/78, pulse, 98.
not_available Your belly hurt? 
not_available Hey, put me with him.
not_available Nice to see you.
not_available Recovering from an appendectomy.
not_available Must have ripped open his stitches.
not_available Okay
not_available Oh, yuck.
not_available Yeah, that's not good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ray Barnett will be right with you.
not_available How long do I have to keep this up? 
not_available Epi infusion, 10 mics per minute.
not_available He's very healthy, Mitch is.
not_available I ain't going anywhere! 
not_available Even virile.
not_available Okay, tell me.
not_available Bradycardic arrest.
not_available No response to atro, no capture with pacing.
not_available I'm behind you, you bastard! What are you doing? 
not_available CPR.
not_available You can't possibly hope to perfuse the brain that way.
not_available Fuse the what? 
not_available Okay, step back.
not_available Step back.
not_available Who is she? 
not_available Who are you? That's Mary.
not_available She's an EMT trainee.
not_available She's shadowing the nurses today.
not_available Then you should be showing her the right way to do things.
not_available Okay, Mary, I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I'm the Attending physician and the ER chief, so let me train you a bit.
not_available Hundred times a minute, and you should really compress the chest.
not_available There'll be a military honor as requested.
not_available I didn't request that.
not_available Colonel and Mrs.
not_available Gallant requested it, ma'am.
not_available Sounds like something he might want.
not_available After the ceremony, we'll head out to the reception in Lincoln Park.
not_available Canapés will be served.
not_available Bed will be ready in half an hour.
not_available Sedation's off.
not_available He's trying to extubate.
not_available Give him a few minutes, then you can pull it and send him up.
not_available Hey, Luka, can I get a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available His heart's beating well now.
not_available It looks good.
not_available You hear, Mitch? You're okay.
not_available Probably took too many pills by accident.
not_available Oh, he gets confused sometimes.
not_available Can we go now? Take him home? No, probably not for a couple of days.
not_available Something the matter? 
not_available There's something bad here, I can feel it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Heh
not_available heh.
not_available I feel that every day.
not_available Is everything all right with your baby? It's fine.
not_available Are you a believer, dear? You must be very brave, then.
not_available I could never have brought a child into this world if I didn't have faith 
not_available In a higher power.
not_available in a higher power.
not_available Amen.
not_available I'm sorry about in there.
not_available You're a senior nurse, I expect you to know what's going on around you.
not_available I want you to be exact about meds.
not_available I know, it's
not_available I guess that that girl is kind of dragging me down.
not_available I'm sure you'll whip her into shape.
not_available My bad, I guess.
not_available He sure is a gloomy Gus.
not_available Needs to lighten up a bit, doesn't he? It's his department.
not_available Hey, Sam, you got a minute? I may have to tube this guy.
not_available I need you to draw up induction meds.
not_available Steve's here? Yeah, he got in a little jail
not_available yard altercation, but he's okay.
not_available Belly's benign.
not_available Looks like superficial dehiscence.
not_available Does he need anything? Look, I'll get somebody else to redress the wounds, okay? I'll get you a CPR dummy, okay? After this.
not_available You can practice compressions in the lounge.
not_available I think I've had enough CPR for one day.
not_available GCS is 11, and resps are shallow.
not_available Sometimes, if you hit your head, you can stop breathing.
not_available So then you do mouthtomouth? 
not_available No.
not_available We put a tube in his trachea and breathe for him.
not_available This is vec.
not_available It knocks him out so we can do the intubation.
not_available 132/84.
not_available Good.
not_available Pulse ox is up to 99.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Let's lay off the tube for now, he's doing okay.
not_available Doc, how long I gotta wait on Miss Congeniality here? He needs to be admitted for observation.
not_available Jerk
not_available off.
not_available Come on, Hendricks, we're missing lunch.
not_available Gumbo Thursday.
not_available Hey.
not_available As long as they're here, they're patients, not prisoners.
not_available Sorry, but they're always our prisoners.
not_available Been a while since I seen that.
not_available What? 
not_available Compassion.
not_available Flank party.
not_available Ready.
not_available Ready, aim, fire.
not_available Ready, aim, fire.
not_available Ready, aim, fire.
not_available Neela, it is too dangerous over there.
not_available It's too dangerous for me, but it's okay for you? What a load of crap.
not_available Neela, I am a soldier, remember? You're also a husband, remember that? Seems kind of silly now, but out in the bay this morning, I was, uh I was thinking about asking you out.
not_available I was thinking of saying yes.
not_available Ready, face.
not_available You better come back.
not_available You know that, don't you? Yeah, I will.
not_available You ready? Goodbye, Michael.
not_available How am I doing? 
not_available Your CT's normal.
not_available But it looks like you'll be spending the night.
not_available Lucky me.
not_available Yeah, well, you've got a standard
not_available issue jump suit an armed guard, and a major head injury.
not_available You're not the luckiest guy in the world? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Could be worse, could be dead.
not_available No arguing that.
not_available Dead would be bad.
not_available Hey, it's the other guy who started it.
not_available Is that so? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've made mistakes, but that guy's a wrong number.
not_available I'd stay away from him.
not_available Thanks for the advice.
not_available I'm gonna go check on the guy in Sutures.
not_available Does he get a bandage on that? 
not_available Just a little Neosporin.
not_available Oh 
not_available And we're gonna need some urine.
not_available I'll check his vitals.
not_available You said every 30 minutes.
not_available It's been 35.
not_available I'm not peeing in front of everyone.
not_available Use the screen.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I'm getting to be like a regular.
not_available Leave the nurse alone.
not_available It's all right.
not_available We know each other.
not_available What is that? It's called a moistto
not_available dry dressing.
not_available We soak gauze in saline, then pack it in the wound.
not_available How'd you do this? 
not_available Jerk tried to shiv me.
not_available What, Bible group got out of hand, huh? 
not_available He was trying to snag my smokes, man.
not_available These dudes will beef it up over anything.
not_available Thought you were trying to turn around.
not_available I am, Sammy.
not_available I really am.
not_available Then you gotta stay out of trouble.
not_available Hey, BP's 125 over
not_available Nice and easy, dumbass.
not_available Pull the blinds, now.
not_available Are you out of your mind? 
not_available Pull the blinds, bitch.
not_available "Handsome.
not_available Sensitive.
not_available Macho?" What is this macho? 
not_available Thank you, Sveta, that's good.
not_available Dude, I slayed him.
not_available No, no, he's still moving.
not_available Look.
not_available But I cut off his head.
not_available Well, I got to the Oblivion Gate long before you did anyway.
not_available Don't cheat, Jerry.
not_available I'm gonna move your old guy.
not_available The cops are coming.
not_available What for? There was a missing
not_available persons report.
not_available I gotta follow it up.
not_available Who did the workup on migraine guy? Sam and Mary.
not_available These vitals are completely wrong.
not_available Where's Sam? 
not_available In with prisoner number one.
not_available What? Yeah, Steve and another guy came in.
not_available I guess they had some sort of jail fight.
not_available Steve is here again? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Here's how this is goes.
not_available You're gonna walk us out like old Steve's going back.
not_available This is it, Steve.
not_available You cross this line, there's no stepping back.
not_available They got me, Sam, on all kinds of stuff.
not_available You are such an idiot.
not_available I ain't getting out any time soon.
not_available That is what you deserve! Hey, hey, kids.
not_available Can we move this thing along? If there's anything we haven't anticipated, this is the time to mention it.
not_available Hey, open up.
not_available Um, just a second.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hi.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Sit down.
not_available Come here.
not_available Sit down, now.
not_available Babe, tape him up.
not_available No! No, don't shoot! Luka! 
not_available Shut up, shut up.
not_available Luka.
not_available Stop! What was that? 
not_available The crap you were gonna give Rafe.
not_available Vec? You gave him vec? Get me the ambu
not_available mask.
not_available This thing? 
not_available Yes.
not_available That was vecuronium.
not_available You were gonna give it to Rafe.
not_available To knock him out.
not_available It paralyzes muscles, he's not breathing.
not_available Let's go, Sam.
not_available He'll be paralyzed for the next half hour.
not_available Good.
not_available His diaphragm isn't working, okay? 
not_available He's gonna asphyxiate.
not_available Not our problem.
not_available Look, if you leave him here, in five minutes, he'll be dead.
not_available He needs to be intubated, please.
not_available You want a murder rap? We're not killers, man.
not_available Let me fix him up.
not_available I swear, I promise you if you let me fix him up, I will walk you right out of here.
not_available Mary, go get the van.

not_available You could have kept him here.
not_available You could have saved him.
not_available Neela, sit down.
not_available But instead, you made him want to go back.
not_available For what? Because there was something noble in it? Why did you do that? When it would have been just as easy to convince him to stay for a much better 
reason Because we loved him.
not_available Because we loved him.
not_available Neela, come on.
not_available Let's go for a walk, okay? I can't see anything.
