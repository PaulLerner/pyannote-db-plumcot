not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available No, I work at a burger joint.
not_available Caught myself by putting my hands on the grill.
not_available You're too young to have high blood pressure, E.
not_available This is my dad.
not_available Hi.
not_available The longer you stay, the harder it's gonna be on him when you leave.
not_available Well, maybe I won't leave this time.
not_available She left the money to me.
not_available She left the house to me.
not_available She trusted me to make the right decisions.
not_available I doubt she'd agree that's what you're doing now.
not_available Pleasure meeting you.
not_available I look forward to getting the wedding announcement.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 10x21 "MIDNIGHT" What else did we get? 
not_available Another book from Elizabeth Corday.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Who's that? Surgeon.
not_available British.
not_available The American Way of Birth.
not_available Don't let Dr.
not_available Ford catch you reading that.
not_available Oh, yeah? Why not? Because it argues that the shift from home births and midwives to hospital births and C
not_available sections is the result of American OBs' greed.
not_available All right, what do you think? 
not_available I'll read it today.
not_available No, about the paint.
not_available Maybe something with more blue.
not_available Maybe? You know, Americans are way too neurotic and technology
not_available reliant.
not_available I mean, with all your money and equipment your infant mortality rate is still terrible.
not_available Oh, you'd rather be back in Kivu, giving birth on a concrete floor? You're, like, 34th or something, behind Guam.
not_available I like the second one.
not_available Too much gray.
not_available Well, why don't we ask George? George? You don't like George? 
not_available Oh, please.
not_available I like George.
not_available It's the name of first president of the United States, the quiet Beatle.
not_available Current occupant of the White House.
not_available Well, no name is perfect.
not_available Hey, George.
not_available It's Dad.
not_available Listen, would you rather be born on the filthy dirt floor of a primitive mud hut in Central Africa, or
not_available ? I do not live in a mud hut.
not_available Or in a modern hospital surrounded by the finest doctors and equipment in the world? Kick once for America, twice for the mud hut.
not_available I resent your characterization
not_available He's deciding.
not_available He's not deciding.
not_available He's deciding.
not_available You know what, he's sleeping.
not_available No.
not_available I'm back.
not_available Hey, you get there in time? Yeah.
not_available It's a nice
not_available looking school.
not_available It's kind of heavy
not_available duty security, though.
not_available They have a drug shootout there recently or something? What the hell is this? Honey, you knew what that was when I met you at 15.
not_available Where did he get it? He saw it with my stuff, and he wanted to know what it was.
not_available So you gave it to him? 
not_available He knows not to take it to school.
not_available A condom? Hey, look.
not_available Come on, I'm sorry, all right? It's no big deal.
not_available I shouldn't have had the thing in my damn pocket.
not_available Picked up a few, just in case.
not_available You're not on the pill right now, right? 
not_available Me? A boy can dream, can't he? You look good, baby.
not_available I missed you.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available What you like.
not_available It's still what you like, isn't it? No.
not_available I gotta go finish laundry.
not_available Hey, can you hang with Alex tonight? I got something I gotta do.
not_available A date? Yeah, sure.
not_available I can't believe we graduate tomorrow.
not_available Neither can future patients.
not_available Today, ill
not_available prepared students.
not_available Tomorrow, doctors with the fate of countless helpless victims in incapable hands.
not_available They ought to make them wear caution signs.
not_available " 
Danger New Doc" in big letters on your coats.
not_available Thanks for the pep talk.
not_available Happy to lend encouragement to the newbies.
not_available Jerk.
not_available Bastard.
not_available How long will it take me to get to O' Hare at midnight? Midnight? 
not_available My family's arriving from London.
not_available I had to get the cheapest flight.
not_available How many are coming? 
not_available Nineteen.
not_available How many? Really.
not_available Eighteen if my uncle's hip is still dodgy.
not_available Your families coming? Father and mother, Dad's new wife, Mom's new boyAbby, any family jetting in? 
not_available No.
not_available We're not that close.
not_available We're more like survivors of a particularly brutal carjacking than a family.
not_available Hello, ladies.
not_available Let's get a move on.
not_available It's your last chance to learn something before you start screwing up your malpractice premiums.
not_available Wanker.
not_available Turd.
not_available Dick.
not_available Is Alex coming with us? 
not_available No.
not_available It'd be fine with me if he did.
not_available Just you and me.
not_available Where do you wanna go? Just hang out.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Eightyfiveyear
not_available old male, combative and uncooperative wandering around naked at board and care.
not_available Give me my watch back, you bastards! 
not_available Thinks we took his watch.
not_available I want it back, you son of a bitch! It's on his wrist.
not_available You want restraints? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available CBC, chem panel, UA and chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Somebody call the cops.
not_available And let's see if we can find a reason for his deterioration.
not_available Hey, back so soon? Lucky me, huh? 
not_available Abby, you free? What, everybody just decide to not file anything for two months? Frank, my man! Thank God you're back.
not_available You start blubbering, I swear I'm gonna smack you.
not_available Back to work already? 
not_available Wife threw me out of the house.
not_available I think I was getting on her nerves.
not_available She was definitely getting on mine.
not_available John? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available God, how long have I been asleep? 
not_available About an hour.
not_available Here, drink this.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available No, really, I don't want it.
not_available Come on, come on, come on.
not_available You been doing your kick counts? 
not_available What? No.
not_available The baby squirms like mad all the time.
not_available You've been reading too many books.
not_available I'll count, okay? Just go do something useful.
not_available Unpack a box, paint, do something.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Remember that kid with high blood pressure? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Burnt his hands on a grill? His belly CT came back.
not_available No pheo, no coarc, no renal artery stenosis.
not_available Nothing indicates cause for high blood pressure.
not_available So? 
not_available He has primary hypertension.
not_available What? That big kid who flips burgers? What'd you tell him on discharge? 
not_available To lose weight, get some exercise.
not_available Gave him a scrip for hydrochlorothiazide.
not_available And referred him to Family Medicine Clinic.
not_available Voil√†.
not_available You're a miracle worker.
not_available Look at his cardiac echo.
not_available Left ventricular hypertrophy.
not_available You call the clinic? 
not_available He hasn't made an appointment.
not_available Call and remind him.
not_available He has end
not_available organ damage.
not_available He could have CHF or arrhythmia.
not_available Neela, he's a kid, okay? That would take decades.
not_available Call him, tell him to get his butt to the clinic sometime before he's 30.
not_available No fever, no pneumonia, no UTI.
not_available Something metabolic? 
not_available Pulse ox is 98.
not_available Sodium's okay.
not_available Sugar's normal.
not_available No anion gap.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ferguson, you have to stay in bed.
not_available I have to go feed the cat.
not_available We'll make sure the cat's taken care of, but you have to stay in bed.
not_available What else? 
not_available Could be toxic ingestion but there's no toxidrome.
not_available I think it's just a worsening of his dementia.
not_available Five hundred cc saline bolus and D5 half at 100 an hour? Yep.
not_available You graduate tomorrow? 
not_available Eight short years later, yeah.
not_available You got your boards results yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, you got a minute? They gonna let you graduate? I can walk, but I don't get my diploma until I pass.
not_available You haven't passed your boards yet? 
not_available I took them last week.
not_available Wow, I had to take mine, like, six months before my graduation.
not_available Morris, what do you need? Hey, Malik.
not_available Can you hang 500 saline for the old guy in Exam 3? 
not_available You got it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday is a surgeon.
not_available She'd be on the sixth floor.
not_available I went there first.
not_available They told me to come here.
not_available Yeah? Well, they were wrong.
not_available Rachel? Jerry, how've you been? 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Look at you.
not_available You're all grown up.
not_available Frank, you remember Rachel, right? Rachel Greene.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's daughter.
not_available No bleeding, right, and no contractions? Nothing hurts? Hey, slow down, honey.
not_available You're scaring me.
not_available Did your membranes rupture? Could've happened in the shower.
not_available I saw Dr.
not_available Ford yesterday, and the membranes are fine.
not_available Hey, you can't park here.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available Good for you.
not_available You gotta move it.
not_available It's a tow
not_available away zone! Thank you.
not_available When he does come in would you get him to call me back, please? Thanks.
not_available Bloody hell.
not_available " Bloody hell " already? It's not even lunchtime.
not_available I'm trying to find a hypertensive No answer at home.
not_available Hasn't turned up for work, either.
not_available Organ damage in a hypertensive teenager? Is that even possible? Anybody know whose patient that is? 
not_available Mine.
not_available Malik.
not_available Larry Godiva's taking another afternoon stroll.
not_available Thank you.
not_available One of you Samantha Taggart? You a process server? 
not_available No.
not_available Then that's me.
not_available Better eat them quick.
not_available They gonna start melting soon.
not_available Ice cream? 
not_available Anybody want a sundae? Somebody sent you ice cream? Yeah, she's here right now.
not_available With a boy, yeah.
not_available BJ.
not_available Right, okay.
not_available All right, thanks, bye.
not_available I called your mother.
not_available How is she? She's surprised you're here.
not_available BJ, could you give us a few minutes, please? Cafeteria's on the first floor.
not_available Could you get me some fries, Diet Coke? Cool.
not_available You good? 
not_available Yeah, fine, thanks.
not_available So your mother tells me that you're not living at home anymore.
not_available Moved in with a friend from school.
not_available Living with her family? No, got our own place.
not_available How's Ella? Can't wait to see her
not_available Excuse me, Elizabeth.
not_available Can I borrow you for a moment? Yeah.

not_available Angiography suite.
not_available I'll be right there.

not_available So we can stay with you, right? 
not_available How long for? Couple of days.
not_available I wanted to check out U of I, maybe Northwestern.
not_available You know you're always welcome.
not_available Separate bedrooms, of course.
not_available Of course.
not_available I was 15 when we met.
not_available I was scooping ice cream at the mall little apron, white hat, whole bit.
not_available Anything left? 
not_available Help yourself.
not_available Hey, you just had bypass surgery, like, seven weeks ago.
not_available A treat now and then is not gonna kill anybody.
not_available In your case, that little truism might not be completely accurate.
not_available Steve and his buddies would come after work.
not_available He was working construction then.
not_available He was all tan, sweaty, little cowboy boots.
not_available How old was he? Twenty
not_available three.
not_available And you were 15? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Disgraceful, huh? He'd come to my school and pick me up in this old Mustang GT O he was always fixing up.
not_available We'd go out driving or go play "X
not_available Men" in the arcade.
not_available Lots of times, we'd just park somewhere and steam up the windows.
not_available And your parents had nothing to say about this? They had plenty to say, but I didn't listen.
not_available So, what happened? 
not_available Alex happened.
not_available When was the last time you were sure you felt the baby move? In the bath, this morning.
not_available No bleeding, no cramping? 
not_available No.
not_available A little buzz here.
not_available And again, a little buzz.
not_available You sure you had that positioned over the head? Yes.

not_available Take Kem's hand.
not_available I've been looking for over five minutes.
not_available There's no heartbeat.
not_available There's no gross body movement.
not_available There's no response to acoustic stimulation.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available John.
not_available Kem.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available The baby died.
not_available It could have been an infection, a cord accident erythroblastosis, preeclampsia.
not_available We may never know.
not_available I'm gonna admit you so we can get started on induction.
not_available An induction? We should get this baby out as fast as possible.
not_available I have to go through labor? I'm sorry.
not_available I'll go order the epidural and get started on your paperwork.
not_available Vicki? 
not_available Blood pressure was fine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Rh
not_available positive, she's afebrile.
not_available We're gonna do an autopsy after the delivery and see what we can find.
not_available I'll ripen the cervix with misoprostol.
not_available We'll start Pitocin about four hours after.
not_available How long will that take? 
not_available Twelve to 24 hours.
not_available Sometimes it's longer for first
not_available time moms.
not_available LV wall thickness is 18.
not_available Is this Burger Boy again? 
not_available No one's answering the phone.
not_available Seventeenyear
not_available olds do not have trouble with high blood pressure.
not_available Left ventricular hypertrophy in teens can lead to heart failure.
not_available And sudden death from cardiac arrhythmia.
not_available You're a cardiologist now? 
not_available I looked it up on the internet.
not_available Everything on the internet is true.
not_available I wanna go by his house and see if he's there.
not_available He lives 10 minutes away.
not_available I can take a BP cuff, some IV supplies and oxygen.
not_available Don't forget a thoracotomy tray in case he needs a heart transplant.
not_available Where does he live? Morgan Taylor Homes? Bring an armored personnel carrier and a squad of Rangers.
not_available You can't go in there.
not_available I'm taking my lunch.
not_available I'll be back in 30 minutes.
not_available Hey, Mother Teresa.
not_available I get off at 6.
not_available I'll take you.
not_available But you owe me vindaloo after.
not_available Who's got the geriatric flasher? 
not_available Ferguson has dementia.
not_available Had him in self
not_available restraints.
not_available Keeps getting loose.
not_available Use the Posey vest.
not_available I don't wanna see his "wee Willy Wonka" wagging around here anymore.
not_available I'll go make sure he's okay.
not_available Nail him to the bed if you have to.
not_available Hey, Kovac, Security's on the line.
not_available They say your car alarm's going off in the garage.
not_available It's driving them crazy.
not_available So you like Indian food? I love Indian 
food chicken tikka, masala, naan.
not_available I love it.
not_available When you open your match letter, maybe I can take you out to celebrate.
not_available Might not be anything to celebrate.
not_available You're gonna do great.
not_available You're smart cute.
not_available You work your ass off.
not_available Got nothing to worry about.
not_available Not like Lockhart.
not_available Some residency program's gonna get a shock when they find she hasn't passed boards.
not_available I need to go and see a patient.
not_available So are we on? Sure, maybe.
not_available Your TV control is here, on
not_available button, volume, channels.
not_available It's gonna feel a little tight.
not_available This is the call button, straight to nurses' station.
not_available If you need anything
not_available All set.
not_available You thirsty? I'll get you some ice chips.
not_available Hey.
not_available You know, your alarm's a little sensitive.
not_available You might wanna raise the motion
not_available detection threshold a bit.
not_available It's a nice ride.
not_available What'd it set you back? 
not_available What do you want? The sports package.
not_available Should hold up pretty good on resale.
not_available I really screwed this thing up with my family.
not_available But I'm gonna make it right this time.
not_available And I need time to make it right.
not_available Let Sam see how much I've changed.
not_available Time to be a father to my son.
not_available We belong together, Sam, Alex and I.
not_available And Sam knows that.
not_available You paid that kid $ 10 to watch your car? I want there to be wheels on there when we get back.
not_available Thanks for doing this.
not_available He's here, we yell at him to get to the clinic.
not_available If not, just leave a note, and that's it, okay? 
not_available Lifts are over there, I think.
not_available Trust me, the elevators don't work.
not_available Thirtynine, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So much wire mesh.
not_available So they don't throw things on folks below.
not_available Like trash? 
not_available Like bricks.
not_available Nobody's home.
not_available Got the note? Come on, would you? I'm starving.
not_available Elgin? 
not_available Great.
not_available It's Neela from the hospital.
not_available I just get a little winded climbing the stairs.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available You remember Dr.
not_available Pratt, right? 
not_available What's up, man? You been taking your hydrochlorothiazide? Why not? Because you told me if I exercised a little, I'll feel better.
not_available I said you could stop taking it in six months if you exercised and lost weight.
not_available Is that dinner? Cheeseburgers.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My mother's working tonight.
not_available I have to pick up the kids from Ms.
not_available Johnson at 7.
not_available Can someone look after the kids so you can come to the hospital for more tests? 
not_available I'm feeling okay.
not_available Take your pills.
not_available Come in next week for a blood pressure check, okay? 
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks, doc.
not_available You got it.
not_available He needs an EKG and a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available He needs to pick up his family and get them fed.
not_available You found him.
not_available You told him what he needs.
not_available Unless you plan on adopting the kid, let's get something to eat.
not_available What time is your graduation ceremony? 
not_available Noon.
not_available You're not gonna go? 
not_available I'm off.
not_available Thanks, but no.
not_available It's boring.
not_available It's boring, and I'm not even sure I'm gonna go myself.
not_available To your own graduation? Yes.
not_available It seems pointless considering the fact that I might not actually get to practice medicine, so I would rather no one come.
not_available Abby, got a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available But thanks.
not_available Anything new on Henry? 
not_available No, no, thank you.
not_available Abby, did you get confirmation of your match list yet? Couple of weeks ago, yeah.
not_available Well, with your clinical skills, I'm sure you'll do very well.
not_available Off the record, I can tell you that we ranked you in our top 20.
not_available If County's top of your list, you're guaranteed to match here.
not_available I thought we weren't supposed to talk about that.
not_available No.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available You found out I failed my boards.
not_available Well, I took them again last week.
not_available The hypothetical concern would be that if you don't pass again and you match with a program, whatever that program might be you would be ineligible to begin your internship.
not_available And the program would be short an intern.
not_available Programs can still delete applicants from their match lists until Friday.
not_available That way, the applicant would match with his or her second choice.
not_available And if he or she didn't pass their boards, the second
not_available choice program would be the hospital short a body.
not_available Well, I guess if that happened If that happened, the applicant that was deleted would lodge a complaint with the National Board indicating he or she'd been approached by the chief of staff in violation of clearly stated rules governing how matches are conducted.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where to? I'm starving.
not_available I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
not_available Everything all right? 
not_available Yeah, yeah, fine.
not_available I'm just just tired.
not_available This have something to do with Steve? Because I keep telling him he's gotta find another place to crash.
not_available I just think it's maybe confusing for Alex.
not_available Alex isn't confused.
not_available It's not that simple.
not_available Can I give you a lift? No, that's okay.
not_available Hey, it's morning in Kinshasa.
not_available You want me to call your family? Kem, do you want me to call your family? You sure? What's that? 
not_available Have you told anybody? No.
not_available No.
not_available Been here with you.
not_available I don't want anyone to know.
not_available Okay 
not_available You didn't restock.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available Just restock when you use something.
not_available I will, when I actually use it.
not_available You need anything? Do you? I don't want anyone to know, okay? Ella's asleep? Guy named Dave called.
not_available Wanted to know if you were still up for a movie Saturday night.
not_available He has a daughter, the same school as Ella.
not_available Guy at the hospital, tall British guy.
not_available You dating him too? How are you liking school? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm going to college.
not_available Do I look worried? My mom's worried.
not_available Rachel, why are you here? I just wanna look at a couple of colleges.
not_available I need a prescription for Plan B.
not_available The morning

not_available You're moving along.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available Hard to say.
not_available Hours still.
not_available My legs are completely numb.
not_available We can turn the epidural down.
not_available I'll come back and check on your progress.
not_available I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee or something.
not_available You'll be okay for a couple of minutes? One more big push.
not_available That's it.
not_available Push.
not_available Push.
not_available That's it.
not_available Good.
not_available Long night, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Your first? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got three already.
not_available All girls.
not_available This one gonna be a girl too.
not_available Even our cat's a girl.
not_available You know what time it is? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's almost midnight.
not_available Midnight.
not_available I am dying for a cigarette.
not_available But you gotta go all the way down halfway across the building to get to one of them smoking areas.
not_available So I'll probably see you around the hallway later on, huh? 
not_available Good luck.
not_available You too.
not_available Didn't mention anything about the ice cream.
not_available Was a big hit.
not_available God, you're beautiful, Sam.
not_available Yeah, this is me at my finest.
not_available No, really.
not_available You're all grown up.
not_available You're drunk.
not_available A little bit.
not_available Hey, did you go to the hospital and say something to Luka? Sam, I want another chance.
not_available Well, I don't want you going to the hospital, okay? I gotta get up early.
not_available Come on.
not_available Steve.

not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available It's almost over.
not_available He's out.
not_available He's out.
not_available It's over.
not_available True knot.
not_available Clamp.
not_available Your baby twisted and squirmed in such a way that he tied a knot in his umbilical cord.
not_available Send 5 cc's of cord blood to the lab for Rh factor.
not_available There's nothing you could have done to prevent this.
not_available Not genetic.
not_available It's not an infection.
not_available It was just bad luck.
not_available Would you like to see him? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Are you sure? John? It's okay, son.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Stillborn? 
not_available Yeah, true knot in the cord.
not_available How terrible.
not_available I can't even imagine.
not_available I'll try and get up there after rounds.
not_available Those poor people.
not_available Seven months old? 
not_available Almost eight.
not_available Yeah, tough break.
not_available What? I was being sincere.
not_available This is the admit area where we keep track of all of the patients we have in the ER.
not_available That's Jerry.
not_available He makes this whole place work, and he's very big.
not_available That's Frank, works with Jerry.
not_available Had a massive heart attack and shouldn't be eating that doughnut.
