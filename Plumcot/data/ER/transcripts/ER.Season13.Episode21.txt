not_available It's got some songs I've been working on.

not_available There's one about you that you'll have to figure out.
not_available Plus a few others I burned.
not_available Some songs we used to listen to when we were roommates.
not_available I'm sorry, Ray.
not_available About what? I thought I was coming alone, and he just turned up.
not_available I didn't know what to do.
not_available No offense but not knowing what to do has become your baseline.
not_available This isn't easy for me, Ray.
not_available I've had a pretty hard time ever since Losing Michael.
not_available I still haven't quite 
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I mean, Tony was new.
not_available There's no history.
not_available Didn't make me think about things from before.
not_available Maybe I rushed into it because it made moving on easier.
not_available So I feel like history to you? Well, I couldn't separate you from Michael.
not_available I couldn't be with you and not feel guilty.
not_available What about now? Now? I'm not sure all that matters anymore.
not_available Meaning? 
HOPE Ah! There you guys are.
not_available Neela, Abby needs to see you before the ceremony, come on.
not_available Okay.

not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is so nutty.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available It's great, everyone's so excited.
not_available I have to ask you a question.
not_available What do you need? Something borrowed, something blue? Chuny has a scarf, it's aqua, but might do the trick.
not_available Can you just sit down for a second? Sit down.
not_available Sorry.
not_available First, I know this has been a really rough year for you.
not_available And I don't think I have been around as much as I should.
not_available And I feel bad about that.
not_available Oh, you don't have to.
not_available But you have always been a great friend to me, so So I was wondering if you didn't mind, do you think you could lead and stand up there with me when we do this? You mean, like be a maid of honor? Well, I hate to put that kind of conventional term on it but yes.
not_available I'd be honored.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Your first job is to figure out how I put these in my hair.
not_available Hair? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's a Croatian thing, I don't know.
not_available They belong to Luka's mother.
not_available Okay.

KOVAC Come in.
not_available There he is, dead man walking.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Very funny.
not_available You're not getting cold feet, are you? I could find a back way out of here.
not_available I'll have you at a gentlemen's club in under 20 minutes.
not_available Pratt 
not_available I'm just teasing you, man.
not_available So Hope said you wanted to talk to me, said it was important.
not_available We've had our moments, Pratt.
not_available And I haven't always liked the things you've done or the way you've done them, but I've always respected your reasons.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I had to supervise you which wasn't always easy for either of us.
not_available But I think we've managed to reach a place where at the end of the day we're also friends.
not_available Yeah, I feel the same way.
not_available Would you stand up for me? 
not_available Wait, you mean, like? Heh.
not_available Be my best man.

MORRIS Okay, sorry, I'm just emotional.
not_available I'm emotional.
HOPE Everything's good, everything's under control.
not_available There's just one minor change.

not_available Okay, sweetie.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Come on.

not_available I choose you as the person I will love and honor for the rest of my days.
RABBl Abigail? 
not_available Well, it's not really fair, because you got to practice.
RABBl Abigail.
not_available Abigail? 
not_available It's not fair, because he got to

not_available Before, when I was getting ready.
not_available And I think it 
starts I carry your heart in my heart I am never without it Anywhere I go, you go 
not_available I'm probably messing the whole thing up but I think the end 
goes And this is the wonder That keeps the stars apart I carry your heart I carry it in my heart So I guess what I'm saying is let's just try to love each other and persevere.

not_available the party portion of tonight's festivities.
not_available Thank you, thank you.
not_available And I'd just like to say that this is clearly a marriage made at County.
CROWD Aw.
not_available Because if we worked at Northwestern or Rush there'd be better food and a lot more booze.
not_available The top shelf stuff, right, Lucien? Relax, big guy.
not_available Hey, you know, I'm not saying that Kovac is cheap but he did try to get Murray, the roach
not_available coach guy to cater this thing.
not_available Anyway, the kids have rested up and are ready for their first dance.
not_available So I give you Abby Lockhart, Luka Kovac, married couple.
not_available It was so beautiful.
not_available What you said, it really added an ethnic spice to the ceremony.
not_available I was just trying to do my part.
not_available What did it mean? Uh I wasn't really prepared.
not_available Don't be so modest, you were great.
not_available Oh, it 
meant " I went to the market to buy some meat but the butcher wasn't there, so I got fish instead.
not_available " It was the only Punjabi I could come up with in a pinch.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's just keep that between ourselves.
not_available Stevie Wonder, huh? I told you, I hear everything you say.

not_available I'm happy for them, this is good.
not_available This is a beautiful night.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Tony.
not_available I just don't get it sometimes.
not_available You know, I don't Why did she do this? I mean, I think I'm handling it fine most of the time.
not_available But then other times, I get so damn angry at her.
not_available I mean, how could she leave a beautiful kid like this? How could she mess with our minds like this? How could she lie to us? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's not okay.
not_available It's not okay.
not_available It's okay to be angry.
not_available It is? She's dead.
not_available I'm angry at Michael.
not_available Still.
not_available I'm not sure I'll ever get over it.
not_available I I haven't been a good friend.
not_available I know that.
not_available I screwed up, and I wanna make it right.
not_available I wanna make it better.
not_available Can I have another chance?

not_available Every time I think I'm turning the corner, I feel like I know what I'm doing I end up falling backwards again.
not_available It's a wedding you're drunk, and you're hooked on a girl.
not_available Just go, you'll feel better in the morning.
not_available I don't wanna go home.
not_available Well, you're done here, okay? So just catch a cab.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Go home, Ray.
not_available I'm not kidding, go home.
MORRIS You know what I love about you, Gates? Just when I get worried that maybe I'm being tough on you you prove what an ass you are.
not_available Me? I was perfectly civil till that alcoholic O.
not_available C.
not_available reject went off on me.
not_available You should've kept walking.
not_available Well, Morris, as my role model, Kenny Rogers once 
said " Sometimes you have to fight when you're a man.
not_available " Oh, that's deep.
not_available That's Gates.
GATES I'm not going back.
not_available I just wanna talk to her.
not_available Neela.
not_available Not right now, Tony.
not_available Can't you see she's upset? 
not_available Chuny, I just wanna talk to her, okay? It's all right.
not_available I'm fine, Chuny.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry that happened.
not_available Abby and Luka are in the other room, they don't know about it.
not_available There's no excuse.
not_available No, there isn't.
not_available I wasn't looking for trouble, he wouldn't back down.
not_available Right, and there was no way for that to end without him backing down.
not_available What do you mean? Well, with men, you have to win.
not_available And with women Well, with women, you have to feel like you've done right by them.
not_available Even if all you're doing is causing them pain.
not_available Or at best, wasting their time.
not_available Is that what you think I'm doing? Wasting time? You know, I think we both got into this because we knew it had no future.
not_available It was just a bridge from one part of our life into another.
not_available I think it's a lot more than that.
not_available No, I don't love you.
not_available And I don't think you love me, and I don't see much chance of that changing anytime soon.
not_available So that's it? We're done? Yeah.
not_available Because Ray couldn't get over you? 
not_available No.
not_available Because You can stand there as if you're listening to what I'm saying and still believe that none of this is your fault.
not_available Have you got any bourbon? 
BARTENDER Yeah.
not_available Can you make it a double? You okay? 
not_available Yeah, yeah, I just Wish that hadn't happened though.
not_available You did a really good job tonight.
not_available No, no, no, you did an awesome job.
not_available They look so happy.
not_available I got them the honeymoon suite at the Ritz for a few nights but they can't use it on account of Joe.
not_available Yeah, I can see that.
not_available It's too bad.
not_available I really don't want the room to go to waste.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't either.
not_available Really? You don't? No, of course not.
not_available Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting? Oh, it's go time.
not_available It's Can I get that on record, please? Say it Say that again.
not_available No.
not_available So you quit your job and get married in the same week? 
not_available I'm a new guy now.
not_available Is that so? Being chief was gonna just mean spending less time with my wife and baby.
not_available Well, I have to admit, I don't think I could've planned a better wedding.
not_available You don't? 
not_available I don't.
not_available Uh Abby, it was a really nice wedding.
not_available Luka, what I said before about hurting Abby, I meant it.
not_available I'm not really sure why I'm here, but I'm very happy to be invited.
not_available I don't really know these people.
