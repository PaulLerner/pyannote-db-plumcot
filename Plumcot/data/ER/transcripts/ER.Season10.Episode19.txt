not_available Their argument is Sandy was his mother and you never legally adopted him.
not_available We were in the process.
not_available And that will help, perhaps.
not_available If the child's genetic father was willing to assign you his rights.
not_available He was an anonymous donor.
not_available Well, we will establish parental intent.
not_available And I'm confident we can secure some temporary
not_available Temporary? Henry is my son.
not_available The good news is that the state has adopted a sexualorientationneutral approach to child

not_available Pratt, can I see you for a second? 
not_available Just give me a minute.
not_available Can I go home now? 
not_available I need you now.
not_available All right, I'll be right back.
not_available I have a baby at home.
not_available I just need to run a few more tests, okay? Here.
not_available What's up? Did you treat this patient? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? She accused you of sexual harassment.
not_available What? 
not_available Did you T.
not_available U.
not_available B.
not_available E.
not_available her, Pratt? What? That's what you call it, isn't it, when you wanna feel up a good
not_available looking patient? If she hires a lawyer, you could be charged with harassment.
not_available If I found a lesion, I would've saved her.
not_available You didn't.
not_available I'm being punished because she's not sick? It's not her condition, it's your behavior.
not_available Nothing's wrong with my behavior.
not_available She had tenderness over the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.
not_available Bony tenderness.
not_available None over the paraspinus muscles.
not_available I felt a 1
not_available centimeter lymph node in the axilla.
not_available You saying you weren't attracted to her? Oh, come on.
not_available Bone pain and lymphadenopathy in a woman who's never had a mammogram? You would've done the same.
not_available It's not about what you did, it's how.
not_available With a nurse present, per policy.
not_available The patient felt you enjoyed yourself.
not_available Come on, please.
not_available Give me a break? You ever got turned on giving a breast exam? You don't have a nurse in the room.
not_available I'm a woman.
not_available Who sleeps with women.
not_available I never T.
not_available U.
not_available B.
not_available E.
not_available D.
not_available a patient.
not_available Yeah? Neither have I.
not_available You coined the phrase.
not_available It's been around since I was a student.
not_available You've been overheard using it.
not_available It doesn't mean I've done it.
not_available If she was uncomfortable, why not say something? I don't know.
not_available Maybe she was intimidated by you.
not_available Scared the big black doctor's gonna bend over the bed
not_available Don't you turn this into a race issue.
not_available When you're black, it's always an issue.
not_available I'm not gonna let you hide.
not_available I'm not hiding.
not_available A call for you.
not_available Take a message.
not_available It's your lawyer, line four.
not_available Don't go anywhere.
not_available Where's Sam? 
not_available I think she's with her son.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Pratt, Neela's patient collapsed.
not_available She was coming back from the restroom.
not_available Hey, ma'am.
not_available Can you hear me? Somebody find Neela! Let's get her up on the gurney, okay? Ready? One, two 
not_available Malik, monitors.
not_available Positive sternotomy sign.
not_available What happened? V
not_available tach.
not_available Ventricular arrhythmia.
not_available On amiodarone.
not_available "Tetralogy of Fallot repaired in 1975.
not_available " Why is she in today? 
not_available Flu.
not_available What's her lab show? 
not_available Haven't come back.
not_available Need hands? Did you open your big mouth to Weaver? What? 
not_available Airway clear.
not_available Start bagging.
not_available Did you tell Weaver I T.
not_available U.
not_available B.
not_available E.
not_available D.
not_available a patient? V
not_available tach, no pulse.
not_available Denise, stay with us.
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available I'm charged.
not_available Clear.
not_available No change.
not_available Going again, 300.
not_available Well, did you? 
not_available No.
not_available Somebody did, though.
not_available Clear.
not_available Sinus.
not_available Good carotid pulse.
not_available What'd you say? Nothing.
not_available That hot patient was complaining about you.
not_available Good breath.
not_available I'll call about her labs.
not_available Perhaps you two referring to a patient as " hot" is a clue.
not_available I never called her that.
not_available She's the one with problems.
not_available Can you even imagine what it was like for her to come here? Feeling ill, worried, scared.
not_available Waiting several hours to be seen only to have a stranger fondle her.
not_available Secondary survey.
not_available Good gag.
not_available She's waking up.
not_available You're okay, Denise.
not_available Labs? CBC, electrolytes, calcium, LFTs, creatinine.
not_available Labs report her amiodarone level less than zero.
not_available She sometimes forgets to take it.
not_available Must have stopped taking it weeks ago to have zero.
not_available She give you any indication why she'd do that? Maybe.
not_available Because men are idiots.
not_available Can I play pinball? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Finish your lunch first.
not_available I'm full.
not_available Barely touched your hamburger.
not_available I don't wanna get mad cow disease.
not_available Then finish your fries.
not_available God, he's grown a foot since I've seen him last.
not_available Been a year.
not_available You've done a great job, Sam.
not_available He's a cool kid.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I guess I can't take much credit for that.
not_available Anyway, is he doing good in school? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available When he's not being expelled for performing medical procedures on himself or dissecting dead squirrels.
not_available Really? It's not funny.
not_available He seems to like that Russian doctor.
not_available Croatian.
not_available You two? We've gone out.
not_available Nothing serious.
not_available He have any friends his own age? 
not_available He's got some buddies at school.
not_available That's good.
not_available Considering how much you move around, that's good.
not_available Well, you gotta go where the work is, right? Tell me about it.
not_available That's the good thing about Chicago.
not_available Always building
not_available How long are you planning on staying? You sick of me already? It's not about me.
not_available It's about Alex.
not_available Well, he seems happy that I'm back.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available The longer you stay, the harder it's gonna be on him when you leave.
not_available Well, maybe I won't leave this time.
not_available What's going on with Hollings in 2? Cardiology was supposed to get him.
not_available Call them again.
not_available What about Dunn in Exam 3? Some recurrent seizure disorder.
not_available Waiting on an EEG.
not_available They can do that upstairs.
not_available We need to free up some beds.
not_available Medicine won't take her.
not_available Why not Neurology? They don't think she had a seizure.
not_available Was there witnessed tonicclonic activity? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Did she bite her tongue? 
not_available No.
not_available Was there urinary incontinence? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Not a seizure.
not_available Discharge her, she can have an EEG.
not_available If she passes out, she could hurt herself.
not_available Send in a DMV card.
not_available There's also a baby at home who could get hurt.
not_available Look, she had a syncopal episode.
not_available And I'm gonna rule her out for Ml.
not_available While we wait for the six
not_available hour troponin, we might as well throw in an EEG.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, Denise's parents are coming in to talk to her.
not_available Her cardiologist's gonna switch her to sotalol which should help the skin.
not_available Hey, Neela, when does your research rotation start? 
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Let me ask you a question.
not_available Yeah? When you do a breast exam on an attractive woman, it's awkward, right? 
not_available For you and the patient.
not_available Right.
not_available See, I'm just as nervous and uncomfortable as they are.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe it comes across as something else.
not_available What do you mean? How do you do it so that they don't think that you're enjoying yourself? It's a medical procedure.
not_available It's no different than looking for rebound or guarding.
not_available I pretend it's my mom.
not_available Yeah, it's a little trick I picked up from my OB
not_available GYN Attending.
not_available It works.
not_available I mean, unless your mom's hot too.
not_available You're a freak.
not_available Every workstation has its own microfuge.
not_available We share the ultracentrifuge.
not_available Cold room for tissue
not_available culture media, bacterial plates, DNA ligations.
not_available Arun and Angelie are looking at expression of heat
not_available shock proteins in glial cells.
not_available This is Neela.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is that an electron microscope? Yeah.
not_available EM's kind of old school for showing apoptosis in neurons, but, you know looks sexy on the page, so Lundgren still likes it.
not_available Lundgren? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lundgren, the guy whose huge RO1 grant is funding your butt.
not_available I'm not getting paid.
not_available Rotation.
not_available Fourth
not_available year med student.
not_available I'm an eighth
not_available year, Ph.
not_available D.
not_available program.
not_available Eight years? God.
not_available We don't get credit around here for wiping snotty noses.
not_available I've actually gotta discover something new in neuroscience in order to get my degree.
not_available Takes a while.
not_available I'm helping with some stroke study? Everyone here is researching some aspect of brain hypoperfusion and tissue injury.
not_available You're gonna be with Yuri and me.
not_available Looking at the effects of ketamine on cerebral ischemia and tissue damage in mice.
not_available Yuri, Neela.
not_available Neela, Yuri.
not_available Hey.
not_available No one said anything about working with animals.
not_available Is that a problem? All tests look good.
not_available We'd like to figure out why she had a seizure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I thought that was something she outgrew as a kid.
not_available It may be totally unrelated.
not_available Here we go.
not_available What's all of that? We're doing an EEG to monitor her electrical brain activity.
not_available It takes several hours, some of which is done while sleeping.
not_available Can I stay with her? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Just try not to wake her up.
not_available We're more likely to pick up the seizures when she's asleep.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You hear that? We're gotta let your mama sleep.
not_available Hey.
not_available You know when I ask you to assist me on an exam of a female it's so I don't get accused of things I didn't do.
not_available Don't blame me for this.
not_available You were there.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available I did everything I could to put that patient at ease.
not_available Guess it didn't work.
not_available I was trying to be friendly.
not_available One man's friendly is another woman's creepy.
not_available You're a flirt.
not_available You can't help yourself.
not_available I was breaking the ice.
not_available It's a breast exam, not a cocktail party.
not_available You don't have to break the ice.
not_available Nice package, by the way.
not_available What? Package.
not_available Amira and I were noticing it earlier.
not_available Must be those pants.
not_available I see what you're trying to do.
not_available You're way off.
not_available I didn't say anything remotely inappropriate to that woman.
not_available It was going through your head.
not_available It wasn't.
not_available You weren't thinking about her great rack when examining her? Hell, no.
not_available And even if I was, which I wasn't, so what? 
not_available She can't read my mind.
not_available Of course she can.
not_available We all can.
not_available It's not that difficult, believe me.
not_available You're a guy.
not_available Men only think about three 
things food, sports and sex.
not_available Dogs are more mysterious.
not_available If they invent a refrigerator with a widescreen TV and a vagina 
not_available we're all doomed.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.
not_available When you check us out you might as well be asking us to show our tits.
not_available That's what it feels like.
not_available It's not a nice feeling.
not_available I didn't check her out.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, your patient's seizing again.
not_available All right, find Kovac.
not_available Jordan? 
not_available Push two of Ativan.
not_available I knew it.
not_available Pulse ox, 97.
not_available Up the nasal oxygen to five liters.
not_available What's happening to her? Malik, another two of Ativan.
not_available Mix up Dilantin.
not_available She's gonna be okay.
not_available Give the medicine a chance to work.
not_available How long has she been seizing? 
not_available Less than a minute.
not_available I stepped out for a second.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay, Jordan.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Caught the seizure on the EEG.
not_available Is this just gonna keep happening? She needs anticonvulsant medication.
not_available After that, everything should be fine.
not_available See any spikes? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Can she hear me? 
not_available Sure, you can talk to her.
not_available She's not gonna be awake for a while.
not_available Hey, sweetie, it's me.
not_available I'm here with Caroline.
not_available Everything's gonna be okay.
not_available You're doing good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt? 
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available Looks like Neurology can't refuse to admit her now.
not_available That wasn't a real seizure.
not_available What are you talking about? The EEG doesn't lie.
not_available No focal spikes, no sharp waves, and no spike
not_available wave complexes.
not_available She's faking it.
not_available She had a pseudo
not_available seizure.
not_available Call Psychiatry.
not_available I learned a little Klingon.
not_available That's good.
not_available We had to get rid of our Klingon translator in the most recent round of budget cuts.
not_available You're serious? My buddy's hospital in Seattle had to hire someone who speaks Elven full
not_available time.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Tolkien.
not_available That was an interesting approach today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, I know it's cruel throwing students into a group like that.
not_available But it is a good indicator of who has what skills.
not_available I was kind of freaked out.
not_available I've never seen them respond to a student the way they did to you.
not_available Of course, they've never seen anyone show as much disregard for hospital policy.
not_available I think you scared them.
not_available You kind of scared me.
not_available I am being paged to the ER.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We could try hypnosis.
not_available On who? 
not_available You.
not_available It might help you quit smoking.
not_available I'll get back to you on that.
not_available I told her to look for any changes in the shape or size of the breast.
not_available And I felt for any lumps.
not_available I told her to watch out for dimpling or puckering.
not_available This is stupid.
not_available Continue.
not_available I told her to check for discharge.
not_available Then gently squeeze the ni
not_available Jerry.
not_available I can't help it.
not_available My nipples are sensitive.
not_available What? 
not_available Your lawyer, Mr.
not_available Brooks, is here.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available So are we done here? I want you to prep a lecture for the med students on gender sensitivity in the physical examination.
not_available Abby's down from Psych for your patient.
not_available Pardon me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you mind? Bored yet? 
not_available Actually, I find it extremely interesting.
not_available I prefer working with empirical data over patients.
not_available Not a people person? 
not_available Not when they're sick.
not_available Watch it! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available You contaminated my ELISA.
not_available Shouldn't have coffee in the lab.
not_available I always have coffee in the lab.
not_available You just ruined my sample.
not_available Do you have to rerun it? I can't.
not_available I don't have any serum left.
not_available You just set us back six weeks.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe she's faking it.
not_available Not if it's a conversion reaction.
not_available Nothing on the EEG.
not_available Doesn't mean her symptoms are under voluntary control.
not_available Whatever's happening is on a subconscious level maybe due to some sublimated emotional trauma or something.
not_available Would you listen to Miss Freud here? Okay.
not_available What are we talking about? Postpartum depression? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available In some, it can turn into full
not_available blown psychosis.
not_available Hey, where are you going, Mrs.
not_available Dunn? 
not_available Home.
not_available Miss Dunn, hi.
not_available I'm Abby Lockhart from Psychiatry.
not_available I already told him I don't need a shrink.
not_available I have to go.
not_available My husband's waiting for me.
not_available Jordan, if you don't stay, we can't help you.
not_available That was my easiest consult all day.
not_available Get your prescription filled, Mrs.
not_available Epstein.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available I got these back today.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Look at you guys.
not_available You can keep those.
not_available I got double prints.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good night.
not_available Luka.
not_available I didn't know he was coming.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Hey.
not_available How did Rena Carlson make out? MVA, came up for an ex
not_available lap.
not_available She had a lot of clot in the belly.
not_available We took out the spleen.
not_available What about the liver? 
not_available Good.
not_available Mesenteric arteries are fine.
not_available Kidneys too.
not_available She's a lucky girl.
not_available She should be awake by now.
not_available I think she's in 10.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You working banker's hours now? Hardly.
not_available I only stepped out of surgery once today and that was to pee.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that, for you and your bladder.
not_available Are you up for some dinner? 
not_available Tonight I can't.
not_available You can't eat? 
not_available Not with you.
not_available Oh, really? What's wrong? Who's that? A patient? 
not_available It's difficult to talk about.
not_available Sounds serious.
not_available It could be.
not_available I still have some tests to run.
not_available Anything I can do to help? 
not_available No, nothing.
not_available I think I'd better go.
not_available Hey.
not_available Oh, what are you doing here? 
not_available I thought I'd surprise you.
not_available Well, you certainly did.
not_available Hey.
not_available Dr.
not_available Jeremy Lawson, Mr.
not_available David Spencer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Spencer.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available It's going very well, thank you.
not_available Have a good evening, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available It was nice meeting you.
not_available What's with the James Bond routine? 
not_available He's English.
not_available Oh, that's nice.
not_available A little taste of home? Dr.
not_available Weaver, sorry to bother you.
not_available If I don't get more nursing shifts I'm not gonna be able to pay for my spring tuition.
not_available You okay? Why don't you take some time off? You need to give yourself time to grieve.
not_available I don't have that luxury.
not_available I lost my wife.
not_available Now I'm fighting to keep my son.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Been begging and arguing with lawyers all day to get Henry for the weekend.
not_available And they're granting me two days with my son.
not_available Well, if there's anything I can do Thank you.
not_available And don't worry about your tuition.
not_available It's been paid.
not_available What? Yeah.
not_available The registrar said it's been paid through graduation.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You need to sign this.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's a visitation agreement.
not_available Basically, it says you'll return Henry to the Lopezes by Monday at noon.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello, baby.
not_available There you are.
not_available Oh, how are you? He's been a little fussy.
not_available Maybe he's teething.
not_available Yeah, I don't think so.
not_available It's too early.
not_available Isn't it? You don't have any teeth, do you? You just miss your mommy.
not_available That's my baby.
not_available Not all of us think like my parents do.
not_available They're pretty old
not_available fashioned.
not_available I know Sandy would be pissed if she knew what was happening.
not_available She'd be cursing up a storm.
not_available I know she'd want you and Henry to be together.
not_available I hope it works out for the two of you, that's all.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's my boy.
not_available That's my beautiful baby.
not_available What? What are you doing? 
not_available Waiting for an ambulance.
not_available Carter.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm not taking your money.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available You know.
not_available I'm not one of your charities.
not_available I was hoping to count you as a friend.
not_available Well, neither a borrower nor a lender be.
not_available Abby, I'm not loaning you the money, I'm giving it to you.
not_available Think of it as an investment in the future of medicine.
not_available You'd be better off with tech stocks.
not_available In the time that it's taken us to have this conversation I've made your salary for the rest of your life in interest.
not_available When you put it that way, how about a couple extra grand for a new car? You can't park here.
not_available This is where we bring ambulances.
not_available He's with me.
not_available And I will pay you back.
not_available You know, you both should be wearing helmets.
not_available My throat hurts.
not_available It's from being intubated.
not_available I didn't think you'd come.
not_available I said I would.
not_available I think you said you'd call me too.
not_available Well, this place keeps me pretty busy.
not_available You don't remember me, do you, Greg? That's okay.
not_available Is there anybody you'd like me to call? My mom lives in Detroit.
not_available Her last name's Henderson.
not_available Julie Henderson.
not_available I'll write the number down if you've got a pen.
