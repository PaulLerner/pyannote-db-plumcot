not_available I thought you were ice fishing.
not_available I didn't make it.
not_available I can see that.
not_available Goodbye, Elizabeth.
not_available See you.
not_available Can I freshen your cup? 
not_available I practically drank the whole pot.
not_available So are you amused? Bemused? Shocked? Chagrined? 
not_available That's a start.
not_available I suppose you think at my age

not_available His wife is.
not_available Recently.
not_available Then bloody well good for him
not_available Mother! Is it so difficult to imagine two people being attracted to each other? Were you using protection? There are diseases.
not_available He's diseased? 
not_available That's not the point.
not_available You really want to discuss this? 
not_available No! He's my boyfriend's father.
not_available You always worried what people think.
not_available I did not! 
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available How would you know? Did the nanny tell you? Yes, Elizabeth.
not_available You were so neglected.
not_available Don't pretend to know me.
not_available I know you better than you think.
not_available I'm just trying to say this could get very complicated.

not_available I have to go.

not_available I didn't expect to feel great.
not_available I'm still bleeding, from the

not_available They were banded just last week? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're pale.
not_available How much bleeding? 
not_available Not much.
not_available I fly to Denver at 5 for my girlfriend's birthday.
not_available Could you give me a cream to shrink it down? Sorry.
not_available I was taking her dancing.
not_available Just dinner might be better.
not_available Need a hand? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Could you order a CBC, Chem
not_available 7 and coags and prep for anoscopy.
not_available Is that what I think? 
not_available I'll be gentle.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Where's my mom? Somebody get my mom! She's coming, Laura.
not_available I need to cut open your pants now.
not_available Oh, my God! Is she okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I called 911.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Her leg is broken and maybe a rib.
not_available Mom, it hurts! Can't you do something? 
not_available Get that lady's broom.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Splinting her leg.
not_available Why? 
not_available I need to check for artery damage.
not_available We We heard you can't tell anybody anything we say.
not_available That depends on what you tell me.
not_available It's about Sex? If there's no abuse and the guys are under 18 then I can't tell anyone.
not_available You can't tell our parents? 
not_available No.
not_available You promise? 
not_available What is it? I can't help if you don't tell me what it is.
not_available We might have caught something.
not_available What do you think it is? We heard syphilis was going around school.
not_available I see.
not_available Why don't you girls come with me, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available It hurts! What is it? 
not_available I'm worried she's bleeding internally.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Where's the ambulance? 
not_available It's coming.
not_available Let's just drive her.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available Sir! You, the plumber.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Can you make room for this girl? Put her in the van? 
not_available She needs to get to the hospital.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available In his underwear? My father? 
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available What could I say? I tried to talk to her about it, but we just argued.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available It beats ice fishing.
not_available Don't you find it bizarre? 
not_available It's not such a bad thing.
not_available Are they going to keep on doing it? He's coming in this afternoon.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Her rib could've punctured a lung.
not_available Look right.
not_available Now to the left.
not_available Laura? Laura? Oh, my God! 
not_available No breath sounds.
not_available What is it? She has a tension pneumothorax.
not_available An air leak is keeping her heart from beating.
not_available We have to use this needle to relieve the pressure.
not_available Oh, my God! Why is she bleeding? 
not_available I might've nicked an artery.
not_available Push where the blood's coming out.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available These pads are soaked.
not_available Just keep pressing them.
not_available Come on, damn it.
not_available I'm coming in with a major trauma.
not_available Clear a room and get four units of O
not_available neg.
not_available Go faster.
not_available We need to be there now! Auto versus 10year
not_available old girl.
not_available Trauma to lower chest 
not_available and fractured left femur.
not_available Hang on! 
not_available We need a chest tube right away.
not_available Pulse is thready.
not_available Need any help? 
not_available No.
not_available Got it.
not_available She was stable, then I lost her pulse.
not_available And I may have nicked her intercostal.
not_available What happened? 
not_available The van hit a bump.
not_available Why not wait for the ambulance? 
not_available I waited seven minutes.
not_available Paramedics arrived two minutes after you left.
not_available You'll have to wait.
not_available Trauma panel.
not_available Type and cross for 4.
not_available Two large
not_available bore IVs, prep the chest.
not_available BP's 80, palp pulse 110.
not_available Where's my mom? 
not_available She's outside.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available I'll give you something for the pain.
not_available Lidocaine.
not_available I need ultrasound.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Luka, we got it from here.
not_available I'll stay.
not_available Get X
not_available ray up here.
not_available Pulse ox 92.
not_available Let's intubate.
not_available 6½ ET tube.
not_available I'm in, hook me up.
not_available Chest full of blood.
not_available You did hit the artery.
not_available Call the O.R., hold a room.
not_available Looks like more than a nick.
not_available We got a liter out.
not_available Pressure's 50.
not_available She's unresponsive.
not_available Prep for a right
not_available sided thoracotomy.
not_available Not much longer.
not_available Is Terri okay? She's fine.
not_available She's sitting in Chairs.
not_available There's cervical bleeding.
not_available It might be dysplasia.
not_available Is that syphilis? Dysplasia? 
not_available There's no sign of syphilis.
not_available We'll wait for the blood test.
not_available You can get dressed.
not_available So I can go? No.
not_available Your HIV test won't take long.
not_available Am I all right? 
not_available Let's see what the test says.
not_available The other girl looks okay, but do a stat pap smear on this one.
not_available Let's get you dressed.
not_available Well, Mr.
not_available Perth.
not_available Ron, please.
not_available Your blood count's normal.
not_available Good, right? Right, but it takes a while for a crit to show a blood loss.
not_available But I feel okay.
not_available I'd hate to have you bleed out at 35,000 feet.
not_available You want another test.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm going to draw some blood which is tagged with a radionuclide which I reinject by IV.
not_available Then I trace for bleeding.
not_available As long as I won't glow in the dark.
not_available It's quick, I promise.
not_available Is it really the thought that counts? 
not_available About what? My girlfriend's birthday.
not_available I was considering jewelry.
not_available But if I go there, I've got to go big.
not_available I don't know.
not_available My husband gave me a surprise picnic.
not_available Romantic.
not_available Cheap.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, Mr.
not_available Perth.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available I'm doing a nuclear medicine scan.
not_available We don't do those very often.
not_available CBC and lytes come back? 
not_available Yeah, they're normal.
not_available Can we talk a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hold that.
not_available The belly's benign, there's no evidence of a bleed.
not_available Why do the test? His skin is pale, his eyes are dull
not_available Not diagnostic of a bleed.
not_available I don't think the scan is necessary.
not_available You should discharge him.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available I just have to get this to the lab.
not_available More suction.
not_available Got it.
not_available Can you sticktie the bleeder? 
not_available No.
not_available Keith needle.
not_available What are you doing? Kennedy maneuver.
not_available Transmural hemostatic suture.
not_available Hang another unit.
not_available And autotransfuse.
not_available I tie the superior and inferior and tie them tight.
not_available Dry as a bone.
not_available Nice.
not_available New seizure in 2.
not_available I'll get this.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Check the BP.
not_available How about another crit? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's go talk to the mother.
not_available Pressure's crashing.
not_available Chest is dry.
not_available Check the belly again.
not_available She must still be bleeding.
not_available You're right.
not_available Belly's full of blood.
not_available She blew the capsule.
not_available Should've checked.
not_available Let's hang two units and move to the O.R.
not_available now! What is it? 
not_available We're going to surgery.
not_available This is her mom.
not_available Come with us.
not_available We'll take it from here.
not_available I want to stay.
not_available She's my patient.
not_available No.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Go and get some sleep.
not_available You think I'm going to sleep? 
not_available That's hilarious.
not_available Oh, my God! We got to go.
not_available Bye.
not_available We were just talking to some friends.
not_available I need to talk to Andrea privately.
not_available Is she all right? 
not_available Could you wait outside? Hey, it's okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Andrea, we got your test results.
not_available They found abnormal cells in your pap smear.
not_available You might have cervical cancer.
not_available We need to do a biopsy to make sure.
not_available Cancer? Was it caused by having sex? You get it from an infected partner.
not_available It's human papilloma virus.
not_available Not everyone with HPV has cancer
not_available You can't tell my parents.
not_available If you have this, you need to be hospitalized.
not_available You said everything I told you was confidential.
not_available If you're not treated, you'll get sick.
not_available We also have to inform your partner.
not_available I don't know who it is.
not_available I mean, which one.
not_available How many have you had? Not sure.
not_available We have these parties.
not_available I want to scrub in.
not_available No.
not_available Why? 
not_available You're not a surgeon.
not_available I'm not asking to operate.
not_available I'll call you when I'm done.
not_available Let's go.
not_available She'll be all right.
not_available Are you coming back down to the ER? 
not_available In a minute.
not_available I'll show you where you can wait.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Saltzman was in for shoulder pain.
not_available She had an MRI.
not_available You were right.
not_available Herniated disc.
not_available And Mr.
not_available Blandeleau, chest pain.
not_available Ruled in for an Ml, had angioplasty.
not_available And he's doing okay.
not_available That's it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No problem.
not_available Are you doing Lucy's cases too? 
not_available Told Weaver I didn't mind.
not_available How was the memorial service? Okay.
not_available It was nice.
not_available A little weird.
not_available How's everything else downstairs? Same old thing.
not_available How are you doing? I'm doing fine.
not_available People drop by here all day.
not_available I bet.
not_available Even my grandmother.
not_available I thought you two didn't talk.
not_available There's nothing like a stab wound to put a spin on things.
not_available Hey, I'm gonna be back to work soon.
not_available Maybe I'll take up skydiving.
not_available You do that.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available I need my rest.
not_available Okay.
not_available Need help getting on the bed? 
not_available No.
not_available Catch you tomorrow.
not_available Yep.
not_available JohnAre you okay? 
not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available Listen, take it easy, okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks, Deb.
not_available Dad.
not_available You're late.
not_available Three minutes.
not_available I was worried you might have fallen through the ice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Very funny, Mark.
not_available Like you don't know.
not_available Just having fun.
not_available Which is apparently what you were doing.
not_available Elizabeth wasn't amused.
not_available I'd say that's accurate.
not_available It was wrong to be at her place.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll get a room tonight.
not_available What? 
not_available It'll be easier for everyone.
not_available So it's an ongoing thing? You think this is a onenight stand? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What floor's this pulmonologist on? 
not_available Fifth.
not_available I like her.
not_available She makes me happy.
not_available Sorry if that makes you unhappy.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available But she'll be gone soon and I'll be back on your sofa.
not_available Then we can both be unhappy.
not_available How many has she slept with? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Both have been going to sex parties.
not_available My God! At their age? I can't tell her parents.
not_available But she's a minor who needs surgery.
not_available Maybe she'll let me tell them.
not_available I know what you're doing, but this is a public health issue.
not_available At least one of those boys is spreading HPV.
not_available And the girls at those parties need to be examined.
not_available So you also need to call the school.
not_available Did you see two girls here? 
not_available They went out that door.
not_available Damn it! Excuse me? Yeah? I'm Barbara Knight.
not_available I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available He was here just a minute ago.
not_available Or maybe Dr.
not_available Weaver? She was here too.
not_available Right now, I'm all you got.
not_available I need to find your lounge area.
not_available People don't usually wait in there.
not_available No, I just need to check my daughter's locker.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Your name? 
not_available Barbara Knight.
not_available I'm Lucy's mother.
not_available I don't have the combination.
not_available The med school gave it to me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I've checked into the Ritz
not_available Carlton.
not_available I don't need that.
not_available This is unnecessary.
not_available They have a lovely view.
not_available Now I have a meeting.
not_available Stop it.
not_available At our ages, there's no reason for us to be living together.
not_available You say that as if we ever really lived together.
not_available I love you.
not_available But I swear, at times you can be insufferable.
not_available Me? I can be insufferable? 
not_available What exactly do you blame me for? I don't blame you for anything.
not_available Then stop acting as if you do.
not_available So I wasn't the conventional mother.
not_available What about your father? 
not_available It's not about Dad.
not_available No.
not_available It's about what I couldn't provide.
not_available Fathers aren't blamed for working too much.
not_available Mothers are blamed if they work at all.
not_available Should you have a child sometime, will you give up your work? I don't know.
not_available I don't know if that's gonna happen.
not_available Then I'm sorry I set you such a terrible example.
not_available Technetium? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Any signs of bleeding? 
not_available No.
not_available Why'd you order a scan that I said was unnecessary? Maybe it's a nursing instinct.
not_available But the guy does not look well.
not_available It's winter.
not_available Nobody looks well.
not_available And medical students don't order tests.
not_available It wastes your time and his money.
not_available Cut him loose.
not_available Abby, if Benton calls, get me.
not_available I'm gonna grab something to eat, okay? 
not_available I thought you weren't on.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Have you called the police? 
not_available What? I'm not done yet.
not_available Call them now! Get out of my way! You're not leaving! Leave me alone! What's wrong with you?! Get off! You left her! 
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available You hit her and left.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available I saw you, and I can identify you! 
not_available It was an accident.
not_available And you just drove off? I was scared, okay? 
not_available So was that little girl! I panicked.
not_available I've had a couple DUIs.
not_available But I wasn't drinking today.
not_available I didn't know what to do.
not_available But you knew enough to run away, huh? Is she here? Is she all right? 
not_available You don't have the right to ask.
not_available Maybe I was just being a hypochondriac.
not_available No, you were right to come in.
not_available And you'd be right to come back.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available I'll keep an eye on it.
not_available Say, in 15 minutes, if you're feverish or sick to your stomach, get that checked out.
not_available But you just saw me.
not_available It may not be me again, but somebody would 
not_available and they'd examine you thoroughly.
not_available Are you saying I'm not okay? I'm just saying that it's been an awfully bad flu season.
not_available You wanna take a break? 
not_available No, I'm okay.
not_available That's enough for today.
not_available Hang on.
not_available You did great.
not_available I'll get
not_available I can do it! I just wanna get back to my room.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? What are you doing here? 
not_available We need to talk.
not_available You promised, you bitch! 
not_available You need to come in.
not_available You said there were rules.
not_available I know, but I can't.
not_available You lied.
not_available To both of us.
not_available It is a lot more complicated than that.
not_available Your health is in danger.
not_available And other girls could get infected too.
not_available Now everyone's gonna know everything.
not_available Andrea? Andrea! So we'll have to reschedule the bowel resection for 4:30.
not_available Hello.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to surprise you.
not_available Certainly not twice in one day.
not_available You're here for your appointment? I've already been.
not_available Got poked and prodded and x
not_available rayed.
not_available Damn doctors.
not_available No offense.
not_available None taken.
not_available And I'm sorry if my presence offended you this morning.
not_available I was just
not_available Well, you said it.
not_available Surprised.
not_available I didn't mean to make trouble for you two.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available None that wasn't there already.
not_available And why is there trouble? 
not_available Mothers and daughters, I suppose.
not_available You don't own the whole ranch on that one.
not_available Let's save a little corner for fathers and sons.
not_available But I will admit mothers and daughters are worse.
not_available But that's just a woman thing.
not_available The only problem with children is they grow up to be adults.
not_available Yes, eventually we have opinions.
not_available I know.
not_available But do you have to express them? It's a learned response.
not_available I'll give you that.
not_available I suggest the four of us go out sort of bury the hatchet.
not_available Mark thinks it's a great idea.
not_available He doesn't.
not_available He will.
not_available Abby didn't discharge him? 
not_available He's back with abdominal pain.
not_available BP's 80/60.
not_available Hang a unit on the infuser.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I began a rectal.
not_available He started gushing.
not_available It's a bleeding tic.
not_available Get four units, call O.R.
not_available I already did.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Okay, hook him up.
not_available Thank God he came back in.
not_available Chicago wasn't her first choice.
not_available She wanted San Francisco.
not_available I took her when she was 8.
not_available One ride on a cable car and it was her city.
not_available Although she grew to love this one.
not_available You don't need to hear all this.
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available I really just wanted to stop by and thank you.
not_available Lucy always talked about you how she was first assigned to you.
not_available She had a lot of respect for you.
not_available And you must've taught her a lot.
not_available She worked with all the residents.
not_available I know.
not_available But you're the one she used to mention.
not_available But she
not_available She loved her work.
not_available She was better than I ever gave her credit for.
not_available Can I ask you something? Yes.
not_available When you were
not_available Well, when that man stabbed you, what did you think? No I mean, what did it feel like? It happened really fast, and I didn't know what was going on.
not_available But I didn't feel a thing.
not_available No pain? No pain.
not_available Did you get that venogram I ordered two hours ago? I had a CT 
not_available guided biopsy.
not_available You gonna get it? 
not_available After my embolization.
not_available Does that mean tomorrow? 
not_available With that attitude.
not_available Did you read a CT on David Greene? Who? 
not_available My father.
not_available He came in for a scan.
not_available Check the pile.
not_available That's a big stack.
not_available While you're at it, read a few plain films.

not_available I'm not so sure.
not_available You had to open her chest to fix my mistake.
not_available We had to do it anyway.
not_available The liver was life
not_available threatening.
not_available If you waited, she might not have made it.
not_available It's impossible to know.

not_available It took a lot of guts.
not_available What have you got?

not_available Cleo knows it too.
not_available What's that mean? 
not_available Nothing.

not_available Then dinner in a nice but well
not_available lit restaurant.
not_available Then, maybe a sporting event.
not_available And tonight's jazz.
not_available We all know what happens after the jazz.

not_available You okay? I lied to Lucy's mother.
not_available I said it wasn't painful to have a knife shoved into your gut.

not_available You know what she took? 
not_available She was on the floor.
not_available Was it from your cabinet? 
not_available My parents'.
not_available What was there? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Tylenol, aspirinAnything prescription? 
not_available My dad takes pain pills.

not_available Let's intubate.
not_available I'll bag her.
not_available She could vomit.
not_available Antidepressants? 
not_available No.
not_available Are you sure? History of seizures? 
not_available No.
not_available Push flumazenil.
not_available She's hypoxic.
not_available Intubate.
not_available Give the flumazenil a chance.
not_available We have to protect her airway.
not_available All right, good.
not_available It worked.
not_available What am I doing here? Terri found you.
not_available Do you remember taking pills? What? 
not_available You'll be okay, Andrea.
not_available Oh, God, Andrea! What did you do? Let's give her charcoal now.
not_available It's an interesting game.
not_available Don't worry, you'll get it.
not_available A martini would help.
not_available That should do the trick.
not_available Loosen you up.
not_available You want anything? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available What's keeping Mark? 
not_available He'll be here.
not_available I hope.
not_available Do you know how to keep score? 
not_available Not a clue.
not_available But you're learning American games?

not_available I think that's rather adventurous of you.
not_available That meeting I was running off to earlier I missed it.
not_available First time that's happened.
not_available I think it was.
not_available Just couldn't be bothered to go.
not_available Went and sat by the lake instead.
not_available I bet that was freezing.
not_available The only thing colder was the conversation we had this afternoon.
not_available Elizabeth, I know I'm not the mother you wish you'd had.
not_available That's not exactly true.
not_available I keep hoping that you'll forgive me.
not_available The problem is you never wanted forgiveness.
not_available There's the rub.
not_available Mark's dad says children shouldn't have opinions.
not_available Yes? Well, he's absolutely right.
not_available I'll take over, Connie.
not_available Sure, thanks.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I had to tell the school so other students could get tested.
not_available But I haven't told your parents.
not_available Or Terri's.
not_available You haven't? 
not_available I was hoping you would.
not_available If it happened to one of them, wouldn't you want to know? 
not_available That was ugly.
not_available Am I penalized? 
not_available It's just a little dent.
not_available What? There's not a little dent.
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available Hey, hey, Mark.
not_available What kept you? 
not_available Oh, nothing.
not_available Hi.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Have a drink.
not_available My ball's stuck.
not_available You broke it.
not_available Press the button.
not_available We'll work you in next.
not_available No problem.
not_available Boys against girls wouldn't be fair.
not_available Neither one of them is any good at all.
not_available And I'll be back on the sofa.
not_available Isabelle's going back to Elizabeth's tonight.
not_available Sure.
not_available Grab a ball.
not_available No, you're too far to the right.
not_available But last time it went left.
not_available You see those marks? 
not_available The arrows? Aim for the one on the right.
not_available And pull the ball all the way back.
not_available And don't drop it.
not_available Just let it roll on the floor.
not_available Wrist straight.
not_available That's an awful lot.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available I never knew he was a surgery intern.
not_available He was good, smart.
not_available He'd spend all of his time talking to patients.
not_available One time Morgenstern made him hold a retractor for four hours.
not_available Carter never broke a sweat.
not_available He'll be all right, Peter.
not_available Tickets.
not_available You sure you wanna go in there? We're not gonna be able to talk.
not_available Let's go get some coffee.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're gonna disappoint Carter.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available What? Nothing.

not_available Yeah, it was.
not_available Dad, I need to talk to you.
not_available Sure.
not_available I saw your scan today.
not_available You have lung cancer which has spread to your liver.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's what the doctors in San Diego said too.
not_available How long have you known? For a while.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? You remember old Rear Admiral Norris? How could I forget him? He was missing a thumb.
not_available He scared me to death as a kid.
not_available He had cancer.
not_available Every time I laid eyes on him, I 
thought "Poor old bastard, he's got cancer.
not_available " Hell, he lived another 12 years.
not_available But still, every time I saw him I didn't want it to define me, Mark.
not_available I didn't wanna see it in people's eyes.
not_available I didn't want to see it at all.
not_available And I'm scared.
