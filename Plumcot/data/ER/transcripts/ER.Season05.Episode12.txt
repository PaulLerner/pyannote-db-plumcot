Previously on ER Do you want to catch a movie tomorrow night? You applied for the space program? 
not_available My second year.
not_available Tonight's dinner is semi
not_available formal.
not_available So any slinky black number will do.
not_available You want me to conduct a study at County General.
not_available And the drug is for the treatment of fracture pain? Comparing it against acetaminophen with codeine.
not_available What's your son's medical condition? 
not_available ALD, Adrenoleukodystrophy.
not_available How old is he? 
not_available Eight.
not_available Why? They usually don't make it past 10.
not_available This must be Ricky.
not_available I'm Carol.
not_available I could have taken Lucy out for a pizza.
not_available That's what my Residents did when I finished a rotation.
not_available In my day, Residents always had their students over for a meal.
not_available Makes for better mentoring.
not_available That's why I invited Peter to join us.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton's coming? He was your Resident.
not_available Now Lucy's working with him.
not_available It's much more civilized.
not_available John, don't! No, no, no.
not_available I thought peppers went in the blender.
not_available We run separate colors for the sauce.
not_available Good save.
not_available You cool and peel them first.
not_available Why don't you seed the Persian cukes? You know, it's funny.
not_available I'm actually gonna miss having Lucy around.
not_available That's how it works.
not_available The instant students know enough to be of use they move to another rotation.
not_available Lengthwise.
not_available Lengthwise.
not_available And then you seed them.
not_available Okay? Emergency medicine may not be a bad choice for Lucy.
not_available Well, she might feel differently after she has her Surgical rotation.
not_available You know what? Why don't you? Why don't you chill the Pinot Grigio? In the freezer? IKeep your day job, Carter.
not_available Well, let's see how you handle these.
not_available Got it? All right, let's do it.
not_available Do you have inside information on this drug? This stuff really works? 
not_available Amazing.
not_available Aaron broke his arm before, the pain was excruciating.
not_available I'd like to buy stock in this.
not_available This may be acetaminophen with codeine.
not_available I know some patients in the study aren't getting the wonder drug.
not_available Aaron is, and it's remarkable stuff.
not_available They keep docs in the dark? It's a double
not_available blind study.
not_available Get your "insider trading" elsewhere.
not_available See you in three weeks.
not_available Jeanie's gonna be late.
not_available Probably stuck in the snow.
not_available She overslept.
not_available Had a late night.
not_available I wish we did.
not_available We are going to kick
not_available start the a.m.
not_available With a wakeup call from my main 
men 
not_available Hetfield and Hammett.
not_available It's coming down.
not_available I didn't expect to see you today.
not_available The clinic's closed.
not_available I organized a seminar on STDs and cervical cancer.
not_available A gab session for women in the community.
not_available That's a great idea.
not_available Is that Metallica? You're a metalhead? You know this tune? Yeah.
not_available Because it's banned in my house.
not_available I thought women should know more about screening and prevention.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I wish I could pay you overtime.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I scored some grant money to pay for it.
not_available Really? That'll run through the clinic? Yeah.
not_available I got lucky.
not_available I caught some dribbles off the gravy train.
not_available I thought that was you.
not_available Listen, I got your memo about the NASA offer.
not_available The opportunity came out of the blue.
not_available A year of training in Houston? It could be 18 months if they delay the launch.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available What? Obviously do what you must.
not_available I wish you wouldn't.
not_available You kept me awake last night.
not_available I kept you awake? I do not want to run the Emergency Department without you.
not_available What'll it take to get you to stay? Full tenure, effective today.
not_available Well, I probably can't swing that.
not_available But I could push up your eligibility.
not_available Considering you in '02.
not_available Two thousand two? 
not_available Aught two.
not_available Will somebody tell us what to call the future? You'd consider me for tenure in three years? We need you.
not_available Think about it.
not_available I think you have a flair for this.
not_available I found my 
niche Pulling drains.
not_available Get the Penrose and not the T
not_available tube.
not_available Pull that, it's not a pretty sight.
not_available Miss IKnight, you found your way to Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available All the preop labs were in the charts.
not_available I nearly kissed her.
not_available Oh, none of that.
not_available Not unless I get to watch.
not_available I insisted you get a decent student.
not_available You could use backup with the scut.
not_available I live for scut.
not_available I'd like you to assist this afternoon on a choledochojejunostomy.
not_available Choledochojejunostomy? 
not_available Oh, you can say it.
not_available Would you like to do it? I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
not_available No catch.
not_available You've suffered enough.
not_available I started the groundwork today to get your fellowship reinstated.
not_available I'll be damned.
not_available Should I feel special, or does he stare at everyone's breasts? No.
not_available Only the females as far as I know.
not_available It's good for the clinic.
not_available You should know what grants are applied for.
not_available Lynette does have some good ideas.
not_available And you are the boss.
not_available What the hell is that? 
not_available That is our new music program.
not_available You call that music? 
not_available I told you to start with Erykah Badu.
not_available It's for patients in Chairs.
not_available Music helps people handle stress.
not_available You're getting ready to DJ a party.
not_available That's just a coincidence.
not_available Somebody signed off on this.
not_available Who signed off on it? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lee.
not_available Jerry, there is no Dr.
not_available Lee.
not_available There never was a Dr.
not_available Lee.
not_available Is that siren in the music? 
not_available It's in the music.
not_available Hey, we could use some extra muscle out here! Jerry, turn the music down and give Conni and me a hand.
not_available Oh, boy! Gird your loins.
not_available at the scene of a fire.
not_available This is one big woman.
not_available Probable anaphylaxis.
not_available Her med alert bracelet said peanut allergy.
not_available Don't pull until we get a grip.
not_available Another gurney? Yeah.
not_available A double
not_available wide and a winch.
not_available I hope the wheels don't snap.
not_available Trauma 1, I'll be right there.
not_available Talk to me, Doris.
not_available Second victim is Fred Danziger.
not_available He singed his mustache putting out the flame.
not_available It's the first call this week where something was on fire.
not_available She drags me away for nothing.
not_available She could be right.
not_available Singed facial hair could mean a burned airway.
not_available Chuny, let's put Fred on a pulse ox and get a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available I had to force him.
not_available This new policy sucks.
not_available Adding paramedics to fire trucks? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And the guys resent it.
not_available They blame me for having to answer so many medical calls.
not_available Nobody likes change.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available So you passed out and took a fall? Angie found me.
not_available Is Angie your homehealth aide? 
not_available She was.
not_available They burn out fast with me.
not_available You see my chart? Yes, sir.
not_available Pancreatic cancer and mets to the liver.
not_available I keep hoping that "end
not_available stage" means it can't get any worse.
not_available Nausea pretty bad? We're gonna hydrate you, see if that helps.
not_available Would you like me to put your own robe back on? It can get chilly.
not_available Did Angie call my son? 
not_available I can find out.
not_available Is that yours? Ten years ago I kicked my son out of the house over this stuff.
not_available Now he gets it for me.
not_available Helps with the nausea? Do you have to take it? Take what? Can you open your eyes? 
not_available Unresponsive since the Valium.
not_available Pulse ox is 99o/o.
not_available Can you imagine lugging around all this fat? It didn't stop her from eating noodles at 9 a.m.
not_available Does Radiology stock extra
not_available extra large? Better call the vet school.
not_available Okay, everybody, settle down.
not_available Miss Meredith, you've had a bad allergic reaction.
not_available The tube is to help you breathe.
not_available BP's 90/60.
not_available Let's start dopamine at five mics per kilo.
not_available How many kilos? You want a calculator? What do you think, 275 pounds? 
not_available Oh, I'll take the over.
not_available Hey, were you looking for me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Conni, start her at 750 mics.
not_available Let me know how she does.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available We got it under control.
not_available As part of your workload you'll teach patient/doctor class to second
not_available years.
not_available Patient/doctor class? Students practice H &amp; Ps on simulated patients.
not_available I remember.
not_available Bad actors pretended like they were sick.
not_available I hated it.
not_available Yeah? Why is that? Because it's fake.
not_available Everybody knows it's fake.
not_available It's a waste of time.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, starting tomorrow, you're gonna learn to hate it all over again.
not_available It'll sharpen your teaching skills.
not_available Did Lucy give me a bad evaluation? Lucy gave you a fair evaluation.
not_available I'll put the teaching guide in your box.
not_available The patient collapsed push
not_available starting a car.
not_available Slurred speech and right
not_available side weakness.
not_available Resolved in 30 minutes.
not_available Suggesting? 
not_available A T.I.A.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday ordered doppler ultrasound in his carotid arteries.
not_available Which demonstrates what? 
not_available A 50o/o lesion on the left side.
not_available This is a surgical candidate? 
not_available He's pretty old.
not_available How old? He was push
not_available starting a car.
not_available He claims not to know his age.
not_available Well, wasn't your Civil War in the 1860s? According to Mr.
not_available Barnes, he's roughly 140.
not_available Elizabeth, is now a good time? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Ms.
not_available IKnight and I can handle this.
not_available Peter, 8:00.
not_available I don't know if I can make it.
not_available We need to compile our sternal saw data by tomorrow.
not_available Mr.
not_available Barnes, what are you doing out of bed? I asked you to call me Charley.
not_available You have to stay in your gown so Dr.
not_available Benton can examine you.
not_available Is that you? I don't mean no disrespect.
not_available But when you get to be my age and you loll around in bed them rheumatoids kick in.
not_available Pretty soon you can't move at all.
not_available Unfortunately, you have blockage in your neck artery.
not_available It puts you at risk for a stroke.
not_available I can't have that.
not_available Too many people counting on me.
not_available Charley helps the older people in his neighborhood.
not_available And the children.
not_available They need sitters, those people working all day.
not_available Are you her teacher? At the moment.
not_available Then you know, you and I, we have the responsibility to pass on what life has taught us.
not_available Can you fix me up? Well, there is a surgical option.
not_available But I hesitate to use it on someone your age.
not_available You ain't ever seen a patient my age.
not_available You don't have to worry.
not_available I can't be killed because I got a conjure on me.
not_available I don't know what that means.
not_available Of course you don't.
not_available Because you are a man of science.
not_available How else you gonna explain my being alive at all? When every other body, all the ones from slavery times done died 50 and 60 years ago.
not_available Miss IKnight, what would you suggest? I'd call a Psych consult.
not_available Is that the doc for loonies? Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available He's outrageous.
not_available He can be tasteless.
not_available He certainly likes to throw his weight around.
not_available So you can't corroborate any instances of sexual harassment? It's a very American thing, if I may say this penchant for turning personal issues into lawsuits.
not_available The hospital's hope, of course, is for me as ombudsperson to address problems and avoid lawsuits.
not_available Look, one has to be thick
not_available skinned working around Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available You roll with the punches, don't you? Whoever's complaining may be too fragile to practice medicine at all.
not_available Her identity is confidential until I can assess if any action is warranted.
not_available It's a delicate business.
not_available Rarely do I hear the kind of slam dunk where Dr.
not_available Soand
not_available So made sexual advances.
not_available She declined.
not_available And then he either fired her or cut her funds.
not_available Right.
not_available Is Robert aware of this complaint? He doesn't know who came to me.
not_available He could figure it out since I prevent the parties from working together.
not_available I see.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available I let it go on too long.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available We're gonna start a line.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Remember Ricky? He hasn't had a bowel movement in three days.
not_available His temp spiked to 101.
not_available I let him get septic.
not_available I've always been able to disimpact him.
not_available You disimpact him at home? I usually use a glove and Vaseline.
not_available The morphine's made him constipated.
not_available Why is he on morphine? He's having pain from contractures.
not_available That's what I think.
not_available Ricky stopped speaking about a week ago.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He still opens his eyes sometimes.
not_available Is the morphine working for the pain? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available It's all right.
not_available I've got it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's just I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Everything he's been through I fall apart over this.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I know.
not_available When we got to Michigan Avenue, he just passed out.
not_available How long ago did he hit his head? 
not_available Four hours.
not_available He was fixing a floodlight over our garage.
not_available The ladder slipped.
not_available But he seemed okay.
not_available He just had a headache.
not_available When you have a head injury, it's best to call the paramedics.
not_available I did call.
not_available Paramedics didn't show? No.
not_available They came, but Jim seemed okay.
not_available And then there was a fire somewhere and they got called away.
not_available Jerry's gonna show you where you can park.
not_available Jerry, I want you to call Dispatch.
not_available Find out which unit responded to the Haggerty's call.
not_available Ricky's resting.
not_available His fever is due to an ear infection.
not_available They're treating it with antibiotics.
not_available Thank you, Carol, for everything.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross will be out to talk to you about it.
not_available You always see me when I'm such a wreck.
not_available I usually cope better.
not_available Well, sometimes coping too much can drive you crazy.
not_available I meant to thank you.
not_available The respite care has been wonderful.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Did you get to your daughter's recital? I had the worker come back another time just so I could take a bath.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We had great news last week.
not_available My daughter's blood test came back.
not_available She's not a carrier.
not_available Oh, that's a relief.
not_available Thank God.
not_available She'll never do this to her kids.
not_available We'll keep him until his fever comes down.
not_available I'll see you before you go, okay? Does this mean we have to reduce Ricky's morphine to prevent this? That's one thing we could do.
not_available This was the hardest part with Michael.
not_available I lost Ricky's older brother to ALD three years ago.
not_available Right.
not_available Now he can't tell me it hurts.
not_available Somehow it's worse to see him suffering.
not_available I'll check.
not_available There may be something we can do for the pain.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Hyperventilate him.
not_available BP 160/90.
not_available Pulse 60.
not_available Mannitol's in.
not_available Your husband has a blown pupil.
not_available I'm worried the bleeding in the skull could be putting pressure on his brain.
not_available CT's ready.
not_available We'll get a head CT to find out more.
not_available Take Mrs.
not_available Haggerty to Chairs.
not_available Chuny, call Neurosurgery down here right away.
not_available I was afraid you weren't joining us.
not_available I'm looking forward to it.
not_available You don't see a choledochojejunostomy every day.
not_available When they shuffled the schedule, I was afraid I was gonna miss out.
not_available The Resident let the patient eat, and we had to postpone.
not_available That's the problem sometimes with Residents rotating in.
not_available They're not up to it or don't care.
not_available Who was this Resident? Third
not_available year from Emergency.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Maggie Doyle? They think very highly of her.
not_available She's being considered for Chief Resident.
not_available The pickings must be slim this year.
not_available I've always found her to be extremely capable.
not_available I hear she makes a lot of women uncomfortable.
not_available This is gonna be nifty.
not_available Stones in the common bile duct distal to the sphincter of Oddi.
not_available No kidding? My whole team is tied up in the O.R.
not_available Someone needs to scrub out and join us.
not_available That's why you have to wait.
not_available Look at the size of the clot.
not_available It's compressing his brain.
not_available Every second counts.
not_available Chuny, shave the scalp.
not_available Malik, open the burr hole tray.
not_available You can't do burr holes in the ER.
not_available You're not giving me any choice.
not_available What size gloves do you take? I am not comfortable with this.
not_available We can't wait without risking brain damage.
not_available I'll try again to get someone down.
not_available Twelve blade.
not_available Pulse is down to 55.
not_available Self
not_available retaining retractor.
not_available This is a mistake.
not_available Pressure's up to 180/95.
not_available That's the Cushing response.
not_available It'll herniate unless we relieve the pressure.
not_available Periosteal elevator.
not_available My Chief can be down in 20 minutes.
not_available Too long.
not_available Hudson brace and perforator.
not_available I can see the skull fracture line.
not_available ABG is 
back PH 7.51, PCO2's 25, PO
not_available 2's 350.
not_available That's what we want.
not_available Okay, I'm ready for the burr hole.
not_available Can't you wait a few minutes? IKeep the irrigation coming.
not_available I need to see what I'm doing.
not_available Please not too deep.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I'm through the inner table.
not_available Okay, there's the clot.
not_available I need a dural suction catheter.
not_available Pulse up to 170.
not_available BP's 140/70.
not_available Pupils are equal.
not_available That's more like it.
not_available Wet sterile gauze.
not_available Let's get him to the O.R.
not_available I'll alert the team.
not_available Tell them to take their time.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Nice job.
not_available You got time for a quick question? Yeah, sure.
not_available Can I account for a broken container in the study? One of the vials busted? The powder spilled into the envelope.
not_available I'd just make a note of it.
not_available We don't have many patients enlisted.
not_available We won't use all the samples.
not_available That's all I wanted to know.
not_available You gonna make your lecture? The guy from NASA at the med school? Oh, right.
not_available I almost forgot.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Haggerty, your husband's been stabilized and sent up to the O.R.
not_available What? 
not_available Jerry.
not_available Your husband has been sent up to Surgery.
not_available Someone will take you up.
not_available I'll take her up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene stabilized your husband.
not_available He's doing fine.
not_available Did you find out which paramedic unit left him with a brain bleed? It was an engine company that went out.
not_available Doris Pickman was the paramedic.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available The deputy chief will handle it.
not_available Listen, call Dispatch back and tell them that I'm gonna follow up.
not_available Oh, and Jerry, if you put that music back on, you're fired.
not_available I'm sorry it's taking so long.
not_available We put my fingertip on ice.
not_available It'll be okay, right? It's a possibility we won't be able to reattach.
not_available The surgeon will decide.
not_available You're still waiting on Plastics? They swore he's on his way.
not_available Did you find another candidate for that fracture study? No.
not_available Just recording a broken container.
not_available Is he a plastic surgeon? 
not_available No.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You want something to drink? My dad's getting me a Coke.
not_available It shouldn't be that much longer.
not_available Did you find my son? His office said he was out on a sales call.
not_available He's not picking up his cell phone.
not_available We'll keep trying.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is the Zofran helping the nausea? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm gonna ask the docs to add Reglan.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available They don't work.
not_available Any chance you could wheel me outside for some fresh air? I can't take you to smoke marijuana.
not_available Maybe your son can help you.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available I'm probably not able to inhale anyway.
not_available The neuromuscular response can be studied since there's no gravitational force in the usual Z axis from head to toe.
not_available Gentleman in the back.
not_available What are the applications of this study? A loss of muscle tone in microgravity is an issue sci
not_available fi movies have largely ignored.
not_available Cosmonauts who spent months on Mir had to be carried from the spacecraft.
not_available I'd like to kick off the Q and A with a question to 
you What interested you in the astronaut program? I ask because a lot of candidates admit to childhood dreams of adventure the adrenaline of takeoff, the vastness of space.
not_available The doctor who just walked in, would you respond? Well, for me, it was pretty much adventure.
not_available The adrenaline of takeoff, the vastness of outer space.
not_available Thank you for your candor, Dr? 
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Doug Lowrey wanted me to look you up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene may be joining us as a payload specialist.
not_available The real picture of your schedule, should you make it is one of routine.
not_available In training, you'll spend a year repeating tasks following checklists, adapting to a regimen.
not_available Everything you do is dictated by the ground crew.
not_available You follow a precise minuteto
not_available minute itinerary.
not_available I'm sorry to disturb you.
not_available I didn't know what to do.
not_available I screwed up bad.
not_available But the guy seemed fine at the scene.
not_available The engine got the fire call, the guys were all so jazzed, I told the wife Doris, slow down.
not_available How's Mr.
not_available Haggerty? 
not_available Epidural hematoma, but he's okay.
not_available They pulled me off active duty.
not_available They're doing an investigation.
not_available He's worried about bad press.
not_available Fire engine leaves an accident scene.
not_available That's a medical error.
not_available That's my call.
not_available Maybe I was influenced by the firefighters.
not_available They wanted to go.
not_available That shouldn't cloud my judgment.
not_available It'll ruin my record.
not_available Take a breath.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Will you? 
not_available I'll call the deputy chief now.
not_available Come on, doc.
not_available I'm not gonna do that.
not_available You heard me.
not_available Roll up your sleeves.
not_available I'm not gonna arm
not_available wrestle over surgery.
not_available Are you scared to? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I am.
not_available Well, I want the surgery.
not_available That's all there is to it.
not_available And that one doctor calculated that I was fit in the head.
not_available Because you didn't mention you thought you were at Appomattox.
not_available But there was another doctor who also said my FEV
not_available 1 was over 120 percent.
not_available I think that's darn good.
not_available They cleared you physically.
not_available You're giving me that second
not_available rate pill idea.
not_available You think the medical treatment isn't convincing.
not_available I use my judgment.
not_available Your judgment is to put your arm next to mine, clasping my hand and we will arm
not_available wrestle.
not_available You will find out that old Charley's not as weak and puny as you think.
not_available I never said I don't think you're puny.
not_available But you don't believe I can't die.
not_available I don't believe that one either.
not_available I'll give you something you can believe.
not_available Put your elbow right here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Barnes, come on.
not_available Listen, if you don't give a man his measure of respect and you don't believe his history you're talking about a fight.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Don't make your elder beg.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? There is an O.R.
not_available Available.
not_available Hey, don't humor me now.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available You win.
not_available You win.
not_available All right, go ahead.
not_available Book the O.R.
not_available It's a new policy putting paramedics on fire trucks.
not_available It'll take a while to work the kinks out.
not_available I know Doris.
not_available I work with her.
not_available She deserves to be counseled, not put on a desk.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available This is my job.
not_available Is Doug Ross around? 
not_available Try Admit.
not_available Deputy Chief Mead, please? Mark Greene again.
not_available They let you out of the lab? I make deliveries for some customers.
not_available I got the toxicology results on that powder you brought us.
not_available Negative for codeine.
not_available Is that all you needed? 
not_available That'll do it.
not_available When I heard you hand
not_available carried it, I thought well, maybe you were back on the market.
not_available Me? No.
not_available I I called the HandiVan for the Abbotts.
not_available Joi said you wanted a prescription.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Nice to see you.
not_available See you later.
not_available Ricky's temp is 98.8.
not_available Which is good.
not_available You know back there that was nothing? Yeah, of course.
not_available I'm afraid Lynette has appropriated the lounge.
not_available The staff will have to gossip someplace else.
not_available You knew about it? She showed me her proposal last week.
not_available It's a good area for the clinic.
not_available I know you can tell if he's cheating.
not_available But some Your man don't take a shower before he leaves but he does when he gets home? He's cheating! The number of partners you have and he has can put you at risk for cervical cancer.
not_available It can put you at risk for being a fool.
not_available How young you were when you started having sex and smoking are factors.
not_available That's right.
not_available This is Carol Hathaway.
not_available She runs the clinic here.
not_available Nice to meet you all.
not_available Oh, carry on.
not_available I think it's a really important topic to be informed about.
not_available Please feel free to come see us at the clinic anytime.
not_available Thanks, Carol.
not_available My apologies.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Baker.
not_available Jeanie Boulet.
not_available This is Donna.
not_available Her father should be back soon.
not_available This is the x
not_available ray, Ms.
not_available Boulet? I did a digital nerve block with Marcaine.
not_available Amputated the distal phalanx.
not_available We'll rongeur and do a V
not_available Y flap.
not_available You can put it back on, right? The blood vessels are too small.
not_available Did you explain to her? I told her it may be a possibility.
not_available But you guys put arms and stuff back on.
not_available If you had cut your finger at the base, we'd have bigger arteries.
not_available We'll trim down the bone and create a flap over the defect.
not_available You mean I'll have a stump? Maybe we should talk to Donna's father.
not_available Yes.
not_available If we can get a Trauma Room, I'll do the procedure right away.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll make you a small prosthetic tip.
not_available I'm saying oldies are played out.
not_available People like the classics.
not_available Not ones you can't dance to.
not_available You're gonna lose them.
not_available Jerry, what is this? You wanted the rap turned off.
not_available Actually, I said we need a desk clerk here, not a DJ.
not_available Fine.
not_available It's no more.
not_available Forever gone.
not_available What possessed you to pick that particular song? I don't know.
not_available Just instinct.
not_available I'm just going with the flow.
not_available My mom used to play this album when I was a kid.
not_available It was always, like, the ultimate freedom.
not_available You know? Leave ground control behind and float way.
not_available Escape.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The folks in the Waiting Area want to know if you could put Bowie back on? Jerry, do whatever you want, okay? Just use your best judgment.
not_available All right.
not_available Now, you give this to him every six hours if needed.
not_available You don't exceed four doses in 24 hours.
not_available Call me if it isn't working for him.
not_available Watch your head.
not_available Why didn't the genetics clinic suggest this medication? It's still part of a clinical trial with kids with fractures.
not_available Perfectly safe for Ricky.
not_available It might give him some relief.
not_available Do I need to fill any of this out? 
not_available I wouldn't bother.
not_available He's not a candidate for the study.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Trauma 2 is open.
not_available Can you assist me? I insist.
not_available You blew by that like she was an annoyance in your busy day.
not_available You said there's a parent here to give consent.
not_available Find him.
not_available I'll explain the procedure.
not_available I'll do that.
not_available I can't believe I get to scrub in on my first day.
not_available That's the best way to learn.
not_available Masks? Charley has a crowd in the Waiting Room.
not_available Does anyone know where he's from? Been in the neighborhood for years.
not_available That car he was push
not_available starting? Registration expired in 1956.
not_available He had terrible stories.
not_available The first two branches of the internal carotid? The ophthalmic artery and the posterior communicating.
not_available Okay, that's it.
not_available You're ready.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Gown and glove Miss IKnight.
not_available She doesn't know the ropes.
not_available Just about to put him under.
not_available IKeep your hands in front of you.
not_available Don't reach for anything unless you're told.
not_available What if I have an itch? 
not_available Tell the nurse where.
not_available What is that? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Riggs? 
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Atropine.
not_available One milligram onboard.
not_available Blood pressure's dropping.
not_available He's in V
not_available fib.
not_available Grab the crash cart.
not_available I'm sterile! It doesn't make a difference.
not_available Amp of epi.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Come on.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Asystole.
not_available Start compressions.
not_available Epi and atropine onboard.
not_available Right.
not_available What's the rhythm? 
not_available Got an idioventricular rhythm.
not_available Faint pulse.
not_available Try to get a BP.
not_available Can he still have surgery? No.
not_available Let's get him a room in the ICU.
not_available How long till spring? 
not_available This is the shortest day of the year.
not_available That's December.
not_available We're past that.
not_available I made up my mind.
not_available I'm not going to Houston.
not_available Really? 
not_available It's an old dream.
not_available You fooled me.
not_available I thought you were ready to blast off.
not_available I realized I didn't want to go.
not_available I don't want to go anywhere.
not_available This is what I do.
not_available This is where I belong.
not_available Lost that old restlessness? I guess.
not_available Coming in? Come on in! It's cold! You went out of your way not to involve me.
not_available Why would I? 
not_available You knew I would object.
not_available Object to what? All the women were African
not_available American.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The clinic's for everyone.
not_available I didn't exclude anyone.
not_available Where did you advertise? I have a special interest in an underserved population that is particularly at risk.
not_available Latinos are even more at risk.
not_available Our death rate is higher.
not_available Vietnamese women have worse statistics.
not_available To get women to consider changing sexual habits, they need to feel open.
not_available Women talk more freely among their own.
not_available We'll have to hold seminars that target other populations.
not_available Look, I did this on my own time out of my own interests.
not_available I understand that.
not_available But I can't have you pulling against me.
not_available If you want to work in the clinic, adjust your project to include others.
not_available Well, I guess you've given me something to think about.
not_available Couple more stitches and the Y is closed.
not_available See? What kind of music do you play, Donna? Folk and classical.
not_available Some rock.
not_available Well, Ms.
not_available Boulet is right.
not_available More 5
not_available 0 nylon, please.
not_available A prosthetic will take some getting used to.
not_available But with time, you'll be able to play just fine.
not_available What about computer games? 
not_available You'll never be able to touch them.
not_available Your dad paid me to say that.
not_available Cut, please, Jenny.
not_available It's Jeanie.
not_available Sorry, Ms.
not_available Boulet.
not_available Honest.
not_available I owe you my first born.
not_available You do that and you're on a desk.
not_available You saved my career.
not_available I gave you a chance to turn it around.
not_available We'll work out a counseling schedule next week, okay? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Where's Jerry? 
not_available We're in between sets.
not_available I was taking requests.
not_available Hey, you off? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? That guy in Exam 2 wanted to say goodbye.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ackerman? Pancreatic cancer? He's gonna have to stay the night.
not_available Nobody can come until tomorrow.
not_available Are you waiting for the health bus? We're all loaded up.
not_available I just had another question for Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross is in a meeting.
not_available Is there something I can do? He gave some new medication to us.
not_available I forgot to ask if it's all right to take with Robaxin.
not_available My son has ALD.
not_available He has a fracture? No.
not_available But he was in pain.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross thought this might help.
not_available Where's your study envelope? He said we didn't need to bother.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross did? Since my son isn't actually a candidate for the trial.
not_available I see.
not_available I heard your son couldn't make it.
not_available You need this? Please.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Oh, God! Again? Hey, is Doug still upstairs? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, I'm headed home.
not_available Mark, what are you doing? Do you know anything about a boy with ALD? Ricky Abbott? Why was he given meds for the clinical trial? He wasn't.
not_available Doug wouldn't do that.
not_available Looks like he did.
not_available Talk to Doug.
not_available I'm sure there's an explanation.
not_available Ms.
not_available Boulet, I wanted to thank you for assisting on the finger flap.
not_available Not at all.
not_available And for reminding me to take time with our young patient.
not_available I don't do well when I get behind schedule.
not_available But that's no excuse.
not_available You were right, and I thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Would you join me for an opening at the Art Institute this evening? This evening? I realize it's short notice.
not_available It may be 
interesting Raghubir Singh, an Indian photographer.
not_available I don't know much about art.
not_available I don't care about art.
not_available I promised my wife, who died a few years ago I'd keep our membership and not become a Philistine without her.
not_available I'm sorry to hear you lost your wife.
not_available And my partner.
not_available Jenny and I had a practice together for 15 years.
not_available Her name was Jenny? You're a sweet angel.
not_available Called for a consult? Self
not_available inflicted knife wounds.
not_available Quite a few of them.
not_available He gave me a suturing refresher.
not_available She's my angel.
not_available That is not what he was calling me before the Haldol.
not_available No blood in the urine but these two needed two
not_available layer closures.
not_available Good bowel sounds.
not_available Belly's soft.
not_available I wanted to mention to you I have been having a problem with Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available IKerry spoke with me this morning without actually saying it was you.
not_available I'm sorry I didn't ask before dragging your name in.
not_available I don't think I can be of any help.
not_available Well, no sign of any intra
not_available abdominal bleed.
not_available He's got another one on his back.
not_available We'll have to lift him.
not_available I hoped Romano would cool it if I confronted him.
not_available But instead he threatened to blast me on my evaluation.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano can be volatile.
not_available You mean he's a mean
not_available spirited little powermonger? That too.
not_available Well, the kidneys look fine as well.
not_available Whores! Whores! I want to die.
not_available There's the Mr.
not_available Michaels I know and love.
not_available Look, Romano, he likes to push things to the limit.
not_available I guess he thought anything goes with the gay chick.
not_available I hope you're not going out on a limb.
not_available He's a star.
not_available Self
not_available respect's a bitch.
not_available IKerry, do you have a moment? 
not_available Mark needs me.
not_available You're leaving? How about breakfast tomorrow? 
not_available That's more than a minute.
not_available I may have some things to add to your inquiry.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available We'll set something up.
not_available There she is.
not_available Minnesota Fats.
not_available I was afraid I'd missed you.
not_available Hey, Reggie.
not_available You'll give me a chance to win my money back? Playing pool two nights in a row is bad luck.
not_available It's bad luck to play against you.
not_available Where'd you learn? Signs of a misspent youth.
not_available What do you say we go eat? I already have plans for tonight.
not_available Something a new friend can barge in on? Opening at the Art Institute.
not_available Say no more.
not_available I'll catch you on the weekend.
not_available I almost went straight to Anspaugh.
not_available What the hell was Doug thinking? If we were exposed for breaking protocol on a federally funded trial They'd cut off research money and Medicare payments for years.
not_available And it's against the law.
not_available They brought me the study.
not_available I got him onboard.
not_available Mark, given the implications I don't think we have any choice but to handle this internally.
not_available Cover it up.
not_available If Anspaugh finds out, he has to react.
not_available Nice position he put us in, huh? Do you have the key to the pain study cabinet? Come in and take a seat.
not_available Any changes? Will he wake up? What do you think? His brain was deprived of a lot of oxygen during the cardiac arrest.
not_available Old folks don't usually come back with full function after hypoxic insult.
not_available It's a waitand
not_available see.
not_available He could live like this for a while.
not_available Forever.
not_available Well, according to him.
not_available What's his Glasgow score? An eight.
not_available No spontaneous eye
not_available opening.
not_available No speaking.
not_available Responds only to painful stimulus.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't expect this.
not_available Well, neither did I.
not_available Should I go tell his neighbors? No.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Then to top it off, he goes to IKerry Weaver instead of coming to me.
not_available But you gave Joi the meds? Mark said that he wasn't gonna use all the samples.
not_available That's not the point, is it? 
not_available What is the point? That breaking research protocol could damage the hospital's funding.
not_available So you agree with them? I see their point.
not_available You know how sick he is? Yeah, but that decision could have a larger impact.
not_available The hospital's only at risk if someone goes out of their way to report me.
not_available And believe me, it kills IKerry Weaver not to be able to do that.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Doug, don't walk away.
