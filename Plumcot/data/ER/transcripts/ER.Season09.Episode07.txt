not_available Not for a couple weeks.
not_available A couple weeks? There it is.

not_available You can tell it's a boy? Because I can't.
not_available No, it's just a figure of speech.
not_available Just a pronoun.
not_available Are you hoping for a boy? Not particularly.
not_available I mean, a boy would be nice but I don't care.
not_available I don't even really wanna know.
not_available As long as it's healthy, right? The rash of Lyme disease is?

not_available Facial nerve palsy.

not_available This is a teaching hospital, not medical Jeopardy! Where are all the doctors? 
not_available Who? Anyone.

not_available Doxycycline! Beth, this is Erin.
not_available She's gonna be putting your cast on.
not_available Beth? Miss Garrison? 
not_available I can't feel a pulse.

not_available Come on.
not_available Corday's looking for you, man.
not_available Be right there.
not_available ER, please hold.
not_available Think you could take this somewhere else? 
not_available I need to use the computer.
not_available Use one over there.
not_available I don't want you near me when God strikes you dead for killing that nun.
not_available I didn't kill her.
not_available You didn't save her.
not_available She was an 87year
not_available old woman in poor health.
not_available What, you only save the healthy ones? She stroked out.
not_available No one could foresee that.
not_available You don't have to explain to me.
not_available I'm not the one doing the judging.
not_available GSW, 10 minutes out.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Corday still down here? John Doe.
not_available Found in the park.
not_available No signs of serious trauma.
not_available Promise me you won't let them near my face.
not_available Sir, what's your name? They dropped right out of the trees
not_available We got good breath sounds.
not_available Nobody's near your face, sir.
not_available No, don't let them near me! Settle down! Okay, get five of HaldolDon't let them bite me! 
not_available Relax, sir.
not_available No, no.
not_available We're trying to help you.
not_available Get Security! 
not_available It's the dyskinesia.
not_available Still need the Haldol? Yes.
not_available We got it.
not_available We're going to need a head CT.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Are you okay? Nothing that 12 hours of sleep wouldn't cure.
not_available Put him on pulse ox, two liters O
not_available 2 by nasal cannula.
not_available Mineral oil on a cotton ball should act as a solvent.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Let's get him inside.
not_available Make sure his nasal passages stay clear.
not_available Hey, Jody.
not_available What are you doing here? I'm looking for Eric.
not_available Abby.
not_available Hi, Abby.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on? Where's Eric? 
not_available I was hoping you knew.
not_available What do you mean? I don't know.
not_available We were in Indiana on our way back from my parents' 
not_available They had a fight.
not_available It was hardly an argument.
not_available He got really angry.
not_available I was just asking him about us, our future, stuff like that and he took off.
not_available I didn't mean to upset him.
not_available Maybe he went back to his base.
not_available No, I called.
not_available They said he's been UA for two weeks.
not_available UA? 
not_available Unauthorized absence.
not_available Abby? He's AWOL? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Joel Seaton, 67, syncopal episode at Navy Pier.
not_available Paramedics found him dehydrated, systolic of 90.
not_available Came up with 500 of saline.
not_available Joel was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer three months ago.
not_available What treatment have you been on, Mr.
not_available Seaton? Megace and Gemzol.
not_available They said I might have a year with the chemo, but I'm not doing too good.
not_available He's had two stents in his common bile duct to relieve the obstruction.
not_available It's probably clogged, which explains the fever.
not_available How's your pain? 
not_available Every night I go to bed I keep hoping I'll wake up in the morning and I'll be better and the pain will be gone.
not_available Think there's a surgical alternative that could help? I'm afraid not.
not_available What happens if you don't do anything? You'll get more jaundiced, slip into a coma from liver failure.
not_available Your kidneys will fail and your heart will stop from a high potassium level.
not_available Is that a painful way to die? Not once you slip into the coma.
not_available We can arrange for home hospice care.
not_available A nurse will visit you twice a day to give you the pain medications.
not_available When my wife was living, she used to always say I'd probably die in my Barcalounger watching the football game.
not_available I'm starting to think that's not such a bad way to go.
not_available Does that mean youre no longer interested in further treatment, Mr.
not_available Seaton? Sorry.
not_available Let's have Ativan now.
not_available I can't see.
not_available I can't see.
not_available All right, just relax.
not_available Need some flush? Did you try to kill yourself, Greg? No.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available He didn't mean it.
not_available Page ENT and Ophtho.
not_available Get a Wood's lamp and fluorescein.
not_available Who, Greg? Who shot you? 
not_available Tommy.
not_available Ativan's onboard.
not_available A friend? He's my brother.
not_available He's 10.
not_available Need a two view of the face along with a trauma panel.
not_available Look at this light, Greg.
not_available Can you see this light? 
not_available A little.
not_available Where'd Tommy get the gun? 
not_available He was playing with our dad's gun.
not_available I tried to take it away from him so he wouldn't hurt himself, but it went off.
not_available We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let me know if there's anything else you need, okay? Thank you.
not_available We should have pursued other options.
not_available What? With Corday.
not_available There are treatments to consider.
not_available I asked for surgical consult.
not_available She didn't think it was a good idea.
not_available What if it's in the patient's best interest? You went up against Carter on a terminal patient.
not_available That's not your job.
not_available You're a med student.
not_available This guy could just be having a bad day.
not_available We try to do what's best for the patient and respect their wishes.
not_available If were lucky, we get to do both.
not_available This is one of those times.
not_available Have Pedes page me and get me that Ophtho consult.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Mike Dobbs.
not_available I think you know my wife, Heather.
not_available Look, we've been having some rough times recently but I'd appreciate it if you'd stop seeing her.
not_available You should speak to your wife about it.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available Are you married? I was.
not_available Then you know how hard it can be.
not_available Look, I'm not trying to threaten you or anything, man, but I got two daughters.
not_available What do I tell them when their mother doesn't come home at night? I don't know.
not_available Just trying to keep my family together, that's all.
not_available Hey, Eric, it's me again.
not_available Listen, could you please call me back? You don't have to talk to me.
not_available Just leave a message on my machine, I'd appreciate it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Looks like your day's sucking as bad as mine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm worried about my brother.
not_available I can't get in touch with him.
not_available At least you haven't killed anyone.
not_available I'm 0 for 2.
not_available All these patients could be my next victim.
not_available I think I have the crabs and it itches bad.
not_available " So youre not taking the chest pain in 4? 
not_available Not if he wants to live.
not_available Guy in Exam 2 with scrotal swelling.
not_available Pretty safe bet.
not_available I'm not that desperate.
not_available At least it's medical.
not_available He's pushing 300 pounds! 
not_available It's a big scrotum.
not_available He's a heart attack waiting to happen.
not_available Half these patients are.
not_available Old, diabetic, old, old and diabetic.
not_available Did you reach him yet? 
not_available No, I get his voice mail.
not_available Oh, screw it.
not_available Give me the swollen scrotum.
not_available Maybe he's off with a buddy or something.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, could you reassess my allergic reaction in 2? 
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Where's Jody? She's checking into a hotel.
not_available Wanna get coffee? 
not_available He didn't respond to Benadryl.
not_available Try Solu
not_available Medrol.
not_available I did.
not_available He's still wheezing.
not_available Try an albuterol treatment.
not_available It didn't work.
not_available Should I push an IV epi? 
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What are his sats? Eighty
not_available three on oxygen.
not_available Why didn't you come get me? 
not_available I just did.
not_available Base operations.
not_available Medical facility, please.
not_available One moment.
not_available Medical.
not_available I'm from Chicago's County General Emergency Department.
not_available Were treating a patient from your base, Eric Wyczenski.
not_available Were gonna need his medical records faxed over.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Who's his doctor? 
not_available I don't have the chart in front of me.
not_available Does it matter who the doctor is? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We can't release his records otherwise.
not_available Okay, just a second.
not_available The physician's name is Dr.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Dr.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available It's okay.
not_available How are you feeling, Greg? My eyes hurt.
not_available Can you see anything? No.
not_available Hey, Chuny? Yeah? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available About everything.
not_available Me too.
not_available Am I blind? You have a shotgun pellet inside your eyeball.
not_available Were bringing in an eye specialist to repair it.
not_available Youre lucky.
not_available You could've blown your head off.
not_available My dad would be less mad at me if I was dead.
not_available He shouldn't be angry with you at all.
not_available You probably saved your brother's life.
not_available Hey, can I talk to you for a second? 
not_available Shoot.
not_available Carter! Carter! Is there anything wrong with him? 
not_available Not that I can tell.
not_available Neighbor heard the baby crying.
not_available Found Mom in the backyard, kid in the swing.
not_available Mom's got no sign of trauma.
not_available Could be a possible mixed OD.
not_available GCS, 415, but she's uncooperative.
not_available BP, 122/78.
not_available Pulse, 84.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's her name? Neighbor wasn't sure, thought it was Tenji or Tong
not_available yi.
not_available She didn't have ID.
not_available Ma'am, can you tell me your name? I have a 16year
not_available old boy who's gonna go blind if he doesn't get here fast.
not_available Tell me where he is so I can call for some initial orders.
not_available He's on the golf course.
not_available He's where? He's playing golf at the country club.
not_available Eyes open to painful stimuli.
not_available Is your name Tenji? Or Tongyi? Is she oriented to person? 
not_available Her little boy's fine.
not_available Does she understand English? Gag reflex is present.
not_available I smell alcohol on her breath.
not_available Got your bloods.
not_available Okay, what do you want? 
not_available CBC, lytes, ET OH.
not_available Aspirin and acetaminophen levels.
not_available Hello? Eric! What about charcoal? Where are you? The 2001 recommendations from Clinical Toxicology didn't support the administration 
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available She can't tell us when she took it.
not_available Twenty
not_available five of charcoal.
not_available I need some Surgilube and an NG tube.
not_available Abby, she needs a Foley, tox screen.
not_available Damn it.
not_available And let's change the saline to Dfive 
not_available half at 75 an hour.
not_available Hello? Blunted deep tendon reflexes.
not_available Could be benzos.
not_available Should we try Flumazenil? 
not_available Only if you want her to start seizing.
not_available Did you lose him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I lost him.
not_available It's not unusual to experience these feelings when dealing with chronic illness.
not_available Mr.
not_available Nathan, may I have a word? Excuse me.
not_available What's he doing in there? 
not_available That's Dr.
not_available Harvey.
not_available He's the Attending psych
not_available I know.
not_available I asked you what he's doing.
not_available He was on a psych consult on another patient and I asked if he would speak with Mr.
not_available Seaton.
not_available Did you run this by Dr.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available No.
not_available Dr.
not_available Harvey agreed.
not_available Mr.
not_available Seaton was depressed and wasn't objective about his own treatment.
not_available He's refused treatment.
not_available He's willing to consider other options.
not_available A Whipple, for instance
not_available A Whipple? No.
not_available Please don't tell me you suggested a Whipple for this patient.
not_available I'm not sure who brought it up.
not_available Well, whoever did must be utterly insane because nobody in their right mind would suggest a 6
not_available hour operation.
not_available An operation that requires months of recovery, assuming he ever recovers.
not_available And for what? 
not_available He's dead in 2 months if we do nothing.
not_available That's right.
not_available But only you seem to be unwilling to accept that.
not_available Well, shouldn't we at least present him with all the facts and let him decide? You've done enough, thank you.
not_available Normal vitals, satting well on room air.
not_available You get your phone working? 
not_available No.
not_available Tox screen is positive for barbiturates.
not_available Blood alcohol level's only.
not_available 065.
not_available Urine dip's negative, but ICON's positive.
not_available She's coming around.
not_available Ma'am? Do you know that you' re pregnant? You speak English? Where's Chen? Maybe she can translate for us.
not_available I wanna rule out an ectopic.
not_available Where is the portable ultrasound? 
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Can I do it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I'm sorry, but it was right in the middle of a trauma.
not_available Maybe he'll call back.
not_available Check your home machine? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't have a chance to.
not_available Well, how did he sound? Depends on who you ask.
not_available Sounds great.
not_available He's happy, he's carefree, he's having the time of his life.
not_available Just the fact that he called is a pretty good sign.
not_available Yeah, he's manic, Carter.
not_available Say, Abby, here's two of the country's finest looking for a patient.
not_available I'm Sergeant Andrews with the Air Force Office of Special Investigation.
not_available I understand you' re treating Eric Wyczenski.
not_available No.
not_available We were, but we' re not now.
not_available He left against medical advice.
not_available Any idea where he may be going? I'm sorry we can't be more helpful, but we have an emergency.
not_available What about the doctor who treated him? 
not_available He's upstairs.
not_available If you leave your card, we'll call you if he shows up again.
not_available What was that all about? 
not_available I was about to tell you.
not_available These are your brother's medical records? I said we were treating him.
not_available You'd still require his signature.
not_available And a written request from his Attending physician which in this case was You forged my name too? 
not_available We could get into trouble for this.
not_available Just read it.
not_available No.
not_available I have no right to read this, and neither do you.
not_available He took a leave of absence for stress following a near
not_available miss incident.
not_available Yeah, so? He's an air
not_available traffic controller.
not_available It's a stressful job.
not_available He had therapy but wasn't medicated.
not_available Probably no reason to.
not_available Just a reaction to the event.
not_available What if it isn't PTSD? What if it was depression? The initial presentation of a bipolar disorder? 
not_available He's too old.
not_available He's under 30.
not_available Well, then he'd be at the far end of the curve.
not_available He's been suffering from insomnia, lack of appetite.
not_available Both of which are consistent with PTSD.
not_available Six months ago he was depressed.
not_available Now he's cycling up to a manic phase.
not_available The timing is perfect.
not_available I know.
not_available Why didn't the Air Force catch it? 
not_available They' re not looking for it.
not_available Look.
not_available "No family history of psychiatric disorders.
not_available "He's lying to the doctors.
not_available Just like you did to get those records.
not_available I thought this was a surgical consult.
not_available It was.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Fat lady sang.
not_available Fat man, in this case.
not_available We did everything but order him a deep
not_available dish pizza.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just say no to drugs and double bacon cheeseburgers.
not_available His size is probably something that he couldn't control.
not_available Certainly not if he was running downhill.
not_available Nathan, we didn't mean to offend you.
not_available You didn't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm having a really bad day.
not_available Not as bad as him.
not_available What the hell is that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You can't drive on here, you idiot.
not_available Which one of you is Dr.
not_available Abrams? 
not_available I'm Abrams.
not_available You need to come with me now.
not_available I've got a 14year
not_available old boy with a ruptured globe.
not_available He may lose his eyesight because you didn't answer your page.
not_available You' re insane.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Get in the car now! 
not_available You don't have to listen to this guy, Vic.
not_available Are you a doctor? 
not_available An oral surgeon.
not_available Then shut up.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available What about my clubs? You, take his clubs.
not_available You' re doing a good job clearing the patients.
not_available Easy to be fast when you' re just killing them.
not_available I'm gonna be taking some time off.
not_available Yeah? For what? Just to deal with some personal things I've been putting off for a while.
not_available With Romano out of commission you'll probably be the one forced to pick up the slack.
not_available Bad idea.
not_available Do you mind? We' re having a conversation here.
not_available I don't mind.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available I mind.
not_available I mind your insinuations and your smart
not_available ass comments.
not_available This is an ER.
not_available People come here because it's an emergency.
not_available Guess what.
not_available Some of these people are gonna die.
not_available I've saved hundreds of lives.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know that drunk you intubated this morning? 
not_available He asked to take his tube out.
not_available He can't talk if he's intubated.
not_available I think you better come.
not_available He's gonna vomit and aspirate.
not_available Twenty bucks says she kills this guy too.
not_available Frank, did my brother call? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Are you sure? Let me double
not_available check.
not_available Nope.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Tell Abby what you just told me.
not_available An unauthorized absence can be a serious offense.
not_available But if it's a first offense and you can prove extenuating circumstances you can get off with minimum punishment.
not_available That's good to know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Your girlfriend, Harkins, was looking for you.
not_available Why are you talking about my brother to med students? Gallant's in the Army.
not_available I'm trying to get information.
not_available You didn't have to say it was my brother.
not_available Excuse me, Carter.
not_available This is Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Yeung.
not_available Their child was brought in.
not_available Which one? The 3year
not_available old with your patient.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I thought she was the mother.
not_available No.
not_available Tong
not_available yi's our nanny.
not_available I'm Aidan's mother.
not_available Is our son okay? 
not_available Yeah, he's fine.
not_available Chuny, you can take Mrs.
not_available Yeung to see her son.
not_available Sir, if I can just ask you a couple questions first? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is Tongyi a drug user? 
not_available No.
not_available Has she been depressed? 
not_available No.
not_available Can you think of any reason why she would hurt herself? She wouldn't do that.
not_available She tested positive for barbiturates and alcohol.
not_available Well, she's been up all week with Aidan.
not_available He had an earache.
not_available She might've taken some sleeping pills, maybe a glass of wine but she's not suicidal.
not_available Does she have a boyfriend? I don't think so.
not_available Why? I just
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe she's got some problems in her personal life.
not_available Well, if she did, we'd probably know.
not_available She lives with us, has been for four years now.
not_available Can I see her? You wanted to see me? Did you review Zollinger? Was I supposed to? 
not_available He's under.
not_available Thanks, Shirley.
not_available Are we gonna do a Whipple on him? 
not_available He's a little old.
not_available Thought you didn't wanna do this.
not_available I didn't, but thanks to you he and his family seem to think the operation is worth the risk.
not_available They may have second thoughts after we resect his pancreas duodenum, gall bladder and a portion of his stomach.
not_available He's got a daughter and grandchildren.
not_available Any extra time he gets, he could spend with them.
not_available He could get up to a year from this.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available If it comes with a small miracle.
not_available Which may be in order seeing as you seem to have become the patron saint of the terminally ill.
not_available You prepared to assist? Really? 
not_available You got us into this.
not_available We' re still running some tests.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sonosite is ready.
not_available I need both trauma rooms.
not_available Double MVA en route.
not_available Auto versus motorcycle.
not_available Can I take these two? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Grab trauma gowns and gloves.
not_available Come on.
not_available Can we take her home? 
not_available She should stay for observation.
not_available In that case, I'd like to have her moved to a private facility.
not_available Would you ask her why she did it? She's not depressed.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available She took a couple of sleeping pills with a glass of wine to help her sleep.
not_available And she's sorry to have caused you any trouble.
not_available She said all that? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Suction here so I can see the field.
not_available Are you okay? I've been up for 24 hours.
not_available It throws off my meds.
not_available Does it usually bleed this much? There are numerous branches off the superior mesenteric artery.
not_available Hemostat.
not_available Do we tie off or bovie? Pressure's down to 90/60.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bolus a liter and check a crit.
not_available Like this? You need to isolate the source of the bleeding.
not_available Come on, Nathan.
not_available I need better exposure.
not_available Stop! Stop! You' re up against the portal vein.
not_available Pull out before you tear the wall and kill him.
not_available Shirley, take over, please.
not_available Just tell me what to do.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Shirley, suction.
not_available What was that? T
not_available tube for the common bile duct.
not_available Do we have another tray? 
not_available We can autoclave this one.
not_available I don't have 30 minutes to wait for this.
not_available Tell me what you want me to do.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Shirley, pick up the instruments, get them re
not_available sterilized.
not_available This will pass in about an hour.
not_available Carl Vanosh, 32, motorcycle driver versus stakebed truck.
not_available Extracted.
not_available Unable to breathe for four minutes.

not_available And I appreciate it.
not_available Your disease presents you with innumerable challenges.
not_available And the fact that you' re standing here is testimony to your character.

not_available I have to make certain adjustments to accommodate my disease.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Political correctness aside, you are physically handicapped and I would be doing a disservice to your future patients.

not_available You can do Radiology, Psychiatry but you must give me your word that you will never treat patients.

not_available I've been calling you.
not_available I was on the phone.
not_available Did you reach him? You might have to wait till morning.
not_available But I got some fish and chips from Brennan's.
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available I bought it on the way home from work.
not_available It took an hour to get it out of the bag and 45 minutes to put it in the glass and I still haven't had a sip.
not_available I just wanted everything to stop, you know? I just wanted to stop thinking about
not_available Hey, hey, hey.

not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I wanted you to be wrong.

not_available up families.

not_available We should get them all together for the holidays.
not_available Gamma, my parents, your mother.
not_available I'm really scared for him, Carter.
not_available I know.
not_available And it's so unfair.
not_available Because he was such a good kid.
not_available We went through so much growing up, and I really thought I got him through.
not_available I thought he was safe.
not_available He'll get all the help that he needs now.
not_available We' re gonna make sure that he does.
not_available And nothing that you did or didn't do would have prevented this.
not_available It's just that Eric he was the only constant thing in my life, you know? He was the only thing I could ever really count on.
not_available That's not true anymore.
not_available Promise? Because I really need something to hang onto right now.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
