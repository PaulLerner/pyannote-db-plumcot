not_available It's no problem.
not_available Is this as bad as it gets? Has it been worse? It's always different.
not_available Sort of.
not_available Or maybe I'm different.
not_available Your perspective changes from 7 to 20.
not_available It was pretty bad the time she locked herself in the garage and turned on both cars.
not_available She's been suicidal? 
not_available If you count attempted suicide.
not_available How many times? 
not_available Seriously, two times.
not_available You cut a tendon, Adam.

not_available It's tradition.
not_available How did the bottle break? 
not_available I was I was pounding it on the trunk of the car.

not_available I didn't make it through last time.
not_available Well, I guess you really want this, huh? It's a good house, and they're good guys.
not_available Don't you think you're jumping the gun? 
not_available Hold on a sec.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available You're ready to pop.
not_available Shouldn't I be the judge of that? Is this time for real? 
not_available We should've been here hours ago.
not_available We were! If we'd waited any longer, we would've had a home birth.

not_available Fine.

not_available Okay.
not_available See that family down there? Right down there.
not_available There's two little boys over there.
not_available They're fighting by the pool.
not_available Do you see them? And I think that must be their parents over there, having a cocktail.
not_available I watch people like that for hours.
not_available People doing their marketing and tying their shoes.
not_available Just doing routine things that probably bore them to tears.
not_available I think how lucky they are.
not_available They have 
not_available They have ordinary lives.
not_available You could be like them.
not_available I could never be like them.
not_available Yes, if you took your medication.
not_available I tried.
not_available I did everything I could think of.
not_available I got married.
not_available I had two kids.
not_available I tried to fool everyone that I was just like them.
not_available God, why did you come, Abby? Because you needed me.
not_available There's no one here to save.
not_available You want me to talk to her? What would you say? That I asked you to come help me with my mother.
not_available You didn't ask me to come.
not_available Send her some flowers.
not_available I'm sure it'll be fine.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available She's young.
not_available If you get involved with a teenager, you have to expect drama.
not_available We broke up.
not_available You broke up? 
not_available She broke up.
not_available When? 
not_available Last night.
not_available Over a basketball game? Over you.
not_available That's silly.
not_available What does she think? We're having an illicit affair or something? No.
not_available Just that I have a crush on you.
not_available It's not like the relationship didn't have its obstacles.
not_available Yeah, but I wouldn't want you to break up because of me.
not_available Face it.
not_available You're a home wrecker.
not_available Dr.

not_available Well, she decided she wants to come and help with her granddaughter.
not_available We'll all get along famously.

not_available How did she do? 
not_available She was an angel.
not_available She didn't even cry with the heel stick.
not_available Now she's gonna give her mother a hard time.
not_available Well, if you don't feed her, she will.
not_available I think she's hungry.
not_available The nurse said she'd walk me through breast
not_available feeding.
not_available I don't think Ella knows that.
not_available I suppose I can wing it.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Oh, it's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Just try and keep the head above the tummy.

not_available I don't know whether I can do this, Mark.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available It just takes patience.

not_available Here's your problem.
not_available You must have run over a nail.
not_available But it just started hissing.
not_available I can patch that for you.
not_available Fifteen dollars.
not_available You did that.
not_available Because I saw it, doesn't mean I did it.
not_available You put that in the tire.
not_available What's the problem? He popped the tire and thinks I don't know about cars because I'm a woman.
not_available You want me to fix it? Ten bucks.
not_available His price is going down.
not_available Fix it before we call the cops.
not_available Five bucks? Negotiating with me now? Mom? Mom? Mom! What? 
not_available What are you doing? I'm hungry.
not_available You're hungry? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll go with you.

not_available No.
not_available What? No.
not_available Here.
not_available What's that?

not_available $9.49.
not_available Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
not_available She was pretty close to traffic.
not_available It's hard not to overreact sometimes.
not_available She seems better today.
not_available She couldn't really be worse.
not_available All done.
not_available All right.

not_available Every other day? Since when does Peter Benton give home care? Yeah.
not_available Well, you know what? I owe that guy.
not_available He must've done something for you to make house calls.
not_available He was my science teacher.
not_available I should have been expelled.
not_available He gave me a month's detention instead.
not_available Expelled? What did you do? Blow the place up? Almost.

not_available No.
not_available What was that for? 
not_available School, science, everything.
not_available You did not.
not_available I did.
not_available You did not.
not_available Why would I make that up? You got a perm? 
not_available Twice.
not_available Twice? What? It was junior high school.
not_available That was the style.
not_available I don't know what planet you grew up on but I do not remember perms on boys ever being popular.
not_available Yes, it was.
not_available Jenny Butler liked it.
not_available I'd like to see pictures of it.
not_available I think I burned them all.
not_available Twice! So that means you thought it looked good the first time.
not_available As far as youthful transgressions go, I think it scores pretty low on the scale.
not_available If you say so.
not_available Is she still out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think you'll be all right by yourself.
not_available I should be.
not_available I really want to thank you again for doing this.
