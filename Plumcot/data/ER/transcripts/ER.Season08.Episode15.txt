
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available It's an isolated dysfunction of the right hypoglossal nerve.
not_available It's a recurrence.
not_available Nothing I can do can make it right.
not_available You can leave.
not_available You can pack up your things and leave my house.
not_available Either she's out of the house or I'm not taking that baby home.
not_available Brian.
not_available Brian! I won't mess with Abby again.
not_available I won't even talk to her.
not_available You touch her again I'll kill you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hirsch, please pick up extension 350.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hirsch, extension 350.
not_available I apologize for how late he's running.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm sure he'll be with you any moment.
not_available I can wait.
not_available I'll see you in two weeks.
not_available Judy will give you all your pre
not_available op instructions before you leave.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You've come to the right place, Mary.
not_available Mark, you look good.
not_available You too.
not_available How was your flight? 
not_available Uneventful.
not_available Yeah, the best kind.
not_available Elizabeth with you? Not this time.
not_available See this area? It's called "ring enhancement." It encircles the cavity where we removed your tumor.
not_available Could it be inflammation from a vaccine? No.
not_available What about a side effect from radiation? The spec MRl shows a peak of creatine and choline with a depressed NAA, which rules out radiation necrosis.
not_available I'm afraid it's definitely tumor re
not_available growth.
not_available Don't you need a biopsy? Spectroscopy was conclusive.
not_available How soon can you operate? I can't.
not_available Not this time.
not_available The tumor invaded the areas of the brain that control speech and motor function.
not_available If I start digging around in there now, the side effects would be devastating.
not_available You wouldn't be able to walk, talk, feed yourself.
not_available Which is exactly what'll happen as the tumor grows.
not_available Some of the cells must've been radiation
not_available resistant.
not_available So what are my options? I mean, other than sticking a shotgun in my mouth.
not_available Your best bet now is stereotactic radiosurgery.
not_available The Gamma Knife's safe and effective.
not_available And they can do it in Chicago.
not_available And if it works? The average is four, maybe five
not_available Years? Months.
not_available So I'm back where I started.
not_available You should've been dead a year ago, Mark.
not_available You got married, saw your daughter be born.
not_available I'd say that was time well
not_available spent.
not_available Dad? Dad, don't you have work today? I'm up.
not_available I made you some coffee.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You want some breakfast? No.
not_available I'm good, thanks.
not_available I'll be down in a minute.
not_available Elizabeth called.
not_available You were showering.
not_available Should've come and got me.
not_available Did she leave a number? 
not_available No.
not_available How am I supposed to call her back? She wanted you to bring some things for Ella to work.
not_available I wrote them down.
not_available I can get all that stuff and put it in a bag.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available I don't mind.
not_available How'd it go? 
not_available What? The conference in New York.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available You know, the usual.
not_available Boring.
not_available So everything's set for staying tonight at Kelly's? Yeah.
not_available Are you sure you should be doing this? This? Working a double shift? 
not_available You seem a little tired from your trip.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Iverson in 4 needs about another hour of monitoring.
not_available Dunn, also in 4, is probably gonna need a walking cast.
not_available The foot x
not_available rays are pending.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis is crashed out in 3.
not_available Susan? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She She worked a double, so don't wake her up.
not_available And last but not least is the lovely but kind of spooky Miss Armstrong in 2 who's waiting on a Psych consult before the sewer people come get her.
not_available What sewer people? 
not_available She's crazy.
not_available Hence, the Psych consult.
not_available And there's a bad burn trauma coming in, so have fun.
not_available Right.
not_available He called again.
not_available Randall? 
not_available Five calls in 18 hours.
not_available Sounds like a stalker.
not_available You want me to talk to him? 
not_available No.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What are you looking at? 
not_available Theresa Matthews.
not_available Comatose for a year following an MVA.
not_available Mom takes care of her at home.
not_available Called 911, thought her daughter was in discomfort.
not_available How could she tell? 
not_available My question too.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac wants you to meet him in the ambulance bay with Tartaglia's x
not_available rays.
not_available Really? 
not_available He said it was an emergency.
not_available Tartaglia from last night? 
not_available The one with the whiplash.
not_available Just telling you what he said.
not_available More information might've helped.
not_available Am I talking to you? 
not_available Knock it off and help me find it.
not_available Is that it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who's your friend? Would you mind telling me what's going on? He was gonna give me a ticket.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available I told him I had an emergency.
not_available Oh, so you used me to get out of a ticket.
not_available It would have been a big ticket.
not_available I'm glad you could pull me away from patients so you could avoid traffic school.
not_available I owe you one.
not_available Nice car.
not_available Did he get the leopardprint interior? You off? 
not_available Not till 10.
not_available What did you do to deserve that? 
not_available I asked.
not_available This way, I'm never home when my neighbor is.
not_available He's out on bail? Till the trial.
not_available Then I get my life back.
not_available How's his wife? 
not_available She's good.
not_available Safe.
not_available How are you? How's the eye? Good.
not_available I think my Good Samaritan days are over, though.
not_available You probably saved her life.
not_available Steady midnights, that can be tough.
not_available You getting enough sleep? Yeah? Eating okay? Feeling depressed or anxious? 
not_available I have to get back.
not_available Call if you want to talk.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Coffee and pie on me if you change your mind.
not_available Hey.
not_available What does a girl have to do to get a cup of coffee around here? Mark? 
not_available Hey.
not_available I just worked two shifts.
not_available I'm supposed to be the zombie.
not_available Little slow getting started this morning.
not_available How was New York? Well, I didn't see as many Broadway plays as I'd hoped.
not_available And my tumor's back.
not_available Oh, God, Mark, I'm sorry.
not_available I do Gamma Knife today.
not_available Today? What are you doing here? 
not_available It's best to stay busy.
not_available How's Elizabeth taking it? 
not_available I haven't told her yet.
not_available What? Why not? Mark, you shouldn't be going through this alone.
not_available I'll see her this afternoon.
not_available What time's your treatment? I'm gonna go home and get some rest.
not_available But after, I'll come by
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I want to.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Dr.
not_available Weaver needs some help.
not_available All right, I'll let you go.
not_available Bye.
not_available Good luck.
not_available What patient? 
not_available She's got an elderly woman in CHF.
not_available An explosion trauma just rolled in and there's an MVA with a possible spinal injury 10 minutes out.
not_available They need you in Trauma 2.
not_available Burn victim.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm firing that new guy.
not_available What new guy? Jerry.
not_available Jerry was here before you, Frank.
not_available So was the Neanderthal man, but he didn't last either.
not_available You can't fire anybody.
not_available Either he goes or I go.
not_available You
not_available You! You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
not_available What'd I do? 
not_available Mark, coffee.
not_available Mr.
not_available Nevinger, did you pass out? 
not_available No.
not_available Full trauma panel, portable C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available Start a second IV with LR.
not_available Add an ABG with carboxyhemoglobin and a CK.
not_available Sats, 94.
not_available Pulse, 120.
not_available Can I give him something for pain? Titrate 10 of morphine.
not_available But watch his pressure.
not_available Keep him above 90.
not_available Carbonaceous materials on his nose and lips.
not_available He's not moving much air.
not_available He's in too much pain to breathe.
not_available How much fluid? 
not_available One liter per hour for the first 8 hours.
not_available I'll ask my super.
not_available I think there's a waiting list for my building.
not_available There's been an old lady who's been sick on my floor.
not_available I don't want to live in an apartment where somebody died.
not_available All you need is some Lysol and some air freshener, and it's all good.
not_available Are you moving? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The freak who hit me moved back in.
not_available You can stay at my place till you find something else.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I don't know if that's a good idea.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Yeah, Abby.
not_available Why not? Don't you guys have something to do? You shouldn't have to leave your own place.
not_available He should move.
not_available He'll be in jail soon.
not_available I just don't know if I want to live there after all this.
not_available What's with the car? Like it? 
not_available It's kind of flashy.
not_available You only live once.
not_available Well, not if you keep driving like a maniac.
not_available You look kind of tired.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was up late.
not_available Oh, really? What's her name? Who? 
not_available It's a joke, Luka.
not_available No, seriously.
not_available If you need a place 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Stay as long as you need.
not_available You only have to sleep with me on the weekends.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available It's a joke, Abby.
not_available It's a joke.
not_available Who called for a consult? Burn patient.
not_available Trauma 2.
not_available What doctor? 
not_available Greene.
not_available Make it stop hurting.
not_available We're trying, Ian.
not_available How's his PO2? Eighty
not_available nine on 10 liters.
not_available Borderline.
not_available I don't want to tube him yet.
not_available Why not? He's hypoxic.
not_available He needs intubation.
not_available Then I can assess him for escharotomy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, his wife's here.
not_available That's why I've been waiting.
not_available Keep an eye on him.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Nevinger, I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Can I see him? 
not_available The surgeon's in with him now.
not_available The surgeon? The burns caused constrictive tissue
not_available swelling around his chest.
not_available He may need a procedure to relieve that so he can breathe easier.
not_available You have to do an escharotomy? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available You in the medical profession? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm a nurse at Mercy.
not_available Is he intubated? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available What's the surface area? Over 50 percent.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Do you know how it happened? He was in the garage painting some new furniture for our son's bedroom.
not_available Did he have a heater on in the garage? No.
not_available He paints cars.
not_available He knows he has to be careful around that stuff.
not_available Well, we're gonna do everything we can.
not_available Okay? Repeat the blood gas in 20 minutes and have a fiber
not_available optic scope standing by.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available How is he? 
not_available In need of intubation.
not_available I brought the things you asked me to bring.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What are we doing? I miss you and Ella.
not_available I need you to come home.
not_available I can't.
not_available You have every right to be angry with me.
not_available But staying in a hotel isn't gonna solve anything.
not_available Mark, I'm not trying to punish you.
not_available I'm just trying to do what's best for Ella.
not_available Don't you think it's best for her to be with her mother and father? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available So when are you coming home? I don't know.
not_available Aaron, how many lights do you see? One.
not_available There's nothing wrong with my eyes.
not_available It's my arms and my legs.
not_available Okay, Aaron, I need you to lay absolutely still.
not_available No sign of cranial nerve impaction or blowout fracture.
not_available Bilateral TM's clear.
not_available No blood.
not_available Does it hurt when I press here or just the sides? 
not_available Both.
not_available Foreface is stable.
not_available No dental fractures.
not_available Okay.
not_available We're gonna leave the collar on for a while.
not_available Let's tape down his head and use sandbags to stabilize.
not_available Can you feel this? 
not_available No.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available It's too early to tell.
not_available Can he tell me what happened? 
not_available It was a sledding accident.
not_available Yeah, his dad got smashed and was pulling him and his friend on a sled behind a snowmobile.
not_available Smelled alcohol on his breath? No.
not_available But he seemed out of it.
not_available Maybe drugs.
not_available Lungs are clear bilaterally.
not_available Normal heart tones.
not_available You going somewhere? 
not_available What? That's the third time you've looked at the clock.
not_available Aaron, can you feel this? 
not_available No.
not_available What about now? 
not_available No.
not_available Anything? 
not_available No.
not_available Why can't I feel my arms? Just relax.
not_available We're trying to help you.
not_available I'm gonna go speak with the father.
not_available Prep the Solu
not_available Medrol, hold the scanner.
not_available Okay, give me a reflex hammer.
not_available Mr.
not_available James, I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I'm treating your son, Aaron.
not_available He got hurt.
not_available He has no feeling in his arms and legs.
not_available We're sending him for x
not_available rays and an MRl.
not_available We'll have a better idea once the neurosurgeon's had a chance to assess his injury.
not_available This is all my fault.
not_available You were pulling him and his friend behind a snowmobile? I knew it was wrong.
not_available You been drinking? 
not_available You mean booze? No.
not_available I told them.
not_available Told who? 
not_available Aaron and Chris that we shouldn't.
not_available But they kept bugging me to.
not_available Well, that's where adult judgment comes in.
not_available Hey, idiot! 
not_available Is there a problem? Yeah.
not_available My son's got a broken arm thanks to Dumb and Dumber.
not_available You could've killed them! 
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Settle down, sir.
not_available I'll settle down after he's arrested.
not_available Look, he shouldn't be allowed to operate a motor vehicle.
not_available He's only got half a brain.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available His wife even left him because he's lost it.
not_available Let's go over here and talk, sir.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available It's okay.
not_available He's kind of right.
not_available I would've never done this before I was stupid.
not_available Here, sit down.
not_available What happened? July 17th, 1997.
not_available It was very hot.
not_available I took off my hardhat so I could wipe the sweat off my forehead.
not_available And a pipe fell loose from the fitting above me, and boom.
not_available Head injury? My brain doesn't work like it used to.
not_available Does Aaron live with you now? 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available We're buddies now.
not_available We don't fight like we used to.
not_available He's gonna get better, right? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Mrs.
not_available Nevinger's wondering about an update on her husband.
not_available I'll be back to tell you about your son.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Get a red top on Mr.
not_available James.
not_available Sure.
not_available Nobody's telling me anything.
not_available He's still in with the surgeon.
not_available Why don't you sit down here, and I'll find out.
not_available Oh, Abby.
not_available District attorney's office called.
not_available Your subpoena's been revoked.
not_available Revoked? 
not_available Trial's been canceled.
not_available What? Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Some legal snafu, I guess.
not_available You know about lawyers.
not_available They're half as smart as doctors but twice as sneaky.
not_available Ian, your wife's here.
not_available She wants to come in and see you.
not_available Is she alone? No.
not_available Your sons are with her.
not_available I don't want them to see me like this.
not_available I'm gonna have to put a tube down your throat to protect your airway.
not_available Once I do that, you won't be able to talk to them.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Your urine tested positive for amphetamines.
not_available Want to tell me why? I've been working two jobs.
not_available Sometimes I need a little help to keep me going.
not_available How do you take it? Do you smoke it? Did you light up with all those fumes in the garage? I wanted to finish the dresser.
not_available Birthday's on Saturday.
not_available Hey, where have you been? Elizabeth.
not_available I was down in the ER.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available A ruleout appy on a corpse? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, you're lucky.
not_available I'm starting to think "ER" stands for "everyone's retarded.
not_available " Honestly, it's a wonder they all find their way to work every day.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Your nanny called, said they're just leaving the hotel.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That sounds kinky.
not_available Do you need something, Robert? 
not_available Yes, actually.
not_available Your buddy Benton left us with eight delinquent operative reports.
not_available He said he was stopping by sometime this week.
not_available He wouldn't be caught dead here.
not_available They are now your problem.
not_available I'm not the operating surgeon.
not_available I don't give a damn.
not_available I want a dictated note on every chart before our JCAHO review.
not_available I'm being paged to the ER.
not_available If I don't have them by tomorrow, I'll report him to the medical board.
not_available Someone is very popular today.
not_available Oh, Jerry, give me a break.
not_available I could have one of my buddies on the force do a background check on this Randall.
not_available Isn't that nice to know.
not_available Now, what's that supposed to mean? It means that the continuing invasion of personal privacy by law enforcement is appalling, not to mention immoral.
not_available Well, you have nothing to worry about if you don't have anything to hide.
not_available Malcontent.
not_available Psycho fascist.
not_available Now, that's it! 
not_available Settle down, you two.
not_available You wanna start something, tough guy? 
not_available Bring it on, gramps.
not_available Gramps? Who are you calling gramps? Guys, stop it.
not_available Both of you, stop it! Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look what you did.
not_available You did it.
not_available Will you both shut up? You okay? Can I get a doctor here? 
not_available What happened? Dennis Cooper, 32.
not_available Multiple GSWs to the chest.
not_available I got his 8year
not_available old daughter too.
not_available Was she shot? 
not_available No.
not_available Dad arrested about a minute out.
not_available No BP, but good pulse with CPR.
not_available All right.
not_available Somebody page Corday and open a thoracotomy tray.
not_available Spreader.
not_available Okay, crank it open.
not_available Suction.
not_available What do you need? No.
not_available It slipped.
not_available I need to reset the lip.
not_available I could use a subclavian.
not_available Eight French cordis introducer.
not_available Gallant's with the daughter.
not_available Paramedics don't think she's injured, but she was covered in blood.
not_available I've got it, Kerry.
not_available Open up the pericardium.
not_available Pick
not_available up.
not_available What's her status, Gallant? She has a couple superficial abrasions.
not_available No evidence of any penetrating injuries.
not_available I don't think any of this is her blood.
not_available Hey, who is your friend? The first officers on the scene found her hiding under a table.
not_available By the looks of it, she saw everything, including who shot her father.
not_available So what's your name? 
not_available I couldn't get her to say anything.
not_available Her name is Brianne Cooper.
not_available Brianne, I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available And we're trying to make your daddy better, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Now, are you hurt? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Did you see who shot your father? Do you mind? 
not_available I need to know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I need to make sure that she's all right.
not_available Wait outside until we're finished.
not_available Her father is known
not_available Outside means outside.
not_available Should I call DCFS? Don't worry, Brianne.
not_available You and your daddy are safe here.
not_available Nobody's gonna hurt you now, okay? 
not_available She wasn't hurt.
not_available Physically, no.
not_available But she's showing signs of post
not_available traumatic stress disorder.
not_available You have to wait until the psychiatrist is finished with her.
not_available How long will that take? 
not_available Look.
not_available Some girl just saw somebody put five bullets into her father.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I need to know who did it.
not_available Her father's a well
not_available known drug dealer and a murder suspect in his own right.
not_available If whoever did this finds out she was the only witness, they may finish the job.
not_available What about her mother? 
not_available She's a junkie and a possible suspect.
not_available All right.
not_available Post an officer outside her room, and I'll try to speak with her.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available We did the best we could, but the bullet passed through Mr.
not_available Cooper's aorta.
not_available How's the little girl? 
not_available She's still in shock.
not_available You like me to speak to her for you? 
not_available No, I think I should do it.
not_available But thanks.
not_available Sorry about the delay.
not_available I got a little backed up.
not_available No problem.
not_available The whole procedure only takes about This frame provides reference points so we can pinpoint the tumor with 201 separate gamma rays.
not_available Hope you're a good shot.
not_available Well, the machine's accurate up to.
not_available 3 millimeters.
not_available What if I sneeze? 
not_available Just try not to.
not_available It could vaporize all the brain matter in your skull cavity.
not_available Kidding, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available You won't be able to move once we lock the frame down.
not_available Any last questions? 
not_available Nope.
not_available All right.
not_available See you in a few minutes.
not_available Just try and relax, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Has anybody seen Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available He left.
not_available Already? Did he say where he was going? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available We have an appointment.
not_available I can page him.
not_available You should take it easy for the rest of the day.
not_available No problem.
not_available A few people report headaches, nausea and vomiting.
not_available What about seizures? Less than 10 percent experience seizures in the next 24 hours.
not_available But you' re on Dilantin and we gave you some Decadron to reduce the risk of brain edema.
not_available Is there someone to drive you home? 
not_available I took the El.
not_available Is someone staying with you tonight? 
not_available My daughter.
not_available It would be better if it's an adult.
not_available Rachel's a teenager.
not_available Well, just have her check on you, and call if there are any problems.
not_available Call Dr.
not_available Sanders and tell him I can't see his patient until Monday.
not_available Yes, doctor.
not_available Reschedule Jenna Kline for Thursday.
not_available Fax Dr.
not_available Horton Brook Yeung's MEG results.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available My daughter has an appointment.
not_available Ella.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My wife should be bringing her.
not_available You just missed them.
not_available Well, what does that mean exactly? In the interest of legal efficiency 
not_available we cut a deal.
not_available A deal for what? For jail time? No.
not_available One year parole, Community service? 
not_available This guy attacked me.
not_available This is his first offense.
not_available He's pathological.
not_available I've had to call the police on him before.
not_available He has no prior arrests.
not_available We're also insisting he undergo mandatory therapy.
not_available Oh, that's great.
not_available So, what, he counts to 10 before he hits somebody now? 
not_available This is the best we could do.
not_available The best you can do? Let's not overlook that someone beat the hell out of Westlake a couple hours after you were attacked.
not_available What? 
not_available But you didn't know anything about that, right? No.
not_available Wiggle your toes.
not_available Fingers.
not_available I'm not paralyzed? 
not_available You are showing signs of improvement.
not_available It's only gonna get better as the swelling in your spinal cord goes down.
not_available You are lucky.
not_available Put this behind you.
not_available Your dad is gonna be glad to hear this.
not_available You know, the police think that he was drinking.
not_available My dad doesn't drink.
not_available They're pretty angry about what he did.
not_available Pulling you behind a snowmobile, your dad should know better.
not_available He does.
not_available Then what happened? It wasn't your dad's idea to pull you behind the snowmobile, was it? It was Chris' idea.
not_available We were just trying to have a little fun.
not_available Elizabeth? Where were you? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Something came up.
not_available More important than our daughter? 
not_available I was there.
not_available I just missed you.
not_available I talked to the doctor.
not_available Everything's gonna be okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, any long
not_available term effects remain to be seen, don't they? Dr.
not_available Greene, Ian Nevinger's sats are down to 78.
not_available I'm down for a GSW.
not_available You better hope you can still intubate him.
not_available You still awake in here? 
not_available A little.
not_available Brianne, I have some bad news about your father.
not_available The surgeons did their best to help him.
not_available But one of the bullets hit his heart and damaged it.
not_available They couldn't fix it.
not_available He died.
not_available I know it's hard and you feel really sad.
not_available But it's very important that you talk with the police.
not_available No.
not_available They just want to make sure they find out who did this so that they don't hurt anyone else.
not_available Did you see who shot your father? Yes.
not_available And do you know who they were? Yes.
not_available Will you tell the police? I can't.
not_available Honey, you don't need to be afraid.
not_available Was it your mother? 
not_available No.
not_available Then who? Me.
not_available You.
not_available You shot your father? He fell asleep on the couch and left his gun on the coffee table.
not_available Why did you shoot him? Brianne was he hurting you? Honey, was he doing things to you that he shouldn't be? He wouldn't let me watch TV.
not_available So you shot him? He said if I turned on the TV while he was asleep, he'd shoot me.
not_available So I shot him first.
not_available He can't protect his airway much longer.
not_available Can we go in before you intubate him? 
not_available He'd prefer if you didn't.
not_available This is the last chance we'll have to speak with him.
not_available He doesn't want you to see him in his present condition.
not_available I've seen worse.
not_available This is your husband.
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available If they stay here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Brendan, watch your brother.
not_available I have to talk to the doctor.
not_available Carboxyhemoglobin's 30.
not_available I said no.
not_available I said yes.
not_available You're gonna be okay, Ian.
not_available How's my hair look? You might want to get a wig till it grows back.
not_available Maybe I can get an Afro, huh? Haleh, suction.
not_available I can do that.
not_available I'm an RN.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't talk.
not_available Burn unit have any beds? 
not_available Holding.
not_available He's gonna need a Swan
not_available Ganz catheter.
not_available Are these his labs? 
not_available Some of them.
not_available He tested positive for amphetamines? Were you smoking up? 
not_available It was an accident.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available You told me you'd stay clean.
not_available You promised me you'd quit.
not_available I did.
not_available Was it good? Did you get nice and stoned? 
not_available I just wanted to finish the dresser.
not_available No, Ian.
not_available You just wanted to get high! Pam
not_available Let's get the heliox started.
not_available Chuny, have you seen Mrs.
not_available Nevinger? 
not_available No, sorry.
not_available What's going on? We're trying to decide what to do with Aaron.
not_available Can't reach the mother.
not_available The father's blood alcohol level was negative.
not_available Yes.
not_available But what he did was still reckless.
not_available I don't want to split up this family, but the father is as much a kid as his son.
not_available The boys talked him into it.
not_available They should take some of the blame.
not_available You need to talk to them.
not_available I did, and they didn't say anything.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you talk to the social worker and the police? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What did you tell them? What do you care? You worried about getting in trouble? 
not_available No.
not_available What is it, then? You want your dad to get arrested? 
not_available Maybe it'll smarten him up.
not_available What? My dad's always doing stupid stuff and saying things that are embarrassing.
not_available Every teenager thinks that about their parents.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But my dad's really a moron.
not_available Well, you won't have to worry about that once Child Services puts you into a foster family.
not_available He could've said no.
not_available Could he? You think your father likes what happened to him? He lost his wife.
not_available He lost his job.
not_available He lost himself.
not_available You're the only thing he has left.
not_available And he still thinks that you two are buddies.
not_available We are.
not_available Well, then you need to grow up and start acting like one.
not_available Are the cops still here? 
not_available They might be.
not_available Well, can I talk to them again? 
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available And could you tell my dad I'm sorry? No, but you can.
not_available Why are you still here? 
not_available I'm on till 8.
not_available You shouldn't be on at all.
not_available Do you have a headache? 
not_available Just Just a little stress.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That and several hundred beams of radiation zapped into your brain this afternoon.
not_available You need to go home.
not_available There's just a half an hour left.
not_available Did you tell her? 
not_available Who? Mark.
not_available You said you were gonna talk to her.
not_available Does Rachel know? Mark, they're gonna figure it out.
not_available Let them figure it out.
not_available So you're gonna keep this a secret act like nothing's wrong until you pass out in public? The moment you tell them, they start treating you differently.
not_available They start giving you that look.
not_available What look? That look.
not_available That look like you're half
not_available dead, like you're already gone.
not_available Believe me, I've seen it before.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, you're still here.
not_available Good night.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Mark.
not_available I'm just a little nauseous.
not_available That's it.
not_available I'm taking you home.
not_available No.
not_available I am not going home.
not_available You have two choices.
not_available I am taking you home right now or I'm ratting you out to Weaver.
not_available What'll it be? You'd better not vomit in my car.
not_available The burn unit's ready for Nevinger, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Haleh, do we have Marcaine? 
not_available Right in front of you.
not_available Right.
not_available Can you take him up? I don't want to lose his airway in the elevator.
not_available Who? 
not_available Nevinger, the surface burn.
not_available I thought he was intubated.
not_available He's stabilized on a heliox, but he's drifting down again.
not_available He's Dr.
not_available Greene's patient.
not_available Ask him.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene went home.
not_available He did? Half
not_available hour ago.
not_available It says "Corday" on the chart.
not_available Fine.
not_available Mr.
not_available Nevinger, how's your breathing? Did you find her? 
not_available Who? My wife.
not_available She isn't here? Dr.
not_available Corday, sats down to 9 percent.
not_available Point
not_available eight of Pav, prep 20 of etomidate, 120 of sux.
not_available Mr.
not_available Nevinger, we're going to have to intubate you for transfer.
not_available You might not be able to talk for a few days but your wife will be able to talk to you.
not_available I let her down.
not_available Tested positive for amphetamines.
not_available Promised her.
not_available All you need to worry about now is getting better.
not_available Even if I live, she'll leave me.
not_available Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
not_available Wouldn't you? I mean, look at me.
not_available Things might be difficult for both of you for a while, yes.
not_available But you just need to give her some time.
not_available Could you find her? 
not_available Meds are in.
not_available Tell her I love her, I'm sorry.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Yankauer tip and a 3
not_available mac.
not_available Got it.
not_available Bag him.
not_available No.
not_available I had Debbie pick up the kids.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks, Evelyn.
not_available No, I will.
not_available I will.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bye.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Nevinger? I'm Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I helped work on your husband.
not_available They told me you were in Chairs.
not_available I was afraid you'd left.
not_available No, I'm leaving now.
not_available I just called Ian's mom.
not_available She's coming.
not_available I didn't tell her about the drugs.
not_available I should.
not_available I should let the boys see him.
not_available Show them what drugs did to their father.
not_available They'll see that soon enough.
not_available Assuming we're still around when he gets out.
not_available We've just moved your husband up to the burns unit.
not_available Look, I know what he did was wrong and obviously you have some things to work out but he really needs you right now.
not_available Yeah? What about me? What about my sons? They really need a father, but they don't have one now.
not_available Yes, they do.
not_available No.
not_available They have a drug addict in a hospital with burns over 50 percent of his body.
not_available He's still their father.
not_available He's still your husband.
not_available You do know that he could succumb to infection and die within the next week? That is not my fault.
not_available I begged him to stop using drugs.
not_available I'm certain he's sorry for what he did.
not_available Is he? Mrs.
not_available Nevinger, he's in unbelievable pain.
not_available He'll be permanently disfigured.
not_available He'll never look like the father your sons remember.
not_available I think he's suffered enough punishment, don't you? You two can go home.
not_available You're both suspended until Monday.
not_available For what? 
not_available For fighting.
not_available We weren't fighting.
not_available I was told you two got into a fistfight.
not_available I'm afraid somebody's pulling your leg, chief, so to speak.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I love this old guy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen, did you or did you not witness these two getting into an altercation? What altercation? 
not_available You were knocked to the floor.
not_available No.
not_available I tripped over a phone cord earlier, but that was my own fault.
not_available Hey, knock it off, you two.
not_available Carter.
not_available Just the man I want to see.
not_available Look.
not_available I got six patients for you.
not_available Not on for eight minutes.
not_available You're here.
not_available But I'm eating.
not_available Well, too bad.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei? Randall.
not_available I've been calling you all day.
not_available Did you? Did you get my flowers? Yes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So are you off? You know, actually, I have
not_available Aren't you covering Dr.
not_available Greene? Yes.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available Well, what about after that? Look, Randall, you're a nice guy and all but I just don't think this is gonna work out between us.
not_available Well, I had fun.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I've gotta get back to work.
not_available Can I call you? No.
not_available Bye.
not_available Don't tell me you just broke up with that guy.
not_available It was hardly a breakup.
not_available I mean, we just went out once.
not_available One date and he buys flowers? Can you believe it? You give a guy hand
not_available release during Harry Potter and he wants to marry you.
not_available You okay? Thank you.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Can I help you? Nope.
not_available Hey, Abby?

not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available You need a place to stay, let me help.

not_available Please? For me.
not_available I need you.
not_available They're kicking my ass in Pictionary.

not_available Three lap cholys, two inguinal hernias, LeFort III reduction vagotomy and a pancreaticoduodenectomy.
not_available I only assisted on the LeFort.
not_available Daniels was the primary.
not_available Well, Daniels has moved to Las Vegas.
not_available Growing demand for breast implants, apparently.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, I guess I should've moved further away myself.
not_available This doesn't have to be so clandestine, Peter.
not_available You won't burst into flames if you step inside the hospital.
not_available I know.
not_available I just wanted to make a clean break.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, finish those and you'll be free of us.
not_available Oh, and you owe me $27 for Xerox.
not_available How's the baby? Normal background rhythms, low amp activity.
not_available All right, make sure you get SSEPs.
not_available You seem to be holding up okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What? What? I think I may have left my husband.
not_available You think? 
not_available Well, I moved out.
not_available I'm living in a hotel.
not_available What happened? I've never made demands on him, not real ones anyway.
not_available The only time I ask him to put his family first, he can't do it.
not_available Back up.
not_available You lost me.
not_available He won't send Rachel away.
not_available It's like he has to prove he loves her.
not_available You want him to prove he loves you.
not_available Yes.
not_available No.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know if I'm protecting my daughter or just angry.
not_available Look, Elizabeth, I'd be angry too
not_available At Mark.
not_available You see, I think I do blame him for what happened.
not_available And I think I've found a way to avoid being with him because I blame him.
not_available He's different.
not_available It's like he's It's like he's disconnected from us somehow.
not_available Or maybe it's me, you know? I just don't have the energy to figure it out.
not_available What happens if he sent Rachel home tomorrow? Usually this time of year, Chicagoans are tired of the cold and snow wondering if winter will ever end You' re out of mustard.
not_available I told you, I'm not hungry.
not_available You have to eat.
not_available That's right.
not_available Starve a cold, feed a tumor.
not_available You need to keep your strength up.
not_available I need to take a nap.
not_available Well, I'll help you upstairs if you have some soup.
not_available No, I mean right now, right here.
not_available What if Rachel comes home? She'll see you're sick.
not_available She's sleeping over at a friend's.
not_available Mark, you have to have someone watch you following Gamma Knife therapy.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available What? I can't close my eye.
not_available I've heard of cowboys who sleep with one eye open.
not_available I'm glad you think this is funny.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hold still.
not_available You'll have to start using artificial tears.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's that? It's good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't let the soup get cold, huh?
