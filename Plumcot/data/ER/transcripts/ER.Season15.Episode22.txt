not_available And he died.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available And it seemed so senseless that we
not_available My wife and l, we struggled to find some sort of meaning in it.
not_available And in the aftermath of our small tragedy we realized that we could make a difference in other people's lives.

not_available Even with aggressive treatment she would only live a week or two in the lCU on machines.
not_available A ventilator, dialysis, lV pumps to keep her blood pressure up.
