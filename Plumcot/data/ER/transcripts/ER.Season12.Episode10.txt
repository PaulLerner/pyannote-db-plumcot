not_available I never heard that one before.
not_available Repeat electrolytes aren't even back yet.

not_available Hyponatremia is serious.
not_available You need to stay here and be monitored.
not_available I thought you had fixed me with that saline stuff.

not_available We got an MVA rolling in.

not_available Three months ago, I went to the doctor for a stomachache.
not_available I walked out a cancer patient.
not_available Ovarian.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Had already spread to the liver and the lungs.
not_available Five
not_available year survival, less than 5 percent.
not_available All the more reason for you to stay.
not_available You can't fight this if you don't take care of yourself.
not_available I don't wanna fight this.
not_available Treatment means surgery, chemo, months in a hospital bed.
not_available I don't want that.
not_available I don't want my kids remembering me as this weak, bald, dying woman.
not_available I can devote my remaining time to some futile fight or to my family.
not_available I'm choosing my family.
not_available What does your husband want? He doesn't know.
not_available Look, after the holidays, I'll tell him.
not_available But right now, I'm going home.
not_available I already told you.
not_available It happened so fast.
not_available So no license plate, nothing? 
not_available No.
not_available Why don't you give her a break? 
not_available We'll call you if anything changes.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He asked me if I saw the guy's face, and I didn't, so
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available They're stabilizing her.
not_available We wanna get her to Surgery.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available That's good.
not_available And here are her things.
not_available I told her Santa wouldn't bring her anything unless she wrote it all down.
not_available We're doing everything we can.
not_available Neighborhood's always been dangerous.
not_available When I moved to New York, I asked my mom to come live with us but she wouldn't.
not_available Do you want me to call her? Arrange to have her meet you here? Her diabetes, she can barely walk.
not_available Well, is there someone else? A friend or family? My husband.
not_available He's flying in tonight, but he doesn't know about this.
not_available Is there anything I can get you? I should try Jason again.
not_available Maybe I can catch him on the layover.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Kovac from the ER looking for a repeat sodium level on a patient, Tamara Gordon.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, are you auditioning today? I'm not sure yet.
not_available Hey, schizo.
not_available Mickey Goldstein's labs are back.
not_available What about you, Dr.
not_available Clemente? Are you a singer? Very nice.
not_available Abby's short on baked goods, maybe you can help her out there.
not_available Okay, good news.
not_available All your blood tests came back completely normal.
not_available Yeah, bad news.
not_available I feel like there's a truck parked on my spleen.
not_available You can go home now.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available What about this terrible cough? Don't worry.
not_available It's probably just a little virus.
not_available A virus? Well, can a virus cause chest pain? What chest pain? 
not_available A terrible massive pressure right here.
not_available Oh, the pain.
not_available Why didn't you tell the other doctor? It just started a little while ago.
not_available You still stuffing that suit? I went to buy some kente cloth but the salesgirls used it all to wipe themselves.
not_available That's why I kicked your ass.
not_available How did you guys get started in this, anyway? Some employee complained that our company only celebrates Christmas.
not_available So the boss decided to throw a PC holiday party to show how we all get along.
not_available That sounds like a plan.
not_available Santa, how do you handle one of those on your lap? Oh, we break out the big Santa for that one.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Maybe I should bring a leg tomorrow.
not_available If you don't stop, I'll shove a leg up
not_available Eve.
not_available You're a real nutcracker.
not_available You wanna help me jingle my bells? Instead of pissing all over everyone, piss in that.
not_available I'm in too much pain to walk.
not_available I need a urine sample now.
not_available Crit's 31.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Got a weak pulse.
not_available That's what I wanna hear.
not_available Let's get a BP.
not_available All right.
not_available Tube position looks good.
not_available What's the delay? 
not_available Surgery's here.
not_available Where's Dubenko? 
not_available On vacation.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Albright.
not_available I'm covering for him.
not_available Bullet in upper quadrant.
not_available Cross
not_available clamp the aorta for traumatic full arrest.
not_available You told us an hour ago you were redlining this patient to the O.
not_available R.
not_available We got a team, scrubbed and waiting.
not_available She hasn't been stable enough to move.
not_available We had no pulse.
not_available Be discriminating when you say " redline.
not_available " We hear it, drop everything, and run to the O.
not_available R.
not_available You don't redline a pulseless patient.
not_available Important thing is she has a pulse now.
not_available So let's go.
not_available She's bradying down.
not_available And we just lost that pulse.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available You have a real three
not_available ring circus in here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Albright, I don't think we've met.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver, chief of staff.
not_available Oh, Dr.

not_available I'm the surgical chief resident.
not_available Just got back from a VA rotation.
not_available Good for you.

not_available Hang a unit.
not_available Call us when you know what's going on.
not_available I know what's going on.
not_available We can't hold the O.R.
not_available for a dead kid.
not_available She's not dead.
not_available What the hell? 
not_available She's a bitch, but she's right.
not_available Let's get the mom in here.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm going with an atrial line.
not_available Fourteen
not_available gauge and four more units.
not_available Hey.
not_available Merry Christmas, doctors.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available You letting them go home? 
not_available You saw her sodium level.
not_available She needs to be home.
not_available She could develop central pontine myelinolysis.
not_available She could start seizing again.
not_available We'll recheck her level in the morning.
not_available She promised to come back after her kids opened their presents.
not_available You're not gonna believe this.
not_available Joe just called.
not_available He wants to spend Christmas at his mother's.
not_available That could be fun.
not_available Without me.
not_available Well, maybe it's a family tradition.
not_available You can spend New Year's together.
not_available I guess.
not_available Isn't this cute? Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Roy Orbison, together at last.
not_available What did you just say? My bad.
not_available Roy Orbison wasn't blind, he just wore the glasses.
not_available You sit down.
not_available I'm not gonna tell you again.
not_available You're ruining our performance.
not_available No, you guys sound great.
not_available Keep going.
not_available And don't yell at me again, or you won't see any gifts under the tree.
not_available Oops! My bad.
not_available You won't see them anyway.
not_available Ho, ho, ho, you piece of crap.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available Another atropine and stand by with epi.
not_available She's had eight rounds of meds, Pratt.
not_available Bring her mom in.

not_available Cardiac line might help us catch up with her blood loss.
not_available I'm getting her now.
not_available No, I'll go get her.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hopkins.
not_available Is she okay? I'll let you guys talk.
not_available Would you like to come in and see your daughter? Are you finished? How is she doing? 
not_available Danielle's condition is very serious.
not_available But you're helping her.
not_available I can see that.
not_available We've given her fluids.
not_available We've given her medicines.
not_available We've even opened up her chest, but her heart's just not beating on its own.
not_available What are you saying? Nadine, please
not_available No.
not_available Just go back in there and help her.
not_available It'd be good for her to have you there.
not_available Just hearing your voice.
not_available Okay? Sats are not coming up.
not_available It's getting harder to bag her.
not_available Up the rate.
not_available Watch her pressures.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You can get close.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available You have been so strong today.
not_available Is she responding to the calcium? We've given her medications to try to restart her heart but nothing's working.
not_available She's lost too much blood.
not_available They've been working real hard to keep you here.
not_available Remember how I told you God does things for a reason? Well, maybe he just wants you with him real bad right now.
not_available I want you to know I want you to know that it's okay to let go.
not_available You see, God doesn't want you to be in any pain, and neither does Mommy.
not_available Daddy and I, we love you so much.
not_available We will always love you.
not_available So don't be afraid.
not_available Don't be afraid.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Rate's coming up.
not_available She's got a pulse.
not_available Epi infusion, 0.
not_available 1 cc per kilo.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Her heart's beating.
not_available Package her up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I want her fired.
not_available Things got a little out of hand.
not_available She poured pee on me.
not_available At least it was your pee.
not_available You think that's funny? These guys saw it.
not_available Saw it? We can still smell it.
not_available What did you have for lunch? Asparagus fries? We didn't see it, Santa.
not_available No, but you heard it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And it sounded good, you fat bastard.
not_available Dr.

not_available Yeah, I don't care.
not_available The kid can't wait.
not_available Her chest is open.
not_available She's got a pulse.
not_available Two minutes and that's it.
not_available O.R.'s full.
not_available They'll take her soon.
not_available Now.
not_available They'll take my child now.
not_available Move her to another hospital.
not_available She's not stable enough.
not_available Call Shriners, Children's.
not_available If they don't call back within 2 minutes, I'll take her up myself.
not_available I promise, okay? What did? How did it go? Remember Debbie Allen from Fame? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, Haleh makes her look like Mother Teresa.
not_available Next! 
not_available You punched a patient.
not_available He's lucky I didn't have a gun.
not_available You can get suspended.
not_available He's a moron.
not_available He's a moron who wants to call his lawyer.
not_available Good, I'll punch him too.
not_available Now, keep the splint dry.
not_available Watch for any pain, numbness, discoloration.
not_available Remember, just because Santa's reindeer can fly doesn't mean you can, okay? 
not_available Eve.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Walk with me.
not_available Eve, hold on.
not_available What? You need to go over there and apologize.
not_available You want me to say sorry to some jerk who was teasing blind kids? I want you to apologize so we can salvage this situation.
not_available And if I don't? 
not_available You can lose your job.
not_available You may have gotten a gold star and become chief of the department but I hate to break it to you.
not_available Only the nursing supervisor can fire me.
not_available Okay, well, you got no signs of ischemia, or LVH or arrhythmias.
not_available So, what have I got? You've got absolutely nothing wrong with you.
not_available What about the headache? What headache? 
not_available The terrible pounding between my eyes.
not_available Pounding? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It keeps me awake all night.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available And it's worse during the day.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm starting to smell something.
not_available Yeah, I smell something.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available What is that? Bull crap, maybe? 
not_available Oh, jeez.
not_available First you say it's your stomach, then your heart, then your head.
not_available Look, I just can't go home.
not_available Well, you got no choice, okay? I need these beds for really sick patients.
not_available Look, I need this bed.
not_available Yeah, well, you've wasted enough tax dollars.
not_available Just go home to your wife.
not_available Just go.
not_available My wife died about four years ago.
not_available So you're tired of spending Christmas alone watching Miracle on 34th Street by yourself? Yeah, especially in living color.
not_available Right.
not_available How long you gonna keep me waiting? I got a patient here, okay, Jodie? Please, do you mind? Yeah.
not_available You're signing him out.
not_available No, I'm not signing him out.
not_available He's really sick.
not_available He's got Ohniatis Muchgotow.
not_available He got it in Brazil.
not_available Right, Mickey? 
not_available Yeah, right, Brazil.
not_available I never heard of that.
not_available Because you're an ICU nurse, that's why.
not_available And this is a toxicology problem.
not_available In fact, he needs to be admitted and watched tonight and especially tomorrow.
not_available Haleh.
not_available Haleh, please.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've called you 20 times.
not_available Right.
not_available And I haven't answered you back for a reason.
not_available What's up? 
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available Because I wanted to see you in person.
not_available Breathe normally.
not_available Okay, go back.
not_available Go back to Jersey.
not_available Go back to your husband.
not_available Just leave me alone.
not_available My husband is not gonna find me, so just relax.
not_available Your husband's a cop, okay? Don't tell me to relax.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente, do you need me? Haleh, yes, I do.
not_available Mr.
not_available Goldstein needs to be signed in and needs to be observed for 
not_available Systemic Ponderosa.
not_available Systemic Ponderosa.
not_available What? 
not_available What? You heard me.
not_available Just write it down.
not_available I'll explain it to you later.
not_available Jodie, please.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Have you witnessed violent behavior before? I never said she was violent.
not_available Angry? She's very good at her job.
not_available Today was just a hard day.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taggart
not_available Look, I don't feel comfortable evaluating her.
not_available She's my boss.
not_available That's part of management, Sam.
not_available That's what everyone tells me, but I don't understand why you can't just bring her in here instead of talking behind her back.
not_available I will talk to her, but we believe in 360 evaluation here from supervisors, peers and subordinates.
not_available So I expect you to be honest with me.
not_available After she punched Santa and poured the urine on him, what did she do? She went to lunch.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you for your time, Ms.
not_available Taggart.
not_available So, what happens now? Well, this is grounds for immediate termination.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available You can't fire Eve on Christmas Eve.
not_available Look, it was good between us, okay? Actually, okay, it was great.
not_available But that was for a while.
not_available God, you look good.
not_available You're married, which is something you deliberately omitted when we first met.
not_available You knew.
not_available No, I didn't know.
not_available Okay, at first, at first
not_available Okay, but you know what? It doesn't matter now, because I can't stop thinking about you.
not_available Jodie.
not_available Jodie.
not_available Jodie, stop it, stop it.
not_available I want you to hop on the first plane and get the hell out of here.
not_available Before your husband puts a bullet in my ass.
not_available Just tell me the truth.
not_available Don't you miss it? 
not_available Nope, not at all.
not_available You never think about it? You never think about us? No, I don't think about us.
not_available See, I think that whenever I called, you wanted me to call.
not_available That's such bull.
not_available I think that whenever you heard my voice, you sprung to attention.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Don't be ridiculous.
not_available And you went into a room and you saluted your little soldier.
not_available Big soldier.
not_available I know.
not_available But, see, I'm here now, baby.
not_available Systolic's up to 83.
not_available The art line's a little hinky.
not_available If the waveform looks blunted, try repositioning.
not_available This is probably a waste of time.
not_available But it's good for Residents and students to get a look at young organs.
not_available This is a child.
not_available Keep that in mind.
not_available I'll see you.
not_available They're taking her up to Surgery.
not_available Anesthesia will have some more questions for you.
not_available Danielle's a fighter.
not_available They're gonna take good care of her.
not_available Nice work.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Is she gonna make it? Not sure yet.
not_available Did they find those shooters? Still looking.
not_available I'll come back later.
not_available I need to go out for a while.
not_available Where are you going? Come see.
not_available When they find these jerks the cops should make them come here, make them see what they've done.
not_available What's all this? 
not_available It's a vigil for Danielle.
not_available But she's not dead.
not_available They're praying to keep her that way.
not_available Really? 
not_available Really.
not_available Not bad, Olivia.
not_available Not bad, baby.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Our little girl bradied down in the elevator, lost her pulse.
not_available Brought her back to Trauma 1.
not_available Tell them to keep praying.
not_available Hey.
not_available I just can't believe it.
not_available On Christmas.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I just tried so hard, you know.
not_available Now it's all nothing.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Don't talk like that.
not_available You know how hard it is out there.
not_available Yeah, but you're experienced.
not_available Hospitals are always looking for good nurse managers.
not_available What? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? My boyfriend just dumped me.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available What did you
not_available ? Am I getting fired? I didn't say that.
not_available Answer me.
not_available Am I getting fired? I gotta get back to work, okay? 
not_available What? Ugh.
not_available Of course.
not_available What did I expect? Come on.
not_available I'm setting up a new life here.
not_available I want as little drama as possible.
not_available You can understand that, can't you? Bobby hit me.
not_available What? 
not_available Broke a rib.
not_available I'm sorry, I didn't know, but you didn't say anything.
not_available Look, why didn't you go to the police? He is the police.
not_available All they would have done is come over, give Bobby a high five and then had a beer with him.
not_available I left him.
not_available Vic, I'm not going back.
not_available Now, I'm at the Marriott.
not_available If you wanna call me, do.
not_available And if you don't, then you can have a nice holiday.
not_available At least she's saving on long distance.
not_available Come on, Frank.
not_available Was that Jodie? 
not_available How do you know her name? She calls Frank about eight times a day and I talk to her about three.
not_available That's great.
not_available Must have been.
not_available Your fly is down.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available There's a snowplow accident coming in.
not_available I'm making Croatian bread and a turkey.
not_available What are you cooking? Cooking? Do you have amnesia from the last time we dated? I thought that little girl was gonna die hours ago.
not_available I guess she's not ready to go yet.
not_available Is that them? 
not_available We got confessions.
not_available Thanks for bringing them.
not_available Hey, what are we doing here? 
not_available Taking us to the morgue or something? Somewhere even better.
not_available This way.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She was fine until we tried to move her.
not_available Holding compressions.
not_available She's down on the right.
not_available Tension pneumo.
not_available Chest tube tray and 14 French for Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available I got the heart.
not_available What's happening? Her lung collapsed.
not_available We're inserting a tube to reinflate it.
not_available Nadine? 
not_available They found them? They're outside.
not_available Is it okay if we bring them in? I don't wanna be in here for that.
not_available I need to see my daughter.
not_available Go through there and wait in the hall.
not_available I'll come and get you in a minute.
not_available Hey, nice shot, guys.
not_available We didn't shoot no girl.
not_available You didn't mean to.
not_available Your bullet went through that guy and landed here.
not_available No, dog.
not_available Yeah, dog, right into her belly.
not_available Ripped through her liver, her intestines and her spleen too.
not_available Took out countless veins and arteries, caused her abdomen to fill up with blood.
not_available We had to crack her chest open.
not_available Yo, get us out of here.
not_available No, no, stay.
not_available Admire your work.
not_available You know, your one shot is probably gonna kill this little girl.
not_available And if she lives, well, think about it.
not_available What if this was your sister lying here? Have to have her intestines removed and crap into a bag for the rest of her life? 
not_available Answer me.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available While you're in jail, I want you to remember what you did to this little girl.
not_available And for what? A dime bag? Because somebody looked at you wrong? Let's get them out of here.
not_available Her name's Danielle Hopkins.
not_available She's 6 years old.
not_available Hey.
not_available You got me fired? I have nothing to do with you.
not_available Check with the nursing supervisor.
not_available She said I had to clear out within two hours.
not_available You know it's Christmas? You'll be missed.
not_available Bite me.
not_available Don't make me call security.
not_available No, it's fine, I'm leaving on my own.
not_available But I tried to do something good here.
not_available I tried to elevate this stupid ER.
not_available Instead of getting praise, I get fired on Christmas Eve? 
not_available Screw yourselves.
not_available You all suck.
not_available Come on, calm down.
not_available Oh, you, behind my back, trying to get my job.
not_available Merry Christmas, Judas.
not_available They've controlled the bleeding.
not_available Vitals are good.
not_available Looks like she's gonna pull through this.
not_available Always wanted a girl.
not_available Thought it would be easier, safer.
not_available Those guys are gonna pay for what they did.
not_available I don't want them to pay.
not_available I want them to stop.
not_available We turn our backs on these kids, we don't educate them and then we wonder why this happens.
not_available People have choices.
not_available Some people don't know they do.
not_available Is it over? 
not_available Not bad for your first shift.
not_available You cleared the board and an employee.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available Yep.
not_available I gotta go get Henry.
not_available I'll see you at Ike's.
not_available Hey, what's up? Nothing.
not_available I'm gonna go play my game.
not_available Thank you so much for having a play date on Christmas Eve.
not_available I can take them on New Year's if you want.
not_available You know, Sam, I don't think so.
not_available Why, what's wrong? Is there a problem? Alex keeps telling Willie his father's dead.
not_available That's not true.
not_available And now he's telling Willie his dad's gonna die too.
not_available I'm sure he's just joking around.
not_available Sam, Alex needs help.
not_available Until you get that for him, I'd prefer he not hang out with Willie.
not_available Heather
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Anything I can do? Thanks, I got it.
not_available Alex? What's up? Why did you tell Willie that your father is dead? Hey.
not_available Answer me.
not_available I don't need him, so that's like being dead.
not_available Come on.
not_available Your dad has problems, but he loves you, you know that.
not_available I know you love him.
not_available If he loved me, he'd call.
not_available He can't call you, Alex.
not_available But he misses you.
not_available No, he doesn't.
not_available You're just lying for him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Part of your present.
not_available Open it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available This
not_available This beats what I got you.
not_available Open yours.
not_available A compass? 
not_available I know it's corny, but it seems we always find each other.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available Can we talk? Yeah, sure.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe go outside for a minute? Okay.
not_available I don't know how to say this.
not_available What? Well, It's just that these past three weeks have been really
not_available You know, I couldn't have imagined it better.
not_available For me too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I haven't laughed so much or felt so good in a really long time.
not_available I don't wanna do anything to ruin that.
not_available Hey, you won't, I promise.
not_available Look, Luka.
not_available Yeah? Oh, man.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm pregnant.
