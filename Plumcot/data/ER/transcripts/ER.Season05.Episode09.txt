not_available Detective Wilson, Chicago PD.
not_available Wilson and I were just laughing about how we both have the same name.

not_available Right.
not_available Look, I need to ask you a few questions, Wilson.

not_available Yeah, Wilson.
not_available He is dead.
not_available And you saw the man who was chasing him? Chasing you? Can you tell me if he was white, or black, Latino, or maybe Asian? Do you know what those mean? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So which one was he? Did you know this man? You recognize him? Maybe you saw him in the park before? The police just want to find the man who did this.
not_available So anything you tell them can help.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, was he a tall guy or a short guy? Kind of tall, maybe.
not_available Did he come up on you all of a sudden or did you notice him earlier? He came up all of a sudden.

not_available I'm awake.
not_available Just playing possum.
not_available I'm sick of meeting people.
not_available Can we get out of here? 
not_available I don't know where we'd all fit.
not_available Oh, not them.
not_available Us.
not_available Once the implant's in, we'll repair the pericranium.
not_available After his hair grows, you'd never know we were there.
not_available Except he'll be able to hear.
not_available We'll activate the device in a few months.
not_available If you'll excuse me a minute He seems excellent.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available He's terrific.
not_available He's very aggressive.
not_available Aggressive? Well, I mean, as in "accomplished." So I guess you guys tried every other option for Patrick? We've done the hearing aids, intensive oral training, speech training Iooked into special teachers, special schools.

not_available No, no.
not_available But, man! He'll hear a range of sounds.
not_available Mr.

not_available There's my boy.
not_available Hey, Patrick! Hey, big guy! Is this okay? You're not too cold? Not too cold.
not_available This is a bit better view, I think.
not_available At my age, anything vertical will do just fine.
not_available So how does it feel to have 100 birthdays? Downright appalling.
not_available I'm so old I can practically remember when this river ran the other way.
not_available That's right! That's right, they changed it.
not_available My husband, Everett, used to love this river staring down at it from 20 stories high.
not_available He worked in one of these buildings here? Built them.
not_available Construction spree after the First War.
not_available Even worked on the Chicago Board of Trade Building.
not_available We did real well.
not_available Sent every child to college whether they wanted to go or not.
not_available They must have appreciated it.
not_available They seem pretty devoted.
not_available Family should be.
not_available Some are more than others.
not_available My mom and dad, they They tend to travel a lot.
not_available Oh, don't tell me your sad tale.
not_available I hear enough of that at Happy Valley.
not_available "My kids hate me.
not_available I hate my kids.
not_available My son never visits me." On and on.
not_available Given that you never know what you'll get Everett and I were darn lucky in what we begot.
not_available Well, I suppose we should be heading back.
not_available They're all terrified I'm gonna die before they get this picture taken.
not_available Okay.
not_available Doug? Andy Stiles' mom and her boyfriend are here.
not_available Are you the ones who helped Wilson? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm Judy Stiles, Andy's mother.

not_available He could use a familiar face.
not_available He's sleeping.
not_available We want to see how he is.
not_available And we want to talk to him.
not_available He hasn't said very much.
not_available The police were here earlier.
not_available What did he tell them? 
not_available He couldn't remember anything.
not_available Please.
not_available He was the last person to see my son.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available For a few minutes.
not_available All right.

not_available I think we need to go.
not_available All right.
not_available Your mom and your dad are gonna be here real soon.
not_available I know you're gonna be just fine.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's okay, Wilson.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Patients always postpone before holidays.
not_available Nothing like surgery to make fruitcake seem like a good idea.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available So I can fit in Reece next Tuesday.
not_available But his age doesn't fit the FDA requirements.
not_available It's been lowered to 18 months.
not_available But his residual hearing is still high.
not_available He's right on the bubble.
not_available Here's the 
thing We know it won't improve.
not_available The sooner he can orient himself to a hearing world, the better.
not_available Huh? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available So, Vicky, let's put Reece Benton on my schedule for a cochlear implant, next Tuesday a.m.
not_available Good.

not_available Fentanyl oralet, a little Versed, paralyzed and intubated.
not_available How did the parents do? 
not_available They could've used some lollipops.
not_available Okay, Peter.
not_available So I'm going to implant the electrode directly out of the linea temporalis.
not_available Then I'm going to put the microphone holder right behind the ear.
not_available I'm gonna inject lidocaine.
not_available And I'm going to make a flap, two centimeters from where I insert the device.
not_available I'll cut through the muscle and pericranium so the flap will come right off the skull.
not_available Alex, going to Aspen this year? No, too many snowboarders.
not_available Felt like I was part of an obstacle course.
not_available Peter, can you see all right? 
not_available Yeah.

not_available There we go.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing out of bed? 
not_available Looking for the bathroom.

not_available No, I found it.
not_available Then I'll take you to your bed.
not_available You're looking better.
not_available Are you feeling better? Wilson, what is it? Is something wrong? I should have told the policeman.
not_available They're gonna keep asking me, aren't they? Well, they want to find out who did this.
not_available If you remembered anything, I can get the detective.
not_available No.
not_available When you came here, you said there was a man chasing you.
not_available He was white.
not_available He seemed tall.
not_available But I got on my bike right away.
not_available Did you know this man? Have you seen him before? We'd seen him there earlier.
not_available And we'd seen him before in the park when we'd play.
not_available And if you saw this man again, would you recognize him? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Do I have to talk to the policeman again? When are my mom and dad coming? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available They'll be here.
not_available Carol, the cops had to leave but they'll be back soon.
not_available They said your bike's at the station.
not_available Thanks, Jeanie.
not_available Are you sure it was this room? 
not_available No.
not_available But I was in here earlier.
not_available As I said, it's a randomized doubleblind multicenter study funded by one of those hoo
not_available hah biotech companies.
not_available And the drug is for treating fracture pain? Comparing it against acetaminophen with codeine.
not_available Hopefully, it'll be more effective with fewer side effects.
not_available A colleague is coordinating it from Atlanta.
not_available So you want me to conduct a study at County General.
not_available Kerry's doing the sternal saw study.
not_available I thought you might want this one.
not_available Lf you're game.
not_available I'm game.
not_available Why not? Hey, doc.

not_available We're trying to find her earring.
not_available You know, that's okay.
not_available I'm gonna check the desk.
not_available Thanks, Mark.
not_available That's a nurse's job.
not_available They were busy replenishing albuterol and mixing ipratropium.
not_available I was trying to help in an emergent situation.
not_available Who injected the magnesium? 
not_available I did.
not_available Did you verify the dosage with the nursing staff? When did you realize your mistake? The patient went into respiratory arrest at 1534 fourteen minutes into the magnesium injection.
not_available Continue, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Endotracheal intubation was performed.
not_available Heart rate dropped to 30.

not_available Who left you unsupervised.
not_available She had the patient intubated and on a transvenous pacemaker.
not_available Due to her quick response, the patient recovered with no cardiac or neurological sequelae.
not_available It's important that we look at the outcome here.
not_available Thank you, but I'm not looking to you for defense of my actions.
not_available In fact, I feel that M and M has become a forum to place blame cover up mistakes, or be grateful that there's not a lawsuit.
not_available I would argue that, actually, we should embrace our mistakes and learn from them to improve the system.
not_available I erred not because I was untrained or incompetent but because I was exhausted, having been up for 36 hours.
not_available If we really want to cut down on our errors why don't we, for example, allow oncall house officers to leave by 12 noon on the post
not_available call day? Why don't we establish a night float system? Air traffic controllers work with airplanes four to six hours a day no more than two hours without a break.
not_available Now, why? Because human life is at stake.
not_available Yet we allow surgical interns to work 36 hours without sleep.
not_available Why? Because we've all had to do it? Because the surgeons before us have had to do it? Tradition may be wonderfully nostalgic but it is clearly not in the best interests of our patients.
not_available If you disagree with me, why don't you ask yourself next time you 
fly Do you really want that man in the control room to be on his 36th hour? She's full of piss and vinegar.
not_available For an old lady.
not_available Because she's an old lady.
not_available Everybody look at the camera lens.
not_available If you're looking at the camera lens, you're in the picture.
not_available And smile.
not_available I just need Mrs.
not_available Johnson's children inside for a quick picture.
not_available She's done it again.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Johnson? Mrs.
not_available Johnson, are you playing possum again? Come on, Ruth.
not_available Time to wake up now.
not_available Ruth? Mrs.
not_available Johnson? Oh, God! Kit, go get a gurney and a crash cart now.
not_available I don't want to bother you but the boys' clothes are all mixed up.
not_available Andy's His boots are missing.
not_available And I've got Wilson's sneakers.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available If you'll just have a seat, I'll go check for you.
not_available Have you seen Wilson's belongings? Maybe check under the trauma gurney.
not_available Conni, I need to talk to Wilson.
not_available Can you give us a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Wilson, wake up.
not_available Hey, Wilson.
not_available Are my parents here? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available But I got to thinking.
not_available Andy was probably your best friend, right? Sometimes.
not_available When your parents were out of town on business, you'd stay there? It was closer to school.
not_available We could ride our bikes.
not_available So you probably shared each other's toys? Maybe even coats, gloves, boots? Andy would never let me wear his boots.
not_available They're kind of too small, anyway.
not_available Remember when you were trying to take them off? Right.
not_available So if he never let you wear his boots then how come you were wearing them when the paramedics brought you here? 
not_available Because we had a bet and I won.
not_available A bet? To see who could ride faster from his house to the park.
not_available And I won.
not_available Whoever won got to wear the boots? Yeah.
not_available But he wouldn't give them to me.
not_available I rode faster and he knew it.
not_available He wasn't being fair.
not_available Are these yours or Andy's? 
not_available Neither.
not_available They're my dad's.
not_available Wilson, did you put these into a gun? No, those are extras.
not_available I already had some in the gun.
not_available And when Andy didn't give you the boots you pointed the gun at him? And you shot him? Not to hurt him or anything.
not_available Just to scare him.
not_available We had a bet and I won.
not_available It was fair and square.
not_available You do know that you hurt him though, right? Look, all I meant was to get the boots.
not_available You can't go back on a bet.
not_available That's not right.
not_available Andy knows that.
not_available What did you do with the gun? I dropped it down a drain pipe when I got on my bike.
not_available None of this would've happened if that car hadn't hit me.
not_available You'll let me know when my parents get here? Yeah, Wilson.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Oh, Nurse Hathaway can you not tell my dad I threw his gun away? He'll get really mad.
not_available You're saying he could go home today? There are no prisons for 8year
not_available olds.
not_available I'm not talking prison.
not_available I'm talking juvenile hall.
not_available Not for kids under 10.
not_available Can an 8yearold even understand his rights? Or the consequences of his actions? 
not_available Yes! He shot Andy to get the boots.
not_available He wanted to scare the boy.
not_available His intent wasn't to kill.
not_available But he did kill him! Doesn't that count? 
not_available Yeah, but what? Murder two? Manslaughter? The kid is 8 years old.
not_available Isn't it up to the state? But he's gotta be assessed and get a psych evaluation.
not_available Social Services has to see if he can differentiate between right and wrong.
not_available He can.
not_available Why would he make up a story about the man chasing them? Is he aware of what he's done? Has he shown any remorse? He's sorry he tossed the gun afraid his father will be mad.
not_available Does that count as remorse? You're telling me the police, the courts, psych, Social Services nobody knows what to do with Wilson Geary? Pretty much.
not_available What a mess! Anything else you want me to do? 
not_available Not right now.
not_available I put her things in here.
not_available Thanks, Chuny.
not_available I'll go talk to the family.
not_available Apparently, she was sucking on a hard candy and it lodged in her windpipe.
not_available We were able to extract it, and her BP is now 128/90.
not_available Heart rate, 70.
not_available Vital signs all appear normal.
not_available You mean she's not dead? 
not_available No, no.
not_available She's not dead.
not_available She's asleep, but definitely not dead.
not_available Can we see her? 
not_available Like I said, she's asleep so Dr.
not_available Lee? I'm sorry.
not_available We looked everywhere, and we couldn't find your earring.
not_available Well, thank you, anyway.
not_available Did you lose an earring? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Not expensive or anything.
not_available But sentimental value.
not_available Yes.
not_available I was engaged once.
not_available To a really lovely man.
not_available And he was killed in a freak horseback riding accident.
not_available Actually, we were on a bridge and the horse spooked and 
not_available Anyway, he gave them to me.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It was a long time ago.
not_available Yeah.
not_available David Kotlowitz, please.
not_available Peter Benton.
not_available Hey, David.
not_available Listen, I I wanted to postpone Reece's operation.
not_available I mean, he's barely within the age range.
not_available He has a fair amount of residual hearing and the technology's changing all the time.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, I just saw him.
not_available He's doing fine.
not_available Yeah, well, you too.
not_available Have a great holiday, all right? My parents called on the way from the airport.
not_available My dad has a phone in his car.
not_available You're mad at me, aren't you? No.
not_available When my mom's mad, she stands at the sink and does dishes.
not_available And she doesn't say anything.
not_available I'm not mad, Wilson.
not_available I'm sad about what happened to Andy.
not_available It would've been so cool if he was in one of these other beds.
not_available Do you know what it means to be sad? Wilson, do you know what it means to have done something wrong? Carol.
not_available His parents are here.
not_available Thanks, Conni.
not_available Are you waiting on a bus? I wish I was on a bus going anywhere.
not_available How'd it go with Anspaugh? 
not_available Well, no crime, no punishment.
not_available Seems what I did wasn't terribly wrong.
not_available No need to penalize me.
not_available No need to examine a system that's served so many, so well, for so long.
not_available They seemed pretty shocked that you actually suggested it.
not_available As were you.
not_available Oh, well, it wouldn't have been my choice.
not_available Well, you and I never make the same choices, do we? No.
not_available Well, Peter, we could now.
not_available Come on, Peter.
not_available This should be over.
not_available Some would argue that it already is.
not_available We haven't been alone for weeks.
not_available I need to focus on my son right now.
not_available Look, we could both draw up a list of reasons why.
not_available But why don't we just put it down to faulty construction? A casual relationship has to grow into something or it dies.
not_available It's not like I haven't wanted this to grow.
not_available It's just that I I don't have it to give right now.
not_available L I understand that.
not_available Which is why I think maybe we'd be better off as friends.
not_available I'll see you around, okay? You probably didn't know it, but we've been off work for 20 minutes.
not_available Want to get something to eat? Rosebud, Morton's, Johnny D's? 
not_available Home, bathtub, bed.
not_available That's my girl.
not_available I met them today, you know? They seemed like perfectly normal people.
not_available Father sells office supplies.
not_available Mother went to Dallas with him.
not_available She wanted to see her favorite aunt.
not_available Wilson's parents? Thought they'd be monsters to raise a kid like that.
not_available That would explain everything, right? The parents beat the kid.
not_available Or they yell at him, or starve him.
not_available So he ends up killing his best friend.
not_available Then why did he do it? Stuff happens.
not_available An 8year
not_available old shoots another kid and you say, "Stuff happens"? You got a better answer? No.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe his genes are screwy.
not_available Or his parents seem nice but they ignore him? Maybe he plays too many video games like every kid in America.
not_available Doesn't it bother you that there isn't any reason? No.
not_available It bothers me that you cared about him, and you believed in him and now you feel betrayed.
not_available I don't feel betrayed.
not_available I feel scared.
not_available If you don't know what causes it, how do you keep it from happening? Are we any different from them? I mean, they didn't see it coming.
not_available Would we? You bring a child into this world, and you think they're helpless.
not_available But, actually, I think it's us.
not_available We're the ones that are helpless.
not_available We probably are.
not_available But that's why you love them as much as you can.
not_available And you teach them as best you can.
not_available And then you wish them good luck.
not_available So, what do you say? Home bath, bed? Yeah.
not_available If you don't have any plans.
not_available If you're not busy.
not_available Drinks sound great.
not_available Can we eat too? 
not_available Dinner, absolutely.
not_available I'm meeting with Anspaugh for 20 but I'll be right back.
not_available We're going home.
not_available You? Catching up on paperwork and 
not_available Curfew's at 11.
not_available Very funny.
not_available ER.
not_available How about this snow? 
not_available It's great.
not_available Have a good shift.
not_available You gotta help me! My wife's having a baby! Hang on, let me look.
not_available We're not due for two more weeks.
not_available Yeah? Somebody lied.
not_available Oh, God, please help me.
not_available Help me.
not_available We're gonna help you.
not_available Get Mark and a gurney.
not_available Do something, please.
not_available Ma'am, I'm a doctor.
not_available All right.
not_available I got it.
not_available Help me up.
not_available Good.
not_available You know how to breathe.
not_available This is our fourth.
not_available It's coming.
not_available When did it start snowing? Crowning! 
not_available We're not due yet.
not_available Must be all the excitement.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Louis Bernucci.
not_available This is Gilda.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available You ready to push? On the next one, push.
not_available Ready? And one, two, three.
not_available Push.
not_available If it's a girl, I want to name it after Nana.
not_available Ruth? Ruth Johnson.
not_available Ruth Johnson Bernucci.
not_available What do you think? It sounds good to me.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, Gilda.
not_available I like that.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Good.
not_available This one, push.
not_available This is it.
not_available Push! Oh, God! Okay, the head's clear.
not_available Shoulders.
not_available There we go.
not_available Beautiful baby girl.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Let's wrap her.
not_available There's your mama.
not_available There's your mom.
not_available There's your mama.
not_available Okay, clamp.
not_available Excellent.
not_available We're just gonna take over here just for a minute.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Coming right back to Mom.
not_available Good job.
not_available You are so beautiful.
not_available Good luck, Ruth Johnson.
