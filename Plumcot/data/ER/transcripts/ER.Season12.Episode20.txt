not_available R.
not_available You're sending me to Africa? But I thought you could use a change of perspective.
not_available Mouthwash? You've gotta be kidding me.
not_available You're a weird dude, Pratt.
not_available Debbie and Dakarai, huh? 
not_available Yeah, they're an item.
not_available We're on our way to the Dumtala Camp to help the sick people.
not_available We're only here to help.
not_available Generally, they do not hurt the doctors.
not_available One never knows what might happen.
not_available Janjaweed.
not_available He is Janjaweed.
not_available Welcome to Darfur.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 12x20 "THERE ARE NO ANGLES HERE" Subt√≠tulos subXpacio Your government promised $50 million in aid only to pull it away.
not_available Yeah, well, we got our own problems.
not_available You ever heard of Katrina? If the U.S.
not_available does not lead the way, who else will? Without international intervention, nothing will change here.
not_available Zahra, ask him if he's been taking the amoxicillin.
not_available Listen, even with intervention, a year after us being here the world will be screaming for us to get out of Sudan.
not_available Oh, Pratt, I expected so much more from you.
not_available Ah.
not_available Why? Because I'm black? 
not_available No, because you are smart.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm also American.
not_available I did not realize these things were mutually exclusive.
not_available He says, yes, he's feeling better.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Listen, all I'm saying is that it's a lot more complicated than that.
not_available We been too quick getting in the middle of other people's fights.
not_available Fine.
not_available When the solution does come to Darfur, it is not going to be quick.
not_available Yeah, well, where I'm from, gangs, they get into it all the time.
not_available All the cops can do is step back and wait for it to end.
not_available Step back and wait? That sounds like an excellent foreign policy while people are suffering.
not_available Dakarai, stop ragging on my country.
not_available There's plenty of Americans helping.
not_available You see me here, right? Yes and quite frankly, I'm beginning to wonder why.
not_available What? 
not_available She says the baby wasn't moving.
not_available Okay, just show me where.
not_available And you are moving pretty fast for an isolationist.
not_available They told you a brother was coming, you expected Marcus Garvey? We don't have more in common than you and Carter.
not_available I don't.
not_available In fact, I think Carter is more African than you are.
not_available How long has he been like this? Um, has he had a fever? Diarrhea? Baby no cry.
not_available Yeah, he's too sick to cry.
not_available Listen, we need to bring him back with us.
not_available Look, your baby needs medicine.
not_available We have to get him to the hospital.
not_available Where is that other doctor? 
not_available Tired.
not_available Tired? Okay, wait right here.
not_available Dakarai, what are you doing, man? Whoa.
not_available What the hell? You all right? 
not_available Varices.
not_available Varices? Getting worse.
not_available You told me your IV was for a little stomach virus.
not_available Scarring in my liver.
not_available Schistosomiasis when I was a child.
not_available Damn.
not_available Well, congratulations.
not_available You just became the proud winner of a bed in tent number three.
not_available Rashida Fallad.
not_available She's 26 weeks pregnant and she has hepatitis E.
not_available Hepatitis E? I thought our water was clean.
not_available They go outside the camp, drink from other sources.
not_available It shouldn't be long now.
not_available I think you're overreacting.
not_available Mortality rate for hep E isn't high.
not_available It is in pregnant women, especially in Darfur.
not_available Over 30 percent of people who contract the disease will die.
not_available Rashida.
not_available Rashida.
not_available The encephalopathy is worse.
not_available She's pretty jaundiced.
not_available Scleral icterus.
not_available She's in hepatic coma.
not_available Ask her if, um, she's been eating or drinking.
not_available Tell her we've been giving her antibiotics and glucose through an NG feeding tube.
not_available What did she say? She wants to know if her daughter will die today or tomorrow.
not_available Tell her I'm not sure.
not_available She wants to know if we need the bed.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Got a minute? So this baby I brought in yesterday, she's not doing so good.
not_available I'm having trouble finding an IV site and this kid is getting pretty dry.
not_available Stop trying to be so tough.
not_available I am tough.
not_available I'm just trying to look out for you.
not_available I don't need a wife, already had three.
not_available Steven, you feeling any better? 
not_available I don't want to be babied.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Stay in bed a little longer.
not_available I'm ready to work.
not_available You have paracentesis.
not_available Don't be an idiot.
not_available Sound medical advice.
not_available She has no bedside manner.
not_available Talk to him.
not_available Stay in bed until I sign off on your chart.
not_available When? 
not_available When I get to it.
not_available This is why people hate doctors.
not_available He needed a paracentesis? 
not_available Took five liters off his belly.
not_available Five liters? 
not_available Had him on Lasix all night.
not_available We have to limit his sodium.
not_available That man shouldn't be working.
not_available He shouldn't even be here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dakarai is very committed.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available This is Mahdi, his mother, sister.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Can you tell her that we're gonna try to give some fluids to her baby? Dr.
not_available John, they're bringing a man from outside.
not_available They say he's been shot.
not_available Okay, 20 gauge on the femoral, I want you to call me if you need me, okay? 
not_available Ishaak.
not_available What? His name is Ishaak.
not_available Why won't you get this treated? What happened? 
not_available Two GSWs, chest and leg.
not_available I'm going to help.
not_available We got it.
not_available We handle gunshots differently
not_available We know that.
not_available Get back in bed.
not_available An entrance wound, right chest.
not_available Okay, belly seems clear.
not_available Ishaak, you left the compound.
not_available Just to the perimeter, to help a family get water.
not_available He's got strong carotid.
not_available Okay, try for the BP.
not_available Men on horses.
not_available They shot me.
not_available Let me guess, Janjaweed.
not_available Through and through left calf.
not_available One hundred over 60.
not_available Why are you always where the trouble is? 
not_available I try to help.
not_available Ishaak is a sheik.
not_available Like, with a harem? No, like a leader.
not_available He is recognized as someone the other IDPs can look up to.
not_available Trying to make a difference, get people together.
not_available Yeah, well, he should stop that.
not_available Why say such a thing? 
not_available It's making people wanna kill him.
not_available Give me two liters of saline, wide open.
not_available Okay, I got a good vein in the antecube.
not_available I'm going in with the 18.
not_available Ishaak, we need to move you to town.
not_available You need more surgery than we can do for you here.
not_available I
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Do we have the oxygen extractor? 
not_available Yeah, on its way.
not_available Treating a man with a gunshot wound? Ishaak Alazhari? I'd have to check with the doctors.
not_available You can't just come in.
not_available As long as there is no violation, we'll leave.
not_available Officer, please, please, wait outside.
not_available I'll look around for you.
not_available We'll look for ourselves.
not_available You cannot be here with those weapons.
not_available You know the agreement the Alliance has with your government.
not_available We'll go where we need to go, do what we need to do.
not_available Look, the NGO rules apply, even in Darfur.
not_available Debbie.
not_available Ishaak, this is oxygen.
not_available This should help you breathe.
not_available How are you doing, man? 
not_available Feeling pain when I breathe.
not_available This man's been shot.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available He's bleeding internally.
not_available He needs immediate care and transport to a surgical facility.
not_available Did you report this to my office? 
not_available Come on.
not_available He can do that later.
not_available Without a form eight, he's got no right.
not_available He's gotta fill out a form? It's not gonna help much if he's already dead.
not_available Come on.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available What's the matter with you? What are you doing? Are you nuts? 
not_available What's the matter with you? He'll die.
not_available Guilty, form
not_available eight violation.
not_available Requires gunshot injuries
not_available He's here now.
not_available Please, don't do this.
not_available If you are going to do this Steven! You can't come in here
not_available Unh.
not_available I'll send you a document re
not_available clarifying the regulation so this does not happen again.
not_available Good day, doc.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Damn.
not_available How does that feel? Feels like I got hit in the head with a rifle butt.
not_available Better to be hit with one than shot with one.
not_available You want something for the pain? 
not_available No, I'll be fine.
not_available I've had hangovers worse than this.
not_available Perhaps you should drink less mouthwash.
not_available What's gonna happen to the guy they took? They'll probably bring him back when they are finished interrogating him.
not_available He could be dead by then.
not_available Oh, yes, I'm sure they are aware of that.
not_available Hey.
not_available You should go back to the compound.
not_available No, I'm okay.
not_available It's almost quitting time.
not_available He's bradycardic, 58, 0.5 epi.
not_available He's already had two doses.
not_available He's not responding.
not_available Because he's hypoxic and acidotic.
not_available All right, give him another bolus and find me a bag mask.
not_available Nope.
not_available He'll turn around once the antibiotics kick in.
not_available I can bag him through this.
not_available By yourself? All night? 
not_available It could take days.
not_available Pulse is down to 50.
not_available I'm doing compressions.
not_available Are we just gonna watch him die? No, that's what his mother does.
not_available We have other patients.
not_available That's messed up.
not_available Would you please tell her that we're very sorry.
not_available Tell her that I know how difficult it is to lose a child that my own son died when he was very young in a hospital.
not_available She finds it hard to believe that babies die in Western hospitals.
not_available You should not have let them take him away.
not_available We didn't have a choice.
not_available Hey.
not_available Ishaak's wife, Sittina.
not_available Hi.
not_available You treated my husband? Tried, but they took him, he didn't fill out some form.
not_available No, they took him away because he tells people the truth.
not_available That it is not safe to go back to their villages.
not_available The people listen to him, he's
not_available Ah.
not_available Whoa.
not_available You okay? Maybe you should sit down.
not_available Are you having contractions? How far apart? She's eight centimeters.
not_available One hundred percent effaced.
not_available She's definitely having this baby tonight.
not_available It'll be dark soon.
not_available Take her to the residential compound? 
not_available She can't have it here? She can, but we can't stay with her.
not_available There's electricity back at the compound.
not_available The only place I am going is to the police station to get my husband.
not_available Do you want the police to deliver your baby? 
not_available Unh.
not_available But Ishaak
not_available Let's worry about the baby.
not_available Ibrahim, bring the truck.
not_available Here we go.
not_available I'll grab the OB pack.
not_available Passing through.
not_available Here we go.
not_available I got it.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're late.
not_available It's cinema night.
not_available We're moving to the rec room.
not_available Gregory wants us to watch Deuce Bigalow again.
not_available Keep everybody in there for a little while, all right? Is everything all right? 
not_available Yeah, it'll be fine.
not_available They turn the generators off in the compound at night.
not_available The only power in the clinic is used for cold storage.
not_available She would have to deliver the baby alone in the dark.
not_available Try and relax, huh? You okay? She's progressing very well.
not_available She can start pushing within the hour.
not_available I'm talking about you.
not_available I am tired.
not_available Been on my feet all day.
not_available You are not tired? 
not_available I'm tired.
not_available Tired of you lying to me ignoring a life
not_available threatening illness which needs to be treated.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available I promise if I get any worse, I will do IV diuretics and sodium restrictions 
not_available and I will dry out my ascites.
not_available It's not good enough.
not_available You need the procedure.
not_available Carter, what is it he needs? A, uh, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
not_available Well, interventional radiology is hard to come by if you don't have x
not_available ray machines.
not_available You need to go to Khartoum, Nairobi.
not_available When I'm in bed, who's going to take care of my patients? Don't know.
not_available Who's gonna take care of them when you're dead? Long day, huh? Only thing longer than the days here are nights.
not_available I'm okay, Carter.
not_available Really.
not_available You could have fooled me.
not_available This is nothing.
not_available It's my weekly ritual.
not_available Only way to get through the suffering that surrounds this place is to allow myself a good cry every now and then.
not_available Feel better already.
not_available So this has nothing to do with Steven? Steven makes me angry, he doesn't make me cry.
not_available You tell me, you're a doctor.
not_available What happens if he doesn't get treated? His condition is gonna get worse.
not_available It's already worse.
not_available It's the police.
not_available Hide her.
not_available What? Where? What's going on? 
not_available It's the police.
not_available Gotta hide her.
not_available Contraction? 
not_available Where? Let's go to the bathroom.
not_available Are these the men that took my husband? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Unh.
not_available Ask them.
not_available I want to know what they've done.
not_available Keep her quiet.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just breathe.
not_available What's going on? He is searching for Ishaak's wife.
not_available I told him come in the morning, search the camp.
not_available He thinks we brought her here.
not_available No, we don't treat patients here.
DAKARAl I told him that.
not_available Now he wants to search the house.
not_available No.
not_available A housing unit, that's off
not_available limits.
not_available It's off
not_available Hey, come on, you guys.
not_available You know what time it is? Everybody's sleeping inside.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available They're in the house.
not_available No! Shh.
not_available You have to keep her quiet.
not_available I can't.
not_available She's in labor.
not_available Try to breathe through the pain, Sittina, good girl.
not_available Breathe, breathe, breathe.
not_available Breathe, breathe, breathe.
not_available Hey, what's up, fellas? Whoa, whoa.
not_available Sorry, I'm next.
not_available And I don't think it's gonna leave a scar.
not_available Thanks for asking.
not_available Look, I've been standing out here for 20 minutes, okay? Pratt! All right.
not_available What the hell are you doing? Get out! Get out! Your superiors are gonna hear about this.
not_available Something is wrong.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available I feel the head.
not_available I see thick meconium.
not_available Deceleration.
not_available A long one.
not_available How low? 
not_available Low.
not_available I think the occiput's posterior.
not_available We don't have time for this baby to turn.
not_available Prep for csection? 
not_available Are you out of your mind? All, right, Sittina, your baby is showing signs of very serious distress.
not_available Vaginal delivery is too dangerous.
not_available We need to do a cesarean.
not_available No, please, unh, save it.
not_available I'm gonna put some anesthesia in your back.
not_available You'll lose feeling from the waist down.
not_available Okay, come on.
not_available Oh, Ishaak.
not_available Aah! Ishaak! 
not_available Give me more counter pressure.
not_available Yep.
not_available Debbie, can you get a blanket? Okay, I got it.
not_available Unh, here we go.
not_available Got it.
not_available It's a girl, Sittina.
not_available Allah has blessed you with a healthy child.
not_available Get my husband.
not_available There's blood in the pelvis.
not_available Try uterine massage.
not_available I am.
not_available I got no suction, I can't see where she's bleeding from.
not_available Oh, Ishaak.
not_available Give me some sterile fourby
not_available fours and keep them coming.
not_available If they find out who we are, they will kill him.
not_available Who you are? 
not_available We helped to form the HRD.
not_available What's she talking about? HRD.
not_available It's a human rights group based in Khartoum.
not_available Human Rights for Darfur.
not_available They will kill him if they know.
not_available Please.
not_available Oh, man, she's bleeding out.
not_available This was a bad idea.
not_available No blood, no pressors, no pit, not Methergine.
not_available What are we supposed to do now? She needs a hysterectomy.
not_available Bring her to the hospital in Al
not_available Fashir.
not_available It's too late to drive.
not_available She'll have to go tomorrow.
not_available Because of a bunch of thugs on camels.
not_available And they also have trucks and guns.
not_available Lots of guns.
not_available Okay, I can tie off the uterine arteries buy us time.
not_available Give me O chromic on the longest needle we got.
not_available Not enough time.
not_available Couple hours, the uterus will become ischemic.
not_available That is the best chance we got right now.
not_available I grew up in Detroit, I can be in Al
not_available Fashir in two hours.
not_available You didn't wanna bring her.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available If we'd left her, she'd never be able to deliver safely.
not_available This baby would have died.
not_available Slow down, Pratt.
not_available Okay, the uterine artery is tied off.
not_available Only chance she's got, you know it.
not_available She may not survive the trip.
not_available Yeah, but she's dead if she stays here.
not_available If she dies making the journey, well, at least we tried.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, I'll go with you.
not_available No, John, you and Debbie should go to the police.
not_available Find Ishaak.
not_available You have a much better chance of getting him out of there.
not_available He and I, we'll close and then we will bring her on to the hospital.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'd like to see Ishaak Alazhari.
not_available No, you can't see him.
not_available Why not? He's under arrest.
not_available On what charge? He's been shot.
not_available He needs medical attention.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available I would like to evaluate his medical condition.
not_available How's she doing back there? She is breathing.
not_available What the hell is that? Janjaweed.
not_available Let's go back.
not_available Oh, we got a traffic jam.
not_available If we stop, they will take the truck, leave her to die, or worse.
not_available Okay, all right, then we don't stop.
not_available Just cover her up and hold on.
not_available Now, hold on, Dakarai.
not_available But
not_available Hold on! Get down, Dakarai.
not_available Did you tell him that we work for the Alliance? 
not_available Dumtala camp.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available All right, look, is it money? Because I can get some.
not_available You must leave now.
not_available No, I would like to speak to your boss.
not_available Very busy.
not_available Should I tell him you walked in on this American woman while she was bathing? Or should I tell the consulate that an American woman's privacy was violated? How much money? Ishaak? Ishaak, can you hear me? I need to see him.
not_available No, I need to go in there.
not_available Not responding.
not_available He's dead.
not_available The tire is flat.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think they hit the oil pan and the radiator too.
not_available She's getting pretty hot.
not_available What is that? Lasix for the ascites? Prozac.
not_available Keep driving.
not_available How fast can a horse go with a rider? I don't know, maybe 30 miles an hour.
not_available Okay, well, we've been going 45 miles an hour, maybe 40, our tire blew out, so 
not_available It's more like 50.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available We've done enough time.
not_available For what? To change the tire.
not_available Maybe somebody in that village can help us out over there.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Aah! If there was somebody living there.
not_available Lord.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What? The people we treat every day it is places like this from which they come before the Janjaweed burned them out.
not_available Agonal respirations and a thready pulse.
not_available He's alive? 
not_available Barely.
not_available Ready to lift? One, two, three.
not_available Don't tell the police.
not_available Zahra, get an IV started and get him back on oxygen.
not_available What can I do? Transfer 0
not_available neg from the fridge.
not_available And when she's done, you can squeeze in a liter of saline.
not_available He's got decreased breath sounds on the right.
not_available Possible hemo
not_available pneumo.
not_available He's gonna need a chest tube.
not_available Where do you keep them? 
not_available We don't.
not_available Uh, we're gonna have to improvise.
not_available Get me a scalpel and a curved Kelly and a NG tube.
not_available When the blood compressing his lung is removed, his pulse should get stronger.
not_available Bleeding? 
not_available It should stop.
not_available If it doesn't? Why don't you see if you can radio Dakarai? They should be in Al
not_available Fashir by now.
not_available Do we have any extra water? No.
not_available What about saline? 
not_available Four liters.
not_available All right, toss me one.
not_available I gotta say, this is the first time I've ever given a bolus to a truck before.
not_available Take it easy, man.
not_available We just wanna get her to the hospital.
not_available Tell him that.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Aah! 
not_available No.
not_available His friends will not be far behind.
not_available If you try and save him, we will never get away from here.
not_available There is nothing you can do for him now.
not_available Come on, get up.
not_available Come on.
not_available Watch your step.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, go.
not_available Aw, damn! 
not_available What? The engine is seized.
not_available We're gonna have to hoof it.
not_available Gotta walk from here.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why the hell not? 
not_available I don't think I can walk.
not_available And I will only slow you down.
not_available I can't leave you here.
not_available You have to.
not_available No way.
not_available Why don't you leave me the rifle and perhaps I can occupy his friends while you get to Al
not_available Fashir.
not_available How far away is the city from here? It is still several miles.
not_available But you can get there.
not_available You really think she's gonna make it? 
not_available She will die if you don't.
not_available You ever fire one of these? 
not_available I've never held a weapon.
not_available Just point and shoot.
not_available Okay, Sittina, we're gonna go on foot patrol from here on in.
not_available I'm gonna give you a little something for the pain, okay? Wha
not_available ? What the hell is she saying? She called us angels.
not_available I said there are no angels here.
not_available Speak for yourself.
not_available You ever been to Mozambique, Sittina? Yeah, they got great beaches there.
not_available White sands, cool waters.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Definitely gotta get me to Mozambique.
not_available Okay, either those are the good guys and we're saved or the bad guys and we're dead.
not_available Either way I'm done walking.
not_available Very sick? That's right.
not_available I tell him faster.
not_available Good.
not_available You English? James Bond, 007? Dodoododoo? 
not_available No.
not_available Dodoodo
not_available doo? American "Rambro"? Yeah, "Rambro.
not_available " Good stuff.
not_available Help me.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available I need a doctor.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available She needs saline, blood, antibiotics and a surgeon.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Good stuff.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good stuff.
not_available Ishaak's doing much better.
not_available Bleeding stopped.
not_available Good.
not_available Keeps asking for Sittina.
not_available No word yet.
not_available Did you try the radio? They stopped answering the radio hours ago.
not_available Still
not_available There's no signal, John.
not_available And they haven't resorted to sending smoke signals yet.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go introduce him to his daughter.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Stop! Stop! Stop! Dakarai.
not_available Dakarai.
not_available Dakarai.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Go.
not_available We had hoped to be back in our village before the child came.
not_available To be born in this place it wasn't what we wanted for our child.
not_available Now I can only hope that before she's grown up we can go back to our village.
not_available Ahem.
not_available We tried calling the hospital in Al
not_available Fashir but we haven't been able to find out anything yet.
not_available She's there.
not_available I'm sure of it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Greg, you gave us quite a scare.
not_available Van broke down.
