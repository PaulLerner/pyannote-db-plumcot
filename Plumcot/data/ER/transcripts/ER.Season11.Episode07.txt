not_available R.
not_available I was wondering if you found a permanent replacement for the chief of Emergency Medicine? Someone you want to recommend? 
not_available Yeah, me.
not_available You're doctors.
not_available It's time to stop thinking like students and take on a real patient load.
not_available You like it over there at Luka's? 
not_available Guess so.
not_available You like him too, right? 
not_available Yeah, why? You two decide yet? About moving in? You'll kill the romance.
not_available They're on their best behavior and before you know it, they're farting in the kitchen.
not_available Hey, thanks for your help today.

not_available Sure, of course I'm thrilled.
not_available It's just I'm late for a meeting with Weaver.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I'm glad you called.
not_available Just, ChuckChuck
not_available Chuck, I gotta go.
not_available I'll call you back, okay? Bye.
not_available How's Chuck? 
not_available He's fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He's excited because Cosmo ate yams for the first time.
not_available You know babies.
not_available They like the bananas or the apples.
not_available Henry loved yam right from the get
not_available go.
not_available So as to your onemonth performance review Performance review? Now? 
not_available You've been emergency chief 30 days.
not_available And I think it's going well.
not_available Staff feels positive, esprit de corps is high.
not_available That's good to hear.
not_available Not that there haven't been 
not_available a few little glitches.
not_available First.
not_available First the average wait time to see a physician is almost 10 hours.
not_available I think we'd all agree that's a bit excessive.
not_available Second, a record number of patients leave without treatment, resulting in a record number of complaints coming to the administration.
not_available That would be me.
not_available Yes.
not_available Kerry, I'veThird, the number of bouncebacks in under 48 hours was up 11 percent, signifying an increased rate of misdiagnoses, improper treatment or really just poor follow
not_available up planning.
not_available Kerry, if this isn't working out
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available You're doing a great job.
not_available I wanted to make you aware that there are still many, many, many problems for you to work on.
not_available And if there's one word I can't emphasize enough, Susan it's leadership.
not_available That's it.
not_available Carry on.
not_available Still waiting on a transport for Mr.
not_available Lemley.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available From when you were in Africa? No, these are new.
not_available Kem just e
not_available mailed me these.
not_available I was gonna print them up.
not_available She looks happy.
not_available Which is nice, considering 
not_available Oh, yeah, she does.
not_available Oh, very nice.
not_available Anyone I should get to know? You're not her type.
not_available Paramedics at the back door.
not_available Lewis is upstairs with Weaver.
not_available We'll take it.
not_available Won't we, doctor? Hey.
not_available That's Carter's whatever, right? Man, I could look at her all day.
not_available Sixtyyearold woman, facial injuries, chest wall contusions 
not_available and deformities to both arms.
not_available What's your name, ma'am? 
not_available Might be Louise.
not_available There's no ID.
not_available She was found in an alley.
not_available No purse, wallet, anything.
not_available What happened? She could have fallen from a window or dumped from a car.
not_available I don't know.
not_available BP, 124/74.
not_available Tachy at 118.
not_available She's gonna need an airway.
not_available Let's clear her neck first.
not_available C
not_available spine looks good.
not_available Does that mean I can talk to her? You can take the c
not_available collar off.
not_available Sit her up to 30 degrees.
not_available No.
not_available Do you need a hand in here? 
not_available Facial fractures, pulmonary contusions fractured wrist, fractured hands.
not_available Name is Louise.
not_available Hi, Louise, I'm Sam.
not_available Let us know if this makes you at all dizzy.
not_available Don't talk if it hurts.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, your COPD guy's 
not_available seizing in Curtain 4.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available 8.0 ET tube is ready to go.
not_available Not so fast.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know it hurts.
not_available Pulse ox, 82.
not_available I'll move her to five liters.
not_available No intubation.
not_available It's a LeFort ll.
not_available She's gonna need surgery or she can't have an oral tube.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can I crike her? 
not_available You're gonna observe quietly.
not_available Louise, you have a broken jaw and broken bones in your face.
not_available We'll put a breathing tube in your neck and sedate you for the procedure.
not_available Wait.
not_available I was raped.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'll be back, okay? Are you the one? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got the rape kit.
not_available We did it while she was out.
not_available She doesn't need more trauma.
not_available Well, her full name is Louise Garvin.
not_available We canvassed the neighborhood.
not_available Her apartment's above the alleyway where she was found.
not_available Anyone see anything? 
not_available No.
not_available There were signs of a struggle inside.
not_available Seems like she got away and then took a fall 
not_available coming down the fire escape.
not_available Found any family? Not yet.
not_available Detectives are on the case.
not_available They'll be here.
not_available They'll talk to her, to you, and to the doc.
not_available Fine.
not_available Hey, Jerry.
not_available When the detectives get here for Louise, find me.
not_available Okay.
not_available We can't have patients sitting around for 10 hours waiting to be seen.
not_available You need to adhere to a 15
not_available minute rule.
not_available Even if you're busy, the patient needs to be seen within 15 minutes of hitting the gurney, okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available And we have a serious issue with bouncebacks.
not_available Oh, man, I was supposed to stitch that head lac in 2.
not_available Okay, bouncebacks.
not_available I need you all to provide aftercare instructions written directly to the patient.
not_available Make sure they understand.
not_available You'll take that belly pain in Curtain 3? 
not_available Yes, I was.
not_available Make sure they understand and that they know to go to their clinic or primary for follow
not_available up.
not_available Get the labs back on that renal colic? 
not_available Still waiting.
not_available What do those guys want? I got them a crate of Cracker Jacks.
not_available What's the? About the followups? Okay, MiCha Pak? MiCha, am I saying that correctly? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Tell me about the pain you're having.
not_available It hurts here.
not_available Okay.
not_available And is it constant, or does it come and go? It comes and goes.
not_available I think it's a kidney stone.
not_available My father had one
not_available Morris.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Okay? Sorry.
not_available What about a kidney stone? 
not_available Her father had one.
not_available Okay.
not_available And are you? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What is your problem? 
not_available No problem.
not_available We're all set.
not_available Sorry again.
not_available Vomiting or fever.
not_available Any vomiting or fever? I think maybe I'm better.
not_available I could probably go.
not_available No, no.
not_available As long as you're here, we'll take a look at you.
not_available We'll get you in a gown, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available And I'll be back to examine you.
not_available So you two moving in? Girl, that's getting serious.
not_available With Luka, that's getting lucky.
not_available It just seemed to make more sense.
not_available That's what my girlfriend said when she moved in six years ago.
not_available That's why you two are coming in together.
not_available We just moved our stuff over last night.
not_available We haven't even unpacked our boxes.
not_available Living together is for wimps.
not_available Real commitment comes with a ring.
not_available Yeah, my girlfriend's on that one too.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm Detective Patrie.
not_available I'm here about Louise Garvin.
not_available Yeah, she's over here.
not_available She's in rough shape.
not_available As soon as a bed opens up 
not_available we'll send her to ICU.
not_available Did she say anything other than that she'd been raped? 
not_available She could barely get that out.
not_available She's got a crike tube now, can't talk at all, and two broken arms.
not_available Hi, Louise.
not_available This is Detective Patrie.
not_available He's investigating your case.
not_available Hi.
not_available May I call you Louise? I'm so sorry about what happened.
not_available I know this is difficult.
not_available But I'm going to need to ask you some questions if you're up to it.
not_available Now, the man who raped you was he someone you knew, a friend or an acquaintance? Anyone you saw around your building or neighborhood? Was he alone? It's just mucous plug.
not_available Louise, I'm gonna have to suction you out 
not_available since you can't cough this stuff up.
not_available Can I still talk to her? Yeah.
not_available Louise, was he alone? Did you get a good look at him? Would you be able to identify him if you saw him again? You know what, I think that's enough for now, okay? When will she be able to talk? 
not_available We'll have to ask Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available It's a gravid abdomen.
not_available It hurts.
not_available It hurts now.
not_available I need sterile gloves, Surgilube, and help with the pelvic.
not_available When was your last period? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You don't know? Did you have a gush of water today? Maybe when I was peeing.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available She's 10 centimeters dilated.
not_available Oh, God, is right.
not_available Effacement? 
not_available Hundred percent.
not_available Station is two
not_available plus.
not_available Call OB? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, Mi
not_available Cha, don't push, all right? Listen to me and focus.
not_available I need you to pant when the pain comes and don't push.
not_available Chuny, can you help me with this gurney? Is she having a baby? 
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available Pulmonary contusions are getting worse.
not_available That's why she can't talk? She was punched so hard that her lungs are bruised.
not_available Swelling, fluid, bleeding in the air sac
not_available Sam.
not_available Her condition is critical.
not_available We'll provide oxygen, wait for the lungs to heal, hope it doesn't get any worse.
not_available It could get worse? 
not_available Much worse.
not_available I need to talk to her.
not_available That's not gonna be possible.
not_available The details she could give us might help solve this case.
not_available This rapist has been assaulting women all over the North Side.
not_available She's the first one who seems like she got a good look at him.
not_available Can't we do something? I think she wants to help.
not_available How? By blinking in Morse code? We can't miraculously cure pulmonary edema.
not_available She's being admitted to the ICU.
not_available Then she'll go for reconstructive surgery on her facial bones.
not_available In a week or so, they may be able to remove the tube and then she can talk.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't push.
not_available Don't push.
not_available What's she doing down here? She didn't know she was pregnant until I examined her.
not_available Name's Mi
not_available Cha.
not_available Hi, Mi
not_available Cha.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available Don't push, okay? 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, breathe.
not_available Breathe, breathe, breathe.
not_available Breathe? 
not_available Yeah, breathe.
not_available Yeah, breathe.
not_available We won't make it.
not_available She's crowning.
not_available Wanna take it? 
not_available No, not in the elevator lobby.
not_available Get me a BOA kit and a baby warmer.
not_available Okay, don't push.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available Baby's LOA, normal presentation.
not_available Okay, Mi
not_available Cha.
not_available Now I want you to push.
not_available So push.
not_available Push.
not_available Come on.
not_available Push.
not_available A little bit more.
not_available Head's out.
not_available Good, good.
not_available More suction.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now stop pushing.
not_available Stop pushing.
not_available Don't push.
not_available Don't push.
not_available A little bit more.
not_available And there we go.
not_available Cord clamp.
not_available Time of delivery, 11:14.
not_available I'll get the HemoCue.
not_available Ten fingers, 10 toes.
not_available You have a beautiful healthy baby boy.
not_available You did great.
not_available That's not my baby.
not_available What? 
not_available I didn't have a baby.
not_available Abby's not making much progress with that Korean girl.
not_available Well, give her a little bit more time.
not_available She was hoping you could come.
not_available If she can't break through her denial, she should get Psych down here.
not_available Is that the message you'd like me to give Dr.
not_available Lockhart? 
not_available Tell her I'll check in with her in a bit.
not_available Frank, call a taxi for Mrs.
not_available Donaldson.
not_available Hear you're doing the "mi casa, su casa" thing.
not_available What? 
not_available Hell, it's none of my business.
not_available Detective's still here.
not_available You shouldn't have been so dismissive 
not_available of me in front of him.
not_available You didn't need to discuss details.
not_available Louise deserves some privacy.
not_available Yeah, and she deserves a chance to help.
not_available We have an option we haven't 
not_available even talked about.
not_available And that is? If we deflate the crike balloon, Louise could whisper.
not_available You want to take her off the vent? 
not_available Just for a few moments at a time.
not_available She's requiring 100 percent oxygen.
not_available I take her off the vent every time I suction her, and she's fine.
not_available We both know it's possible.
not_available Technically, yes, but why risk it? 
not_available Because she wants to help.
not_available She does or you do? What is that supposed to mean? You're sensitive about these kinds of cases.
not_available What? You always stand up for women 
not_available who have been assaulted.
not_available And you don't? Of course I do.
not_available Maybe because of when you were with Steve? Steve never raped me.
not_available Physical abuse? Hitting you? 
not_available Oh, this has nothing to do with that.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's a violent rapist out there.
not_available How are you gonna feel in two days, two weeks, a month from now when we get another woman like Louise in here? Hey, crit's only 19 on your Gl bleeder.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available Korean girl, mother's in the family room.
not_available But Mi
not_available Cha is still on another planet.
not_available She's perfectly reasonable until I mention the baby.
not_available Then she looks at me like I'm nuts.
not_available Teenage denial can be fairly intransigent.
not_available Can't necessarily attack it head
not_available on.
not_available I know.
not_available That's why I was
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Hi, Mi
not_available Cha.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you? How are you feeling? 
not_available I feel fine.
not_available It's hard to sleep though.
not_available That baby cries.
not_available She said my kidneys are fine.
not_available Yes, they are.
not_available Then can I go home? No.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available Not yet.
not_available We're still waiting on a few more test results.
not_available How long is that gonna take? Because my parents get really mad when I'm not home right after school.
not_available Well, you're not in school today.
not_available I still need to be home by 4.
not_available Hey, Mi
not_available Cha.
not_available Have you checked out this baby over here? He's pretty cute.
not_available Why do you people keep asking me about that baby? We're just wondering if you like babies, or if you ever wanted to have a baby.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe when I'm married.
not_available Who cares? You want to try holding him? Why would I do that? I don't get why he's even in here.
not_available I mean, shouldn't his mother be dealing with him? 
not_available Okay, you just take it easy.
not_available Calm down.
not_available And we'll be back in a bit.
not_available Am I gonna get out by 4? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Hope so.
not_available So is she pretending this didn't happen or does she really believe she didn't give birth? Who knows? Her dissociative denial is pretty strong.
not_available I have her mother hanging around.
not_available And I can't break confidentiality and tell her about the baby.
not_available Let me guess, this is the mother walking towards us? That's Mrs.
not_available Pak.
not_available Call Social Services and Psych again.
not_available Get back in there, see if you can keep working on her.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Pak.
not_available Hello, I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Fortythreeyearold female, 15
not_available foot fall.
not_available Blunt head trauma.
not_available GCS, 13.
not_available Heart rate, 92.
not_available BP, 112/72.
not_available Why isn't she wearing a collar? What collar? 
not_available Don't talk.
not_available Did you just say 43? What do we got? Twentyeightyear
not_available old male.
not_available Penetrating injury to bilateral lower extremities with arterial laceration.
not_available BP 72 palp.
not_available BP 72 palp.
not_available I don't think she'd be talking on her cell phone, and I don't think she's a male.
not_available We're here now.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Thirtynineyear
not_available old female, crush injury to the chest and abdomen.
not_available ST elevations on the strip.
not_available I know I just got here but where are the bathrooms? What's going on? Are you the incident commander? Me? Mixed

not_available Go.
not_available What the hell? 
not_available Did you know anything about this? Dr.
not_available Lewis! Louise is still asleep.
not_available Yeah, I got some background information on her.
not_available She lived alone since her husband died five or six years ago.
not_available Neighbor wasn't sure.
not_available No children.
not_available Haven't located any family yet.
not_available I thought you might wanna know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I should probably get in there and check on her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Guy uses a similar pattern each time.
not_available How many other victims? Four women in the last five weeks.
not_available He poses as a pizza guy pretends to be confused about the apartment number.
not_available Never open your door to anyone you don't know.
not_available The others, are they okay? Rape isn't quite bad enough for this guy.
not_available He likes to beat them too, like Louise.
not_available One died, and the other three are in pretty bad shape.
not_available Hope she makes it.
not_available Each victim has given us a clue, you know helped us get a little bit closer.
not_available If Louise dies, we'll just have to wait for the next one.
not_available Got a head lac, GCS, 15.
not_available She's a green, put her in Sutures.
not_available Suture room's full.
not_available Okay, then Curtain 4.
not_available I wanna stay with Kaitlin.
not_available They said we could be together.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You're a pelvic fracture.
not_available Red tag, Trauma 1.
not_available I wanna stay with Julie.
not_available They promised usGuys, you're not babies, all right? Yeah, but they were told they could 
not_available Yeah, they said so.
not_available Yeah, they said so.
not_available Don't forget to call your consults and support staff.
not_available They're keeping track of the response times.
not_available Abby said Social Services is here.
not_available They are in with the Korean virgin
not_available birth girl.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks, Haleh.
not_available Frank, where's Jerry? He left on account of the infestation.
not_available He was calling Transport for a real patient in 2, going to CT.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Wow, this is fun.
not_available Damn JCAHO drill.
not_available Explosion at a maraschino cherry factory.
not_available That's what I heard.
not_available Who makes this stuff up? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Does this even exist in Chicago? I actuallyI got rid of two greens and a dead merit
not_available badge holder.
not_available Is it okay if I help a real person with double vision and vertigo? Susan, do you want all the red tags parked in Trauma 1? 
not_available No.
not_available Hi, I'm Trina.
not_available I'm a squad leader.
not_available Need any help? 
not_available You have a head lac.
not_available You can't talk.
not_available I wasn't asking you.
not_available Phone call for Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available It's the lab.
not_available They wanna yell at you.
not_available So Fremont has a pretty good football team, don't they? I don't go to that many games.
not_available What kind of stuff do you do with your friends? Mostly we just eat lunch together at school.
not_available What about the weekends? Do you go out as a group, or do you go on dates? Some of my friends have boyfriends so they just go with each other.
not_available Do you have a boyfriend? No.
not_available Can I still leave by 4? Do your parents get very upset if you're not home on time? I have to be there for my brother.
not_available Why is that? 
not_available I take care of him.
not_available How old is he? Twenty
not_available three.
not_available So you spend a lot of time with your brother.
not_available Yeah, of course.
not_available And when you take care of him what kind of things do you do? 
not_available I don't know why you keep asking all these questions.
not_available I'm getting tired.
not_available Can I just take a nap in here? Sure.
not_available Get some rest.
not_available Maybe we should check out this brother.
not_available Mom's in the family room.
not_available I'll try talking to her obliquely.
not_available If need be, we can designate the baby as a safe haven.
not_available Safe haven? This baby isn't abandoned.
not_available It kind of is.
not_available Mother's right there.
not_available Grandmother's down the hall.
not_available She's not acknowledging the baby.
not_available She's not competent 
not_available to give up the baby.
not_available Even if she does, we don't know 
not_available she'll want to keep him.
not_available Shouldn't we at least try? 
not_available We don't know a thing about her family.
not_available Let's go find out.
not_available You can't break confidentiality.
not_available Maybe her family's support 
not_available is what she needs.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I talked to the mom.
not_available She seems very reasonable and concerned.
not_available This baby has a family.
not_available Carter 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Pak.
not_available Yes? MiCha, can I see her now? Notice any changes in Mi
not_available Cha's condition in the last couple months? No.
not_available She's good.
not_available Please tell me what's wrong with her.
not_available So you didn't know that your daughter was pregnant? That's right.
not_available This morning she gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby boy.
not_available Her father won't have her in the house.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Pak.
not_available How long will she stay here? 
not_available Maybe a couple days.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Pak 
not_available She's awake.
not_available The Unasyn piggyback get here? Yeah.
not_available I just hung it.
not_available I'll get back to our little Ranger Scouts.
not_available Yeah, be my guest.
not_available Hey, Louise.
not_available How you doing? Louise, the man that raped you, he raped four other women.
not_available Now, there might be a way that we could help you talk to the detective.
not_available The tube that's in your neck has a little balloon on the end of it that we inflate to protect your lungs to prevent oxygen from leaking out.
not_available If I deflate the balloon and cover the end of the tube you would be able to whisper just a few words at a time.
not_available There are some very real risks.
not_available I would be depriving your lungs of supplemental oxygen for a minute.
not_available But if there were a problem I'd re
not_available inflate the balloon and put you back on the vent.
not_available Do you understand what I'm saying? I would need to clear it with Dr.
not_available Kovac, and I also need your consent.
not_available Hey, Jerry, where's that surgical consult on Rapke in 2? Man, I have called them, like, five times.
not_available They're so jerked around with these scouts they won't come down.
not_available Go and drag one down here before the guy bleeds out.
not_available As soon as I take these to
not_available No, Jerry, I said now.
not_available Frank, call the lab.
not_available Have them come pick that up.
not_available Don't accept any excuses.
not_available Which patient does Kovac have at CT? 
not_available Check the board.
not_available Stay away from Carter.
not_available He's got his panties in a twist.
not_available Tell Kovac to come find me.
not_available Did they call about a bed for Louise? 
not_available They said maybe an hour.
not_available Oh, just wanted to let you know that I'll be leaving for a while.
not_available Louise is awake.
not_available Yeah, I saw her.
not_available I told her I'd see her later.
not_available Well, she'll be in ICU by then.
not_available I'll find it.
not_available Thanks for your help.
not_available Detective Patrie, wait.
not_available There is something else we could try.
not_available You knew the drill was today.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis?

not_available Can I move the scouts? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available But they need to be seen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was supposed to be a surprise.
not_available A hint wouldn't hurt.
not_available Susan, you need to learn to take control despite the rules.
not_available I'm gonna need clarification on which ones to follow and which ones to break.
not_available What should I do with a ranger with a shrapnel injury? 
not_available The O.R.
not_available won't let me through.
not_available I'll call them.
not_available Girls, please, stop.
not_available You're gonna get hurt for real.
not_available Morris, what the hell is going on? 
not_available A vat of cherry dye blew up on them.
not_available They needed decon.
not_available I couldn't find the key to the decontamination closet so I sent them to the shower.
not_available It was supposed to be a pretend shower.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go round them up.
not_available Okay, get them some scrubs.
not_available Get them out of those wet clothes.
not_available Oh, my God.

not_available Seven out of 10.
not_available Do a repeat EKG.
not_available I already did.
not_available He says the pain radiates to his back.
not_available Could be a dissection.
not_available See if his chest x
not_available ray is ready.
not_available Already got it.
not_available It's bedside.
not_available Okay.
not_available I had better be sure this guy doesn't need the O.R.
not_available You said you got a good look at this guy's face.
not_available What color was his skin? White.
not_available Was he tall or short? Wait.
not_available Do you want us to stop? Louise, was he tall or short? Kind of medium.
not_available Maybe tall.
not_available Jerry's not back yet? 
not_available When is Jerry ever back? This where we keep the workmen's comp claim forms? No, they're in these bins down here somewhere.
not_available Talked to Mi
not_available Cha's brother.
not_available He's coming.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's all that working out? Okay.
not_available She's opening up about her family.
not_available They sound kind of scary.
not_available Meaning what? Conservative, traditional, old world.
not_available As in you'd be pretty screwed if you were an unwed teenage mom.
not_available Wendall had to leave, but she's coming back.
not_available Wanna talk to her? MiCha? Again? Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just figured whatever helps.
not_available What are these doing in here? What? 
not_available Pictures of Kem from the computer.
not_available Why are they in that drawer? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Somebody printed them out.
not_available You don't have any idea who? 
not_available Well, Morris was looking at them.
not_available I
not_available Morris? Where is he? He was wheeling one of those scouts up to CT, or something.
not_available Hey, Morris! What are you doing downloading pictures of my girlfriend? What? 
not_available Morris! You should really come take a look at him.
not_available Who? This beautiful baby.
not_available This beautiful boy.
not_available What are you talking about? You haven't even held him yet, have you? Why are you talking like this? He is so beautiful.
not_available Look at those eyes.
not_available Look at that face.
not_available And all he wants to do is be held.
not_available All he wants to do is be loved.
not_available Do you know how lucky you are? Do you know what a miracle this is? What are you doing? I just don't understand.
not_available Can't you see it? I mean, look at it.
not_available Take him.
not_available Why are you doing this? 
not_available Hold him for a second.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I just thought that if she held the baby
not_available They need you down the hall.
not_available I was just trying to
not_available They need you down the hall.
not_available I don't remember.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That's okay.
not_available You're doing great, Louise.
not_available Did he have any tattoos or scars that you saw? All right, I'm gonna blow the balloon back up.
not_available It's okay, Louise.
not_available I got you.
not_available What? Is she gonna be okay? 
not_available Go get Dr.
not_available Kovac now.
not_available Good news, Mr.
not_available Sanchez.
not_available You won't be needing that surgery after all.
not_available How are her sats? Seventy
not_available nine.
not_available She vomited.
not_available I can see that.
not_available She's aspirated.
not_available Add five of PEEP, hang 3.375 of Zosyn to cover aspiration.
not_available Chest x
not_available ray now and repeat in an hour.
not_available Is she gonna be okay? She's sucked vomit into her lungs.
not_available I don't think there will be any more questions today.
not_available You left her airway vulnerable.
not_available I didn't expect the vomiting.
not_available Her lungs were already bad from the pulmonary contusions.
not_available I wanted to help.
not_available I explained the risks.
not_available It's what Louise wanted.
not_available And what you wanted.
not_available Are you sure no one else knows about what you were doing in there? Just the cop.
not_available Luka, her sats keep dropping.
not_available Down to 72 at a hundred percent oxygen.
not_available Put her up to 10 of PEEP.
not_available Repeat chest.
not_available Bilateral whiteout.
not_available Is that the contusions or the aspiration? Does it matter at this point? Mi
not_available Cha's brother's here.
not_available Good.
not_available He's 23 but developmentally delayed.
not_available Wendall's in there with them.
not_available I'm heading in.
not_available Wanna come along? 
not_available Nope.
not_available You and Wendall can handle it.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available So, YongJo, you and Mi
not_available Cha spend a lot of time together? First we get up.
not_available And then we have breakfast.
not_available And then Mi
not_available Cha goes to school, and I go to Sadler's.
not_available Sadler's? 
not_available It's a supermarket.
not_available I stock shelves.
not_available I bag groceries.
not_available I can lift things.
not_available So when Mi
not_available Cha comes home from school, what do you do? She stays home with me.
not_available She doesn't go out.
not_available She never leaves.
not_available Yong
not_available Jo.
not_available She stays home with me.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I didn't tell anybody.
not_available Tell anybody about what? What are you doing here? I came to see you and the baby.
not_available And the baby? I didn't tell anybody.
not_available You told me not to and I didn't, I promise.
not_available You believe me, don't you, Mi
not_available Cha? I didn't do anything wrong.
not_available Please, MiCha! YongJo, let's go outside, okay? 
not_available I didn't do anything wrong.
not_available I know, it's okay.
not_available I didn't tell anybody.
not_available Mi
not_available Cha? It's a real disaster in here.
not_available Red tag, partially amputated foot.
not_available Another red, unconscious and short of breath.
not_available Trina.
not_available Abdominal lac and dizziness.
not_available She's only a yellow, but she's taken a turn for the worse.
not_available I can help.
not_available Trina, please.
not_available I think we'll be okay.
not_available Hey, Malik.
not_available Can you dispo all these fake patients? Respiratory distress needs O2, pulse ox, chest x
not_available ray and a possible tube.
not_available Okay, it's in the works.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Her foot's amputated.
not_available If we don't put pressure on it, she'll die.
not_available Trina, please.
not_available Want her to bleed to death? You want that on your conscience? Please, please, Trina.
not_available Please, get back to your gurney.
not_available But I can help you.
not_available But you're not.
not_available But I can.
not_available I've earned a lot of badges.

not_available Stop it now! I don't care about your damn badges.
not_available Water world, weather watch.
not_available You know what? That's it, I'm done.
not_available You're all out of here.
not_available Excuse me? Every observer, all the little girls, out now.
not_available This drill is over.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available I'm the chief of emergency medicine here, and I damn well can.
not_available We don't need this drill.
not_available We had a helicopter crash in our ambulance bay for God's sake! So you can take your clipboards and your Ranger Scouts and hit some other hospital because my doctors and nurses need to get back to treating real patients with real problems.
not_available You got it? Back to work.
not_available I was afraid I was gonna miss you.
not_available We're on our way out.
not_available Just give me one second.
not_available All right, look, you're gonna go up to the third floor.
not_available Just tell them you're looking for the O.R.
not_available What? You're not coming? Look, hang out for about 30 minutes, or so, and roll yourself back down.
not_available How's your dad? He came in for a G
not_available tube, ended up with pneumonia.
not_available But after two weeks of antibiotics, oxygen and a chest PT he's back to just being old.
not_available I just fired the scouts.
not_available No more fake patients.
not_available What about the ones we dealt with? 
not_available Broom all of them.
not_available See real patients only within 15 minutes of their signing in.
not_available Susan seems to take this chief thing kind of seriously.
not_available I don't know if it was the brother wanting to see the baby or us thinking he's the father, whatever, it got through to her.
not_available So the father was actually some guy that lives across the street? Yes, her boyfriend.
not_available And her cover was having Yong
not_available Jo say, "She never goes out.
not_available She always stays home.
not_available She never leaves me.
not_available " 
not_available Good work.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How are they? Adjusting, hanging in, who knows? Was that Carter who was just out here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I thought he might come in.
not_available I think all of this might have been a little bit rough on him.
not_available Why? What do you mean? I don't know if you've heard what he went through last spring? No, I hadn't.
not_available Gonna come to work tomorrow? 
not_available That's the plan as long as everything's okay on this end.
not_available What's the matter? He okay? 
not_available He gets confused and agitated.
not_available And being in that hospital for that long didn't help.
not_available Papa.
not_available Papa! Papa! No, no, no, no! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Papa! Damn it! Son of a bitch! 
not_available Son of a bitch.

not_available Put Ativan's in.
not_available He might not need these.
not_available Send a tech to get a 28 French button.
not_available We'll put in a Foley to keep the tract open.
not_available Shouldn't I register him first? 
not_available Don't bother.
not_available I'm just gonna put the G
not_available tube in and get him home.
not_available What are you looking at him for? He's a third
not_available year resident, I'm an Attending.
not_available I said he doesn't need to be registered.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available He should be in a nursing home.
not_available I'd never do that to him.
not_available At least you shouldn't have to do this.
not_available Call Gl.
not_available Watch his hand.
not_available He may react when I put in the Foley.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available Papa.
not_available Papa! 
not_available Still in fib.
not_available Charge to 360.
not_available I heard she vomited.
not_available You think she aspirated? Clear.
not_available Fine V
not_available fib.
not_available Possibly.
not_available Try 360 again.
not_available You shouldn't arrest from aspiration.
not_available The balloon on her crike must have burst.
not_available It happens.
not_available Clear.
not_available Asystole.
not_available How long have you been at it? Thirty
not_available nine minutes.
not_available What about a dopamine drip? 
not_available No.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Get a strip.
not_available We're done.
not_available I'll clean her up.
not_available She's a coroner's case.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available When they do the autopsy, they'll see the balloon didn't burst.
not_available No.
not_available They'll see that it did.
not_available So is she gonna keep the baby? Well, we finally got her to hold him.
not_available One miracle at a time.
not_available Look, I just came up to apologize.
not_available A few months ago, the woman that I'd been with 
not_available we lost a baby.
not_available I heard.
not_available You getting some help with that? I'm working on it.
not_available Good night.
not_available I thought they would have taken her by now.
not_available Morgue's backed up.
not_available Coroner's backed up.
not_available Same old, same old.
not_available I thought you were with that intussusception kid.
not_available Pedes surgery took him up to the O.R.
not_available Sam, you don't need to do this.
not_available I know.
not_available There are other nurses.
not_available I know.
not_available Sam.
not_available I shouldn't have done it.
not_available The contusions were severe.
not_available She could have died anyway.
not_available I shouldn't have done it, Luka.
not_available You did what you did to help the patient, Sam.
not_available Sam? When I deflated that balloon, Louise was still so traumatized.
not_available He kept asking her these questions and the only thing that she could remember 
was "White guy, dark hair.
not_available " I did what I did for "white guy, dark hair.
not_available " Come here.
