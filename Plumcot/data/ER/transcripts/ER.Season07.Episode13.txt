not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver! This clown is crashing.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available So, what do you think about tonight? I think it's the least I could do.
not_available No one should be alone after killing a clown.
not_available You killed the clown? 
not_available No.
not_available Didn't save him.
not_available Enough flu on the board? 'Tis the season.
not_available Guy in Curtain 3 fell off a ladder.
not_available Yeah? How far? Taking down Christmas lights.
not_available Fell from the top rung.
not_available That's what you get for procrastinating.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available There he is.
not_available This is my doctor.
not_available Hi, Janice.
not_available They wouldn't give me a needle.
not_available Haleh, give her a clean one.
not_available You serious? We I&amp;D;'d the abscess

not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Come back tomorrow for a wound check.
not_available I'll try.
not_available You're not gonna fill out a chart? 
not_available Nope.
not_available No prescription? 
not_available Waste of time.
not_available I can get behind that.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I know you.
not_available You're the bishop, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available Where's that hat you were wearing?

not_available I really liked it.
not_available Me too.
not_available There he is.
not_available Hello again.
not_available Bishop, are you all right? Oh, yeah.

not_available I was just finishing up my visitations.
not_available Do you have a moment? I don't see a cane.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Have any more pain? Not from the fall.
not_available Your arthritis is still a problem? I was wondering if I could get another prescription for some prednisone.
not_available Did you follow up with your doctor? 
not_available No, I keep having to change the appointment.
not_available That should be the priority.
not_available I know.
not_available Unfortunately he doesn't work on Saturdays.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Don Frost at St.
not_available Mary's.
not_available I should call him.
not_available You'll only get his service.
not_available And frankly, just between us, I'd rather not get him going.
not_available I so much as sneeze, and he wants to poke and prod every inch of me.
not_available I'd have to do some tests before prescribing anything more.
not_available What kind of tests? Blood, urine, check your sugar level.
not_available My sugar's a little high.
not_available I have a touch of diabetes.
not_available But I control it with diet.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available Looks good.
not_available Strep throat, right? 
not_available No fever, no swollen glands.
not_available I had the exact thing last year.
not_available Strep.
not_available You have a cold, Mr.
not_available Ramirez.
not_available Antibiotics, 10 days.
not_available Right? No white spots on your tonsils.
not_available Antibiotics won't help.
not_available Last year they cleared it right up.
not_available Would have cleared up anyway.
not_available Come on.
not_available I've been waiting three hours.
not_available Plenty of fluids and get some rest.
not_available Can you just give me the prescription? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, we need you.
not_available You don't have strep throat.
not_available I'll take them just in case.
not_available collapsed at a nursing home.
not_available You got a pulse?

not_available Intubated, shocked five times, two rounds of drugs.
not_available How long you been at it? 
not_available 20 minutes.
not_available Okay, everybody, nice and easy.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three Any medical history? 
not_available Emphysema.
not_available She's on home oxygen.
not_available Asystole on the monitor.
not_available When was the last epi? 
not_available Five minutes ago.
not_available Push another amp.
not_available What? 
not_available She didn't respond to 20 minutes of ACLS in the field.
not_available She doesn't have a chance.
not_available The family wanted us to bring her in.
not_available So we could flog her for another hour? You want dopamine? 
not_available Nope.
not_available I'm sorry, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available She should have died in her own bed.
not_available Abby, hold compressions.
not_available Asystole.
not_available Time of death, 1409.
not_available Family's in Chairs.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available We just lost a patient.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That singer you like is playing at the hotel tonight.
not_available Really? 
not_available 10:00.
not_available I told Carter I'd go somewhere with him tonight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fundraiser.
not_available His date stood him up.
not_available It's not a problem.
not_available I have a pile of journals to read.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wouldn't have said yes if I knew
not_available Labs are back on the bishop.
not_available Blood sugar's high.
not_available Go.
not_available Have fun.
not_available Okay.
not_available Draw five units.
not_available Take a look at his ANA.
not_available Do you have his BUN and creatinine? Renal insufficiency.
not_available Hey, Jeff.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Just nervous.
not_available Sit.
not_available I got your blood test back.
not_available Okay.
not_available The bad news is you have mononucleosis.
not_available Good news is, if you rest up, you'll bounce back in a couple weeks.
not_available Mono.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But you'll be all right.
not_available How is my blood count? White cells were a little elevated, but that's consistent with mono.
not_available What about my CD4 count? Are you HIV
not_available positive? Because we only do that if you are.
not_available I think I need an HIV test.
not_available Have you ever been tested before? 
not_available Five months ago I was negative.
not_available That's good.
not_available But since then I've been exposed.
not_available You've had unprotected sex? With an infected partner.
not_available You know how unsafe that is? I guess I just get caught up.
not_available Gotta put a stop to that, Jeff.
not_available My sugar that bad? Three hundred forty
not_available eight.
not_available Maybe I'll go back on the glipizide.
not_available Right now you need insulin.
not_available There was also protein in your urine.
not_available So I ordered an ANA.
not_available That's a test for a disease called lupus.
not_available I know.
not_available I take Plaquenil, You lied to me? 
not_available I wanted to avoid a debate.
not_available I may have harmed you by giving you those steroids.
not_available The steroids help me.
not_available I can move around, make visits do my work.
not_available Without them, I'm stuck in bed.
not_available The steroids raise your blood sugar so high that the diabetes destroys your body.
not_available I need to continue my ministry.
not_available You understand? Anyway, thank you for your time.
not_available I need to do a complete physical exam.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available I've got a lot on my plate today.
not_available I have to make sure I didn't harm you with my treatment.
not_available You owe me that much.
not_available And what is it you think I owe you? Bishop, lupus is very serious.
not_available It can attack your kidneys, lungs, your heart.
not_available I know what it does, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I even know I'm gonna die from it.
not_available Did I wake you? No, I was just resting my eyes.
not_available So how's the heart? 
not_available EKG looks good.
not_available That's what we like to hear.
not_available Want me to call someone to be with you? No.
not_available I called the archdiocese just in case.
not_available What church do you belong to? 
not_available I don't.
not_available Haven't found one you liked? 
not_available Haven't looked.
not_available How long have you been in Chicago? 
not_available I don't go to church anymore.
not_available Really? Why's that? I don't remember.
not_available You married? 
not_available No.
not_available Haven't found one you liked? Something like that, yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, we've got a kid with bad congestive heart failure.
not_available The nurse will be in.
not_available What's the pulse ox? 
not_available 81.
not_available Collapsed at a basketball game.
not_available Watching or playing? 
not_available Watching.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Nick.
not_available Hi, Nick.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Have you had heart surgery, Nick? 
not_available Transplant.
not_available How long ago? 
not_available Six years.
not_available Someone call his parents.
not_available On their way.
not_available BP, 115/72.
not_available Lungs are full of fluid.
not_available He's in pulmonary edema.
not_available Sublingual nitroglycerin and start a drip.
not_available Open your mouth, Nick.
not_available This'll help.
not_available Titrate up to 10 of morphine.
not_available I need a 12
not_available lead, blood gas, portable chest and 40 of Lasix.
not_available Pulse ox down to 78.
not_available Notify the transplant team.
not_available And order a PICU bed.
not_available They want to give me a new heart? Yes.
not_available I don't want another transplant.
not_available Malucci, what do you got in Exam Four? Lady with bronchitis.
not_available Sending her out with amoxicillin.
not_available Bronchitis? 
not_available Cough, myalgias, arthralgias.
not_available Sounds like the flu.
not_available She's high
not_available maintenance.
not_available Wants antibiotics.
not_available Antibiotics are not indicated.
not_available I told her that.
not_available She still wants them.
not_available You need to educate her about antibiotic resistance.
not_available Do I have to? 
not_available Gotta break the cycle.
not_available It's easier to write a prescription.
not_available If you feed the bears they'll come back for more.
not_available Food poisoning gets another liter of saline.
not_available Check a post
not_available reduction shoulder on this one.
not_available This is a patient who's waiting on an HIV test.
not_available Okay.
not_available Malucci can take it.
not_available This last one's delicate.
not_available He's high
not_available risk.
not_available Malucci can be delicate.
not_available Thank you, chief.
not_available No, really
not_available Dave, this one's gonna require some tact.
not_available You got it.
not_available He's a patient with mono, he's gay, refuses to use condoms.
not_available Think you can talk to him? Without being insensitive? Sure.
not_available I'll wrap it all up in a nice big bow.
not_available Carter, a construction worker had a pane of glass dropped on him.
not_available Could you help with the suturing? 
not_available Actually, I'm off.
not_available I gotta get going.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available The fundraising.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's more like a family obligation.
not_available It's nothing really exciting.
not_available What's the charity? After
not_available school enrichment programs.
not_available Enrichment? Yeah.
not_available It's, you know, extra education.
not_available Arts, music, that kind of thing.
not_available Actually, Abby's saving me from getting heat from my grandparents.
not_available They kind of insist I bring somebody.
not_available I hope it's successful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available See you.
not_available Hey, Jeff.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Malucci.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter went off duty.
not_available You You have his lab results? I'd like to talk to Jeff about that.
not_available Would you excuse us? Actually, I'd like to stay.
not_available I'm Sean, Jeff's partner.
not_available Is that okay with you, Jeff? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it's all good, man.
not_available Your HIV antibody test came back negative.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You got lucky.
not_available But now you need to avoid risky behavior and keep yourself healthy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Am I missing something here, guys? I'm HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Jeff and I are together.
not_available Through everything.
not_available Right.
not_available So, what? Are you trying to contract HIV? You a bugchaser, Jeff? 
not_available We don't call it that.
not_available Then what do you call it? Suicide? 
not_available HIV is treatable with medication.
not_available Doesn't mean you should try to catch it.
not_available Look, we both know that his HIV antibody could be negative for six weeks after exposure.
not_available So you can't really tell us that he's definitely negative, can you? No.
not_available We'd have to take a direct measure of his viral load.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's do that.
not_available That's gonna take some time.
not_available We'll wait.
not_available Yeah, we'll wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available Flat T
not_available waves in the lateral leads.
not_available Okay.
not_available Repeat 12
not_available lead in an hour.
not_available Something wrong? You have some non
not_available specific EKG changes.
not_available And there is a friction rub around your heart.
not_available I'm creaky all over.
not_available Have you had chest pain? 
not_available Occasionally.
not_available I'm used to it.
not_available How about today? 
not_available This morning.
not_available For how long? I don't know, half an hour? You may have fluid around the heart.
not_available You could be at risk for a heart attack.
not_available I feel fine.
not_available We need to get a cardiac echo and admit you.
not_available No.
not_available I have to observe you for at least six hours.
not_available I'll stay, but I don't want to be checked in.
not_available I'd rather observe you in the Cardiac Unit.
not_available I don't want my life to end in a hospital.
not_available You're not gonna die today.
not_available I will not be admitted! Are you Nick's doctor? 
not_available Yes, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available There's no doctor with him, just a nurse.
not_available Well, Nick is stable right now.
not_available He was in heart failure? Yes.
not_available He's responding to aggressive therapy.
not_available He has pulmonary edema.
not_available The same thing happened after his second transplant.
not_available He's had two? One when he was 4, then again when he was 10.
not_available And now he's on the list for a third.
not_available They did angioplasty last year, but he's still so weak.
not_available Has Nick ever told you he doesn't want a new heart? He says that when he's depressed.
not_available He takes 15 medications a day.
not_available He's still so sick.
not_available A lot for a 16year
not_available old to go through.
not_available Can you call UNOS? He should go to a higher status.
not_available I was waiting to talk to you to see if that's what you wanted.
not_available Of course we do.
not_available Okay.
not_available My flu patient wants to see someone higher up.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available She wants antibiotics gets them every year, refuses to leave till she gets a prescription.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available Right there.
not_available Curtain 1.
not_available Hello.
not_available My name's Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Sara Dell.
not_available I've been sick for three days.
not_available Fever, runny nose Feel like my head's in a vise.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Dell, antibiotics don't help the flu.
not_available They always help mine.
not_available I can assure you they don't.
not_available You're not giving them to me because I'm poor.
not_available If we give antibiotics to millions of people who don't need them a resistance builds which eventually makes the drugs useless to the people who do.
not_available And because I don't have insurance.
not_available That's persecution! You think so? I know so! 
not_available You know what? Follow me.
not_available Well, where are we going? Come on, follow me.
not_available Pay attention.
not_available Excuse me! My name is Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I'd like to see a show of hands of people who have a sore throat.
not_available Right here.
not_available Yeah, man.
not_available Cough? Muscle aches, fever? You all have the flu.
not_available People who have the flu will not be receiving antibiotics today.
not_available So consider that while you decide whether you want to wait or not.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Clearing the board.
not_available Isn't that an EMT ALA violation? 
not_available I didn't discharge anyone.
not_available Hey, Greene.
not_available Tell me you are not giving free needles to junkies.
not_available On a caseby
not_available case basis.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available On no basis.
not_available It's illegal.
not_available Not if there's a public
not_available health emergency, which there is.
not_available How much of your brain did they cut out? This does not put extra needles on the street.
not_available I don't care! We are not gonna have junkies parading in and out of here! So you're not interested in cutting back on HIV and? And? What? Sounds like? Hep Hep? HepHep? Heparin, heptathlon? 
not_available Hepatitis.
not_available Tough one.
not_available You want to start a needle exchange, do it from your house.
not_available Hi.
not_available You're wearing a tuxedo.
not_available You didn't say it was formal.
not_available I didn't? No.
not_available Yeah, it's formal.
not_available You tricked me.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available You look terrific.
not_available Well, we don't match, though.
not_available I can go change.
not_available I don't even know if I own a dress.
not_available Wanna go buy one? No.
not_available Can you just
not_available ? Just wait one minute.
not_available You mad at me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Did you get a haircut? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who are my parents talking to? Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available She's a surgeon.
not_available I told you I didn't want surgery.
not_available You were in a lot of pain when you said that.
not_available I still meant it.
not_available You won't survive without the transplant.
not_available I was hoping to make it to my prom.
not_available But if I can't, I can't.
not_available With a new heart, you will.
not_available Do you know what it's like to have your chest split open? No.
not_available I can barely walk to class, I get so tired.
not_available I take pills every two hours.
not_available And I look like a freak from the side effects.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available He's at the top of the list? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Status 1
not_available A.
not_available It's just a matter of waiting for a heart with a tissue match.
not_available We waited a month on Status 1
not_available A last time.
not_available Now that he's older, there are more possibilities.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Stevens, but Nick doesn't want a new heart.
not_available We explained that to you.
not_available He's thought it out.
not_available He has good reasons.
not_available I think you should listen to them.
not_available He's 16.
not_available And he is tired of living like this.
not_available Well, I'm not giving up on him because he's tired.
not_available I'm only telling you what Nick told me.
not_available I understand.
not_available When do we move him to the unit? Shouldn't be too long.
not_available Kerry, we have a little personnel problem.
not_available Well, you do.
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available He's walking around with attitude handing out needles, blanking out on words.
not_available It's swelling from the chemotherapy wafers.
not_available Really.
not_available He has a mild expressive aphasia.
not_available It's temporary.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available I don't think he likes it either.
not_available Noticed any personality changes? He got very confrontational with me.
not_available You're used to confrontation.
not_available We're not talking about me.
not_available Isn't that your favorite subject? 
not_available Just straighten him out.
not_available Who's this with you at the beach? 
not_available Eric, my brother.
not_available I never got the whole concept behind dried flowers.
not_available I mean, they're dead.
not_available They're dead as soon as you cut them.
not_available Yeah, but they look nice.
not_available Dead ones look nice too.
not_available Right.
not_available Right, no.
not_available I was just wondering.
not_available Wondering what? 
not_available Wondering Why not just buy the fresh flowers? Because there's something sad and dark about the dried ones.
not_available Oh, yeah? You like sad and dark? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just give those a couple days.
not_available You found something.
not_available That looks nice.
not_available It's a bridesmaid's dress.
not_available It works on you.
not_available You're lying.
not_available No, honestly.
not_available I don't think anybody would know that.
not_available Looks like it was made for you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now I know you're lying.
not_available Let's just go.
not_available Carter.
not_available What is this? 
not_available What? Come on.
not_available What do you want to take, the El? You're not gonna tell me, "By the way, this party's in Paris"? No.
not_available We stay in Chicago, I promise.
not_available He needs bandages, update his tetanus and order a six
not_available pack of Keflex.
not_available You lost your cap.
not_available I decided to wear my scar with pride.
not_available It adds character.
not_available Well, it scared a little kid.
not_available Called me Humpty Dumpty.
not_available Well, Humpty, how do you feel about an evening service? What service? 
not_available The wedding.
not_available Coordinator double
not_available booked the afternoon, and they want to push us back to 5:00.
not_available That would push the reception back.
not_available Yes.
not_available I've already spoken with the caterer.
not_available He says he can do it.
not_available But we can't use the patio for cocktails.
not_available What's wrong with the patio? April, the evening, it'd be really chilly.
not_available Well, ask him to move out the, you know Space heaters.
not_available So it's all right with you? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Mark, you're getting better.
not_available The aphasia's fading.
not_available I'm glad you think so.
not_available No, it is.
not_available In a couple of weeks, this will all be gone.
not_available I don't think I can count on you for an unbiased opinion.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available I am biased.
not_available I'm also right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? Nick Stevens just arrested.
not_available Whose patient? I'll grab him.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Oh, God! What's the rhythm? Still V
not_available tach.
not_available Charge to 300.
not_available Come on, Nick! Excuse me, sir.
not_available You'll have to stand back.
not_available Okay, I need to intubate.
not_available Stand by with amiodarone.
not_available Charged and ready.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Still no change.
not_available Please save him.
not_available I need some cricoid pressure.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Rebolus 50 of lidocaine in five.
not_available Clear! Clear.
not_available Got a rhythm.
not_available There's a weak radial pulse.
not_available Mix up the dobutamine.
not_available Open your eyes, Nick.
not_available Come on, Nick.
not_available Wake up for me.
not_available Good breath sounds bilaterally.
not_available Unresponsive to painful stimulation.
not_available He wasn't down long.
not_available He should wake up.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Three separate light settings.
not_available That's an essential amenity.
not_available So I talked to Luka.
not_available Me too.
not_available He didn't seem to mind about tonight.
not_available No.
not_available He doesn't get jealous.
not_available Ever.
not_available All the years I've lived here, I've never been to the Natural History Museum? That's criminal.
not_available They've got dinosaurs, cavemen.
not_available Dinosaurs and dancing? Yeah.
not_available My grandparents like spectacle.
not_available It's not gonna be that big of a deal, though.
not_available A few people.
not_available You are so dead.
not_available It's kind of a scene.
not_available Kind of? 
not_available I told you.
not_available They like spectacle.
not_available Did you grow up going to these kinds of things? This is par for the course.
not_available If you hate it, we can leave in a half
not_available hour.
not_available I won't hate it.
not_available Can we duck the photographer? 
not_available Can we? Hey, Jeff.
not_available Where's Sean? He went to move the car.
not_available I don't want to wait to tell you the news.
not_available Your viral test is back.
not_available No virus detected.
not_available So I'm really HIV
not_available negative.
not_available Definitely negative.
not_available You and You and Sean are close? 
not_available Been together almost a year.
not_available That's nice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But nothing's worth dying for, is it? 
not_available I'm not dying.
not_available No.
not_available You're safe right now.
not_available But you have to protect yourself.
not_available I'm gonna get it sooner or later.
not_available Not if you practice safe sex.
not_available I don't want to treat him like he's contaminated.
not_available With a condom, that's how he feels.
not_available HIV can kill you, Jeff.
not_available I know a lot of people living with it.
not_available A lot of people would rather be living without it.
not_available Look.
not_available How old are you, man? 
not_available 23.
not_available Because you got I love him.
not_available Well, if he loves you, he should want you to stay healthy.
not_available He thinks that this is the only way that we can really be intimate.
not_available That's easy for him to say.
not_available He's got the virus.
not_available I don't have anybody else.
not_available You have yourself.
not_available Those are the bouncers.
not_available I know them.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Bark is much worse than their bite.
not_available I see how they keep people in line.
not_available John, there you are.
not_available Hi, Grandpa.
not_available Finally! Someone I wanted to talk to.
not_available Not so loud.
not_available Is this your friend from the auction? 
not_available No.
not_available She had the flu.
not_available And you are? 
not_available Abby Lockhart.
not_available Jonathan Truman Carter Sr.
not_available Delighted.
not_available We don't get to see too many of Johnny's friends.
not_available You got lucky tonight.
not_available You're very good to get dressed up and come out on such a cold night.
not_available I'd much rather stay at home in a bathrobe.
not_available Don't let Gamma hear you say that.
not_available Oh, she knows me by now.
not_available I'd love to meet her.
not_available Where is she? Talking to the keynote speaker.
not_available Go on.
not_available Shall we? 
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Have a good time.
not_available Friend from the auction? Last family event I was at, the daughter of the host, she 
not_available Never mind.
not_available No, come on.
not_available Tell me.
not_available You ever take dance classes? 
not_available No.
not_available Have you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Actually, I have a few moves.
not_available I'm sure you do.
not_available Care to give it a whirl? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just follow me.
not_available I'm not sure that I can.
not_available I got you.
not_available I feel like I'm back at my spring formal in high school.
not_available I went with this guy Seth.
not_available But I had a crush on this guy Tim.
not_available I'm feeling for Seth.
not_available When he went to the bathroom Tim asked me if I wanted to go outside and smoke a cigarette.
not_available And we never went back inside.
not_available That's cruel.
not_available I know.
not_available Is that when you started smoking? I guess so.
not_available See, it's all Tim Stillman's fault.
not_available Right.
not_available I didn't forget you.
not_available Your CPK's normal.
not_available I watched you work on that boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You'll be going for your echo soon.
not_available It was remarkable.
not_available You brought him back to life.
not_available Yes.
not_available It won't do much good if he doesn't have the surgery.
not_available You can't find him a heart? 
not_available He doesn't want one.
not_available But he's so young.
not_available There are bound to be medical advancements.
not_available He's gotta fight.
not_available One could say the same to you, bishop.
not_available I am fighting.
not_available Are you? You say you should prolong his life, but you want to hasten your death? I'm not looking forward to dying, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available But I also don't want to be enfeebled or bedridden.
not_available I only wish I was as brave as he is.
not_available I think you've been more than brave.
not_available Have I? I wanted to set a good example, serve my parish, do God's work as long as I was able, and then go to glory with a modicum of grace.
not_available But there are times when I'm alone in prayer or trying to get to sleep that it just overwhelms me.
not_available I should never feel the way I do sometimes.
not_available How's that? Frightened.
not_available You got the phone number, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You should call tomorrow and make an appointment, you know? I'll see.
not_available Anyway, thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jeff? You gonna protect yourself from now on? Maybe.
not_available Probably not.
not_available Big plans tonight, Malucci? 
not_available No.
not_available Just getting out of here.
not_available Go ahead, 104.
not_available At the home of a 65year
not_available old male.
not_available Collapsed in the bathroom.
not_available Found him in V
not_available fib.
not_available Haleh, can I take the mike? Defibrillated times four.
not_available Gave epi and lidocaine.
not_available Now in asystole.
not_available He's gone.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available What's the down time? Been here 15 minutes.
not_available Probably down another 10 before that.
not_available Any medical history? Two MI's.
not_available Status, post
not_available bypass surgery.
not_available The last doctor's appointment? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available If he's seen a PMD within a month, they can sign the death certificate.
not_available Save us the trouble.
not_available Saw his cardiologist nine days ago.
not_available Still in asystole? 
not_available For the last five minutes.
not_available That's it.
not_available Stop CPR.
not_available What? I'm pronouncing him.
not_available Time of death, 2118.
not_available Can you do that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can.
not_available Let the family know everything was done under physician guidance 
not_available but he did not respond.
not_available You want us to transport? No, have them contact a funeral home.
not_available This is County General, clear with Rescue 104.
not_available I don't know why that was necessary.
not_available What's the point in going through the motions? I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Frost, Bishop Stewart's personal physician.
not_available See? You were great.
not_available I had a good partner.
not_available If we get really motivated, we could enter a contest.
not_available That might be too much of a good thing.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available What? Hello, Abby.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available What are you doing here? I'm here with a friend.
not_available John Carter.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available That's Richard.
not_available What are you doing at a charity event? 
not_available I'm here with Alexis.
not_available Who? She went to get us drinks.
not_available She old enough to drink? Rich, who's this? 
not_available This is Abby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available We shouldWhere've I seen that dress? 
not_available You haven't.
not_available I swear.
not_available I really don't think you've ever seen it.
not_available My sister's wedding.
not_available You were a bridesmaid.
not_available Always the gentleman, Richard.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Rich, let's go sit down.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available Am I awake or was that just a nightmare? Last week I gave him IV SoluMedrol and put him on high
not_available dose steroids for his arthritis.
not_available Last week? 
not_available Yeah, this is his second time here.
not_available He has diabetes.
not_available Steroids put him in the ICU last year with DKA.
not_available I didn't know that! Which is why you should have contacted his primary physician.
not_available I was going to, butWhat's his sugar? 
not_available 348.
not_available Great work, doctor.
not_available You're destroying his vision, his kidneys, his circulation.
not_available Now that I know about his diabetes, I'm checking for end
not_available organ damage.
not_available I've been treating Bishop Stewart for 15 years.
not_available He doesn't need another doctor.
not_available Maybe you should tell him that, because he came to me.
not_available Underneath that robe, he's just a man like everyone else.
not_available A man facing death.
not_available And right now he's drug
not_available seeking.
not_available He just wants to feel right again.
not_available Well, that's not possible.
not_available Where is he? Okay, 104.
not_available See you at the back door.
not_available This is County Base.
not_available Clear.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available 104's bringing in a full arrest.
not_available I just talked to that guy.
not_available Called en route.
not_available Cardiac arrest.
not_available I already pronounced him.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Gave him two of atropine en route.
not_available What's your problem? We did this.
not_available The family freaked.
not_available Do not unload the patient.
not_available We have to.
not_available We're here.
not_available He's been dead for an hour.
not_available Family wanted him to see a doctor.
not_available Mark.
not_available Kerry, he's not supposed to be here.
not_available Stop CPR.
not_available No.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available I said stop.
not_available This is the guy who died at home.
not_available Keep going, Cleo.
not_available Set up Trauma 2 for a full arrest.
not_available He's dead.
not_available When paramedics bring us a patient we have to care for him.
not_available Chuny, wanna put a shroud on the bed? 
not_available Shroud? Yeah, he's dead.
not_available Might save some time.
not_available Not gonna get him back, Kerry.
not_available We still try.
not_available You running this or am I? 
not_available Fine.
not_available What's his rhythm? 
not_available Still asystole.
not_available What do you think? Another amp of epi? Might get him back? Pupils fixed and dilated.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch, would you concur that the rhythm is asystole? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Code is over.
not_available Take out the tubes and clean the body.
not_available That's the family.
not_available I hope this helped them.
not_available I'll go talk to them.
not_available So typical of him to cry poor and then show up at this fancy party.
not_available And did you think she was even pretty? 
not_available I don't think I'm gonna answer that.
not_available I don't see it.
not_available I think this is silly.
not_available It's a blue BMW.
not_available What if they took her car? What do you think she would drive? 
not_available A Lexus? Get it? "Alexis"? No.
not_available I mean
not_available Say we find it.
not_available What are you gonna do, key it? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe I'll just slash the tires.
not_available I think that would be overkill.
not_available Stop! Stop! Wait! There it is! Do you have a pen? Yeah, why? 
not_available I'm letting the air out of the tires.
not_available How many tires? 
not_available Two's fair.
not_available One's fair.
not_available Fine.
not_available Pen, please.
not_available Now what do we do? I think we have to run.
not_available He's awake? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And oriented.
not_available Passed mental
not_available status exam with flying colors.
not_available Where are you taking him? 
not_available He's got no neuro deficits.
not_available He'll go to the ICU and be extubated.
not_available The heart? I'm gonna recommend surgery to the transplant committee.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano? Nick has requested not to have the surgery.
not_available Well, he's a minor.
not_available His parents make that call.
not_available You're gonna make him do it, knowing how he feels? Dr.
not_available Kovac, he's a teenager.
not_available What do they know about life? He'll thank us for this in a few years.
not_available Mark.
not_available I'm off, Kerry.
not_available We have to talk about this.
not_available And what might "this" be? The way you've been acting.
not_available Abrupt, cavalierRealistic? Are you ready to be back? 
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available Mark, you're still reaching for words.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What happens in a code if you need a cardiac drug and you can't think of the name? 
not_available Won't happen.
not_available I'm asking you to take some time off.
not_available I'm telling you no.
not_available Dr.
not_available Frost is arranging for you to have more tests on Monday.
not_available Did he dress you down? 
not_available He was pretty mad, yeah.
not_available He's very possessive about my care.
not_available You were on his turf.
not_available Well, as I told him, your EKGs and cardiac enzymes are normal.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available For the treatment and for listening.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available I saw they took the boy away.
not_available Is he gonna get the operation then? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Me too.
not_available You think he should have been able to choose how he wanted to live? I think so.
not_available Well, I wanna work.
not_available Do you still want the steroids? I need to work.
not_available Poor guy doesn't even have AAA.
not_available So he has to pay for this.
not_available Maybe Alexis will chip in.
not_available She looks about ready to call a cab.
not_available I'd say we've successfully ruined their evening.
not_available Mission accomplished.
not_available Now I feel kind of bad.
not_available Why? Because I kind of ruined our night too.
not_available Ruined, how? Besides the vandalism? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That we're freezing to death? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You never saw your grandmother? 
not_available She knows I was there.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Okay, then, I guess nothing.
not_available I had an okay time.
not_available Me too.
not_available This is Kerry Weaver at County.
not_available I need information about evaluating a physician who's possibly cognitively impaired.
not_available Could we speak first thing Monday morning? Thanks.
