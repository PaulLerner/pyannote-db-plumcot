not_available I wouldn't miss it for the world.
not_available I know you wanted the position.
not_available I just wanted to check and make sure 
not_available you were feeling okay about all this.
not_available Well, how am I feeling? Pretty damn grateful, actually.
not_available I've got a good heart, good soul and, unlike our new liaison, two good legs.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, we' re ready for you.
not_available Ask yourself what you did to deserve this, Kerry.
not_available A lot of hard work, actually.
not_available And what the alderman wants in return.
not_available He doesn't want anything.
not_available Not everyone's an opportunistic asshole like you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So I'm told.
not_available Still okay with me going? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I said I was.
not_available You meant it? What are you thinking? Nothing.
not_available Work? 
not_available No.
not_available Your mom? 
not_available God, no.

not_available " 
not_available No.
not_available What? No.
not_available You done? Oh, no.
not_available Please don't.
not_available Please don't.
not_available You want to get that? 
not_available No.
not_available It's an utterly thankless position.
not_available No money, endless paperwork, countless meetings.
not_available But it still remains a great honor.
not_available Therefore, on behalf of the board of commissioners I am proud and privileged to name Dr.
not_available Kerry Weaver as medical liaison to Cook County's public healthcare administration.
not_available Thank you, alderman.
not_available I couldn't have accepted this position without the continued support of my colleagues here at County.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, how are you qualified for this office? You mean can a nonpolicy wonk do the job? Well, running a trauma center is perhaps the ultimate training ground for public healthcare, and we are in a healthcare crisis.
not_available This position allows me the opportunity to apply practical solutions to problems that have been dealt with all too bureaucratically in the past.
not_available Are there any other questions? How will balancing two demanding jobs affect your home life? It won't.
not_available She's single.
not_available So am I.
not_available And we make a handsome couple, don't you think? 
not_available Congratulations, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Thank you.

not_available Oh, you' re the guy with the PICC line.
not_available Sean.
not_available Need a doc over here! 
not_available Oh, got to go.
not_available You want these? Wilma Rasmussen, 94 years old with altered mental status.
not_available BP 85/60.
not_available That's pretty low.
not_available Pneumonia? 
not_available She's had that before.
not_available This is different.
not_available Her daughter.
not_available She live with you? 
not_available No.
not_available I live with her.
not_available Hey, save some Donnatal for me.
not_available Cut it out.
not_available What? I just need two tabs.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No.
not_available Actually, I'm the one who should be apologizing.
not_available I was out of line earlier.
not_available This is work.
not_available And the last thing you need to deal with is gossip.
not_available I get that and I respect it.
not_available You do? Yes, I'm the same way.
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available You have a patient waiting for you in Curtain 1.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available So are you two gonna get engaged? No.
not_available Not even close.
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available Pratt's been acting all in love.
not_available Dizzy, weak, lightheaded.
not_available Classic symptoms of a low blood count.
not_available Tinnitus, palpitations Drove my wife nuts over it.
not_available She divorced me because of it.
not_available Trouble is you don't look anemic.
not_available Yeah, but in pernicious anemia, symptoms may occur even in the absence of a low hemoglobin.
not_available Trust me on this, doc.
not_available If I don't get a shot soon, it's gonna get a lot worse.
not_available You've been taking B12.
not_available Up until two months ago.
not_available I went to see my doc in '86 because I was feeling really run
not_available down.
not_available My doc made the diagnosis.
not_available Since then I've been feeling real fit as long as I stay regular on it.
not_available The bastard died on me a month ago.
not_available My doctor.
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available For your B12 fix.
not_available I take up to 100 micrograms a month.
not_available I think since it's been so long, I should take half a milligram.
not_available I'm way overdue.
not_available I'll need to check out a few things before prescribing anything.
not_available Save yourself the trouble.
not_available "Victims of Pernicious Anemia"? You' re looking at the president.
not_available What do you think it is? 
not_available Your mom has a kidney infection.
not_available Does that explain why she's so groggy? 
not_available Possibly.
not_available She has other health problems.
not_available Haleh, can you send this up for culture? And 500 of Levaquin.
not_available Start her on dopamine at five mics per kilo.
not_available Well, that sounds serious.
not_available At 94, everything's serious.
not_available Our friends were brought here.
not_available There was an accident at our school.
not_available What are their names? 
not_available Terri, Sasha, and Janey.
not_available And Lissa got hurt too.
not_available Can we see them? Excuse me.
not_available We can only give that sort of information out to relatives.
not_available But they' re our best friends.
not_available Have your parents call the school, and they'll update you on everything.
not_available Was it that bad? Did they die? 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available We totally cut class today.
not_available I can only give information out to
not_available Was she there? Did she see this happen? Hey, you can't go in there.
not_available Helen, you have to tell us what happened.
not_available Why are you asking me? Who all got hurt? 
not_available You don't even know me.
not_available Forget her.
not_available She's a freak.
not_available Let's call my mom.
not_available She's friends with the principal.
not_available They' re popular.
not_available You did good, kid.
not_available You think? I only wish I'd fallen off a stage two years ago.
not_available Would've kept us from appointing your god
not_available awful predecessor.
not_available Still having trouble with that? Kennedy had chronic back pain and ran the country.
not_available The least I can do is tolerate a bum knee.
not_available You know what? Let me write you a prescription for some more Vicodin.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Don't be ridiculous.
not_available Why suffer if you don't have to? Touch base later this week? 
not_available Look forward to it.
not_available Don't put your pen away.
not_available I need another signature for a subdural.
not_available So congratulations on your appointment, by the way.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, what is it? A county committee type thing? 
not_available Something like that.
not_available Well, if you can get us two more nurses a shift, I'm all for it.
not_available Still no word from Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Nope.
not_available And you tried calling him again? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available This is Luka.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Yeah, Luka.
not_available This is Kerry Weaver.
not_available I'm down two Attendings and up 40 patients.
not_available If you don't start working your scheduled shifts I'm gonna call the INS, tell them your green card's a fake and have your ass deported.
not_available You'll need longer arms if you' re treating her from here.
not_available Why haven't you cleared her? 
not_available She needs a posterior splint.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Look, we' re buried here, Gallant.
not_available I realize that
not_available If you and your Attending can't handle a simple ankle fracture, I'll do it.
not_available Now, clear the bed.
not_available Where do you want it? 
not_available The lounge.
not_available I don't wanna be disturbed.
not_available What'd I miss? 
not_available Two more messages from your mother.
not_available She says it's important that you call.
not_available Right.
not_available Carter get off okay? 
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available Five Sigma Nu's loose in Belize.
not_available I hope they brought a lot of bail money.
not_available I have friends on the P.
not_available D.
not_available who can run a background check on your date.
not_available Already checked.
not_available No arrests.
not_available Or he hasn't been caught yet.
not_available Aren't you the optimistic one.
not_available You don't have plans tonight, do you? 
not_available Excuse me? Carter's off with the boys.
not_available It'd be fun.
not_available Dinner and drinks.
not_available Don't let her talk you into being her chaperone.
not_available How's everyone know about my date? 
not_available You told them.
not_available I got a lady won't get out of my cab.
not_available I need a doctor.
not_available Where's she hurt? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She ain't moving.
not_available Know her name? 
not_available Yeah, she showed her birth certificate before I picked her up.
not_available Ma'am? Ma'am, wake up! 
not_available She's been beaten up.
not_available Come on.
not_available Open your eyes for us.
not_available She's got a weak radial pulse.
not_available There's blood on her hands.
not_available Ma'am, can you tell us what happened? 
not_available Oh, wow.
not_available Come on, let's go! Let's go! I'm not gonna get paid, am I? 
not_available No hemotympanum.
not_available Systolic's 120 after the first liter.
not_available This may burn a little.
not_available I'm just numbing up your belly.
not_available Do you know who did this to you? 
not_available Kids.
not_available Kids? I need to pick my kids up from school.
not_available We can have them brought here.
not_available We need to know your name first.
not_available Monica Walker.
not_available Monica, we have to figure out if you'll need surgery.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available No, no.
not_available You have to talk to the police later.
not_available No.
not_available Can't do that.
not_available Please.
not_available Somebody beat you pretty badly.
not_available It's okay.
not_available She owes me 11 bucks and change.
not_available Check the bra for cash.
not_available What? 
not_available She's a hooker.
not_available It's where they keep it.
not_available Hey, get the hell out of here.
not_available Now.
not_available Out! Out! What have we got? Penetrating abdominal injury 
not_available of uncertain depth.
not_available And these are? Three lab
not_available coated tumors.
not_available You' re teaching? 
not_available This is a teaching hospital.
not_available Good bowel sounds, normotensive.
not_available Can you tell how long the knife was? You collect box tops to get into med school? You didn't get in on your IQ.
not_available Help me retract here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Only into the sub
not_available q.
not_available But there could be an intraperitoneal component.
not_available Deep fascia's intact.
not_available Gram of Ancef and update her tetanus.
not_available No surgery.
not_available That's right.
not_available You boneheads in the ER are gonna have to work.
not_available Irrigate the wound, loose approximation, and follow serial exam.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Whose signature do I get for the chart? 
not_available Excuse me? For the official surgical consult.
not_available I'm head of surgery and chief of staff.
not_available That should do it.
not_available That way.
not_available Turn left.
not_available I don't like to be touched.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver's almost finished.
not_available They'll hate me even more now.
not_available Who will? Everyone at my school.
not_available Why? Because of what happened? 
not_available Helen, what happened was tragic.
not_available But it was an accident.
not_available It was raining you lost control of your car.
not_available Who's your Attending on this? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Get her.
not_available Helen, do you ever have any problems with rigid muscles or jerkiness? I can be a real spaz sometimes.
not_available You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
not_available What is it, Kerry? She has gold
not_available colored deposits on her cornea.
not_available I don't like to be touched.
not_available Kayser
not_available Fleischer rings.
not_available Pathognomonic for Wilson's disease.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Your body may have an inability to excrete copper, so it builds up in the liver and brain.
not_available Really? 
not_available We need to run some tests to be sure.
not_available But I'll be right back, okay? She was here a week ago? 
not_available I treated her and released her.
not_available Did Gallant do an eye exam? 
not_available Of course he did.
not_available But Wilson's is a total zebra to a med student.
not_available What's your excuse? The rings may not have been 
not_available as prominent last week.
not_available Okay, send off a serum ceruloplasmin and find me when you get the results.
not_available She's having trouble breathing.
not_available Who? Your old lady.
not_available Pulse ox down to 82 on five liters.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Respiratory rate's up to 30.
not_available The fluid we gave to raise her blood pressure is going to her lungs.
not_available So, what do you do? Normally we use Lasix and nitroglycerine, but they'd lower her pressure further.
not_available I know you love your mother very much, but you need to think about 
not_available how aggressively you wanna handle this.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available I need her.
not_available Of course you need her.
not_available No.
not_available I need her social security checks.
not_available Another 4
not_available 0 nylon.
not_available He was a regular.
not_available Just went nuts on me.
not_available It might be time for a new profession.
not_available I gotta feed my kids.
not_available How old are they? Luke's 7, Christy's 12.
not_available They know what you do? 
not_available No.
not_available Don't need to.
not_available I'm there when they leave for school, there when they get back and I'm there till they go to sleep at night.
not_available Wait.
not_available You go out after they' re in bed? Look, I'm not a junkie.
not_available And I don't have a pimp.
not_available I just work enough to support my kids.
not_available But they' re home by themselves.
not_available That was fast.
not_available I don't want to talk to him.
not_available They have to document the assault.
not_available I don't want to talk to the police.
not_available She doesn't want to file a report.
not_available You Abby Lockhart? 
not_available Yeah? Officer Beechum, Chicago P.D.
not_available We were asked to come find you.
not_available Me? Minneapolis P.D.
not_available reported that an aircraft your brother was flying has disappeared.
not_available Your mother asked us to notify you.
not_available She was unable to reach you by phone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, what does that mean, disappeared? Where was he? Well, radar last picked him up over Lake Superior 11 hours ago.
not_available You can call the FAA up there for more information.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Okay.
not_available Explain to me how somebody just goes off radar.
not_available What you' re saying is you think he went down.
not_available Right.
not_available Just
not_available What are the other possibilities? Okay, did you have any communications from him? Like a mayday or whatever? No.
not_available Yes, I'm reachable here.
not_available I thought he was an air
not_available traffic controller.
not_available He always wanted to fly.
not_available He just got his license.
not_available Did you reach Carter? I had him paged in Miami.
not_available I guess the flight already took off.
not_available Does your mom know anything? 
not_available I haven't called her.
not_available Do you think you should? I think I'm stressed out enough as it is 
not_available without having to deal with her too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You should go home.
not_available Do people know? About Eric? Some.
not_available I'd rather they didn't.
not_available You should still go home.
not_available I'm gonna stay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hold, please.
not_available Radiology needs you to send Stewart back up.
not_available Film's bad.
not_available Abby, guy from the school district 
not_available dropped off Monica Walker's kids.
not_available Who? 
not_available The hooker with the slashed belly.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'll take you to see your mom now.
not_available Is my mom gonna be okay? 
not_available Yeah, she is.
not_available Did she get mugged again? Thanks anyway.
not_available Her kids are here.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Go right in.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Oh, good to see you.
not_available She denied everything, told the cop she fell through a window.
not_available Probably tell her kids the same thing.
not_available You think it would be better if she told them a john slashed her? Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Mr.
not_available Marshman? Could you turn your hearing aid down, please? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available What? Labs back on your B12 guy, Vitelli.
not_available Hemoglobin's 14, hematocrit's 42.
not_available Anything wrong? Stan, my man, this is your lucky day.
not_available You giving me my shot? 
not_available No.
not_available Your doctor never did a Schilling test on you, did he? I knew it was unlikely, given your age, your ethnicity.
not_available My grandmother's from northern Europe.
not_available have the anti
not_available parietal cell antibody.
not_available And your blood test was negative for it.
not_available So I'm in the 10 percent without the antibody.
not_available You have a normal cobalamin level.
not_available Do you know what that is, Stanley? 
not_available Vitamin B12.
not_available And what causes pernicious anemia? B12 deficiency from lack of intrinsic factor.
not_available You don't have the disease.
not_available You never did.
not_available I can stay home and take care of you.
not_available Don't even think about missing school on my account.
not_available He's only trying to get out of a math test anyway.
not_available I am not, butthead.
not_available My little brother's goofy.
not_available Ignore him.
not_available That's what I do.
not_available Were you talking to me? They' re good kids.
not_available I do the best I can, you know? I really do.
not_available I don't think I'm gonna be able to get home as early as I'd thought.
not_available Well, how about a late supper? 
not_available Kerry, labs are back on Helen Broznich.
not_available Sandy, I'm gonna have to call you back.
not_available Father here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Want me to tell him? Absolutely not.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Walter Broznich.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is all so terrible.
not_available How are the other girls? I'm not sure.
not_available I shouldn't have let Helen drive in that damn rain.
not_available Is she gonna be okay? In addition to the injuries your daughter sustained in the accident we found that she has a rare disorder called Wilson's disease.
not_available I'm confused.
not_available Last week you people said she had hepatitis.
not_available She does.
not_available In the sense that her liver is inflamed as a result of copper accumulation.
not_available I have some in my brain too.
not_available Wilson's is a genetic condition that can cause both psychiatric and motor disorders.
not_available In particular, jerky movements.
not_available It's usually not symptomatic until adolescence.
not_available Is that why I hit the gas and not the brakes? That would be my suspicion.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's curable? 
not_available It's manageable.
not_available There's a Rick Kelly who's a wildlife artist.
not_available Click on that other web site.
not_available You think it's the rock climber? How cute, especially with those tight shorts.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Googling your blind date.
not_available What? That is so rude.
not_available If you wanna know anything about him, just ask me.
not_available Why? You've never even met him.
not_available Buns of steel, huh? Maybe I can live with the vegan thing.
not_available Are you sure this is him? What's so funny? What? Sorry about what's happening with your brother.
not_available Hopefully they'll find him safe and sound.
not_available Well, I'd better get back to the phones.
not_available Where's that Bell's palsy patient? 
not_available Exam 1.
not_available Here, I'll show you.
not_available I wish you'd go home.
not_available Why? So people can talk more about my tragic family? 
not_available That's not where it's coming from.
not_available You know that.
not_available They're concerned.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available All we can do is interview the children, get a better sense of home life.
not_available If she's got customers going home with her, there could be endangerment.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available Bruce Dorchester, social services.
not_available I'm new.
not_available I don't think we've met.
not_available So if your findings support removal, will the children be kept together? 
not_available We'll make every effort, yeah.
not_available Great.
not_available Why are you doing this? I know you mean well but we' re trying
not_available But what? They' re good kids.
not_available Their mother provides for them.
not_available Yes, by actively prostituting herself.
not_available She has been arrested twice.
not_available Is she under arrest now? She admits to leaving her minor children home alone at night.
not_available That's neglect.
not_available We've seen much worse.
not_available By law, we have to report this.
not_available Look, I shouldn't have to explain this to you.
not_available You have to explain it to somebody.
not_available It's wrong.
not_available This isn't your call.
not_available Is it yours? You' re a nurse, Abby.
not_available You don't have the power to make this kind of decision.
not_available I think this sucks.
not_available What is her problem? She's using accessory muscles to breathe now.
not_available Is she talking at all? 
not_available Asked where her daughter was.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available Bathroom, I think.
not_available Go to 20 mics of dopamine.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Rasmussen? I need to talk to you about your condition.
not_available Your lungs aren't working too well anymore.
not_available Neither is your heart.
not_available If it gets much worse, we' re going to have to intubate you.
not_available Your daughter has asked us to do everything we can to save you.
not_available But in situations like this, often the treatment is worse than the condition.
not_available There's something you can sign called a "do not resuscitate" order.
not_available Plums.
not_available What? There are plums in the back yard.
not_available They' re so lovely, sweet.
not_available Do you like plums? I brought an umbrella just in case.
not_available It is beautiful from up here, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen, if you need any help, need me to make some calls answer some questions, IDo you believe people can die instantly? 
not_available Sorry? I don't know.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available I don't know if I believe it happens instantly.
not_available A second can seem like a lifetime.
not_available Like when you hit the brakes to avoid hitting a car it seems like it takes forever to stop.
not_available But maybe if you go nose
not_available first into the water at 200 miles an hour, it is instantaneous.
not_available At least I hope it is.
not_available Why do you think he went nose
not_available first? I don't know.
not_available I'd better get back to work.
not_available So you say you' re sick, you' re broke, you' re unemployed and uninsured.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Come on over.
not_available Mr.
not_available Willner is regular again, and I'm out of here.
not_available What you getting into? I think I'm gonna stay, do some studying.
not_available I missed a diagnosis.
not_available It happens to the best of us.
not_available Hey, you get one of these? 
not_available "Greetings from Baltimore.
not_available " 
not_available Frank, Exam 1 's clear.
not_available Tell it to the next clerk.
not_available I'm history.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Sounds like Leon's having a nice time? 
not_available Guess he's adjusting okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abby, Carter's on the line for you.
not_available I'll take it in there.
not_available Well, have a good night.
not_available Yep.
not_available You too.
not_available Plan on it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Stanley, thought you'd be out painting the town by now.
not_available Well, all my friends are too tired to go out.
not_available You' re kidding me, right? 
not_available They all have pernicious anemia.
not_available Everything in my life was built around it.
not_available Support groups, therapy, committees.
not_available What do I do now? 
not_available Well, you could try enjoying yourself.
not_available How? So your flight was all right then? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Eric's plane disappeared.
not_available It went off radar or something.
not_available They don't know.
not_available Have you been in the water yet? No, Carter.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available Carter, he could show up in an hour.
not_available I just want to wait and see what happens, okay? Okay? All right, I have to go.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Good night, Abby.
not_available Good night.
not_available I hope everything's okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, I'm taking six more.
not_available Cut down on the caffeine.
not_available Or give some to Conni.
not_available Her shift started 10 minutes ago.
not_available Need something done? 
not_available A Nipride drip in 1.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available You rock.
not_available Have you been here since yesterday? 
not_available Well, there's no place like home.
not_available Help.
not_available I think my mother's having a heart attack.
not_available How's this? Smells better anyway.
not_available I don't know how you people stand all this crap.
not_available Me either.
not_available You want some privacy? 
not_available I wanna get out of here.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available They still haven't found a bed upstairs? 
not_available My dad went to find out about it.
not_available Did anybody else die? In the accident? A couple of girls were seriously injured.
not_available But they' re in Recovery now.
not_available They should be okay.
not_available So just Terri died? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not Sasha? No.
not_available I don't know how that happened.
not_available It was raining pretty hard.
not_available Sasha was meaner.
not_available Sorry? 
not_available They weren't very nice to me.
not_available They were never very nice to me.
not_available Come on now.
not_available No! No! 
not_available It'll be all right.
not_available Mommy! No! Why are you letting them do this? 
not_available Everything'll be all right.
not_available Mommy! No! 
not_available It's just till I get better.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right, all right? Mommy, no! 
not_available I love you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No! No! She left them alone at night.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She coded.
not_available Shocked her twice, intubated her, and she converted.
not_available Guess this rules you out as a second signature for her DNR.
not_available It's what she wanted.
not_available I need to talk to you about Helen.
not_available Keep her systolic above 90, and let's get her up to the MICU.
not_available It may not be the disease.
not_available What? What are you talking about? Helen hated those girls.
not_available And they weren't too crazy about her either.
not_available Teenagers torture each other in high school.
not_available Believe me, I remember.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But they get upset when they run over classmates.
not_available Her flat affect could definitely be part of the Wilson's.
not_available Just because she has a disorder doesn't mean she didn't know what she was doing.
not_available Are you implying that she hurt those girls on purpose? She seems disappointed more of them didn't die.
not_available That's what I'm implying.
not_available Doctor, the appy in 4 is asking for you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Your blind date called and said he'd just pick you up here.
not_available Fine.
not_available I have a brother that's single.
not_available Clotted PICC line.
not_available Maybe I missed my turn.
not_available I got up and walked around for a while.
not_available Here's a tip.
not_available Never give up your place on the waiting list at a county hospital.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Yeah, it's a huge deal.
not_available Come on.
not_available No, really.
not_available It gave me a chance to people
not_available watch.
not_available Well, that's putting a positive spin on it.
not_available So why do you have a PICC line? Stage 3C testicular cancer.
not_available These two should be reviewed in surgical committee.
not_available You got it.
not_available I remember you.
not_available Rocket.
not_available How'd I do? Very, very well.
not_available Because you promised you'd take care of me, right? Get some rest.
not_available Send them to the QA office? Mr.
not_available Dresden can transfer to Four West.
not_available And I am going home to soak my feet.
not_available Donald, have a minute? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, what can I do for you? Well, I read your memo and I think your concerns are valid so I'm willing to limit my surgical supervision to fifth
not_available year residents.
not_available Keep going to physical therapy.
not_available Wait, look.
not_available Hear me out.
not_available They already have all the skills they need.
not_available I'd just be there to comment and observe.
not_available You have physical liabilities.
not_available It'd be one or two cases a week.
not_available I wouldn't have to lift a finger.
not_available We simply cannot expose patients or the hospital to unnecessary risks.
not_available Look, look, look.
not_available Just keep me on the schedule, even if it's in name only.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano
not_available Damn it.
not_available Please don't make me beg.
not_available Until your recovery has progressed further let's use your expertise to help our students.
not_available They ready for us? 
not_available Almost.
not_available I'd like to get a psychiatric consult before admitting Helen to the medicine floor for treatment.
not_available Why? Mr.
not_available Broznich, although the disease impacts the brain it doesn't necessarily explain all behavior.
not_available What do you mean? Your daughter has the ability to make decisions.
not_available She goes to school.
not_available She drives a car.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I think you need to speak with the police again.
not_available I'm a spastic.
not_available You said that.
not_available No, Helen.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available That's why I hit the gas and not the brakes.
not_available I'll send the detective in.
not_available Wait.
not_available It's not the disease? 
not_available That will have to be decided.
not_available It was her? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She could have done this? I don't know.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm going to inject something called streptokinase into your port which should dissolve the clot and make your line functional.
not_available A good thing, because your white blood counts are almost nonexistent.
not_available I had chemo 10 days ago.
not_available Your neutrophiles are below 500 making you susceptible to life
not_available threatening infection.
not_available The ER is the last place you should be.
not_available Really? I kind of like it here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now I know you' re sick.
not_available When you' re done with this, go home, take your temperature every four hours.
not_available Anything above 100.4 and you get your butt back here.
not_available Wouldn't it just be easier to stay? 
not_available No.
not_available Hey.
not_available You out of here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Any word? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Is Carter coming back? 
not_available No.
not_available I told him not to.
not_available You don't have to be alone tonight.
not_available Go with you on your blind date? I don't think so.
not_available Call me if you need me.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Good night.
not_available Is that him? Yeah.
not_available Have fun.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Susan Lewis.
not_available Rick Kelly.
not_available So are you ready to go? Actually, I have to stick around with a patient.
not_available A kid with testicular cancer.
not_available I should've called you.
not_available I drove in from Lincoln Park.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Should we reschedule? Probably not.
not_available Really? Well, you know when you meet someone and you can tell if there's a connection or not? Actually, I don't wanna give up steak.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What happened to your date? Oh, it wasn't meant to be, I guess.
not_available Let's get you a shot of Neupogen.
not_available Did you get new furniture? It feels different in here.
not_available It's less crowded.
not_available Maybe that's it.
not_available You miss him? Sometimes.
not_available I never lived with anyone aside from my parents.
not_available No? 
not_available But they weren't around much.
not_available Guess that's why sometimes I love my alone time.
not_available Not me.
not_available I grew up around a whole bunch of cousins and kids in the projects.
not_available I like it loud.
not_available The more the merrier.
not_available You like kids? Why do you ask? I don't know.
not_available You ever think about having them? Okay, okay.
not_available You' re not the maternal type.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I love kids.
not_available Well, good.
not_available Me too.
not_available I
not_available I had one.
not_available You have a kid? I gave him up for adoption.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available He's being raised by good people.
not_available Aren't you good people? I guess I wasn't ready.
not_available Well, I'm gonna go take a shower.
not_available All right? Mom, are you there? Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back earlier.
not_available But I need to talk to you now.
not_available Mom, if you' re there, could you please pick up? Okay.
not_available Maybe you 're sleeping.
not_available Call me back.
not_available I should be home.
