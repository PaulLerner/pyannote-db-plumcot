not_available And starting today, we're both gonna be on time.
not_available Who's picking me up? 
not_available Tina's mom.

not_available I hate Tina.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available She likes you.
not_available No, she doesn't.

not_available Here I am.
not_available It's supposed to be a great weekend.
not_available It'll get up in the 70s.
not_available Damn it.
not_available You're in a good mood.
not_available I was doing fine until I got my blood
not_available test results.
not_available My viral load's up to 1000.
not_available 1000 is not significant.
not_available It is to me.
not_available Perfect timing.
not_available What do you mean? It's Al's and my anniversary.
not_available Would've been nine years.
not_available Talk about the gift that keeps on giving.
not_available You had the flu last week.
not_available That's why your viral load went up.
not_available In two weeks, it'll be undetectable.

not_available We need to talk.
not_available Sorry about the meeting.
not_available The Search Committee received your application for the teaching job along with Kerry Weaver's.
not_available Wasn't she going for research? Teaching job's her fallback.
not_available Now, between us, you're the better candidate.
not_available Kerry's intellect is superior, but she doesn't have your people skills.
not_available The hitch is, you haven't published.
not_available Kerry has written seven articles.
not_available Two in the Annals.
not_available You have to find an interesting case and write it up to show the committee you're not illiterate.
not_available A case.

not_available I went out on a limb to back you.
not_available Don't make me look like an idiot.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Damn it! Carol? What are you doing? What is this? You're reading Harrison's Interna/ Medicine? I'm checking the rate of oxygenated metabolism in hypothyroidism.
not_available This is important to you? It was on the medical

not_available I put "above normal." The answer's "below normal." Every day I think of another question.
not_available I look it up, and I got it wrong.
not_available I'm sure you did fine.
not_available No, Doug.
not_available I've looked up 30 questions, and I missed them all.
not_available I did not do fine.

not_available Is she your daughter? Where is she? 
not_available I killed her.
not_available How're you feeling, Mr.
not_available Bartok? 
not_available Like after my second heart attack.
not_available What you're having is a lot like it, except to your gut.

not_available Wait.

not_available He's infarcting his bowel.
not_available He won't get better in the ICU.
not_available It's his only shot.
not_available Doesn't he have a better shot if we operate? There's nothing we can do for him.

not_available I'm a surgeon, not an executioner.
not_available Let's go, doc.
not_available I'm dying here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bartok, Dr.
not_available Anspaugh feels that you won't survive this surgery.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available It means we'll move you to ICU.
not_available The Intensive Care Unit.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You said if I don't get the surgery right away, I'm through.
not_available That's true.
not_available So? What? Are you writing me off? Send me to die like some animal? 
not_available I am sorry.
not_available You're sorry.
not_available What the hell is that? You told me I'd get the best care in the city, for God's sake! Should I call transport to come get him? You gave me your word.

not_available Sounds like she's got it.
not_available Holy Shih Tzu! I'd say his chances of surviving an anastomosis is slim to none.
not_available His collaterals may still be profusing his bowel.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available His BP is up.
not_available He's not a good risk.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bartok knows he might not wake up.
not_available He wants everything done and I think we should at least try to save his life.
not_available If we get in and out quickly, then maybe.

not_available All right, let's take him.
not_available Good news.
not_available You're going to Surgery.
not_available Thanks.
not_available My pen.
not_available I was wondering where I left it.
not_available Scissors, tweezers.
not_available She should be in the circus.
not_available It's all in her stomach.
not_available With a rat's tooth and a scope, I can grab it.
not_available Looks like she's back to being an ER case.
not_available "Woman Swallows Medical Instruments." The journals would love this.
not_available Didn't know you were into publishing.
not_available The fast track.
not_available Publish or perish.
not_available She's throwing PVCs.
not_available Tricyclics, they're cardiotoxic.

not_available You're experiencing blindness because of the methanol you ingested.
not_available Papilledema? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Suzanne? Yeah? 
not_available Roger is on his way.
not_available My Roger? Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available God.

not_available Is there anything you wanna tell him? That I'm sorry.
not_available Then that's what you should say.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Jerry! It's a test, not a survey.
not_available Doug, got a minute? These kids were going to the prom when she had a gallstone attack.
not_available No big deal.
not_available I've had them for years.
not_available Starting early.
not_available It's barely 2:00.
not_available We had a pre
not_available prom party.
not_available Betsy's folks are out of town.
not_available Why would you tell him that? 
not_available He's a doctor.
not_available I just need antibiotics.
not_available Let me check you out first.
not_available Let's go to Exam 1.
not_available Now let me do the talking.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available Alner? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you want to see her? 
not_available I can see her.
not_available She's dying.
not_available Yes.
not_available Is she in pain? 
not_available Some.
not_available Good.
not_available She cheated on me.
not_available Got herself infected with AIDS, and gave it to our baby.
not_available I've been waiting for this for a long time.
not_available Retract the omentum.
not_available Let's see what we've got.
not_available Is that gangrene? 
not_available From the proximal jejunum to the transverse colon.
not_available If we go forward, we'll be here for hours.
not_available He won't have any small bowel left.
not_available I think it's worth a shot.
not_available What is it, Carter? He owes you money? All right, let's go.
not_available Hemostat and a couple of Scudders for the bowel.
not_available What's going on in here? 
not_available What's the problem? I rejected this patient as a poor surgical risk.
not_available Didn't Carter tell you that? 
not_available No, he didn't.
not_available I got a 23
not_available year jump on you.
not_available You trying to outflank me? What makes you think your judgment is superior to mine? 
not_available I don't.
not_available I thought the patient 
not_available This has nothing to do with him! In the practice of medicine, interns do not make end runs on the chief of staff! I want you in my office at 5:00 sharp to discuss your future as a surgeon.
not_available If you have any hope of continuing in this program, you'll explain your actions with the appropriate degree of contrition and respect and the assurance that nothing like this will ever happen again.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available Scrub out, Carter.
not_available Sign so we can get back our property.
not_available No! I want surgery.
not_available Have you ever had an endoscopy before? I don't think you know what you're missing.
not_available Endoscopy is an extremely traumatic and invasive procedure.
not_available I have to stick this tube with a camera down your throat root around and grab the items you've swallowed and yank them up to your gullet.
not_available The best thing is, you'll be conscious the whole time.
not_available You mean, I can watch? 
not_available In living color.
not_available They called from Rachel's school.
not_available You need to pick her up now.
not_available Someone else was supposed to.
not_available They didn't.
not_available You wanna talk to them? 
not_available No.
not_available I'II Tell them I'm on my way.
not_available I'll be back in 45 minutes.
not_available Don't leave her alone.
not_available And don't let anybody else do the endoscopy.
not_available Whose your wife's doctor? 
not_available Janet Coburn.
not_available Why are you here? 
not_available You're the expert on fetal anomalies.
not_available Since Carla has diabetes, I wanted you to take a look.
not_available I can tell you right now, he looks fine.
not_available No cardiac abnormalities? 
not_available No.
not_available Macrosomia? 
not_available No.
not_available How's Janet managing your wife? Through diet or insulin injections? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available You don't know how your wife's being managed? 
not_available Actually, we're not married.
not_available But you talk to her, one would hope.
not_available Well, we had a little falling out.
not_available I see.
not_available I don't know you and I'm getting the feeling I'm doing something I shouldn't be.
not_available And I'm starting to resent it.
not_available Bad news.
not_available Your gallbladder's gotta come out right away.
not_available First thing tomorrow? 
not_available Right away.
not_available I paid $400 for that dress.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You're in real trouble here.
not_available Listen to him, Bets.
not_available Shut up, Jeffrey.
not_available I'll come back right after the prom.
not_available No, you'll get septic and die by the end of the night.
not_available I'll risk it.
not_available Give me antibiotics.
not_available You're going to Surgery.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I'm 18.
not_available I know my rights.
not_available I'm walking out of here, and you can't do squat.
not_available Jeffrey, my dress.
not_available You'll be back by 10? 
not_available They crown the king and queen at 10.
not_available 10:30 then.
not_available I could leave at 10:30.
not_available Where's the prom? 
not_available The Drake.
not_available That's halfway across town.
not_available 10:00.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Jeffrey, zip me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Wait.
not_available I've got an idea.
not_available Mr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Hi.
not_available Sorry about the mix
not_available up.
not_available It happens.
not_available Where's Rach? In the library.
not_available Got a minute? I'd like to talk to you.
not_available Sure.
not_available I just wanna know if there's anything you need to be careful about with Rachel these days.
not_available Restricted physical activities, diet? Why? 
not_available Because of her leukemia.
not_available Rachel doesn't have leukemia.
not_available Where did you get that? 
not_available Rachel.
not_available She told some classmates she's sick and not expected to live.
not_available Why would she say something like that? She's been having problems socially.
not_available You heard about the fight? It was with one of the more popular girls.
not_available Since then, she's been playing by herself.
not_available Feigning an illness I'm sure was just a way to get attention.
not_available Hey, Rach.
not_available Ready to go? Are we going home? 
not_available I wish.
not_available Gotta go to the hospital.
not_available You can do your math homework.
not_available Big whoop! 
not_available That's no way to talk to her.
not_available We'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Say goodbye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available What's the story? 
not_available Keeled over while playing cards.
not_available Must have gotten a bad hand.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available BP's 80 over 50, heart rate's 130.
not_available You didn't start an IV? 
not_available Blew two on the ride.
not_available Veins are shot.
not_available Try a stick on the hand.
not_available I'm hearing rales.
not_available 3
not_available plus pitting edema.
not_available He's got congestive heart failure.
not_available Prep Lasix and dopamine.
not_available We need to get the fluid off his lungs.
not_available How's that IV coming? 
not_available Forget it.
not_available His skin's like paper.
not_available I'll do a central line.
not_available I need a kit.
not_available Any Attending around? 
not_available Greene left and Weaver's in Radiology.
not_available Betadine, please.
not_available Page Weaver and call Surgery.
not_available We need help with the central line.
not_available Cancel that.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Give me an 8 French.
not_available Surgeons put in lines all the time.
not_available I said I got it.
not_available BP's down to 60.
not_available Standing by with dopamine.
not_available How long is it gonna be? 
not_available Wanna help? Grab him a pillow.
not_available I'm calling Surgery.
not_available Line's in.
not_available Run the dopamine, Hold the Lasix until his pressure is back.
not_available The ambulance takes you to the dance and picks you up at 10:00.
not_available Take that.
not_available 10:15.
not_available IV in, nothing too wild.
not_available All right? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available And for 
her No food, alcohol or smoking.
not_available Make sure she's back by 10:30.
not_available Not a minute later.
not_available You can count on me.
not_available Bye.
not_available Have fun.
not_available Be good.
not_available Close the door.
not_available I have never seen as devious, underhanded and self
not_available destructive a maneuver as you pulled.
not_available What the hell were you thinking? I thought the patient deserved a chance.
not_available I questioned his assessment that the patient wasn't fit for surgery.
not_available If I were a patient, I would like a second opinion.
not_available You led me to believe that mine was the only opinion.
not_available If I'd known, it's unlikely I would've proceeded.
not_available And not without consulting Dr.
not_available Anspaugh first.
not_available Before we decide whether or not to terminate your Residency do you have anything to say? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I apologize for not being more forceful in making my case when we spoke.
not_available And to you for not telling about Anspaugh's assessment.
not_available I still believe we owed this patient a chance in saving his life.
not_available I'm glad we gave it to him.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available I have a question.
not_available What? Did Mr.
not_available Bartok survive the surgery? Yes, he did.
not_available Labs are back.
not_available BUN is 45.
not_available Creatine is 3.5.
not_available He's a renal failure.
not_available Anyone page Weaver? 
not_available I did.
not_available BP's 50.
not_available We gotta increase his output.
not_available Prep some Vasotec.
not_available Ace inhibitors to a renal failure? 
not_available Gotta get his heart pumping.
not_available Give him 1.25.
not_available It'll shut his kidneys down.
not_available Improving cardiac output will help his renal failure.
not_available Give the Vasotec.
not_available Here are the contraindications.
not_available I can read.
not_available We must get it pumping.
not_available It's a mistake.
not_available Load the Vasotec.
not_available What's going on? He's in congestive heart and renal failure.
not_available BP's crashing.
not_available I've ordered 1.25 of Vasotec, but I can't convince the nurses to do it.
not_available Give him Vasotec to start his heart.
not_available What about his kidneys? Gotta get the heart going first.
not_available Where is she? Why didn't you tell me? Still hanging on? 
not_available She's delirious.
not_available From organophosphates, methanol, tricyclics.
not_available Take your pick.
not_available BP's falling.
not_available She's shocky.
not_available Better get Kerry.
not_available Looks like impending respiratory failure.
not_available You may need to intubate.
not_available Roger, is that you? She's blind from the methanol.
not_available Roger, I'm sorry.
not_available She thinks you're her husband.
not_available Roger, I'm sorry.
not_available Forgive me.
not_available Roger's not here.
not_available Please forgive me, Roger.
not_available Please.
not_available Please, Roger.
not_available Please forgive me.
not_available Just say it.
not_available What? 
not_available Tell her you forgive her.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available It's not my place to do that.
not_available Just say it.
not_available Greg, say it.
not_available Just say it.
not_available Please.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What's her rate? One
not_available forty.
not_available Let's tube her.
not_available Roger! Hold her.
not_available Hold her.
not_available It's okay, sweetheart.
not_available It's okay, sweetheart.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Since the test was multiple choice with a possible five answers you could guess randomly and score 20 percent.
not_available You got 15.
not_available Your days as a sperm donor are over.
not_available But I was nervous.
not_available I don't perform under pressure.
not_available You wanna call, or should I? 
not_available Kerry, I'm back on.
not_available Hey, Rachel.
not_available Mark.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Blinnder was complaining of abdominal pains.
not_available I had to scope out her stomach.
not_available I believe this is yours.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I thought we could coauthor an article and send it to the journals.
not_available I've even got a 
title "The Woman Who Ate the ER." Great.
not_available What's your problem? The attitude.
not_available Excuse me? What do you mean? You second
not_available guess me.
not_available What is going on? 
not_available Nothing's going on.
not_available Don't ever disregard my orders like you did in that trauma.
not_available I may be younger, but I am the doctor and you are the nurse.
not_available Keep that straight.
not_available Sweetheart, you gotta do your homework before you watch TV.
not_available I don't wanna.
not_available Those are the rules.
not_available Can you help me? 
not_available I gotta help some sick people.
not_available You're always taking care of sick people.
not_available Rach.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hilderbrand said you told friends you were sick.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available They're not my friends.
not_available You want them to be nice to you? Quality Assurance would like you to finish these charts by 6.
not_available Just leave them.
not_available People won't like you because you're sick.
not_available You help people who are sick.
not_available You don't have to be sick for me to love you.
not_available I love you more than anything in the world.
not_available You know that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh is on the phone.
not_available I'll call him back.
not_available No, wait.
not_available I gotta take this.
not_available Please, Daddy! Rachel, I have to do this, okay? We'll talk more when we get home.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wasn't comfortable pretending to be her husband.
not_available You don't have to apologize.
not_available It's getting late.
not_available If you're still up for the lake, we have to leave soon.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Because of what happened with her? No.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I guess I'm not ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available No problem.
not_available Lf Call me if you wanna get together this weekend.
not_available How did it go? 
not_available Not bad.
not_available We removed most of your small intestine.
not_available You won't be able to eat salt food again.
not_available Can I drink? 
not_available Yeah, actually.
not_available Smoke? 
not_available Lf you must.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Your daughter is flying in tonight.
not_available Goosebumps.
not_available You want me to get you a blanket? Goosebumps, our horse.
not_available How did she do? Oh, I don't know.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Would you call the morgue? 
not_available I already did.
not_available Who put those here? 
not_available I did.
not_available I found them in the trash.
not_available Yes, this is Dr.
not_available McGrath speaking.
not_available Tuesday at 3 would be splendid.
not_available Go for it, dude.
not_available Who's there? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Peter.
not_available Peter who? 
not_available Very funny, Carla.
not_available What do you want, Peter? 
not_available I wanna know how you're both doing.
not_available We're fine.
not_available See you.
not_available Carla! I know things haven't been right between us.
not_available But I'm here, and I'm trying to do the right thing.
not_available I wanna support you through this.
not_available I wanna be a father to my kid.
not_available Carla.
not_available Excuse me, could you hold that door, please? Thank you.
not_available Come by Saturday morning.
not_available I could use some help around the house.
not_available All right, I'll be here.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You know what I hate? Maggie Doyle? 
not_available No, not her.
not_available Just that she's right.
not_available She's younger than me.
not_available Yes, you're right.
not_available She is.
not_available We grew up in the same neighborhood, and I gotta take orders from her.
not_available You're very competitive.
not_available I can't help it.
not_available She got through medical school, and I can't even get through the door.
not_available You can get through my door.
not_available Anything in a bra can do that.
not_available No, I've reformed.
not_available Ask anyone.
not_available All right, kids.
not_available Right on time.
not_available She wanted to see the Best Dressed Contest, but I said, "No, Bets.
not_available Your surgery is more important." 
not_available Good man, Jeff.
not_available Thanks, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available This was the best night of my life.
not_available Me too.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Good night.
not_available Rach, come on.
not_available It's time to go home.
not_available I'm tired.
not_available I know.
not_available It's late.
not_available Can you carry me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Grab on.
not_available We got a great case, a guy with Takayasu's arteritis on a dual
not_available chamber pacemaker.
not_available Make a good article.
not_available Tell Kerry to take it.
not_available I'm going home.
not_available Carter, you're on probation, but you're still in the program.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank Anspaugh.
not_available I wanted you out.
not_available John Carter's not a law unto himself.
not_available I hope you've learned that.
not_available You won't get another chance.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Can I come in? 
not_available Sure, come in.
not_available I was just finishing dinner.
not_available Hungry? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available So you haven't been here.
not_available What do you think? Honestly, I'm glad I got the house.
not_available I'm sorry about this morning.
not_available You did a nice thing.
not_available I was rude.
not_available I'm the one who should apologize.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You don't really think our marriage was a disaster from start till finish, do you? We had a good beginning.
not_available The middle wasn't bad.
not_available Yeah, we had a pretty good middle.
not_available The end was my fault.
not_available The more I think about it, I don't blame you for hating me.
not_available I don't hate you.
not_available I don't wanna be angry anymore.
not_available I don't wanna be that kind of person.
not_available I never meant to hurt you.
not_available Hey Come on.
not_available No tears, okay? Because I'll start going.
not_available I've missed you.
not_available I miss you.
