not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available You're the chief of Emergency Medicine, not the County's lesbian advocate! That's where you're wrong, Robert.
not_available Because I'm both.
not_available I'm the Chief of Emergency Medicine and I'm a lesbian.
not_available Jesse.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's his nephew.
not_available Some guy opened fire in a foster
not_available care facility.
not_available Fossen? Derek Fossen? Fourteen shots.
not_available Six deaths.
not_available That maniac shot her at her house.

not_available E.R.
not_available 8x01 "FOUR CORNERS" Psych? My daughter doesn't need a psychiatrist.
not_available I just need to talk to her.
not_available That's all.
not_available Can you get him on the phone? 
not_available When did he die? It's Dr.
not_available Carter in the ER.
not_available How long does a CAT scan take? 
not_available I'll hold.
not_available I'm off at 4 if you want to go get coffee.
not_available Two hundred people back at the house.
not_available There's coffee there, isn't there? I wouldn't ask you to subject yourself to that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weisman? 
not_available Yes? You have a patient, Holly Evans, who was supposed to be admitted last night.
not_available Say he doesn't die on the table or in post
not_available op.
not_available You ship him back to his convenience
not_available store alley.
not_available But this time, instead of getting beaten up he gets eaten by dogs because he's too weak to move.
not_available Eaten by dogs? 
not_available It happens.
not_available In Chicago? 
not_available A lot.
not_available A cop told me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano needs you in his office immediately.
not_available Did he say why? 
not_available Something about the Fossen case.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hey, Mark, you got a second? 
not_available No.
not_available Look, is Cleo having trouble with the triple cocktail? What? 
not_available She was nauseated.
not_available She's alone and afraid.
not_available And has now been waiting for almost 20 hours.
not_available No.
not_available No, pull your thumb out, get down here and admit your patient.
not_available Give her another gram of cefoxitin and order a clear
not_available liquid diet.
not_available "Pull your thumb out"? 
not_available Call me in half an hour if someone from Pedes doesn't get down here.
not_available Exactly what don't you want me to subject myself to? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Abby, John.
not_available Things are a little tense.
not_available See you later.
not_available I can imagine.
not_available Queen Elizabeth wants me to meet her boy.
not_available Got room for a Haldol deficiency? 
not_available Over there.
not_available Because we are compatible.
not_available Who, you and Prince Charles? 
not_available He likes coffee and so do I.
not_available I could be princess.
not_available He is mine, honey.
not_available Abby? MVA with PSl rolling up.
not_available Coming.
not_available Hey, you stay away from him.
not_available I promise.
not_available There's an apartment listed in that building.
not_available Which? 
not_available The one you like on Clark.
not_available Two bedrooms, big closets, wood floors.
not_available You went there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I called the manager.
not_available She already had two people interested.
not_available Are you seriously considering it? 
not_available I thought you liked that area.
not_available Oh, I can't afford that kind of rent.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available And I'm pretty happy where I am.
not_available Oh, IYou knowHow much is this? 
not_available For you, $20.
not_available Is it real? 
not_available Of course.
not_available No.
not_available I mean authentic.
not_available Direct from Kenya, pretty lady.
not_available Imported with my own two hands.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available It's not a gift.
not_available At some point, we have to have some standards.
not_available Who decides, you? They decided when they chose to participate.
not_available You judge someone based on what they do in their bedroom? Look, I have no problem with alternative lifestyles.
not_available But we 're talking about role models here.
not_available So you would oppose gay teachers? I oppose any homosexual in a job where they interact and influence
not_available Okay.
not_available Exactly what don't you want me to subject myself to? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Abby, John.
not_available Hey, chief.
not_available Back in the saddle so soon? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We weren't expecting you.
not_available It's been three weeks.
not_available Already? Man, the time really flies when you're, you know, missing a colleague.
not_available Malik, you got that xray going? What xray? 
not_available The one with the kid.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abby, MVA with a PSl rolling up.
not_available I love your hair color.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available It's strong.
not_available It's very
not_available Thank you.
not_available Awesome bracelet.
not_available Where'd you get it? 
not_available A place in Nairobi.
not_available Was it totally amazing? What? 
not_available Africa.
not_available It was exactly as I remembered it.
not_available She's not breathing.
not_available Pulse is thready, bradying down to 50.
not_available P.E.A.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Two of O
not_available neg on the infuser.
not_available Get some saline.
not_available How'd she get upstairs? 
not_available She's an ER patient? Came in with facial fracture, abdominal pain, broken wrist.
not_available Waiting for Psych.
not_available Pregnant with her brother's baby.
not_available Why wasn't anyone monitoring? Short
not_available handed with Legaspi gone.
not_available Another 2 cc's in the cuff.
not_available Hey, give me a vascular clamp.
not_available They haven't replaced Legaspi? 
not_available Someone said she got a job in California.
not_available We should be so lucky.
not_available Is that true? Dr.
not_available Weaver, have you heard from Dr.
not_available Legaspi? Probably a tension pneumo.
not_available What happened? Four
not_available story fall.
not_available GCS of 3.
not_available Now in P.E.A.
not_available How did she fall? 
not_available She jumped.
not_available Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.
not_available Did she ever have a pulse? 
not_available No.
not_available Try for a central line.
not_available No.
not_available Open up another tray.
not_available We've got this, Kerry.
not_available Go get cleaned up.
not_available Prep for a subclavian.
not_available I want a second chest tube first.
not_available 10 blade.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Really, Kerry, we've got it.
not_available Set up a Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Holding compressions.
not_available Pretty agonal.
not_available You want atropine? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Push a milligram.
not_available Let's set up a pericardiocentesis.
not_available What did you say to her? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available How long are we going? Dr.
not_available Weaver, how was your trip? Hot.
not_available It was hot.
not_available Hey, I never got a chance to thank you.
not_available For what? 
not_available I got my Chief Resident confirmation.
not_available I won't let you down.
not_available I'm sure you won't.
not_available No! No! No, no, no! 
not_available You should sue that Scottish bastard.
not_available What? Sleazebag host will say anything to get you on his show.
not_available Mr.
not_available Peterson started a brawl at a talk
not_available show taping.
not_available Somebody smacked me with a microphone.
not_available Carl? Stay the hell away from me, you queer.
not_available Carl, let me drive you home.
not_available I don't dig penises, okay? 
not_available I have only one more operation.
not_available Touch me, I swear
not_available Hey.
not_available You need to calm down.
not_available Calm down? This thing makes me look like some twisted fairy.
not_available You knew.
not_available Part of you knew.
not_available Security.
not_available You see this, huh? Man, woman.
not_available That's what I know.
not_available That's normal.
not_available It's still love, Carl.
not_available Love is love.
not_available It's perverted, you faggot! It's sick.
not_available You disgust me.
not_available Calm down, sir.
not_available You're a freak! 
not_available Please calm down.
not_available Damn homo.
not_available You all right? Take it easy, all right? You going to the M&amp;M;? 
not_available What? On Fossen.
not_available The M&amp;M;'s starting.
not_available Luka, has there been any talk about me? Kerry, people always talk about their bosses.
not_available No, I
not_available I mean personally.
not_available Personally? Well, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available I thought maybe you fell under the spell of some Masai warrior and were never coming back.
not_available Coming in? Why wasn't lidocaine given for a stable V
not_available tach? I didn't have the ACLS drug box with me.
not_available When transferring a critical patient? The Trauma nurse ran out to get it but then the doors closed unexpectedly.
not_available Leaving you alone with the patient? 
not_available Right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi, however, is a lesbian.
not_available Am I right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Isn't that a little barbaric? I've never hidden that fact from this administration or my colleagues.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Your secret's safe with me.
not_available How many openly gay women do you know in hospital administrative positions? None.
not_available It doesn't happen.
not_available Then deal with the stigma of being gay.
not_available You care to comment on that? Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available In your opinion, was the patient's care compromised? Compromised? Did the ER accept too many Trauma patients that day? I don't believe so.
not_available We were busy, but we handled it.
not_available Watch your back.
not_available Kerry, you under the weather? Excuse me? 
not_available You were a little slow on the uptake.
not_available Jet lag.
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Your trip to Africa, was it? Spontaneous decision.
not_available Doesn't seem like you.
not_available Half of my accrued personal days were about to expire.
not_available It still doesn't justify you going MIA for three weeks with no real warning.
not_available You know what? I took a vacation.
not_available I may take another.
not_available I still have 19 days banked.
not_available I see.
not_available You might want to try Papua New Guinea next time.
not_available I hear they put gourds on their penises.
not_available Give some notice next time.
not_available Wait.
not_available Robert.
not_available Careful, Kerry.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm good.
not_available You know, you could just call my office.
not_available You don't have to beat up the elevator.
not_available You Who have you told? 
not_available Told who what? About what we discussed before I left.
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Legaspi.
not_available As ordered, I backed off.
not_available But she was determined to leave, decided she didn't like us anymore and was gonna move and work in San Francisco, I understand.
not_available Go figure.
not_available Have you told anyone about me? 
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available I think you do.
not_available Have you told anyone that I'm a lesbian? No, Kerry.
not_available I assumed that that was confidential.
not_available Was I wrong to assume that? I mean, if you want to tell everyone, that's your business.
not_available But I don't see how a person's sexual affairs are appropriate subject matter for a workplace conversation, do you, Kerry? No.
not_available Glad we're on the same page.
not_available We got aluminum rotors in stock? 
not_available Doubt it.
not_available Want me to order some? 
not_available If it's not too much trouble.
not_available Pads too? I'm sure your father will give me a deal.
not_available If I ever need an operation, you better not charge me.
not_available Just for parts.
not_available What's this, summer session? 
not_available Chem 2.
not_available Look, if you can pay him, you should pay him.
not_available Mom got fired.
not_available What happened? You can only take a leave of absence for just so long.
not_available Hey, you know what? You should bring Cleo over.
not_available We haven't seen you guys in a while.
not_available We're taking a little break right now.
not_available What did you do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available She's going through some rough stuff and she needed a little room.
not_available I'm respecting that.
not_available Did you reach him? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available I'm gonna try him again in a few.
not_available Look at that.
not_available You'd think she had fangs.
not_available He said he'd come to check on me.
not_available I know.
not_available Nine years I've been hosting a talk show.
not_available I've never gotten bit.
not_available I thought those fights were all staged.
not_available Not exactly.
not_available But people don't usually get hurt.
not_available We use lightweight furniture, just in case.
not_available Guys tend to get unglued when their lover tells them she used to be a man.
not_available Can you get AIDS from a shemale bite? 
not_available What? I think one of the transsexuals bit me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available She broke the skin.
not_available Cleo? Hey, you all right? 
not_available Y eah.
not_available I heard you got sick.
not_available A little nauseous.
not_available Trouble with your meds? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You're still taking them, though, right? Do you want to help out? 
not_available Sure.
not_available A 20year
not_available old girl fell down and broke her left wrist.
not_available Doesn't sound surgical.
not_available Then smacked repeatedly with a folding chair to the face and abdomen.
not_available Talkshow brawl? 
not_available She's a little worked up.
not_available Just found out her boyfriend is also her half
not_available brother.
not_available Right.
not_available Up.
not_available Down.
not_available Okay.
not_available You might have a facial fracture.
not_available I need to see some x
not_available rays.
not_available Is this tender? How about here? I need to use ultrasound on your belly to rule out internal bleeding, okay? 
not_available Alice.
not_available Get out! Get out! Let me explain
not_available You tell me on TV.
not_available I know.
not_available You keep this from me.
not_available You let me date him.
not_available And you knew we were having sex, and you tell me on TV! 
not_available The producers made me do that.
not_available Get out! 
not_available You need to sit and let us monitor you.
not_available I need to talk to Alice.
not_available Alice, honey, I love you.
not_available I can explain this whole thing.
not_available Get out! 
not_available I can explain this.
not_available Get out! 
not_available Please.
not_available Alice? Can you tell if I'm pregnant with that? Do you think you are? I might be.
not_available It looks like about 10 weeks.
not_available I was gonna keep it.
not_available This can't be happening.
not_available This can't be true.
not_available I love him so much.
not_available It's not fair.
not_available There's no intra
not_available abdominal bleeding, but I'm gonna get a CT scan of your face.
not_available Could you close the curtain? Sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, can I discharge Molton? 
not_available As soon as he's done with his IV.
not_available Also, this girl needs a facial CT and a Psych consult.
not_available Weaver's here! What? Why didn't someone say she was working? 
not_available She's on the schedule.
not_available Take this down.
not_available I know I know you from somewhere.
not_available I wouldn't forget that smile.
not_available All right.
not_available Put Neosporin on it three times a day and don't wash your hair for two days.
not_available No way.
not_available I'm a bridesmaid on Saturday.
not_available I have to wash my hair.
not_available I wanna look good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano needs you in his office immediately.
not_available Did he say why? 
not_available Something about the Fossen case.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hey, Mark, you got a minute? 
not_available No.
not_available Is Cleo having trouble with the triple cocktail? What? 
not_available She was nauseated.
not_available Has she had a repeat antibody test? 
not_available You should ask her.
not_available I want to make sure they're following her LFTs.
not_available Peter, you should talk to her.
not_available Uncle Peter.
not_available Joanie? What's wrong? 
not_available Can I talk to you? Your parathyroidectomy's ready to go.
not_available Put his film on a view box.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I think they're gonna break up.
not_available Who? 
not_available My mom and my dad.
not_available I didn't notice until I came home for the summer, but it's really bad, Uncle Peter.
not_available I mean, one minute, Mom seems okay.
not_available The next, she's crying and locks herself in the bedroom.
not_available Dad won't even say anything.
not_available He just gets all quiet and stares into space.
not_available Look, they lost their son.
not_available It's normal.
not_available No, it is not normal.
not_available They fight all the time about her job, about Jesse's room.
not_available Dad washed a shirt that had his scent on it, and Mom went nuts.
not_available And then Dad stayed out all night.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's just messed up.
not_available Somebody's gotta talk to her.
not_available There's nothing I can say, and there's nothing you can do but give it time.
not_available It's almost been a year, Uncle Peter.
not_available Joanie, I know, but itTrauma 1? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's your patient.
not_available My patient? 
not_available Yeah, the girl from the talk show.
not_available What? Probably a tension pneumo.
not_available What happened? Four
not_available story fall.
not_available GCS of three.
not_available In P.E.A.
not_available How'd she fall? 
not_available She jumped.
not_available Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.
not_available Did she ever have a pulse? 
not_available No.
not_available Try for a central line.
not_available Let's open up another tray first.
not_available We've got this.
not_available Go get cleaned up.
not_available Prep for a subclavian.
not_available Not until I get a second chest tube.
not_available Really, Kerry.
not_available We've got it.
not_available Set up a Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Holding compressions.
not_available Pretty agonal.
not_available You want atropine? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Push a milligram.
not_available Let's set up a pericardiocentesis.
not_available What did you say to her? 
not_available I didn't say anything to her.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Check the tamponade.
not_available Give her 8 units packed cells.
not_available I feel a pulse.
not_available Injury occurring on the monitor.
not_available Blood in the pericardium.
not_available Rate is 29.
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available All right.
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available Another amp of epi.
not_available Mother's outside.
not_available Keep her out.
not_available I'll tell her.
not_available I'm not ready to call it yet.
not_available You will be.
not_available Let it circulate.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? Asystole.
not_available No! No! No, no, no! No, no! Time of death, 12:17.
not_available Peter.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available What, are you springcleaning? 
not_available Getting rid of some crap.
not_available It's not too dark? I wanted to finish.
not_available Salvation Army comes tomorrow.
not_available All right.
not_available Well, let me give you a hand.
not_available I'm almost done.
not_available Want a hamster cage? No? You okay? What did you need, Peter? I
not_available What? I just came by for a snow shovel.
not_available All right.
not_available I came to check on you.
not_available I heard you lost your job.
not_available We'll just have to wait to expand that porch.
not_available What's wrong with the porch? I don't know.
not_available I thought it was time for a change.
not_available Walt took some pictures of the back yard that we could xerox and draw on make plans.
not_available When I went to pick up the prints I found three pictures of Jesse left on the roll.
not_available I fell apart.
not_available Right in the store.
not_available I realized that's it.
not_available There'll never be any more pictures of him.
not_available Fifteen years old.
not_available And he's never gonna change.
not_available You think every day you're getting a little better, getting through it.
not_available And then you're right back to the day it happened.
not_available He's still my baby, Peter.
not_available I'm supposed to take care of him.
not_available I feel like somewhere, sometime he's gonna be sad or cold or scared.
not_available Who's taking care of him? Who's being his mother? "I am the resurrection and the life," sayeth the Lord.
not_available "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
not_available And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
not_available We brought nothing into this world.
not_available And it is certain we'd carry nothing out.
not_available Wherefore my heart is glad and my spirit rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope.
not_available " The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
not_available Blessed be the name of the Lord.
not_available In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ we commend to almighty God our brother John.
not_available And we commit his body to the ground.
not_available Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust.
not_available Dad did a nice job with the eulogy.
not_available He worked on it for a while.
not_available Grandpa would have liked it.
not_available Yes.
not_available Gamma seems to be holding up.
not_available I expect she would.
not_available Is that for your convenience or someone else's? 
not_available Hello.
not_available Bad time? Yeah.
not_available Kind of busy.
not_available Why? Wait, wait.
not_available She's not on the ward? Weisman was supposed to admit her last night.
not_available She's sitting right here.
not_available What's her hemoglobin? Okay, yeah.
not_available No, I'll be right there.
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available We need to make a stop at County General Hospital.
not_available Just get off on Division.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This shouldn't take long.
not_available You mind? Can someone shut him up? 
not_available Why don't you both shut up.
not_available I got a right to be here, same as you.
not_available Hi.
not_available You left without saying goodbye.
not_available You were asleep.
not_available For about 10 minutes.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I had someplace to be.
not_available I don't like it here.
not_available I know.
not_available But we'll make sure that you get your own bed and your own room upstairs.
not_available You said that last night.
not_available Well, they're still working on it.
not_available But I'm gonna go hurry them up, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Any more pain in your stomach? 
not_available A little.
not_available We'll take care of that.
not_available And Abby here is gonna hang out with you until they bring you up.
not_available Tell her to call me again if you want to talk to me.
not_available Thanks for coming back.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available What was her last crit? Thirtysix, after two doses of Solu
not_available Medrol.
not_available Give her four more, MS, then Q2 p.
not_available r.
not_available n.
not_available When are her parents getting here? 
not_available Around 3.
not_available They missed their connecting flight.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weisman, please.
not_available Nice suit.
not_available Who died? My grandfather.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available No, no.
not_available Can you get him on the phone now? When did he die? 
not_available It's Dr.
not_available Carter in the ER.
not_available Monday.
not_available Wow.
not_available You okay? I'm off at 4 if you want to go get a coffee or something.
not_available I got 200 people back at the house.
not_available There's coffee there, isn't there? I wouldn't ask you to subject yourself to that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weisman? This is Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available You have a patient, Holly Evans, who was supposed to be admitted last night.
not_available Wait.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Did the driver get lost? John had something more pressing.
not_available It was trouble with a patient.
not_available Decent turnout.
not_available It'll do.
not_available Where's Gamma? 
not_available Lying down.
not_available Said she was tired.
not_available Where are you staying? 
not_available The Drake.
not_available The Ritz
not_available Carlton was booked.
not_available Did you think about staying here? Oh, there's Peter Harkins.
not_available I should say hello.
not_available Who's Peter Harkins? 
not_available He's handling the probate.
not_available I'm gonna check on Gamma.
not_available I did.
not_available She's fine.
not_available Still
not_available You want to help your grandmother, be a good host.
not_available Introduce yourself to Senator Herrero's daughter.
not_available Arthur.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, your friend is here.
not_available Holly got her bed.
not_available Yeah? Did Weisman come down? Yeah.
not_available A few minutes after you called.
not_available Amazing what a little "pull your thumb out" will do.
not_available Did you eat something? 
not_available No.
not_available I couldn't decide between the smoked tongue pâté and the whitefish mousse.
not_available We must have run out of the pigsinthe
not_available blanket.
not_available Well, somebody should really talk to your caterer.
not_available You're gonna have some dirty birds.
not_available Grandpa liked to drive the power lawn mower around.
not_available And he drove it into the birdbath? 
not_available Not on purpose.
not_available He was having a fatal Ml at the time.
not_available Oh, God! I'm sorry.
not_available You gotta die somehow.
not_available It's not a bad way to go.
not_available A sunny day out on the mower.

not_available All right.
not_available Get a surgical consult and x

not_available Hi, Adele.
not_available Hi.

not_available It's hard.
not_available Have you got up on crutches? 
not_available Yeah, with leg braces, yeah.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available Well, I'm trying.
not_available But I'm also realistic.
not_available Romano wanted me to go to Morbidity and Mortality as a showand

not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available Six weeks maternity leave, not enough.
not_available We have fluid in Morrison's pouch.
not_available Call O.R.
not_available Where? 
not_available There.
not_available It appears you're bleeding internally
not_available It could be ascites from cirrhosis.
not_available I can't assume that.
not_available What's his blood alcohol? 
not_available 315.
not_available When was your last drink, Mr.
not_available Skapinski? They took my last drink.
not_available He's hypotensive with a low crit.
not_available He could be septic from pneumonia.
not_available High risk for surgery.
not_available Even riskier if he bleeds out.
not_available Let's take a deep breath and do a peritoneal lavage.
not_available He's a surgical candidate.
not_available A homeless alcoholic with pneumonia.
not_available Therefore not worth saving? He's as healthy as he'll get.
not_available I'm trying to keep him that way.
not_available Surgery could kill him.
not_available Delaying surgery could kill him.
not_available Say he doesn't die on the table or in post
not_available op.
not_available You ship him back to his convenience
not_available store alley.
not_available But this time, instead of getting beaten up he gets eaten by dogs because he's too weak to move.
not_available Eaten by dogs? 
not_available It happens.
not_available In Chicago? 
not_available A lot.
not_available A cop told me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano needs to speak to you in his office immediately.
not_available Did he say why? 
not_available Something about the Fossen case.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available M&amp;Ms.;
not_available They serve their purpose in the practice of medicine, I guess.
not_available But they can be a pain in the ass.
not_available Needed something, Robert? I hear you're presenting this serial killer.
not_available Mass murderer? 
not_available Right, right.
not_available This Fossen guy.
not_available You don't want me to? 
not_available No.
not_available It's just that Legal flagged something.
not_available I wanted you to be prepared for the question.
not_available Sure.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available It's their job to be anal.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is it? Well, the nurse's notes show that you left the Trauma Room at 1625.
not_available And the codeblue notes from pre
not_available op began at 1642.
not_available Why'd it take you 17 minutes to transfer a patient up four floors? Well I
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, there's an incident in the ambulance bay.
not_available I'm in a meeting, Brenda.
not_available An ER patient jumped out a fourth
not_available floor window.
not_available That's great news, Brenda, thank you.
not_available Are they dead? I don't know.
not_available They're working on her.
not_available Keep the press away.
not_available No statements from anyone to anyone and get Risk Management down there.
not_available Why I wanted this job I will never know.
not_available All right, Greene, let's go.
not_available As you can see, I've got bigger fish to fry.
not_available Doors opened on the surgical floor.
not_available I was alone doing chest compressions, ran down the defib battery.
not_available Took time to get help transfer the patient to pre
not_available op.
not_available Okey
not_available doke.
not_available Brenda, get PR on the line.
not_available Is that it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't think anyone's gonna be crying over this guy.
not_available Do you? Autopsy revealed injuries to the spleen and superior mesenteric artery.
not_available Cause of 
death exsanguination from multiple vascular injuries.
not_available Why wasn't lidocaine given for stable V
not_available tach? I didn't have the ACLS drug box with me.
not_available When transferring a critical patient? The Trauma nurse ran out to get it, but then the doors closed unexpectedly.
not_available Leaving you alone with the patient? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I don't know if it would have changed the outcome.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Did you say the original dysrhythmia was stable V
not_available tach? Yes.
not_available He had a pulse? That's correct.
not_available So the patient was conscious? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I didn't realize that.
not_available Were you involved with this case, Dr.
not_available Corday? No.
not_available No.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available You cardioverted a patient without sedation? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Isn't that a little barbaric? Under the circumstances, it's what I felt I needed to do.
not_available Was there any delay in the O.R.
not_available accepting the patient? Dr.
not_available Greene? No.
not_available Did you know him? Who? 
not_available His grandfather.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I met him at that charity event.
not_available Charity event? Abby, where's my patient? Dr.
not_available Corday took him up to surgery.
not_available I thought you okayed it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So you're going? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Jenkins.
not_available Could you take this tube out? They wouldn't take this tube out.
not_available This is a coroner's case.
not_available I'm sorry, we have to wait.
not_available They flew us to Chicago and put us up in the Hilton gave me money to go shopping with.
not_available They even took me to a dentist.
not_available The producers said not to tell her until after the taping.
not_available That it would be more real if she didn't know what I was gonna say.
not_available It was a lie.
not_available It was all a lie.
not_available All that stuff about them having the same daddies I just said that to get them on the show.
not_available I used to say, "Alice, you must always tell the truth.
not_available " And she'd go, "Well, why, Mommy? " And I'd 
say "Because when you don't God gets very angry.
not_available " How is she? Catherine said she slept for three hours this afternoon.
not_available Has she fed? 
not_available Just now.
not_available How's our patient? Extubated in Recovery when I left.
not_available I repaired a little omental oozing.
not_available But it might have stopped on its own.
not_available It's hard to say.
not_available Judgment call.
not_available You do what you think is right, Mark.
not_available Elizabeth, in the elevator with Fossen
not_available I think we've talked enough about Fossen today, don't you? I'm going to bed.
not_available You coming? Just wait a few minutes.
not_available Make sure she's down.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available Night.
