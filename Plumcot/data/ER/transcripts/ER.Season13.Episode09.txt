not_available Look, the guy's had a pretty tough time.
not_available He's barely getting by.
not_available Okay, I realize that, but that's no excuse for messing with my family.
not_available If you want my opinion he's too busy trying to feed and clothe himself to mess with anyone, doc.

not_available No.
not_available Claustrophobic? Maybe you should just tell me about the patient? Eightyeightyear
not_available old female, anterior MI.

not_available And order up an extra red top if you can, just in case the blood bank needs it.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hey, Alex.
not_available Don't you have anything better to do than hang out with us on Thanksgiving? If he stayed home, he'd play video games all night.
not_available I figured I'd bring him in, make him do community service.
not_available Hey, that's cool, man.
not_available Handing out cookies to sick people? That's cool.
SAM Could be worse.
not_available You could be one of those sick people.
not_available Four pages in the last 20 minutes? What's the crisis, Dr.

not_available old girl.
not_available You're making this up.
not_available I wish I were.
not_available You sure it's not an excuse to keep me here? Please.
not_available I would never dream of wasting your time like that.
not_available But really, must you look so hot all the time? I mean, even with that ridiculous hat, I can't concentrate.

not_available They know she's having a heart attack.
not_available She's not breathing her blood pressure sucks and she's not perfusing her brain enough? 
not_available We can't move her.
not_available She's unstable.
RUSSO The family wants her out.
not_available She won't make the trip.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available If she survives the helicopter, she will die before the family makes it to County.
not_available What's your point? 
not_available Well She's 88 years old.
not_available She's not coming back from this.
not_available Don't you think dying here with her loved ones is better than dying alone in the ICU at County? Listen, doctor, our job is to scoop and run.
not_available The longer we stay and jaw about it, the more unstable this lady's gonna get.
not_available Know what? Just give me five minutes.
not_available I'm gonna make sure they understand.

not_available Mom makes it with bacon and almonds.
not_available Lands me in the hospital every Thanksgiving.
not_available It's worth it.
not_available Be right back with your medicine.
not_available Holidays weird me out.
not_available The special foods, little rituals.
not_available It's not my thing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available When I was a kid, Thanksgiving was an excuse to stay home and watch TV.
not_available I always figured when I grew up and had kids of my own I'd do the whole family thing, a big banquet, but well, here we are.
not_available Me and Alex, hanging out in the hospital.
not_available Didn't your parents demand you come home? No.
not_available My mom's in Trinidad with a new boyfriend.

not_available Any chance you could be wrong? 
not_available Well, yes.
not_available But based on my experience 
not_available Well, which is it? You tell us she won't survive the trip, now you say you might be wrong.

not_available She's gonna die.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available I'm doing my best to facilitate a good death.
not_available It's not your job.
not_available Not your call.
not_available Here's how it works.
not_available The referring hospital refers the accepting hospital accepts.
not_available We're the delivery men.
not_available Delivery people.
not_available You're denying the responsibility that comes with your job.
not_available I'm not the one who's in denial.
not_available Good death? No such thing.
not_available If you think you can make this a good experience for that family you're more arrogant than I thought.
not_available Mom, if you can hear me, we'll see you in Chicago, okay?

not_available Wife even baked the bread.
not_available We got a patient here.
not_available She's fine.
not_available You know, I feel sorry for your old man.
