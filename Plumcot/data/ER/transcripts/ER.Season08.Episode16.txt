not_available No.
not_available I'll settle for someone who isn't hung up on somebody else.
not_available I'm not going home.
not_available I am taking you home right now or I'm ratting you out to Weaver.
not_available What'll it be? Are you moving?

not_available It was great.
not_available You should have let me take the couch.
not_available It's not very comfortable.
not_available No, it was.
not_available It was.
not_available It was fine, really.
not_available Were you cold? I should have turned up the heat.
not_available I'm starting some coffee.
not_available Right.
not_available That Turkish mud that you like.
not_available It'll get you going.
not_available It'll eat a hole in your stomach lining.
not_available It's all right if? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can use the bathroom.
not_available I was just going to take a shower.

not_available I'm up.

not_available We were gonna catch the 7:30 yoga, right? Oh, I forgot.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're out early.
not_available I was over at Mark's.
not_available Mark Greene? 
not_available He's having some trouble.
not_available I spent the night.
not_available On the couch.
not_available Come on up.
not_available I'll take a shower, and then we'll go, okay? Are you coming? He's a friend.
not_available A good friend, I guess.
not_available Oh, would you drop it? Lonely too, with Elizabeth moving out.
not_available Nothing happened! Were you gonna tell me that you went over there? I hadn't thought about it.
not_available Something you don't want me to know.
not_available Something you don't wanna tell me.
not_available This petty, sarcastic side of you is not appealing.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available You'd be cool if I spent the night over at Abby's? Not Abby's.
not_available I was gonna say Darla's.
not_available Darla? Who the hell is Darla? 
not_available Radiology.
not_available The one with the collagen lips and the fake? They're not fake, are they? 
not_available You were going to say Abby.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available Yes, you were.
not_available So now you can read my mind? Well, it's not much of a challenge.
not_available But if you were at Abby's, I'd kill you.
not_available That's a double standard.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I'm not attracted to him.
not_available You are attracted to Abby.
not_available You were attracted to Mark.
not_available He was attracted to me.
not_available Thanks for not denying you're attracted to Abby.
not_available How'd this become about me? You spent the night at an old boyfriend's house.
not_available He's not my old boyfriend.
not_available He's like an older brother.
not_available And I don't want to sleep with him.
not_available I don't want to sleep with Abby.
not_available Susan, John, take this one.
not_available Got a head injury on a vent I'm not on for 10 minutes.
not_available Tell me this is an easy one.
not_available Cruella De Vil here had this guy trussed up in some sort of love swing 
not_available suspended from the ceiling.
not_available The guy swore to me he weighed 275.
not_available The torture swing is guaranteed to 350 pounds.
not_available He pulled the screws out of my ceiling! He's 450 pounds.
not_available Grab on.
not_available I ruptured a disc getting him.
not_available Gallant, get over here.
not_available Just when you think you've seen it all.
not_available It hurts! 
not_available What's he trying to say? He said, "It hurts.
not_available " Why is the mask still on? 
not_available Refused to take it off.
not_available buttocks.
not_available Pelvic pain, can't walk.
not_available BP's 160/95, pulse, 110.
not_available What's your name, sir? No! No name! Do you know where you are? A hospital? Frank, what's open? 
not_available Trauma 1.
not_available Everything he's wearing is mine.
not_available You cut it, you buy it.
not_available Hey, Malik, Abby.
not_available You guys free? CBC, dip a urine, portable chest, pelvis.
not_available What is that? 
not_available A tail.
not_available Careful.
not_available It's attached.
not_available Pure horsehair.
not_available That's mine too.
not_available Check his chest.
not_available I need you to take your hood off, sir.
not_available No! 
not_available I need to check your eyes and ears.
not_available Use the little flaps.
not_available All right.
not_available Any pain here, sir? 
not_available No.
not_available Sinus tach.
not_available How about in here? 
not_available Okay.
not_available No hemotympanum.

not_available Chest is clear.
not_available No rhonchi.
not_available Knees up.
not_available Buck up, wimp! Am I paralyzed? 
not_available No.
not_available You probably bruised your butt.
not_available We'll take some x
not_available rays to make sure.
not_available Take your outfit off.
not_available The zippers screw up the x
not_available ray.
not_available Can I keep my hood? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What's going on in here? Titrate 10 of morphine.
not_available Careful.
not_available Is that a tail? Pure horsehair.
not_available It's attached.
not_available Is your hand all right? 
not_available Fatso fell on me.
not_available That's dislocated.
not_available I should get an x
not_available ray of this before I try and reduce it.
not_available I'm not leaving.
not_available He's got $2000 worth of my stuff.
not_available I can do it here.
not_available It's gonna hurt.
not_available You'll have to wear a splint for six weeks.
not_available Can I wear it over my glove? You can file for workmen's comp.
not_available It's a job
not_available related injury.
not_available Sure.
not_available It'll fit over your glove.
not_available Then do it.
not_available This is really gonna hurt.
not_available All right.
not_available Here we go.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available All yours.
not_available What about my hood? Go with him.
not_available We'll x
not_available ray that finger, make sure there's no fracture.
not_available Malik, hand series.
not_available Show's over, people.
not_available Go back to work.
not_available So what was the tail attached to? 
not_available Believe me, you don't wanna know.
not_available We should have sold tickets.
not_available Hey, what's this? 
not_available I think it's hers.
not_available The mistress of pain? After all that bitching about her stuff, she left her bag here? What's she have in this thing? 
not_available I don't wanna know.
not_available I do.
not_available I'll take it to her.
not_available Take a look first.
not_available No, let's just take a peek.
not_available No.
not_available Not particularly.
not_available You guys are boring.
not_available Hey, you need me anymore, Dr.
not_available Carter? Oh, my God! Nobody could ever actually use that, could they? What is that? Is that a? 
not_available Yeah, I think so.
not_available What? Come on, guys.
not_available This is a patient's personal property.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available No kidding.
not_available What's this? What's this for? 
not_available That is disgusting.
not_available That is disgusting.
not_available Gallant, catch.
not_available No! What is that big purple thing? Oh, no! Oh, my God! Is that an on/off switch? That does not occur in nature.
not_available This is scary.
not_available Oh, Carter? Come on.
not_available Try it on.
not_available Get away from me with that.
not_available No.
not_available I promise I won't tighten the strap.
not_available What do you think? Should I quit my day job? Dr.
not_available KovacDo you have any idea what kind of financial liability you could've opened this hospital up to? What if I'd been a patient who just happened to walk in? 
not_available Kerry, we were just blowing off steam.
not_available Yeah? Well, do it on your own time! And with a medical student in the room? What were you thinking? Were you thinking at all? Who does this belong to? Did someone bring this thing into the workplace? I think that we're all aware that our behavior was inappropriate.
not_available Inappropriate, unprofessional, offensive.
not_available Who does this belong to? A patient.
not_available A patient.
not_available We treated her for a dislocated finger.
not_available But she left her bag.
not_available So you decided it would be fun to pilfer through a patient's belongings? Dr.
not_available Kovac, you're a Senior Attending.
not_available Do you have anything to say for yourself? Dr.
not_available Lewis? Abby? 
not_available We're all sorry.
not_available Damn right you're sorry.
not_available I'll contact Human Resources, try to get them not to convene a hearing which this department can ill afford right now.
not_available I'm putting you all on notice.
not_available I will not tolerate another episode of inappropriate behavior from anyone.
not_available Is that clear? Is that clear? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Get this thing back to its rightful owner.
not_available And let's hope she doesn't notice her belongings have been disturbed.
not_available Thanks a lot, girls.
not_available For what? I asked you not to touch that bag.
not_available You could've left.
not_available No one was keeping you here.
not_available Carter's right.
not_available We didn't want to open it.
not_available You two did.
not_available I wonder what she's saying to him in there.
not_available Well, we should have told her that Gallant wasn't involved.
not_available You should have told her that Luka and I weren't involved.
not_available Were you that kid in elementary school who always told? You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm great.
not_available She moved out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's the rumor.
not_available No rumor.
not_available Shirley told me.
not_available How would Shirley know? She changed her number on the surgical emergency
not_available contact sheet.
not_available Over what happened with their girl? 
not_available That is so sad.
not_available Did she move all her stuff out? They weren't right for each other.
not_available She's too much woman for him.
not_available Hey! If you ladies are done with the stitch and bitch, can I work? I'm surprised it lasted this long.
not_available Poor Mark.
not_available It's really too bad.
not_available Has Psych been down to see the woman in 6? Barker? No.
not_available She tried to bite one of the Salvadorian sisters from Housekeeping.
not_available Chandra from Human Resources called, said she'd be upstairs for an hour.
not_available Tell Dr.
not_available Kovac I'll be upstairs.
not_available He can page me.
not_available Kerry, can I talk to you about what happened this morning? I'm heading up to Human Resources right now.
not_available Well, I think it's only right to tell you that I was really the instigator.
not_available Carter, Gallant, Kovac, they were all opposed to me opening that bag.
not_available What about Abby? It was me.
not_available If there's gonna be any disciplinary consequences 
not_available I should be the one held responsible.
not_available I appreciate you coming forward.
not_available But they're adults.
not_available They could've chose to leave the room or not participate.
not_available I mean, when I entered, it was clear that everyone present was involved.
not_available Anything else? No, that's it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you know where Room 224 is? 
not_available End of the hall, on your left.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I thought I was late.
not_available You are late.
not_available Does anyone know how long this is supposed to last? All day, I think.
not_available What are they gonna do, show us videos? Sexual
not_available harassment videos.
not_available Role
not_available playing and long lectures is what I heard.
not_available Role
not_available playing? Acting out inappropriate behavior.
not_available You two should excel at that.
not_available Would you drop it? No.
not_available I won't drop it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, at least I'm not the one who put that thing in her locker.
not_available Right.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Don't look at me.
not_available Luka? But you should have seen her face.
not_available God, I wish I'd had a camera! This isn't funny.
not_available Sure, it is.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available This is gonna be a very long day.
not_available I think that's Whitman.
not_available What? Well, somebody erased most of it.
not_available But To be surrounded by beautiful Curious, breathing, laughing 
not_available That's " I Sing the Body Electric.
not_available " 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I know that one.
not_available You know Whitman? 
not_available Don't sound so surprised.
not_available No.
not_available Just most people don't.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, Fame.
not_available You know, the movie.
not_available It was in that.
not_available Please! I love Fame.
not_available I've seen it, like, 30 times.
not_available I wanted to be Coco.
not_available How long are we gonna wait? This thing was supposed to start at 8:00.
not_available Probably got held up by the snow.
not_available We all got here.
not_available I say we go.
not_available I say we wait.
not_available He speaks? So what if he's late? We were told to report to Room 224 at 0800.
not_available I'm here.
not_available And I'm gonna stay here until someone in charge tells me otherwise.
not_available And I suggest you all do the same.
not_available At ease.
not_available It's the Army, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Yeah? I don't think anybody will court
not_available martial you because the guy didn't show up.
not_available Gallant's right.
not_available We should wait.
not_available I don't want to have to come here again next Saturday.
not_available Abby! Please! We're in a public building.
not_available I know.
not_available Nobody's here.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Maybe this is the punishment.
not_available Sitting in this room.
not_available Maybe they're watching us to see how we all respond.
not_available Like a test? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hidden cameras recording us for research or something.
not_available Watching to see how we react to the stress.
not_available How alliances grow.
not_available How our social structures break down under pressure.
not_available Like on Survivor.
not_available You watch Survivor? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's a great show.
not_available All the backbiting and the lying.
not_available It's human nature at its most venal.
not_available Reality TV, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
not_available Have you ever watched it? 
not_available No.
not_available Then shut up.
not_available I have a confession to make.
not_available You put the dildo in Weaver's locker? 
not_available I watch Fear Factor.
not_available Oh, my God! I love that show.
not_available Did you see the last one, where they were bobbing for apples with the? And the snakes were climbing into their hair and their mouths! I thought that television was just a vast wasteland.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I meant to watch La Bohème on PBS last night but I had to go to the symphony.
not_available I watch television.
not_available Just not that dehumanizing crap.
not_available I mean, seriously, what's next? Televised executions, bearbaiting, Torture Channel? What is your problem today? What are you so pissy about? You know what my problem is.
not_available You are kidding me.
not_available Still? What? You are still mad about that? 
not_available You know what? Grow up.
not_available What? Oh, come on.
not_available Say it.
not_available I spent the night at Mark's the night before last, and he won't let it go.
not_available I slept on the sofa.
not_available I was on the couch.
not_available He thinks I slept with Mark.
not_available Don't talk about this here.
not_available Years ago he had a crush on me.
not_available Now we're friends.
not_available More than I'll be able to say about us if you keep it up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available A harmless night spent in a recently single man's apartment who's still desperately in love with you! 
not_available Mark is not in love with me.
not_available Who's recently single? 
not_available Greene.
not_available Corday left him.
not_available When? 
not_available Couple weeks ago.
not_available Where was I? It was an emergency.
not_available I wouldn't have gone over if he didn't really need me.
not_available Well, if he really needed you.
not_available He's a friend.
not_available I helped him out.
not_available I'm sure you did.
not_available Not discussing this with you anymore.
not_available What kind of emergency? 
not_available None of your damn business! Are they getting a divorce? I don't think so.
not_available You know, when you find out why I was over there 
not_available you are going to feel very small.
not_available So tell me.
not_available Very, very small.
not_available So tell me! Abby's been sleeping on my couch.
not_available Nothing's happened.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I needed a place to stay until I found a new apartment.
not_available And Luka said I could stay with him.
not_available You're more upset about that than my staying at Mark's.
not_available What? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Carter's still stuck on you.
not_available All right.
not_available Can we change the subject, please? Now you wanna change the subject.
not_available How about them Bears, huh? What? Football? I don't watch American football.
not_available Well, they need to beef up their defense.
not_available But I think they'll be real contenders next year.
not_available I watch basketball.
not_available Let's talk about the Bulls.
not_available The Bulls stink.
not_available How long were you in the Army, Gallant? I'm still in the Army.
not_available Reserves.
not_available They're paying for my med school.
not_available So they can call you up at any time? Yeah, they can.
not_available I don't think they will.
not_available Not yet.
not_available You're not worried? 
not_available I'd be fine if they did.
not_available With everything that's going on? I wish they would give me a gun, put me someplace where I could use it.
not_available I'm ready to go if my country needs me.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Luka was in the army.
not_available Right? 
not_available Yeah? All Croatian men are required to serve in the military.
not_available My brother Eric's in the Air Force.
not_available He's in Saudi Arabia.
not_available He a pilot? 
not_available No.
not_available He's an air
not_available traffic controller.
not_available I worry anyway.
not_available My brother Gavin's in the Air Force.
not_available Munitions specialist.
not_available Is he overseas? 
not_available No, Texas.
not_available But he thinks they're going.
not_available My younger brother Frank is in the Marines at Pendleton.
not_available My sister Carol's on the Carl Vinson.
not_available How many siblings do you have? 
not_available Six.
not_available All in the service? 
not_available Everybody who's old enough.
not_available Steve, he's only 14.
not_available Patriotic bunch.
not_available It's the family business.
not_available My father's got 26 years in as an NCO.
not_available That's only five.
not_available You only named five kids.
not_available You said there were six in your family.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My twin sister, Susan.
not_available She's the black sheep.
not_available Teaches Head Start in D.C.
not_available That's disgraceful.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We hide it when company comes.
not_available How did she stay out of the military? Sounds like a prerequisite in your family.
not_available She has cerebral palsy.
not_available What does your dad do, Dr.
not_available Lewis? My dad? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's a test pilot for Barcalounger.
not_available He sits all day in front of the TV trying to get his cholesterol level over 400.
not_available Is he succeeding? 
not_available He's dedicated.
not_available He'll get there or die trying.
not_available What does your dad do, Dr.
not_available Kovac? My father is a painter.
not_available Not houses, art.
not_available Abstracts mostly.
not_available He's good.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available I mean, not that he's ever made a living at it.
not_available He's a train conductor in Zagreb.
not_available So that pays the bills.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available You never asked.
not_available Abby? Oh, I have absolutely no idea what my father is doing.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? What? 
not_available What does your dad do? Spends the family trust fund.
not_available He manages several of my family's investment funds.
not_available Sits on some corporate boards.
not_available Family investment funds? Carter's loaded.
not_available Really? How loaded? 
not_available Think Bill Gates.
not_available Not that rich.
not_available Okay.
not_available Paul Allen, then.
not_available How much are you worth, Carter? Me, personally? Almost nothing.
not_available Okay.
not_available Your family, then.
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Guess.
not_available I don't know.
not_available A lot.
not_available Fifty million? A hundred million? Two hundred million? Five hundred million? 
not_available Honestly, I don't know.
not_available Oh, my God! I knew you were rich.
not_available I didn't know you were that rich.
not_available Gamma's money.
not_available How old are you, 30? Thirty
not_available one.
not_available How did you last this long without some girl marrying you? We come with a builtin gold
not_available digger alarm.
not_available Gamma installs them at birth.
not_available And I haven't set it off? You better have that thing checked.
not_available It's embarrassing.
not_available Everybody assumes when you grow up with money, everything's great.
not_available Must be hard growing up in a mansion.
not_available Was Gamma too cheap to heat the pool? 
not_available Money isn't everything, Susan.
not_available That's easy for you to say.
not_available We never had much.
not_available You know, always struggled, but we were happy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Same here.
not_available I never knew we didn't have money.
not_available I always had everything I needed.
not_available Presents at Christmas, clothing, food.
not_available Seven hundred million.
not_available Hey, I didn't ask to be born into this.
not_available Is this the sexualharassment group? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Taylor called.
not_available He is coming.
not_available He's having car trouble.
not_available He asks you to wait.
not_available He'll be here as soon as he can.
not_available Great.
not_available I wonder what's in there.
not_available What are you doing? This worked in college when I locked myself out of my dorm room.
not_available They didn't have much.
not_available Candy and sodas.
not_available No coffee.
not_available Anybody want the root beer? 
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Peanut
not_available butter crackers.
not_available I love those.
not_available Want to share them? Sure.
not_available What's he doing? 
not_available Breaking and entering.
not_available Why? What's that play? 
not_available What play? The one with two clowns who wait for that guy who never shows up? Waiting for Godot? Yeah.
not_available I saw that at the Goodman years ago.
not_available I didn't get it.
not_available It's about the futility of life and human enterprise.
not_available You know, we're all waiting.
not_available For what? Fulfillment, love, validation, approval? It's a waste of time.
not_available Life is an empty, hollow exercise filled with pain, loss and grief.
not_available The only thing we can expect to achieve in our lives is our own inevitable death.
not_available That is the most depressing thing I've ever heard.
not_available Glad you didn't grow up in the Balkans? Croatia is beautiful.
not_available Zagreb, Dubrovnik.
not_available You should go.
not_available Kind of a high chance of getting blown up, though.
not_available Always discourages me from adding a country to my travel itinerary.
not_available It's very safe now.
not_available Then why are you here? Barbecue.
not_available You just can't find good ribs in Zagreb, you know? Not to mention spoon bread and sweet
not_available potato pie.
not_available Carson's.
not_available Exactly.
not_available So how did you get into Weaver's locker, Luka? It was locked.
not_available Oh, it wasn't me.
not_available No, I wish I thought of it.
not_available I really do.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available Gallant? Clever.
not_available Very clever to accuse the rest of us to throw suspicion away from yourself.
not_available You still haven't said you didn't do it.
not_available Whitman was writing about slavery.
not_available He was an abolitionist.
not_available The poem, "Body Electric." I minored in English lit at Howard.
not_available Oh, yeah? I was English lit.
not_available Where? 
not_available Penn State.
not_available Really? You went to Penn State? Yes.
not_available Did you assume I went to community college because I'm a nurse? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't mean that.
not_available I think you did mean it.
not_available You did it before, about the poem.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all of you, all doctors.
not_available You all think you're smarter than nurses because you have an MD.
not_available Don't drag me into this, okay? 
not_available I don't assume that.
not_available You're still a med student.
not_available You'll learn to become condescending.
not_available It's a test you take before you graduate.
not_available I got an A.
not_available You got an A plus.
not_available Does anybody have a penknife? 
not_available That's not true of all doctors.
not_available Sure it is.
not_available It's a class thing.
not_available It's part of the educational caste system we have in this country.
not_available Karl Marx went out of fashion with black leather trench coats 
not_available and the collapse of central planning.
not_available You look down on Gallant's family because they're military.
not_available Like it's vaguely pathetic to volunteer to defend our liberties with their lives for crappy pay.
not_available Yeah, that's true.
not_available I don't feel that way.
not_available Really? I quit med school halfway through my third year.
not_available I was second in my class when I quit.
not_available Second? I didn't know that.
not_available Why did you quit? 
not_available That's what I mean.
not_available You can't imagine why anybody wouldn't want to be you.
not_available They tossed you out because your ex
not_available husband didn't pay your tuition.
not_available Yeah, but I chose not to go back.
not_available Halfway through your third year? Why not finish? You finished the hard part.
not_available It was starting to get fun.
not_available Because I realized I was proud of what I do.
not_available I make a difference in patients' lives.
not_available But you can do more as a doctor.
not_available No.
not_available See, that's where you're wrong.
not_available I would be doing less as a doctor.
not_available You guys don't get to spend any time with your patients.
not_available How many do you see a day, 30, 40? You don't get to hold a little kid's hand or teach a new mother how to nurse.
not_available How many patients do you see in a day? Ten, maybe 12.
not_available And I'm not running around all day trying to clear the board.
not_available I made a choice.
not_available You can't understand because it's not one you would choose.
not_available I can't believe you won't let me smoke this! I got it! 
not_available Great.
not_available Now we're felons.
not_available Oh, cool.
not_available What? There's a bunch of fencing gear in here.
not_available I used to fence in school.
not_available Of course you did.
not_available I fence.
not_available Fencing? Are you gonna eat this cracker? 
not_available No.
not_available You really only see 10 patients a day? I learned when I was acting.
not_available When were you an actor? 
not_available In college.
not_available I should warn you.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Okay.
not_available En garde.
not_available They really say that? That's a nice parry.
not_available You think they're trying to impress us? 
not_available If they are, it's not working.
not_available Doesn't that hurt? They really are a couple of freaks.
not_available To think, you slept with both of them.
not_available I never slept with Carter.
not_available Did he tell you that? 
not_available I thought you had.
not_available No.
not_available That was a rumor Carter started.
not_available Oh, God! He is low.
not_available I thought so.
not_available I haven't slept with Carter either.
not_available How long you guys been going out? 
not_available A couple months.
not_available Well, that definitely violates the second
not_available date rule.
not_available What rule? 
not_available My friend has this theory.
not_available You should sleep with a guy by the second date.
not_available If it's not good you shouldn't waste time with someone you don't have chemistry with.
not_available I don't know if we have chemistry or not.
not_available There have been some almost "spark" moments.
not_available I think it's either there or it's not.
not_available You can't force it.
not_available Believe me, I've tried.
not_available Part of the problem with us is you.
not_available He denies it but he's not convincing.
not_available Why didn't you two happen? Timing.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you're hurt, we should stop.
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available This is not going to end well.
not_available Hey, aren't you guys tired yet? Hey! Hey! Oh, my God! Carter! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter! Knock it off! 
not_available Cut it out, Carter.
not_available All right! You maniac! You started it! Look at this! Look at this! 
not_available You went for my face.
not_available After you hacked at my side! I always thought fencing was a finesse sport.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Okay, let me see.
not_available Don't be a baby.
not_available Crazy bastard.
not_available He was trying to kill me.
not_available It looked like it was mutual.
not_available Am I gonna need stitches? No, you barely need a Band
not_available Aid.
not_available I didn't know you had a temper.
not_available I can ask Abby to come over here and check you out if you'd prefer.
not_available What? That man is a menace.
not_available That and I could have lost my eye.
not_available What was that for? 
not_available Just checking.
not_available For what? Second
not_available date rule.
not_available What? What? How did you get Weaver's combination? Michael? Sneak a look over her shoulder when she wasn't looking? When she was opening it? It is Michael? Yeah.
not_available Michael.
not_available You knew the combination, so you snuck in the lounge when no one was looking.
not_available And you put it in there.
not_available Why would I do that? She said something that pissed you off so much you wanted revenge.
not_available The quiet ones are always the most dangerous.
not_available I'm a student.
not_available I could get expelled.
not_available Still waters run deep.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available Where were you living before? Scottsdale, Arizona.
not_available Land of sun.
not_available And you decided to move back to Chicago? I don't know.
not_available The desert, 120 degrees in the shade, never a cloud in the sky.
not_available Kind of depressed me.
not_available I needed to be back where the sun doesn't come out for weeks! Bitter cold and overcast skies better suit my temperament.
not_available But mostly I was running away.
not_available From what? 
not_available A guy.
not_available What else? 
not_available Chemistry? A tanker truck full.
not_available Too much.
not_available What was his name? 
not_available Charlie Dixon.
not_available Dix.
not_available He's a cowboy.
not_available Can you believe it? An honestto
not_available God cowboy.
not_available He has the horse, the pickup truck, the whole deal.
not_available I'm a walking cliché.
not_available Was he cute? What happened? It's complicated.
not_available I'd rather not talk about it if you don't mind.
not_available Cowboy.
not_available So you were in the army.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You see some action? 
not_available Okay, sorry.
not_available It's not what you think it is.
not_available Well, what do you think I think it is? Noble.
not_available Romantic.
not_available A crucible in which to test your young manhood.
not_available No, I'm not that naive.
not_available Sure you are.
not_available Luka, how old were you when you became a man? What? 
not_available When you lost your virginity.
not_available How old were you? 
not_available We're playing a game.
not_available How old? 
not_available I don't want to play.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available We made a bet which one of the five of us lost their virginity first.
not_available Who'd you pick? 
not_available Not telling.
not_available I picked Kovac.
not_available No, she didn't.
not_available Luka? 
not_available I don't want to play.
not_available I told you they wouldn't want to play.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll go first.
not_available I was 16.
not_available Howie Thomas.
not_available He was on the lacrosse team.
not_available What's wrong with? What? Howie? 
not_available What's wrong with that? He sounds like a plumber or something.
not_available I was terrified.
not_available So was he.
not_available It was the longest Twenty seconds? 
not_available Yeah, if you count the foreplay.
not_available Okay.
not_available My turn.
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available No! I'm just kidding.
not_available Just kidding, Carter.
not_available Floyd Walker.
not_available I was 15.
not_available Floyd? And you gave me a hard time about Howie.
not_available In the shed behind his father's radiator
not_available repair shop.
not_available Very romantic.
not_available The smell of antifreeze still turns me on.
not_available Gallant? You don't need their approval.
not_available Come on, give it up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tanya McBride, in the balcony of our church after choir practice.
not_available Wow! Your church? 
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available How old? Let's see, I was in ninth grade, so I was about 14.
not_available All right.
not_available We have a new leader.
not_available Carter? Come on.
not_available Oh, my God! You're still a virgin! 
not_available I was 11.
not_available Eleven years old? Really? How old was she? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available 25.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available Oh, my God! She was one of the maids.
not_available Did you pay her? 
not_available My parents did.
not_available To have sex with you? To be a maid.
not_available I hope you gave her a hell of a Christmas bonus.
not_available All right.
not_available Luka, 11.
not_available It's going to be very tough to beat.
not_available Don't say how old.
not_available Confirm you were older than 11 and Carter wins the prize.
not_available I get a prize? 
not_available Don't let your imagination run away.
not_available My wedding night.
not_available I lost my virginity on my wedding night.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's a good memory.
not_available I hadn't thought about that in years.
not_available We were very young and she was religious, so we waited.
not_available We loved each other very much.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What were you in? You said you were an actor in college.
not_available What plays were you in? We did Hamlet.
not_available I did Hamlet.
not_available I played Horatio.
not_available Who did you play, Luka? 
not_available Hamlet.
not_available In English or Croatian? Why would I do it in English? Were you any good? My mom thought so.
not_available Do you remember any of it? No, it's been a long time.
not_available I think I remember some of it.
not_available To be or not to be, that is the question.
not_available Whether 'tis nobler in the mind's eye to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them.
not_available That's the easy part.
not_available To die, to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks I don't remember the rest of it.
not_available To die, to sleep to sleep perchance to dream.
not_available Ay, there's the rub.
not_available Be all my sins remember'd.
not_available Sorry I'm so damn late.
not_available I spent half an hour digging my car out, and then the battery was dead.
not_available I appreciate you waiting for me.
not_available I didn't expect anyone to still be here.
not_available I'm John Taylor.
not_available Please, would everybody move down front? I won't have to yell.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available I won't bite.
not_available Raise your hand when I call your name, if you would.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Here.
not_available Michael Gallant? 
not_available Gallant.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Luka Oh, boy.
not_available Help me out.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Susan Lewis.
not_available And that leaves Abigail Lockhart? 
not_available Abby.
not_available So let's begin by reviewing current state and federal law for what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior in the workplace.
not_available Hey, it stopped snowing.
not_available It's about time.
not_available Anybody need a ride? I got my car.
not_available I'm on in 20 minutes.
not_available You're working tonight? Yeah? Me too.
not_available Well, that was fun.
not_available Let's try to never do it again.
not_available You want me to give you a lift to the hospital? It's a few blocks.
not_available Gallant will walk me.
not_available Sure.
not_available You have your keys? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll try not to wake you.
not_available See you guys later.
not_available I had fun talking.
not_available We should have coffee sometime.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'd love that.
not_available Ready? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Good night.
not_available Night.
not_available She's pretty great.
not_available Who? Abby.
not_available I didn't know her before.
not_available I didn't think I'd like her, but I do.
not_available You want to get something to eat? I'm starving.
not_available You know, you really made a fool of yourself today.
not_available What? 
not_available If you're worried about Abby living with Luka, don't be.
not_available Nothing's going on.
not_available How did I make a fool out of myself? 
not_available Well, you participated in a duel for one thing.
not_available Kiss me.
not_available Just kiss me.
not_available Was it there for you? 
not_available It was nice.
not_available It wasn't there for me either.
not_available Okay, go before I change my mind.
not_available You sure? I regret it already.
not_available That gold
not_available digger alarm should be clanging like a school bell.
not_available This isn't because Mark Greene suddenly became available? Know when I said you were making a fool of yourself? You're doing it again.
not_available You should tell her.
not_available Who? Tell her what? 
not_available That you're in love with her and can't live a moment without her.
not_available Really? You're hopeless.
not_available You'll figure it out.
not_available Friends? No, I hate you.
not_available Hey.
not_available I used to have Weaver's locker.
not_available She never changed the combination.
not_available It was you!
