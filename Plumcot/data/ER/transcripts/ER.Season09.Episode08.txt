not_available But I didn't know what to do.
not_available Then the MPs came and arrested him.
not_available Actually, I got him arrested.
not_available Abby, don't start.
not_available This is not your fault.
not_available No.
not_available I needed to know.
not_available I had to know, so I called here and I got his medical records and they had misdiagnosed a depression in May.
not_available They thought it was stress, which is why he was transferred here.

not_available He's taking the meds.
not_available Not by choice.
not_available That could take some time.
not_available He's emotionally exhausted.
not_available And he's ashamed.
not_available Try not to be confrontational.
not_available I've got this down.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hi.
not_available Were you expecting a straitjacket? No.
not_available You look nice.
not_available Fashion's key at a court martial.
not_available It's not really a court martial, right? It's a Rule 70
not_available I know what it is, Abby.
not_available You wanted out anyway, right? Yeah.
not_available It's all a ploy.
not_available You know I love you, right? You know that.
not_available I was worried about you because I love you.
not_available And you think I'm crazy? 
not_available No, not crazy.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Sick.
not_available Mentally unstable.
not_available Suddenly plagued by a psychiatric illness.
not_available Truth is I was having a pretty good time.
not_available I want you to come back to Chicago with me.
not_available That sounds like a lot of fun.
not_available Maybe you could call the MPs again.
not_available Eric, you've seen this.
not_available You know if you don't stay medicated, it can get bad.
not_available I mean, bad.
not_available You could end up wasting
not_available Abby, she's right here.
not_available I know she is.
not_available It's not a secret.
not_available She knows it.
not_available She'll tell you.
not_available She will tell you.
not_available Mom, tell him.
not_available Tell him, Mom! Mom, tell him.
not_available I'll be in the waiting room.
not_available What the hell, Abby? Yeah, what the hell? You called her? You didn't
not_available ? It took me three days to find you.
not_available I talked my way in here.
not_available I didn't ask you to.
not_available But you called her? The most unreliable, undependable person in our lives? 
not_available And you' re dependable.
not_available Yeah.
not_available To you, I am.
not_available Yes.
not_available Then I'm sorry.
not_available I have to apologize to poor Abby.
not_available Poor, poor Abby.
not_available My career is over, but she doesn't get to be the savior again.
not_available You need help.
not_available Mom screwed up the first time you went to her.
not_available One, I don't need help.
not_available And two, I didn't go to her.
not_available She thought she saw something.
not_available She dragged me to her doctor.
not_available I went to make her happy, and her doctor proved her wrong.
not_available She wasn't wrong.
not_available Then why am I not allowed to call her? Better get going, sergeant.
not_available Hey, make sure you check my knee too.
not_available It's killing me.
not_available I hit it on the steering column.
not_available Did you hear me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then get me something for the pain, brother.
not_available All the alcohol wasn't enough, brother? 
not_available I only had one beer.
not_available This the driver? Right
not_available side tenderness.
not_available The ultrasound looks clear.
not_available Hey, what's your problem, man? You got Tourette's or something? Did you do it? 
not_available Ask me in six hours.
not_available The transplant team's working.
not_available Did you talk to the father? Large seat
not_available belt contusion.
not_available Safety first.
not_available They let you be a doctor like this? Only on the patients they don't care about.
not_available Hey, did you just dis me, man? I think he just dissed me.
not_available Do you know what you did? Do you have any idea? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I banged up my knee.
not_available You killed a whole family! A mother, her two kids! 
not_available No.
not_available I hit a snowman.
not_available They were making a snowman, you jerk! Perhaps you should help out with another patient.
not_available You have to give him time, Abby.
not_available Oh, now you speak? Now you have an opinion? He can't feel we' re ganging up on him.
not_available Just don't push him.
not_available I didn't push him.
not_available You were already talking about going back to Chicago.
not_available They are discharging him, Mother.
not_available Where do you suggest we put him up, in a psychiatric hospital in Omaha? I'm not so sure he should be hospitalized.
not_available Well, that's not really your decision.
not_available Is it yours? You know, he only looks normal because he's on Depakote.
not_available And if you had seen him
not_available I know the pathology, sweetie.
not_available And, yes, the easy thing would probably be to try to commit him.
not_available Easy? But he's got to accept the disease, accommodate it.
not_available And until he does, he needs to be supervised or he will go off his meds.
not_available You always did.
not_available Well, he probably will at one time or another.
not_available But, Abby, trust me on this.
not_available It's like AA.
not_available It's got to be his decision.
not_available He's got to want it.
not_available And it's way too early for that.
not_available Mom I have been living with this disease my entire life.
not_available Please don't lecture me on it.
not_available I know you've been living with this your entire life 
not_available but you've never been inside it.
not_available What is that? What is that? " Inside it"? Like you two have some sort of special bond now? Because you' re both inside of it? 
not_available Abby, stop it.
not_available This is about Eric.
not_available You can't go back to the way you two were.
not_available There's no quick fix.
not_available Your brother will be struggling with this for the rest of his life.
not_available Abby.
not_available Has she been vomiting? 
not_available Twice this morning.
not_available She started to run a fever so I brought her in.
not_available Is anybody else sick at home? Her little brother had an earache a couple days ago, but he seems fine.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available God knows where they've been.
not_available Well, you can't take my blood alcohol.
not_available I don't give you permission.
not_available We don't need your permission.
not_available So you hungry at all, Kiley? 
not_available No.
not_available Any diarrhea, Mom? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What happened? It was an accident.
not_available I scared her more than anything else.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Did you hit the TM? He just jammed that thing in her ear.
not_available I don't think I really hurt her.
not_available Well, why is she crying? 
not_available Here.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available I'm going home.
not_available Come back here and finish the workup.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available We were able to get Matt stabilized on bypass.
not_available The transplant team's at work.
not_available Is there anybody you'd like me to call? When will you know? It's a delicate procedure, especially on children.
not_available There's a waiting room on the third floor.
not_available I can't seem to walk out of this room.
not_available What time is it? It's almost 5.
not_available I'd be getting home about now.
not_available Silvia would probably pick up a pizza or some Chinese because she got busy with the boys after school and didn't have time to cook.
not_available Toby would have a picture that he drew that he'd want me to look at.
not_available And Matt would want me to test him on his math.
not_available You made the right decision.
not_available The only one you could.
not_available We woke up this morning everything was white.
not_available They were so happy.
not_available We all got to stay home.
not_available It may not seem like it but I know what you' re feeling.
not_available I understand what you' re feeling.
not_available I'm sorry, doctor, but you You don't know what I'm feeling.
not_available You don't have any idea.
not_available I don't even know.
not_available My husband his name was Mark.
not_available He died
not_available My God, I was about to say last year.
not_available It was only six months ago.
not_available I tried to pretend once Mark was gone, that I could pull myself up, continue like normal.
not_available But it doesn't work like that.
not_available You see, you can't run away from it.
not_available It's like this big, relentless wave that you have to ride.
not_available But in riding it, somehow you hold on to what you've lost.
not_available And you find a way to go on without shutting off.
not_available It's not easy, but you do it.
not_available I know someday soon when you look into your child's eyes all you will see are the beautiful things that live on in him.
not_available He needs to be okay.
not_available I need him to be okay.
not_available He will be.
not_available He will be.
not_available Based on his testimony, they don't have enough information to conclude 
not_available that he was mentally incompetent.
not_available Why is he here? 
not_available He's demanding due process.
not_available He needs to stay medicated.
not_available I'll contact the convening authority to get him released from pre
not_available trial confinement.
not_available The door doesn't open from the inside.
not_available Pick up the phone when you' re finished.
not_available You requested a court martial? 
not_available No.
not_available That's what the lawyer says
not_available I was gone less than 30 days.
not_available The worst they'll do is discharge me, maybe a couple weeks' confinement.
not_available You don't have a couple of weeks.
not_available I haven't hurt anyone.
not_available I haven't broken any laws.
not_available I haven't acted irresponsibly.
not_available I just needed a change.
not_available You went AWOL.
not_available That's between me and them.
not_available They want me to say I'm crazy.
not_available I won't say it.
not_available Nobody's saying you' re crazy.
not_available You are.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Come on, Abby.
not_available You were there.
not_available You even tried to hide it from me.
not_available Mom was crazy.
not_available She was outofher
not_available mind crazy.
not_available And I'm not like that! I'm not her.
not_available You can say it all you want.
not_available I'm not her.
not_available Hey.
not_available Shirley, she said she saw you out here on her break almost an hour ago.
not_available You okay? No symptoms.
not_available It's perfect timing, huh? You need something? I owe it to you to give you this in person.
not_available Your evaluation.
not_available You' re not going to open it? Open it for what? There's no middle ground with you, is there? Blind optimism or self
not_available pity.
not_available It's just the truth.
not_available It's gonna cripple me.
not_available Just when I learn how to deal with another symptom, it progresses.
not_available What were you expecting? 
not_available Time.
not_available I expected time.
not_available Enough time to figure out a Time's gonna kick my ass.
not_available So, what, that's it? You' re just gonna give in? Isn't that what you wanted? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I wanted you to recognize your limitations.
not_available I thought you were trying to prove something.
not_available But you probably saved that little boy's life today.
not_available You connected with his father when he was completely lost.
not_available You guided him to make the right decision.
not_available Any idiot can suture a wound, put in a chest tube.
not_available But you have a gift, Mr.
not_available Nathan.
not_available The gift of a physician.
not_available Now it's up to you to decide if you want to share that gift.
not_available And then find a way.
not_available By the way, I keep my promises.
not_available I failed you.
not_available All they have is Diet Shasta.
not_available They still make this? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available They might ask you to testify, you know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mom, I need you to be with me on this.
not_available He can't stay in military jail.
not_available I'm with you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just scared for him and I'm angry.
not_available I'm angry at you for having to do this again.
not_available And you didn't do anything.
not_available No.
not_available You're angry at me for giving it to him.
not_available No, no.
not_available I didn't
not_available I know you feel like a mother to him.
not_available Why shouldn't you? You practically raised him.
not_available You have a right.
not_available But I'm his mother and I gave it to him.
not_available I gave it to my son.
not_available All I can do now is try to be his mother.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I gave his lawyer this number.
not_available I'm gonna try to find us a hotel room.
not_available This may take a few days.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, you turned on your cell phone.
not_available Hi.
not_available Well, did you find him? Yeah, I found him.
not_available They might court
not_available martial him, but I found him.
not_available Did you tell them that he's sick? They already knew.
not_available It's a long story.
not_available You still snowed in? 
not_available Oh, the city's a mess.
not_available How are you holding up? Do we have any spare monitors? For what? Fiber
not_available optic otoscope.
not_available Oh, try Trauma Hall.
not_available Good news.
not_available Your appendix appears normal.
not_available No swelling or inflammation.
not_available Can she get something to eat? 
not_available She's getting her appetite back.
not_available A good sign.
not_available What do you feel like eating, Kiley? 
not_available Pizza.
not_available Pizza.
not_available That sounds good.
not_available But you should have some soup until your tummy's settled.
not_available All right.
not_available CT's negative.
not_available She can go home.
not_available Drink some clear liquids, and come back tomorrow.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available I never finished checking Kiley's ear.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available We' re fine.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm not gonna hurt her.
not_available Can you help me? 
not_available Tell him we' re fine.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She's safe.
not_available I think I saw something, so I want you to hold the scope and put it in your ear very gently.
not_available You even get to watch it on TV.
not_available Me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You get to be the doctor.
not_available Is that my ear? 
not_available Actually, it's your eardrum.
not_available Gross.
not_available Use cotton swabs? 
not_available Yeah, every night.
not_available See, that's the problem.
not_available The cotton swab rubs the protective wax.
not_available It can cause an ear infection.
not_available And what can you do about that? 
not_available Well, I could give her some drops.
not_available It's better if she never sticks anything in her ear smaller than her elbow.
not_available My elbow? I can't fit my elbow.
not_available You can't? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Nathan, are you almost finished? 
not_available Yeah, almost.
not_available You' re needed upstairs.
not_available What is it? Field is dry.
not_available Anastomosis site's intact.
not_available You' re either gonna make me famous or get me arrested for cases like this.
not_available Dr.
not_available Nathan, Dr.
not_available Carmichael.
not_available I toil for eight hours, and you get the honors.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Over here.
not_available Cardioplegia solution is withdrawn.
not_available Okay.
not_available Shut it down.
not_available This is where you jump from the plane and hope you packed the chute correctly.
not_available Better grab those paddles.
not_available What? Paddles.
not_available We' re gonna need them.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available That's your cue.
not_available Clear.
not_available Heart rate, 70.
not_available And that, my friends, makes it all worthwhile.
not_available Start the epi.
not_available Take down the catheters.
not_available I guess his brother will always be with him.
