not_available What are you thinking? Excuse me? 
not_available A fresh trauma patient.
not_available What goes through your mind? The

not_available There's no room to turn around.
not_available The walls are pretty uneven so it's easy to brace yourself with your hands.
not_available Do any rock climbing? No, I haven't.

not_available I can't assess the right arm.
not_available It's pinned at his shoulder.
not_available If we could raise the concrete just another inch or two.
not_available No.
not_available Any movement could bring all this down.
not_available Just an inch, then we might free it.
not_available And I won't have to amputate.
not_available No! No, please don't cut off my arm.
not_available No.
not_available We're trying to save it, Leo.
not_available We're gonna lift up that slab.

not_available If there's any cause for concern, I'd rather go see my own doctor.
not_available Changes in your EKG suggest that you may have had a small heart attack.
not_available Heart attack? 
not_available We'll check a blood test to make sure there was no heart muscle damage.
not_available If that's normal, we'll do a treadmill heart scan.
not_available Would you call my doctor, Greg Fonarow? He's up on Chestnut.
not_available I want his opinion on what you're doing.
not_available I'll call him when I get the test results.
not_available Don't worry.

not_available Then you go get it.
not_available And leave you? Yes.
not_available They've gotta let you back down if I'm here.
not_available Now go! I'm not leaving him! But hurry! 
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available We're gonna die down here.

not_available She's altered.
not_available When did that start? I found her on the floor.
not_available She had a bowel movement with blood in it.
not_available I couldn't wake her up.
not_available Give her an ABG, a CBC, a chem 20 and a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Want an IV of saline? No, just a HEP block.
not_available She's gonna be all right? Did you talk to her parents? 
not_available I beeped her mom.
not_available Could you try again? Yeah.
not_available If you'd gone to public school, you could've seen my science program.
not_available I started them right after the war.
not_available Try and keep your eyes still.
not_available Look at my earlobe.
not_available You know, about 1950, I was on a TV program.
not_available I liked it so much I wanted to make it my life's work.

not_available Dr.
not_available George.
not_available Dr.
not_available George? Tonopen? The stateofthe
not_available art we used to get was the big one with the air puff.
not_available I'll put numbing drops in and then measure the pressure.
not_available Solid
not_available state microcircuitry.
not_available But all in all, just a simple pressure transducer.
not_available That's what
not_available That's numbing already.
not_available The numbing's coming fast.
not_available Press this button and it works.
not_available Don't you wanna know how? I could build you one.

not_available Sophie? Sophie? Why is she unconscious? We had to sedate her to get the breathing tube down her throat.
not_available She wasn't sick when I left.
not_available She had some diarrhea.
not_available We believe it's an E.
not_available coli infection causing the kidney failure.
not_available E.
not_available coli? That comes from meat.
not_available It's impossible, she doesn't eat meat.
not_available It can also come from raw juices or sprouts.
not_available Well, however she got it, she needs dialysis.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I want another opinion before you put her on some machine.
not_available There's no time.
not_available This is my daughter.

not_available What the hell's going on? Elevator recall, down to the lobby.
not_available Happens during emergencies.
not_available Sophie, you okay? Why have we stopped? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available How's her oxygen? She's got two
not_available thirds of a tank.
not_available Look at that! Think they'll hear that? 
not_available Yeah, they'll hear it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You're a doctor? 
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available My daughter's a patient in the ER.
not_available They won't let me in.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can't be here, ma'am.
not_available No! Somebody help me! 
not_available Check in the cafeteria.
not_available Let go of me! Captain Dannaker? 
not_available Copy.
not_available No fire verified on floor two.
not_available Fire patrol, do a reset.
not_available False alarm.
not_available Somebody smelled fumes and panicked.
not_available Jeanie, why are we outside? 
not_available We're taking you to the cafeteria.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available She's still altered.
not_available It's not the benzene, it's the seizures.
not_available She should be fine.
not_available Some may need attention before they go inside.
not_available You're in the cold zone.
not_available Cold zone? Out here.
not_available In there's the warm zone.
not_available Nobody goes in there without a suit.
not_available Same goes for the ER, it's a hot zone.
not_available Are you Carter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Harriet Spooner, VP of Operations.
not_available I'm the incident commander.
not_available Did you evacuate to the cafeteria? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The disaster plan calls for evacuation to Physical Therapy.
not_available It got chaotic.
not_available We had to improvise.
not_available We have an elevator stuck.
not_available I'll get the engineer.
not_available Anybody on it? Don't know.
not_available The phone's dead and the alarm's going off.
not_available Just keep your eye on it.
not_available Now listen, Sophie? We're going on a little adventure.
not_available You'll have cool stories to tell.
not_available Multifocal PVCs.
not_available Let me see this.
not_available Potassium's too high.
not_available Push an amp of bicarb.
not_available Buy us a little time.
not_available Run of seven.
not_available Here, take it.
not_available Bicarb.
not_available She'll go into V
not_available tach.
not_available We don't have any.
not_available Did you check the box? You can't treat hyperkaliemia without bicarb.
not_available It wasn't my idea to move her like this.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay, Sophie.
not_available What do you have? All right.
not_available We got epi, atropine.
not_available How about lidocaine? I'll take lidocaine.
not_available and 5 every five minutes.
not_available How's the oxygen? Ten minutes.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Lavage is negative.
not_available Let's get him to the OR.
not_available Hey, Transport! Give us a hand.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? I'm sorry.
not_available Have we met? You're my doctor.
not_available We should let her rest.
not_available We got two more vents coming down.
not_available Who gets the first one? Let's start with Inga.
not_available Are you sure, Inga? It could be awhile.
not_available Carter, where's your Attending? Dr.
not_available Weaver's over here.
not_available Do you need more nurses? 
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available All right.
not_available I can float you three from the ICU.
not_available Kerry? Harriet.
not_available What is going on? I am so sorry.
not_available I had no idea you were debilitated by the incident.
not_available What incident? Remember I told you there was a toxic spill? Will she be all right? Lack of oxygen caused a seizure.
not_available We don't expect any long
not_available term effects.
not_available This is the action packet for the chief medical officer which I guess, for the moment, is you.
not_available Here's a walkie.
not_available I'll check in with you in half an hour.
not_available I've got to deal with the elevator.
not_available Did you get them out? 
not_available Repairman's on the way.
not_available It'll be an hour.
not_available There are two sets of doors? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Help me when I open it.
not_available I can't.
not_available I gotta bag her.
not_available Reach in! Get your body in here.
not_available Right there.
not_available All right.
not_available Watch your knee.
not_available Go.
not_available I got it.
not_available Hang on.
not_available We're two and a half feet short of the floor.
not_available There's gotta be a latch.
not_available Come down.
not_available What if it moves? No worries about commitment.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available I got it.
not_available Right there.
not_available Pull it.
not_available Give me another pull.
not_available What's that? It's not the EKG.
not_available It's her pulse ox.
not_available The 02 sat's down to 89.
not_available Oh, God! Sophie?! Sophie? 
not_available All right, I got it.
not_available She's unresponsive! Anybody in there? 
not_available We got a little girl in here! Got that? Hold that there.
not_available We need oxygen! Get us out of here! 
not_available We don't have time! Let's go! It won't go any further than that! Come on! It's gonna work.
not_available Watch your fingers.
not_available Hang on.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, hang on.
not_available Hold it right there.
not_available Try this.
not_available All right.
not_available It's not gonna open.
not_available It's gonna open! 
not_available Come here.
not_available Get your hands in here.
not_available Grab hold! All right, guys.
not_available One, two, three! She needs oxygen! 
not_available Got it.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hook her up.
not_available Go.
not_available Here's our little action hero.
not_available How does it look? Like ground beef.
not_available No, more like chopped liver.
not_available Can we salvage the limb? Want my honest opinion? No, I don't think you do.
not_available I'd like to give it our best shot.
not_available You got it, Lizzie.
not_available 110 percent.
not_available Can you feel this? 
not_available It's kind of numb.
not_available Is that bad? It means the leg's tensing.
not_available I'll measure the internal pressure.
not_available Transducer's up in the ER.
not_available HazMat won't find it.
not_available All right.
not_available Then I need an 18
not_available gauge needle, IV tubing and a BP manometer.
not_available You got it.
not_available Then I watched them put you on a gurney and give you oxygen.
not_available Then what happened? They moved me from a yellow room to a green room.
not_available That would be Trauma 2.
not_available But where was I at that time? Then they put you in the yellow room.
not_available That's where they removed all of your clothes and put them into a plastic bag.
not_available Two more to go.
not_available What about the ER? 
not_available It'll take awhile.
not_available Is there a doctor around? 
not_available Right here.
not_available Hard to breathe.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available No.
not_available Suits only.
not_available Suit me up.
not_available He's in trouble.
not_available It'll take 15 minutes to suit up.
not_available He'll be out by then.
not_available Doc, do something! You won't let me in? He could die.
not_available Mike, give him oxygen! Morrie! He's not talking! Do something! 
not_available Get me an airway kit now! Give him one more minute.
not_available Tube him when he comes out.
not_available Morrie! Morrie! Help him! Do something! Help him! That's pretty stupid.
not_available Do something for Morrie! He's dirty now.
not_available Let him do it.
not_available Anybody here an EMT? 
not_available I'm a medic.
not_available Bag him when I'm done.
not_available You got it.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Scrub him.
not_available Let's go, doc.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Wait.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Come in, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I need to talk to her.
not_available I got you covered, doc.
not_available How's he doing? He's picking up.
not_available Looks good.
not_available Great.
not_available Sixty, 70.
not_available What does that mean? The pressure's too high from the bleeding.
not_available We need to operate.
not_available I need you over here! Jerry, book a room! Charging to 200.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Still in fib.
not_available All right.
not_available Charge to 300.
not_available Clear! Can we take him inside? 
not_available In a minute.
not_available What about my shoes? Ernie, take care of Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available His heart's up to 98.
not_available He's waking up.
not_available He sounds pretty good.
not_available I think you'll be okay, Morris.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available No, man.
not_available Real shoes.
not_available Malik! Help us move him inside? Hold up.
not_available They're coding some old lady in the cafeteria.
not_available I said charge it to 360.
not_available Wait, it takes time.
not_available The battery's low.
not_available Okay.
not_available Clear! Asystole.
not_available How long have we been at this? Eighteen minutes.
not_available She never had a rhythm or a pulse.
not_available That's it.
not_available Time of 
death 22:09.
not_available OR's ready for Krakowski.
not_available I've got a fasciotomy.
not_available See if you can find her family.
not_available Did that lady just die? I mean, is she dead? They're not gonna leave her there? Where are the preop labs? 
not_available Here.
not_available How long will I be in a cast? 
not_available Four to six weeks.
not_available Anna's running the code? Yeah, but we just
not_available Five rounds of epi.
not_available Two of atropine.
not_available Lidocaine
not_available Bretylium, amiodarone.
not_available Should've been in the ICU.
not_available Wouldn't have made a difference.
not_available Might've.
not_available No.
not_available You turned this place into an ICU.
not_available This isn't an ICU.
not_available This is just something we threw together.
not_available This shouldn't have happened.
not_available Look.
not_available Inoperable triple
not_available vessel disease.
not_available It was only a matter of time.
not_available Mr.
not_available Arteburn, you okay? Dizzy.
not_available Very dizzy.
not_available Superventricular tachycardia.
not_available Adenosine 6 mgs, IV.
not_available We don't have any.
not_available Jerry, run to the pharmacy.
not_available Do you need some help? Jeanie, help out Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Pulse is weak and thready.
not_available Any chest pain? We can't wait for adenosine.
not_available It's a cardiovert.
not_available Lily, grab a crash cart! Let's get him into Trendelenberg.
not_available I'll try carotid sinus massage.
not_available Yosh.
not_available Can you get a BP? Lily, charge to 100.
not_available Mr.
not_available Arteburn? Mr.
not_available Arteburn? 
not_available He's unresponsive.
not_available Give me the paddles.
not_available Battery's dead.
not_available I'll find an extension cord.
not_available No, there's an outlet.
not_available Help me move him.
not_available Move that gurney out of the way! 
not_available BP's 60 palp.
not_available He's not moving much air.
not_available I gotta tube him.
not_available Carter? Carter? Get ready to start CPR.
not_available I need an intubation tray.
not_available Carter? Lily, when we get power, we need to move him.
not_available Get over here! I need you to bag him.
not_available Almost ready! Hold that.
not_available Normal sinus rhythm.
not_available What are you people doing to me?! You had an abnormal heart rhythm.
not_available We had to treat you.
not_available By drowning me?! 
not_available It's a diving reflex.
not_available It slows the heart, breaks the tachycardia.
not_available You call this the highest standard of care? Get my doctor on the phone! I got the adenosine.
not_available We're okay.
not_available I'll meet you in Recovery.
not_available I want to be there when he wakes up.
not_available Yes.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Hello, Peter.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Oh, your eye looks worse.
not_available I'm sure it looks nastier than it is.
not_available Let me have a look anyway.
not_available You could have a hyphema.
not_available So I heard about the big rescue.
not_available You were under a collapsed building? Went all out to avoid amputation.
not_available But we had to take his arm anyway.
not_available Okay.
not_available You okay? Have to tell Leo about his arm when he wakes up.
not_available What about you? You on call tonight? I've got a fasciotomy.
not_available After that, I'm free.
not_available I could do with some debriefing.
not_available Take a deep breath in.
not_available Now blow out.
not_available Can we get a blood gas in 20 minutes? My throat's sore.
not_available Give her some water.
not_available Yep.
not_available There you go.
not_available That was pretty scary, wasn't it? No.
not_available We do that kind of thing here every day.
not_available No.
not_available You were scared.
not_available Tell the truth.
not_available I was pretty scared.
not_available I was really scared.
not_available Honey, I've been looking all over for you.
not_available Is she okay? She's fine.
not_available I heard about the fumes.
not_available Was she exposed? 
not_available Her lungs weren't exposed.
not_available She was never in any danger? 
not_available No, Mom.
not_available They took really good care of me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available The ER.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lemley, if you'll? I'll come back and check on you.
not_available You're in good hands.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Carol? 
not_available Have Pharmacy restock the drug boxes.
not_available Sure.
not_available Are you still mad at me? I was mad? 
not_available You accused me of spying on you.
not_available I never said that.
not_available That's what you meant.
not_available I was annoyed.
not_available You don't need to check on me.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available I just wanted to see you last night.
not_available Me too.
not_available We shouldn't let that happen too often, should we? I actually think we shouldn't let that happen at all, but
not_available Here goes nothing.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Arteburn.
not_available Let's put you down into Curtain 1.
not_available Take Manny and put him in Curtain 2.
not_available Morris, 2B.
not_available Carter, I can take it from here.
not_available Put the sickest patients in the trauma rooms and curtains.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available Yeah? You and Jerry update the board and get the phones back.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I spoke with Harriet Spooner, the incident commander.
not_available I would like to thank you for helping me out.
not_available The administration would like you to speak with the press.
not_available We'll meet them together in the first
not_available floor conference room at 
11 15.
not_available In terms of dealing with these people, I've got more experience.
not_available It's important that the emphasis
not_available No.
not_available Morris gets that vent! 
not_available All right.
not_available It's important that the emphasis be placed on the institutional response to the crisis as opposed to any individual efforts.
not_available They would tend to sensationalize.
not_available I think it's best to say simply that we followed a well
not_available rehearsed disaster plan and worked with HazMat to ensure the safety of our patients and also the staff.
not_available The fire captain wants to speak with you.
not_available Oh, right.
11 15? 
not_available That's right.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available I've looked at some of the causative factors and I can now identify those at blame.
not_available What are you talking about? I've been on nights, and during that time the day unit service coordinators have let the central area deteriorate.
not_available Jerry, this was a chemical spill.
not_available Yes, and we were impaired because we were unable to find this important manual.
not_available Now that I'm back on days, you can count on a higher level of efficiency at the central work area.
not_available If you pass out again, I'll have everything under control.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter! Want these back? No.
not_available Souvenir.
not_available How do you think your people handled things? Oh, pretty good.
not_available No.
not_available It was a total disaster.
not_available You guys were caught with your pants down.
not_available But you personally did okay under the circumstances.
not_available I think you're the guy to work with on a schedule of disaster drills.
not_available I don't have that kind of authority.
not_available I'm just an intern.
not_available You had me fooled.
not_available You should talk to our chief of staff.
not_available It was good working with you.
not_available Hey, Carter! Hey! When did you get back? Came straight from the airport.
not_available I'm on in five minutes.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available How's your mom? She's doing better.
not_available What's with the boots? It's kind of a long story.
