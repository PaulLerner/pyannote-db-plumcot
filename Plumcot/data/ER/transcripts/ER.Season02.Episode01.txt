not_available She's very smart.
not_available Well
not_available liked.

not_available Which are? 
not_available Discipline, paperwork, administration.
not_available Any other candidates? 
not_available She'd be my first choice.
not_available Carol, any thoughts? Pratt's the best of this year's crop.

not_available Only by reputation.
not_available I'd like you to meet her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can we get this Ross thing finally resolved today? Nobody thinks this is important, but why is my Pediatric budget carrying the cost of an ER fellowship for Doug Ross? It's an ER Pediatrics fellowship, Neal.
not_available Then put him under my supervision.
not_available I'll keep him in the clinic where I'm severely understaffed.
not_available When there's a real pediatrics emergency, you can call him down.
not_available They need him in the ER full
not_available time.
not_available Then let them pay! They're severely under
not_available budgeted, and you know it.
not_available I like him, but he's a bit of a cowboy.
not_available A bit?! David, he's arrogant and dismissive of my authority.
not_available Now, I'm warning you right now.
not_available When his fellowship comes up for renewal in November I'm not gonna sign off on it.
not_available You want him, you find the money for him.
not_available Let's jump off that bridge when we get to it.
not_available Mark, we need to talk about who gets to cover the Attending swing shifts.
not_available It's a nice piece of change.
not_available Any thoughts? No.
not_available I'II I'll get you some names later.
