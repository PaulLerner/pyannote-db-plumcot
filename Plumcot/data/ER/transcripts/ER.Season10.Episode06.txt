not_available 10x06 "THE GREATER GOOD" "The friend had, in a weak hour, spoken with sobs of his own death.
not_available He had delivered a melancholy oration previous to his funeral and had doubtless in the packet of letters presented various keepsakes to relatives.

not_available " Oh, sorry.
not_available Are you taking your enalapril?

not_available "The latter felt immensely superior to his friend but he inclined toward condescension.

not_available The patient was borderline.
not_available Precisely my point.
not_available He needs to stay in the ER.
not_available If his condition worsens, I'll go back down.
not_available You know they're only too happy to free up beds by dumping patients onto Surgery.
not_available Dr.

not_available Accounting, fifth floor.
not_available They wouldn't help me.
not_available Well, I can't either.
not_available This is the ER.
not_available All right, Ernie, those are maggots.
not_available When's the last time you changed that? 
not_available Look, look, I was already there, okay? I sat here for 11 hours with my sick kid to have some quack tell me it was a virus and he'd get better on his own.

not_available I wanna see the doctor who stiffed me.

not_available We'll get you an x
not_available ray.
not_available Clean those cuts and scrapes.
not_available Might even need some stitches.
not_available Really? Don't worry.
not_available We'll numb you up.
not_available You won't even feel it.
not_available No, no medicine.
not_available I can take it.
not_available Tough guy, huh? Trauma panel, a clot, lateral Cspine, chest x
not_available ray and AP pelvis.
not_available Poor guy's driving down the street, minding his own business, 
then 
not_available Wakes up in the ICU.
not_available If he wakes up.

not_available You could use a little more jelly on your belly.
not_available You're the Attending.
not_available And in Morrison's pouch.

not_available Needs O.R.
not_available Start the chest tube.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Don't be a stranger.
not_available Guy next door needs a surgeon.
not_available I'll call Corday.
not_available Mommy, come save me.
not_available I'll decide if he needs surgery.
not_available He only responds to pain.
not_available Urine output's good.
not_available Okay, laryngoscope.
not_available No, no, Surgi
not_available Girl, go next door.
not_available Start the workup.
not_available Yeah, I was gonna intubate.

not_available Thanks.
not_available Nice job.
not_available Okay, Abby, give me the bullet.
not_available I was trying to fix the monitor, sorry.
not_available Oh, you're a med student, a nurse, and technician now.
not_available What's next, cowgirl? I'm pushing the drugs.
not_available You want this or not? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I told you to evaluate this guy.
not_available I can do it.
not_available I don't care who does it.
not_available Neela, go with Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Come back and sew these in when you're done.
not_available Well? No fracture or dislocation.
not_available You probably just strained the ligaments a bit.
not_available Told you.
not_available Maybe you should be a doctor.
not_available Yeah, not with my grades.
not_available I wasn't a great student at your age.
not_available I almost failed lunch.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Kovac, this guy's here for your patient.
not_available Ron Kennedy, I'm a social worker from Stadler House.
not_available We're a foster care facility.
not_available Zack's one of our residents.
not_available You mean prisoners.
not_available Relax.
not_available I'm his caseworker.
not_available Zack hopped a fence on an outing and ran off.
not_available I escaped, you Nazi.
not_available Call my mom.
not_available I'm not going back.
not_available Zack has a conduct disorder.
not_available Screw you! Could you give us a moment? 
not_available I think he's off his meds.
not_available Back off, man.
not_available Hey, stop it, Zack.
not_available He needs Haldol.
not_available Go back to the waiting room.
not_available Get the hell out! 
not_available Get back in bed, Zack.
not_available He needs to be sedated.
not_available Out! Hey.
not_available I'm not going back there.
not_available Please, don't let them take me back.
not_available Please.
not_available Third crit is down to 29.
not_available Done.
not_available Let's roll.
not_available Call Corday, and tell her I'm sending her up a gift basket.
not_available Looks good, but if it comes out, you owe us a beer.
not_available I'm more a cosmo girl.
not_available Drink or magazine? 
not_available A little of both.
not_available Did Neurosurgery agree? 
not_available Yeah, diffuse axonal injury.
not_available No operative lesion.
not_available They'll sign off after the second test.
not_available He's braindead? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Bad guy gets patched up, victim is a vegetable.
not_available Haven't saved this guy yet.
not_available Change that dressing.
not_available Which O.R.? 
not_available That's not your business.
not_available Call UNOS.
not_available Your butt's down here until the coordinator arrives.
not_available You wouldn't feel it if you let me use just a little analgesic gel.
not_available For six months I've been on Tegretol, lithium, Risperdal, clonidine Benadryl and Klonopin, okay? I've been so doped up I didn't know the day.
not_available Have you been cheeking your meds? 
not_available Had to.
not_available It's the first day I felt normal in months.
not_available That why you ran away? I got tired of being a freaking zombie.
not_available Did you call my parents? 
not_available Your mom's on her way.
not_available You're not gonna let them take me back, are you? We'll talk about it when your mom gets here, okay? Hey, Pratt? 
not_available This scan's negative.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm still waiting on a Neurology consult to evaluate a possible subarachnoid.
not_available Do an LP.
not_available They'll be here any minute.
not_available You're wasting time and resources.
not_available What's his problem? Besides being tackled in the waiting room? Possible new onset angina.
not_available I've ordered nitro, CBC, chem panel, serial troponins and a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available And I'm still waiting on Cards.
not_available EKG's normal? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You smoke? 
not_available No.
not_available Hypertension? High cholesterol, diabetes? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm healthy.
not_available I run about 12 miles a week.
not_available Okay, let me guess.
not_available The pain started after your incident in the waiting room.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's an anxiety attack.
not_available Over this stupid hospital bill? 
not_available Probably.
not_available Let me see it.
not_available What's the complaint? My kid came in with a fever.
not_available Your son didn't need that.
not_available Certainly didn't need chem panel and two sets of blood cultures.
not_available You should have only been charged for, what? Three hundred dollars.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Slavco.
not_available What do you think this is, some Zagreb Yugo dealership? On the occasion we do get a patient with insurance, we don't give them deals.
not_available I expect that kind of idiocy from Pratt, not from you.
not_available I thought I was his favorite.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Terra King.
not_available Have you heard of Quinamax? It's our new oncea
not_available day antibiotic with excellent coverage for bronchitis and otitis media.
not_available Neither of which needs treatment with antibiotics.
not_available It has great gram
not_available positive coverage, making it ideal for cellulitis.
not_available I have a patient coming in at 3, Ben Hollander.
not_available When he shows up, just let him in and come find me, okay? Sure thing.
not_available Hey, what's up? I got a 27yearold G3P
not_available zero history of cervical incompetence, EGA, 24 weeks.
not_available Presented in early labor cervical dilation progressed from three to six on terb and mag.
not_available Fetal distress? 
not_available No.
not_available Looks good.
not_available Heart rate's in the 160s, good variability.
not_available Can you repeat the terb? No.
not_available We're maxed out, and she's tachy.
not_available Send her up to Labor Delivery.
not_available Have a Pedes resuscitation team standing by.
not_available If she's progressing on tocolytics, there's nothing we can do.
not_available She's revealing both her upper and lower teeth when she laughs.
not_available What? 
not_available Chen.
not_available It's a sign of flirting.
not_available There.
not_available Hair touching, another one.
not_available Get in there before it's too late.
not_available What are you talking about? I was a cop for 25 years.
not_available You learn body language.
not_available Look at that.
not_available She's mirroring his motion.
not_available Twenty bucks says she touches him next.
not_available So what? She slapped him.
not_available First it's a slap, then it's a tickle.
not_available Before you know it, she'll be spanking his ass.
not_available Jerry, can you call up to L and D? Tell them to make sure
not_available I need to find a fire hydrant.
not_available Hey, that's a cute puppy.
not_available Can I hold it? You can have it.
not_available Fortythreeyear
not_available old man with left flank pain radiating to the groin.
not_available Denies fever, vomiting.
not_available Exam's notable for CVA tenderness on the left.
not_available Urine heme
not_available positive.
not_available Okay.
not_available Diagnosis? 
not_available Kidney stones.
not_available What else? CBC, chem panel, and CT urogram.
not_available Okay.
not_available And give 30 of ketorolac IV push.
not_available No.
not_available No CBC, no chem panel, and no CT.
not_available You don't even need the damn IV.
not_available It's expensive and takes up nursing time.
not_available Give him 60 of ketorolac IM and a bedside ultrasound to rule out hydronephrosis.
not_available You won't see where the stone is.
not_available 90 percent of cases pass on their own.
not_available He's afebrile, and his UA is negative.
not_available And if it's too big to pass? It'll cause hydronephrosis, and he'll come back.
not_available He still thinks he's in the Congo.
not_available Get the CT.
not_available You need to take him up.
not_available That's not how it works.
not_available I come down, I see, I present.
not_available I know how it works.
not_available I'm telling you as a surgeon and head of ER take this guy to your service.
not_available Do I need to write you a damn note? "Dear Dr.
not_available Corday, please admit Abby's patient.
not_available He's very sick today and requires an ex
not_available lap before he gets septic and dies.
not_available " You hanging in there? 
not_available By a thread.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, can you help me? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Which patient? It's about the doctors.
not_available I'm getting conflicting advice from Pratt and Kovac.
not_available Welcome to County.
not_available Kovac is the Attending.
not_available Pratt isn't.
not_available Abby.
not_available This is Patricia Collins.
not_available Husband was involved in the car chase.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Hi.
not_available Abby Lockhart.
not_available I'm Neela.
not_available Hi.
not_available I worked on your husband.
not_available You'd like to see him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll take Mrs.
not_available Collins in while you're waiting for the UNOS team.
not_available This way, please.
not_available I'm beginning to hate her.
not_available She's a med student.
not_available I'm a med student.
not_available Now that you mention it, she's pissing me off too.
not_available Come on, let's hate her together.
not_available Now, the medicine I gave you hasn't stopped you from going into labor.
not_available Your contractions are increasing in frequency and your cervix is continuing to dilate.
not_available My husband had to go to Seattle for work.
not_available He didn't want to go, but I said, "Don't worry, I'll be fine.
not_available " I can't believe I'm having another miscarriage.
not_available No.
not_available You're not miscarrying, Denny.
not_available You're gonna have this baby.
not_available I'm sending you up to Obstetrics.
not_available They're set up to handle preemie delivery.
not_available I don't want a preemie.
not_available Our NICU cares for babies like this all the time.
not_available Yeah, babies with brain damage.
not_available My sisterin
not_available law had a preemie.
not_available They spent every day in the NICU and it still died.
not_available This baby has a chance.
not_available I don't want it this way! Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Problem? She doesn't wanna have the baby.
not_available She's 24 weeks.
not_available What's the weight? Five hundred twenty grams on the ultrasound.
not_available Twenty
not_available four weeks, over 500 grams? That's the hospital's viability threshold.
not_available We're gonna spend half a million keeping one baby alive while we shut down the lead eradication program? I've admitted three kids for chelation this week.
not_available Why stamp out lead poisoning? Just shoot your wad on a little gorker who can enjoy a lifetime of special ed.
not_available What am I supposed to do? Mom doesn't want to save this baby.
not_available She doesn't have any rights.
not_available If it's over Aren't you on a surgical rotation? 
not_available Yup.
not_available Then rotate.
not_available What's the kid's chance of a normal life? Ten percent? Less? 
not_available It's hospital policy, Luka.
not_available Change the hospital.
not_available Another good idea.
not_available Let's send her to Santa Niña Muerta Hospital.
not_available It's called natural selection.
not_available Heard of it? It's worked for a few million years.
not_available So tell me, what should I do now? Hospital policy exists for a reason.
not_available First learn the rules, then learn when to break them.
not_available What's in her best interest? The laceration is superficial, and his shoulder is only bruised but I do have some concerns about the medication he's on.
not_available Zack's had some problems.
not_available Had.
not_available I'm fine now.
not_available I think he may be overmedicated.
not_available They told me that was for his own good.
not_available I had a drug problem.
not_available I let him run wild.
not_available And then he was always doing this crazy stuff.
not_available He got into fights.
not_available It's called self
not_available defense.
not_available He stole a car.
not_available One time.
not_available I'm not doing that anymore.
not_available They blamed it on me.
not_available They said I was an unfit mother.
not_available Do you have custody? Not at the moment.
not_available Has Ben Hollander shown up yet? 
not_available Not that I've seen.
not_available Can you look at a possible scaphoid fracture in Exam 3? Yeah.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Collins refused to donate her husband's organs.
not_available I've heard minority families seldom agree to organ donation.
not_available What, did you just let her leave? I told her she could sit with the body until he went up to the ICU.
not_available I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Greg.

not_available Sure.
not_available Just give me one second, all right? I'll find her.
not_available She left.
not_available Who? My pregnant patient.
not_available You talk to her? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, she took your advice.
not_available She eloped.
not_available That was always her prerogative.
not_available I need a doctor out here.
not_available Doesn't mean it was the best thing for her.
not_available You're supposed to be teaching me.
not_available I'm trying, you're not listening.
not_available Some lady is in the back of my cab.
not_available I think she's bleeding to death.
not_available Denny, what happened? I tried to make it to Saint Joe's but the baby's coming.
not_available Is she dying? 
not_available No.
not_available Run inside.
not_available Tell them I need a gurney and a BOA kit.
not_available Go! 
not_available This is in her best interest? She wouldn't have left if you'd done what she asked.
not_available Type and cross Mom for four units, two large
not_available bore IVs and a liter of LR running now.
not_available It's too soon.
not_available All right, Denny.
not_available One big push.
not_available Let the NICU know we've got a 24
not_available weeker on the way.
not_available Come on.
not_available Cord clamp.
not_available Please, don't save him.
not_available It's a boy.
not_available Eyelids are still fused.
not_available Let him go.
not_available I asked for two lines.
not_available Who's working on the second IV? 
not_available Come on, we need access.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Full respiratory effort.
not_available Placenta's delivered.
not_available I don't want this baby.
not_available Bleeding's picking up.
not_available Heart rate's in the 130s.
not_available Yeah, uterine atony from the tocolytics.
not_available Run in another liter of LR and 20 of Pit.
not_available Do you have a pulse? 
not_available Slow, under 100.
not_available Start compressions? 
not_available Bag him up first.
not_available No, you need to weigh him before anything else.
not_available Less than 500 grams, we stop.
not_available Draw up some epi, get ready with the tube.
not_available Do not tube that baby until you get a weight.
not_available You hear me, Pratt? I mean it.
not_available No tubes, please.
not_available Five hundred and six.
not_available No.
not_available Pratt, she doesn't want this.
not_available I'm following hospital rules.
not_available Doesn't make it right.
not_available This kid is alive.
not_available Systolic's down to 78.
not_available and rush the blood bank.
not_available All right, I'm in.
not_available Bag him and give You got it.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Collins, can I get you anything? Or anyone I can call? Tom's sister is coming.
not_available She wanted to say goodbye.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Shouldn't be doing this, Pratt.
not_available She has the right to demand a natural death.
not_available We have a family room.
not_available If you'd like to wait for your sisterin
not_available law in there, it's a little more quiet.
not_available I wanna stay with him as long as I can.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's happening? They're trying to save a premature baby.
not_available We just started trying to have kids.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Collins, did Neela talk to you about recovering your husband's organs? I told her I didn't want that.
not_available He's been through enough.
not_available Why? Does he have something that could help the mom or her baby? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But there are lots of others who would benefit.
not_available Tom was always going out of his way to do stuff for other people.
not_available To the point where they would take advantage of him, but he didn't care.
not_available I would always tell him, "Don't you know nice guys finish last? " He would always 
say "Guys who finish last are nice.
not_available " He was so stupid.
not_available What would they do if he was a donor? The recovery team would take him to the ICU.
not_available And they run tests, and they start matching his organs 
not_available to people who need them.
not_available Like his kidneys? Several organs can be recovered.
not_available He could help as many as 50 different people.
not_available Tom would like that.
not_available What all will they take? Well, his kidneys which would go to two people with end
not_available stage renal disease and that would free them from a lifetime of dialysis.
not_available Ben Hollander, Susan Lewis.
not_available No, I'm the doctor.
not_available He's my patient.
not_available County General.
not_available Okay, then I'll talk to the watch commander.
not_available My mom around? 
not_available In a trauma.
not_available Wait in the doctor's lounge? 
not_available No.
not_available You get any freaks in here today? Guys with ElephantMan disease and axes stuck in their head? 
not_available No.
not_available Should you be looking at that? I'm gonna become a doctor.
not_available Dollars to doughnuts that kid is already dissecting the neighborhood pets.
not_available When you put me on hold, you increase the chance he's in trouble.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey.
not_available You wanna see a puppy? Why? I don't know.
not_available Because she's cute? Where's the morgue? Your mom says we aren't allowed to let you go there.
not_available I'll give you 5 bucks.
not_available That kid ever give you the creeps? 
not_available He's right at the age where it starts.
not_available Teen rebellion? Devil worship.
not_available Keep an eye on that puppy.
not_available Never mind.
not_available You were supposed to be in hours ago.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, these are
not_available These are for you.
not_available Sort of a peace offering to make up, you know, for my tardiness.
not_available You didn't have to do that.
not_available Well, there's a guy outside, you know, selling them on the street so it's, you know, no big deal.
not_available Oh, and I I brought you this.
not_available We're not finished reading it.
not_available Well, you know, I know how it ends.
not_available Lily, can you set Ben up for a blood draw? Sure.
not_available This way, sir.
not_available That patient brought you flowers? 
not_available And a book.
not_available He's a Civil War buff.
not_available I've been reading to him.
not_available He's losing his sight.
not_available You're going to his house? Yeah.
not_available The guy was a possible OD on Dig a couple weeks ago.
not_available I'm still not sure it wasn't attempted suicide.
not_available Wanna make sure he's reengaged before I cut him loose.
not_available This is a first edition.
not_available Sounds like he's engaged with you.
not_available He has no one.
not_available He's going blind.
not_available He sacrificed everything for his career and now he has nothing.
not_available No one should end up like that.
not_available Where the hell is OB? 
not_available Paged them three times.
not_available Denny, stay with us here.
not_available EBL 1500 cc's.
not_available I'm hitting resistance.
not_available When it bounces back, you're in the liver.
not_available Thread it again.
not_available Get him upstairs, Pratt.
not_available Kovac, I need to talk to you.
not_available Kind of busy.
not_available What's the holdup with that kid from Stadler House? They're threatening legal action.
not_available Still waiting on a Tegretol level to
not_available No, you're not.
not_available It's back.
not_available He can't go back there, Kerry.
not_available Their treatment program is keeping him so drugged that he can't think straight.
not_available BP's up to 98/55.
not_available Good.
not_available He's a nice kid.
not_available You know better than the psychiatrist who's been treating him for two years? 
not_available She has too many patients.
not_available She also has privileges in this hospital.
not_available She's on her way to administer Haldol because the ER physician refused.
not_available Everybody's so concerned about the rules and policy they forget there's a kid caught in the middle.
not_available Reform the foster
not_available care system on your own time.
not_available Neela, come with me.
not_available Discharge this patient.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Kerry! 
not_available Take the baby.
not_available I need you here.
not_available Somebody call for OB? Yeah, that was fast.
not_available Fill her in, Pratt.
not_available Mom just delivered a 24
not_available weeker now with severe atony, EBL 1500 cc's.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available You're doing good.
not_available It looks worse than it is.
not_available The tube in his mouth helps him breathe.
not_available Catheters in his umbilical cord give him fluid, nutrition and medication.
not_available But underneath it all he looks good for a 24
not_available weeker.
not_available Really.
not_available Where's Zack? Zack? Zack? What did she give him? 
not_available Four milligrams Haldol IM.
not_available Just to tide him over till his p.
not_available o.
not_available meds kick in.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You never let me finish telling you about Quinamax.
not_available Now, it's our new oncea
not_available day antibiotic with excellent coverage for bronchitis and otitis media.
not_available I could put together some packages for you to take to the Congo.
not_available I've heard that's a pet project of yours.
not_available Quinamax would be wonderful for the important work you're doing over there.
not_available You want me to take your overpriced antibiotic to Africa? It has great coverage for pneumococcus and H.
not_available flu.
not_available Why hasn't there been a new drug for malaria in three decades? 
not_available That's a really good question.
not_available There's no profit in treating poor people.
not_available My company
not_available Your company spends twice as much in marketing as it does in development which is why prescription drug costs have tripled in the last 10 years.
not_available Get out.
not_available I want you out of here.
not_available If this is a bad time
not_available Frank, I'm gonna go get some coffee.
not_available Page me if you need me.
not_available Okay, Dr.
not_available Kovac, if you could
not_available You know, I'll just come back when you're not so busy.
not_available Everything looks good.
not_available Don't sound so surprised.
not_available Ben, I really appreciate the gesture but I can't accept this.
not_available Well, you said you liked it.
not_available I do, but that book is worth a lot of money.
not_available No, no, my first edition Brontës are worth a lot of money.
not_available I just think it's inappropriate.
not_available I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available It's just that you've done a lot for me and, you know, I just want to show my appreciation.
not_available I certainly never meant to make you feel uncomfortable.
not_available No, no, you didn't make me feel uncom
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available I can help you get a ride if you wait.
not_available No, I'll grab a cab.
not_available Okay, same time next week for another level.
not_available Thank you for the flowers.
not_available I feel officially lousy.
not_available So is it "JingMy" or "Jing
not_available May"? I'm getting conflicting information.
not_available Call me Deb.
not_available What are you doing after this, Deb? Wanna grab a beer, shoot pool? I can't.
not_available I'm taking my parents to the airport.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available We can go out after.
not_available You'll drive my mother and father to the airport? 
not_available Good for embarrassing childhood stories.
not_available No, not my parents.
not_available They're a little distant, bordering on xenophobic.
not_available My dad has six toes.
not_available Just on one foot.
not_available Has anyone seen Alex? 
not_available He was hanging around here earlier.
not_available Could you find him for me, please? You should use your fireball.
not_available This your first time playing? Nope.
not_available You want me to show you how to do the dragon punch? Nope.
not_available He's gonna kill you with his psychocrusher move.
not_available Told you.
not_available I'm thirsty.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available Can she have some ice chips? 
not_available Let's hold off for a little while.
not_available You lost a lot of blood in your delivery.
not_available We had to give you a transfusion but the bleeding's stopped now.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available We're taking your baby up to the NICU.
not_available Good.
not_available He's doing better.
not_available Just take him away.
not_available Denny, just
not_available Please.
not_available Has Abby shown up yet? 
not_available 404.
not_available Doing what? I've been paging you.
not_available I was with this patient.
not_available So I hear.
not_available You convinced the family to donate his organs? Spending this much time with a patient is a luxury we don't usually have.
not_available You missed out on an interesting volvulus repair.
not_available Well, I just felt like his wife needed me.
not_available You already do this well, Abby.
not_available Sometimes being a doctor is about distancing yourself from your patient.
not_available You don't have to stay.
not_available I'd like to stick around if that's okay.
not_available What the hell is this? 
not_available A Labrador retriever.
not_available Wrong answer.
not_available Some sort of spaniel.
not_available A terrier.
not_available Who brought it into the hospital? Pratt? 
not_available I'm sorry, Dr.
not_available Romano
not_available I did.
not_available She belongs to me.
not_available This isn't a petting zoo.
not_available She's not a pet.
not_available She's a Seeing Eye dog, aren't you? Oh, how could you hate a face this cute? 
not_available All right, come on.
not_available Let's go home.
not_available Bye.
not_available So where is my son? Did you show him the morgue? 
not_available Couldn't find him.
not_available I know where he is.
not_available He's across the street in the new Jumbo Mart.
not_available Got you now.
not_available That's cheating.
not_available I thought you were good at this game.
not_available What the hell are you doing? 
not_available My shift ended an hour ago.
not_available Why? 
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available You cannot just wander off without telling me where you're going.
not_available Did you eat all this? Where did you get the money? 
not_available He bought it for me.
not_available Do you know what time it is? Did you take your shot? No? Look at him.
not_available He's hyperglycemic and ketotic.
not_available Did you not notice anything strange? He's diabetic.
not_available God, I can smell it from here.
not_available I thought he was a street kid.
not_available I didn't know he was your patient.
not_available He's my son.
not_available Hi.
not_available Sorry to bother you.
not_available Are you stalking me? Got his first x
not_available ray.
not_available His heart and lungs look good.
not_available He's fighting.
not_available Told you.
not_available Maybe you should get off your feet for
not_available I just wanna stay here a while.
not_available Okay.
not_available He shouldn't have to die alone.
not_available Was this a bad idea? Oh, no, no, I love dogs.
not_available I grew up with dogs.
not_available My parents had a cattle farm outside of Gary.
not_available So you were a farm boy? I still would be if my mother hadn't insisted on my going to college.
not_available What about your parents? Wanna hold her? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available My mom is a secretary.
not_available Was a secretary.
not_available She wanted me to be a flight attendant.
not_available Really? Yeah, that wasn't happening.
not_available She died a few years ago.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available What about your father? He's still in Chicago.
not_available He's a test pilot for Barcalounger.
not_available He must be pretty proud of you.
not_available You're not close? Not really.
not_available That's a shame.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It happens.
not_available I have a daughter named Karen.
not_available Yeah? Yeah, I haven't I haven't talked to her in years.
not_available You should try to reconnect.
not_available No, it's not gonna happen.
not_available You should call her.
not_available No, she blames me for things when When my wife died.
not_available I didn't see that coming either.
not_available Your wife died suddenly? No, no, not really.
not_available She had cancer.
not_available She fought it for a long time but we both knew she wasn't gonna beat it.
not_available Still, I guess I never expected it to end that way.
not_available I just had trouble I had a hard time accepting 
not_available the finality of it all.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Three
not_available forty.
not_available I didn't know he had diabetes.
not_available He's a kid.
not_available You're an adult.
not_available You're supposed to be a doctor.
not_available You didn't notice he was acting weird? Lots of kids his age are weird.
not_available What are you doing playing video games with a 9yearold? You give him ice cream, candy
not_available What's up with that? Can I discharge Mrs.
not_available Fionelli? 
not_available Find another Attending.
not_available I'm off.
not_available Oh, all right.
not_available Her pelvic sonogram results came back.
not_available She's got an ovarian cyst so I was just going to put her on a non
not_available steroidal.
not_available She had an abdominal CT scan? We were thinking diverticulitis.
not_available Flip over your chart.
not_available What? On the back of your chart there's a price list of all tests and labs.
not_available You ordered a CBC.
not_available That's what? 
not_available One hundred and forty dollars.
not_available A chem panel and UA? 
not_available Three hundred and fifty, and 90.
not_available What else? GC and chlamydia cultures, 300.
not_available IV start and a liter of saline, at least $200.
not_available Morphine's another 50.
not_available Abdomen and pelvic CT, 3000 easy.
not_available Did I miss anything? 
not_available Pelvic ultrasound, $750.
not_available $4880.
not_available You could have done a negative urine ICON to rule out ectopic for 15 bucks performed a thorough physical exam, treated her with a $2 dose of ibuprofen.
not_available This is why we can't provide health care for everyone.
not_available Hey, where's Logan? Rule
not_available out subarachnoid? She was in Curtain 2.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac discharged her.
not_available Oh, Neurology finally came down.
not_available Nope.
not_available I did an LP about four hours ago.
not_available You did what? She'd been waiting all day.
not_available Her fluid was clear.
not_available No blood, no xanthochromia, no subarachnoid.
not_available A spinal tap is the quickest, easiest way to rule out an SAH and it's 100
not_available percent sensitive.
not_available She was my patient.
not_available Yes, and if I hadn't treated her she'd still be here.
not_available Now she's at home feeling better.
not_available So that's it? This is how I'm supposed to learn? I do it your way or you take it away? I'm trying to teach you the way you practice medicine here is inefficient.
not_available Oh, and letting babies die is? You really think you saved that kid today? For what, 24
not_available hour nursing care? He's gonna probably require a lifetime of commitment.
not_available Are you gonna give it to him? I'm sorry I'm not in some mud hut doing amputations with a pocketknife.
not_available We have the technology and expertise to give that kid a chance.
not_available What's the sense of having it if we don't use it? That kid has about a 5
not_available percent chance of having a normal life.
not_available You know how many others we could? 
not_available I do everything I can for my patients.
not_available That's how I practice medicine.
not_available This is Chicago, not the damn Congo.
not_available Maybe you should just go back to Africa.
not_available Maybe you should go to Africa.
not_available I know you didn't just say that to me.
not_available Maybe you'd learn there's more to being a doctor than ordering tests and consults for every patient just to cover your ass.
not_available Stay away from my patients.
not_available From now on I'll present to another Attending.
not_available You can just take big bites, you know.
not_available The mortician will do what he can.
not_available I need the practice.
not_available All right, well, take your time.
not_available He's not going anywhere.
not_available What all will they take? His kidneys which would go to two people with end
not_available stage renal disease and that would free them from a lifetime of dialysis.
not_available His heart and lungs could go to as many as three people with cardiac and pulmonary disease.
not_available His pancreas and intestines would go to children as well as adults.
not_available His corneas would allow two people to see again.
not_available His skin, bones and other tissue will help treat burn victims.
not_available And his liver will be split into multiple transplants and used for children with birth defects that used to be fatal.
