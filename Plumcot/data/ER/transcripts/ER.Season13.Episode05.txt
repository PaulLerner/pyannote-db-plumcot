not_available You think it burst? No, he'd be dead.
not_available Probably just a steady leak.

not_available That's still out for repair.
not_available How are we? 
not_available Radiology brings one.
not_available How long? 
not_available Depends on how busy they are.

not_available My boss, he brought me in.
not_available I mean, I thought it was nothing but he didn't want me working until I got it checked out.
not_available How long is the wait? 
not_available Don't talk, please.
not_available How long until I see the doctor? I don't know.
not_available Could be 12 hours.
not_available Twelve hours? Twelve is good.
not_available We're not that busy.
not_available It's okay, Curtis.
not_available I'll get someone to cover.
not_available No, no, I can work.
not_available How about I just sign in and I come back later tonight? You could lose your place in line.
not_available So I just sit in the waiting room for 12 hours? That's how it works.
not_available Be right back.
not_available This seems kind of crazy.
not_available How about I get checked tomorrow? I need a note you're not contagious.
not_available I got insurance issues.
not_available Don't give this job away.
not_available I'm gonna be there tomorrow.
MAN Dr.
not_available Kovac, when did you first see Mr.
not_available Ames? I was working at the Admit desk when he signed in at triage.
AMES How long until I see the doctor? 
MARQUEZ It's hard to say.
not_available If you're stable, it could be up to 12 hours.
AMES Hours? We have a lot of sick people here.
not_available Let me just sign in and I just come back tonight.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We can't do that.
not_available So I gotta wait in the waiting room for 12 hours? I'll be right back.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available I can't do this.
not_available Everything okay, Chuny? Yeah, he'll settle down.
not_available Do not give the job away.
not_available I will be there.
not_available A lot of patients get angry about the wait.
not_available Nurse Marquez was able to defuse the situation before it escalated.

not_available Court.
not_available I heard you had to testify.
not_available It was fine.
not_available A lot of questions about procedure and policy.
not_available But I don't think they have a case.
not_available Here come the cavalry.
not_available Enlighten me.
not_available Hypotensive pulsatile abdominal mass.
not_available Say no more.
not_available Redline to the O.R.
not_available We're waiting on ultrasound.
CRENSHAW Wrong.
not_available We're not waiting on ultrasound? Neela, what happens when we wait for diagnostic tests on a ruptured triple A? Attempts to stabilize are fruitless.
not_available Investigations delay therapy, increase risk of exsanguination.
not_available With a 90
not_available percent mortality.
not_available His crit's not so bad, 32.
not_available Meaningless drivel.
not_available What if it's not triple A? 
not_available Then something else.
GATES Radiology's bringing over the ultrasound now.
not_available He'd be dead.
not_available It'll be seconds.
not_available Zip it, Sparky.
not_available Look, we're admitting him.
not_available Sparky? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available Did you need me to keep bagging? Sure, as long as you don't talk.
not_available Oh, by the way, Abby Lockhart.
not_available Lovely to meet you.
not_available Shh.
not_available When did you assume responsibility for Mr.
not_available Ames' care? The nurse was concerned about his oxygen level so she asked me to see him.
not_available Curtis Ames? Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available What? What is that? 
not_available Uh, low oxygen.
not_available Or just maybe a dirty fingernail.
not_available Wood stains.
not_available They don't wash off so good.
not_available What kind of work do you do? Custom carpentry.
not_available Doors, built
not_available in bookshelves, armoires, you name it.
not_available My father had a wood shop when I was a kid.
not_available I used to play with the shavings from the lathe.
not_available I love the smell.
not_available How did it sound? 
not_available Well, like pneumonia.
not_available You should be admitted to the hospital.
not_available Admitted? Yeah, stay for a couple of days.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I start a custom remodel today.
not_available Your temp is 102, your oxygen level is down to 90 and your x
not_available ray shows your right middle lobe is full of infection.
not_available Look, if you wanna get better, we need to give you IV antibiotics, okay? 
WOMAN After he examined you, then what happened? He left me with a nurse who couldn't start an IV.
MARQUEZ Okay, this time, I get a flash.
not_available Good.
not_available That's good, right? But it won't thread.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Keep pressure on this.
not_available I know the drill.
not_available Anyone ever tell you you have bad veins? How about just giving me a shot in the butt? The antibiotics are ordered IV.
not_available Can I talk to my doctor? He's with a trauma patient right now.
not_available How about after he's done? It could be a while.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Fourth time's a charm.
WOMAN And how long was it before Dr.
not_available Kovac came to your bedside? It was more than an hour.
not_available Uh, I saw him working on a computer.
not_available He was talking to some nurses.
not_available Then he had a bagel with cream cheese.
not_available I think it was poppy seed.
not_available And how did that make you feel? Objection, irrelevant.
not_available On the contrary, Your Honor it goes to state of mind and ability to make decisions.
not_available Overruled.
not_available You may answer.
not_available I felt alone.
not_available Forgotten.
not_available Like nobody there cared about me.
ABBY I'm just saying, he's a frail old man who deserves the benefit of diagnostic confirmation.
CRENSHAW The patient is now on the surgical service, not the ER service.
not_available Go downstairs, pull a cockroach out of someone's ear.
ABBY Neela.
NEELA He's not stable, Abby.
SHIRLEY BP's 90 systolic.
ABBY Five minutes for an ultrasound is not gonna kill him.
GATES I picked up a sterile sleeve.
CRENSHAW Why do you insist on annoying me? 
GATES Only take a few minutes.
CRENSHAW Ten blade.
not_available Want these two out of my O.R.
not_available Shirley, call Security.
ABBY All right, all right.
NEELA Dab the bleeders.
GATES Nice working with you.
CRENSHAW Bovie.
not_available Stand back.
NEELA Irrigation saline.
SHIRLEY Code red.
KATEY Oh, my God! 
CRENSHAW Unplug the Bovie.
not_available Unplug the Bovie.
not_available And turn off that oxygen before the whole room goes up.
MAN Dr.
not_available Kovac, when the nurses couldn't start an IV what action did you take? I knew I needed to place a catheter into a deeper vein.
not_available How are you doing? I didn't know you ordered acupuncture.
not_available I'm Sonya Ames.
not_available Hi, Luka Kovac.
not_available Thanks for taking care of him.
not_available Well, since we can't get an IV in your arm I'd like to place a central line under your collarbone.
not_available That sounds pretty involved.
not_available We need a route to give IV antibiotics or we cannot treat the pneumonia effectively.
not_available I'll numb up your skin and guide the catheter in at the top of your chest.
not_available There are risks of bleeding, infection, collapsed lung but all of those can be treated.
not_available I gotta think about it.
not_available I gotta think about it.
not_available Wait, no, he doesn't.
not_available He If you need some time to consider He's just being stubborn.
not_available He hasn't been to a doctor in 20 years.
not_available I never get sick, baby.
not_available You can barely catch your breath, you've been coughing so much.
AMES It's not that bad, really.
not_available I just want him to get better.
not_available We'll do whatever it takes, okay? Well, if you want the procedure, you need to sign this form.
not_available Now, come on, baby, I've gotta get back to work.
KOVAC He didn 't wanna be in the ER.
not_available He didn't like doctors.
not_available So I felt I needed to treat him aggressively.
not_available He said it was the only way to go.
not_available If he left, I was worried he'd get worse and wouldn't come back.
not_available He told me complications were rare.
not_available It was no big deal, that he does these every day.
not_available His wife works, he's all alone.
not_available My opinion didn't matter.
not_available If he took pills, he could've died at home and no one would know.
not_available He gave me and my wife no other options, no other choices.
not_available We were both really, really scared.
not_available Can we grab you a sandwich? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Hey, Timmy, uh, is Abby around? No, no, if she's in surgery, then don't bother.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll try later.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tricuspid regurg.
not_available Ah, the irony.
not_available A bad heart valve.
not_available Left him with right
not_available sided failure and a big pulsating liver.
not_available So the mass was his liver? 
not_available Yep.
not_available And the fire saved him from unnecessary surgery.
not_available A slightly scorched med student and some burned drapes saved the guy's life.
not_available Lucky guy.
not_available Had minor burns.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Forget how to use that thing? No, I just Didn't wanna be one of those mothers who checks in with the babysitter every hour.
not_available My babysitter used to tie me to my high chair.
not_available I'm sure yours is much better.
WOMAN After your first dose of antibiotics how long were you in the ER? A long time.
not_available Over three days.
not_available Three days? In the ER? They said that there were no other beds in the hospital, so Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom.
not_available I'll let your nurse know.
not_available I don't think that I'll be able to 
not_available I said, I'll let your nurse know.
not_available It's kind of urgent, please.
not_available Plea 
WOMAN So you stayed in the hall all that time? 
AMES They put me in the back at night so that I could try to get some sleep.
OLBES Louie partied a little too hard.
not_available I'd say we're dealing with coke, PCP and ETOH.
not_available Pulled out his line.
not_available You're gonna need hard restraints.
LOUIE I'll rip your head off, I swear.
AMES They kept saying I'd get a regular room after the first day but it never happened.
not_available Nurse? Ahem.
not_available Nurse, I, uh, never got my breakfast.
not_available You may be NPO.
not_available What is that? I have to look at your orders.
not_available Where's, uh, Dr.
not_available Kovac? He's not working today.
not_available So who's my doctor, then? I have to check.
KOVAC Every 12 hours an oncoming Resident assumed responsibility for Mr.
not_available Ames' care.
not_available His progress was discussed.
not_available He was improving.
WOMAN So it was the nurses who were watching him more closely? 
KOVAC Yes.
WOMAN The state recommends an ER patienttonurse ratio of 4to
not_available 1.
not_available Yet during Mr.
not_available Ames' stay, the ratio was 8to
not_available 1.
not_available That's eight patients for every nurse.
not_available How is that possible? Well, we can't control how many patients come into the ER.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, you know that those standards are in place for patient safety.
not_available So on a day when the standards were off by a factor of 100 percent did you discuss this with a hospital administrator? 
not_available No.
not_available With the director of Nursing? No, no, it's not uncommon With a nurse manager? Look, we're always short
not_available staffed.
WOMAN Did you bring this deficiency to anyone's attention or do anything to address the situation? It doesn't work like that.
not_available Mariko Shimane, history of Crohn's disease, vomited blood twice.
not_available Systolic's 88.
not_available Two liters of saline, type and cross four.
not_available Is there anyone we can call, Mariko? 
not_available Doctor Derezin.
not_available From Gastroenterology.
not_available How about a family member? 
not_available Just me and my son.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Oregon.
not_available Sophomore in college.
not_available We can call him.
not_available He'd wanna know.
not_available I'm in the hospital a lot.
not_available Your condition is pretty serious.
not_available That's what they always say.
not_available Upper GI bleed? Sure looks like it.
not_available Hello, Mariko.
not_available Sorry to bother you, Neil.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Any blood in your stool? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She didn't mention that.
not_available Red blood? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Endoscopy here or in the GI lab? Excuse us for a minute.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, dude on Line 2 says he's your brother.
not_available Yeah, take a message.
not_available And, Doc Lockhart, Big Daddy called while you were upstairs.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I can't scope her.
not_available Why not? Crohn's can cause inflammation, erosion into a vessel along the intestinal tract.
not_available Twenty
not_available five feet of possibilities.
not_available Not something I can reach.
not_available She needs surgical exploration.
not_available I'll call the O.R.
not_available So, what's the good news? We're gonna move you to a different room.
not_available It looks like you need an operation.
not_available Again? Maybe it's time to call your son? He's got midterms, no.
not_available On the afternoon of his third hospital day Mr.
not_available Ames complained of numbness in the left hand.
MAN And what was your impression? 
KOVAC How long did it last? 
AMES About 10 minutes.
not_available Okay, squeeze my hands.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now spread your fingers like this.
not_available Don't let me close them.
not_available Good.
not_available Well, what do you think happened? It could be a number of things.
not_available How's it feel now? Back to normal? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available The same on both sides? It's kind of weird.
not_available You probably compressed a nerve while you were resting on your side.
not_available I've slept on floors more comfortable than this bed.
not_available Here, let me take care of that.
not_available Hi, Bed Control? Yeah, this is Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Yeah, I need a med
not_available surge bed for my patient, please.
WOMAN And when did the numbness return? It was about three hours later.
WOMAN And was there something different about this episode? 
not_available Didn't have any feeling for half an hour.
not_available You're okay now? It's worse.
not_available Went up higher.
not_available Where is Dr.
not_available Kovac? He checked.
not_available He said you were okay.
not_available I'm not okay.
not_available I need to talk to him.
not_available Not right now.
not_available Why? Where is he? He's taking care of a patient with a heart attack.
not_available Tell him to come and see me.
not_available When he's through.
not_available No, no, now.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ames, there are people in this ER who are much sicker and need immediate attention.
not_available Hey.
not_available If he won't come to see me, then I'm gonna go to him.
not_available Get back in bed.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available I need to talk to my doctor.
not_available I need you on the monitor.
not_available Frank, help me.
not_available Take it easy, fella.
not_available Take it easy? You people have ignored me for three days.
not_available No one tells me what's going on.
not_available Nobody gives a damn, no one will talk to me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ames, sit down.
not_available How am I supposed to take it easy? I am not sitting down until my doctor does what he's supposed to do.
MARQUEZ I need some help here.
not_available Open your eyes, sir.
FRANK Let's get a gurney over here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ames? Look at me.
not_available Luka, he had a stroke.
not_available Up
not_available going toe.
not_available CT can take him now.
not_available Okay, we're on our way.
KOVAC We recognized the stroke, immediately moved him for monitoring and had him to CT as soon as possible.
not_available From what I remember is, it was pretty chaotic.
not_available Why should this guy have a stroke? 
not_available No idea.
not_available Follow my finger, sir.
not_available Sir, look over here.
not_available Over here.
not_available Frank, I need a monitored bed.
FRANK There aren't any.
not_available Okay, Trauma 2, then.
not_available GSW just took it.
KOVAC Let's move him to CT.
FRANK CT is backed up for a half
not_available hour.
KOVAC Where can we put him? 
MARQUEZ I'll see what I can find.
KOVAC Chart, I need his chart.
FRANK I'm looking for it.
KOVAC Where's the chart? 
MARQUEZ I never saw it.
not_available It's okay, take deep breaths.
not_available Where's Surgery? Crenshaw called, patient's not a candidate for anesthesia till systolic's up to 80.
PRATT All right, tank her up.
not_available Eight French cordis in femoral.
not_available You know, I have another idea.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Hey, has anyone seen a Pocket Doppler? 
not_available Uh, yeah, top drawer by the sink.
not_available All right.
not_available What about an intraaortic balloon? This girl in heart failure? 
not_available No, it's a GI bleed.
not_available What? Inflate the balloon in the chest block off the blood supply to the abdomen.
not_available No, you can't do that.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Why not? That's a great idea.
not_available She's not your patient.
not_available AdiÃ³s, Gates.
not_available Could be a publishable case report.
not_available A non
not_available invasive way to occlude the aorta.
not_available It'll stop the bleeding.
not_available Oh, crap, crap, crap.
not_available What? Pratt, can you come with me? Four units of red cells, one of FFP, a 10
not_available pack of platelets.
not_available We'll be right back.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, what is this? Some kind of postpartum power trip? 
not_available Hey, the aortic balloon will work.
not_available It's an unproven therapy.
not_available You'd let her bleed to death? 
not_available No, have the surgeons take her to O.R.
not_available Doesn't look like that's gonna happen.
not_available What's your problem? It cuts off all circulation to the bowel, liver, kidneys and legs.
not_available Everything could die from the chest down.
not_available What are we doing in here? You know, you used to be such a cowboy.
not_available Why is this a big deal? 
not_available I don't agree.
not_available Gates thinks it'll work.
not_available Gates is a knucklehead who'd defibrillate with a car battery and jumper cables.
not_available I am the Attending.
not_available The buck stops here.
not_available So if there's gonna be a bad outcome let Surgery be to blame for not showing up.
not_available So you'd let her die? No, I just don't wanna be the guy who kills her with some crazy
not_available ass therapy.
not_available Oh, look, this is her last chance.
not_available She's pre
not_available arrest.
not_available If her pressure continues to drop despite massive transfusions I would consider What are you doing? I'm pumping.
not_available Sorry, my boobs are about to explode.
WOMAN When did your wife arrive? Right after the CAT scan.
not_available By then I could talk again, you know.
not_available Looks okay.
not_available I still can't move my arm and leg.
not_available There's no mass, no bleeding.
not_available That's That's good.
not_available Then, why did he have a stroke? Probably a blood clot in a brain artery.
not_available But, uh, there is something we can try.
not_available What? What should I do? A medicine called TPA could probably dissolve the clot.
not_available You're saying that could work? That I might? I can get better, right? There is some chance of recovery and, uh, full recovery We've gotta do something.
not_available What about the side effects? There's always side effects.
not_available Well, there is a 10 percent chance of, uh, bleeding in the brain causing more disability and death.
not_available Ten percent chance of recovery? There's a 10 percent chance of death? What if we don't use the drug? There can be some improvement, uh, with time and physical therapy but probably not a full recovery.
not_available Ah Look, look.
not_available I've been in this hospital Iong enough to know that if something can go wrong it I don't want it.
not_available And what do you recall of Mr.
not_available Ames' reaction to your recommendation of TPA? I brought in Dr.
not_available Saunders, a neurologist to try to explain options in an objective manner.
not_available The statistics are averages for all patients, even ones in their 70s and 80s.
KOVAC Your risk of bleeding is much less, given your age and the fact that it's been only 90 minutes since the onset of symptoms.
not_available I don't know.
not_available The TPA is your only shot at complete recovery.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I'm not taking it.
not_available Settle down, baby.
not_available Look, if it was me, I'd take the TPA.
not_available If it was you, you'd be in intensive care with 10 doctors and nurses watching your ass every second, day and night.
SONYA Curtis.
not_available You wouldn't be getting the runaround for three days.
not_available Not sleeping, not eating, pissing in a pan.
not_available And now I am supposed to trust you with a medicine that can kill me when all I've seen since I've been here is total incompetence? 
MAN Mr.
not_available Ames, did you refuse a therapy that had the potential to reverse the stroke? There were no guarantees.
not_available Experts have agreed that TPA gave you the only chance for a complete recovery.
not_available And you didn't want it? It was, uh, a lot more complicated than that, really Did you refuse a medicine that could have cured you? I refused what they were pushing, and you would have done the same thing.
not_available So you did refuse the cure.
not_available Systolic's only 50 after four units.
not_available All right, hang another two units.
not_available Uh, I'm above the diaphragm.
not_available Go ahead, inject.
not_available I'm putting in 40 cc's of saline.
not_available Let's hope this damn thing works.
not_available Doc Lock, you got a call.
not_available Kind of busy right now.
not_available Balloon is up.
not_available It's your babysitter.
not_available They said it was important.
not_available Pressure's up to 90.
not_available All right, go ahead.
not_available Go, take it.
not_available We're out of the woods.
not_available Mark the time.
not_available Surgeons have one hour to get her up and fix her or the game is over.
not_available Hello? 
SAM They should be here any minute.
WOMAN What's happening? 
not_available We've got your bleeding controlled Is he hungry? Did you try the stroller? 
SAM Thanks for joining us.
not_available What's up with the fluoro? I thought ER docs had x
not_available ray vision.
not_available Put the phone next to his ear.
not_available Stopped a Crohn's patient from intra
not_available abdominal exsanguination.
not_available Rather unconventional.
not_available Dare I say, idiotic? 
SAM It worked.
not_available BP's 122/78.
not_available Cross
not_available clamp without thoracotomy.
not_available It's cool.
not_available What's not cool, her kidneys will be dead in an hour.
not_available Go, clock's ticking.
not_available Abby? It's his favorite song.
not_available Puts him to sleep.
not_available Aren't you glad you don't work here? 
not_available She's auditioning for American Idol.
not_available Hey, nice work, Abby.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Upstairs, the neurologists recognized a faint mid
not_available systolic murmur.
not_available What does that mean? A murmur is from turbulent blood flow through the heart.
WOMAN So because of the murmur, a cardiac echo was ordered showing patent foramen ovale.
not_available Do you know what a patent foramen ovale is, Dr.
not_available Kovac? A small hole between the upper chambers of the heart.
not_available So that hole could have allowed a blood clot from your subclavian catheter to pass from the right side to the left side of the heart.
not_available And then up to the brain? It could happen, but that's extremely rare.
not_available I didn't ask you how rare it was, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I asked whether a patent foramen provides a pathway for a clot to travel to the brain and cause a stroke? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So if you had heard the murmur if you had pulled the catheter when numbness began is it possible that you could have prevented Mr.
not_available Ames' stroke? Objection.
not_available Calls for speculation.
not_available Sustained.
not_available When the numbness began, did you consider a cardiac source or did you ignore an important warning sign of impending stroke? I didn't ignore anything.
not_available I considered what was probable and acted accordingly.
not_available After Mr.
not_available Ames complained of numbness did you then appreciate his heart murmur? The ER is a noisy place.
not_available You can't always hear subtle murmurs.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, I'm not asking you about the noise level in your ER.
not_available I'm asking, did you, at any time in the three days that you cared for Mr.
not_available Ames recognize his heart murmur? At the time of Mr.
not_available Ames' numbness, there were 47 patients in the ER 82 in the waiting room.
not_available I was taking care of a mother who was the victim of domestic violence nearly beaten to death, an 8yearold hit by a car 
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available And a 53yearold heart
not_available attack victim.
not_available There are always sicker patients in the ER and it was reasonable to believe that Mr.
not_available Ames' numbness could wait.
JUDGE Order.
not_available Only one can speak at a time.
not_available Your Honor, I move to strike that tirade be stricken as nonresponsive and I request the court admonish the witness to answer.
JUDGE Restate the question.
not_available And, doctor, I'm instructing you to answer.
WOMAN If you had heard the murmur is it possible you could have prevented the stroke? 
MAN Objection.
not_available Possibility is not the issue.
JUDGE Sustained.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, is it true that you could have prevented the stroke? Well, doctor? 
not_available Counselor, I'm warning you.
not_available No need, I'm done with this witness.
not_available Scabies family went home and Lost Rectal Thermometer went up to Surgery.
not_available Gates needs you for an extubation in Trauma 2.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm here till 7.
not_available Call if you get a break.
not_available Any news from Kovac? 
not_available Not yet.
CHAZ Greg.
not_available Hey.
not_available Am I too early? 
not_available Yeah, just have a seat in triage.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available All right.
not_available It's Abby, right? Yes.
not_available Oh, hi, sorry about your arms.
not_available It's okay.
not_available They fixed me up pretty good.
not_available Med school wants me to make a chart for insurance.
not_available Oh, it's no problem, I got it.
not_available Thank you, Ray.
not_available Thanks, Ray.
not_available I guess we can do it in Curtain 4.
not_available Great.
RAY Might need a little dÃ©bridement.
not_available Go for it.
not_available So your shift almost over? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available They're giving me two days off to heal.
not_available That's very generous of the surgeons.
not_available First free night in forever.
not_available Have you been to Rednofive? Uh, no.
not_available They remodeled, and I hear the DJ on Thursday nights is ridiculous.
not_available You wanna check it out tonight? 
MAN Both emergency and infectious
not_available disease experts agree that Dr.
not_available Kovac gave superior treatment and above and beyond the standard of care.
not_available The stroke was a oneina
not_available million complication that no one could have either predicted or prevented.
not_available And Dr.
not_available Kovac treats the patients that no other doctor will treat.
not_available His ER is the safety net for millions with no health insurance.
not_available Every day, he is out there on the front lines providing the best health care possible for the people who need it the most.
not_available If you find against Dr.
not_available Kovac what message do you send to other health
not_available care providers like him who make that daily struggle their personal mission? Dr.
not_available Kovac could have sent Mr.
not_available Ames home with antibiotic pills, but he didn't.
not_available He assumed that Mr.
not_available Ames was unreliable, that he couldn't be trusted and so Dr.
not_available Kovac took responsibility for his care.
not_available And then he abandoned that responsibility by subjecting Mr.
not_available Ames to substandard conditions in an understaffed ER where that man was shoved into a corner and neglected.
not_available And the warning signs of a major stroke were ignored resulted in a devastating disability.
not_available Before the stroke, Mr.
not_available Ames was a skilled craftsman.
not_available He supported a wife and two children.
not_available And now, with a paralyzed left arm, loss of perception in his left visual field that livelihood has been taken away.
not_available Loss of income, loss of self
not_available esteem, has resulted in profound stress and led to a divorce and separation from his children.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ames now lives alone.
not_available He's trying to get by on a disability benefit of $ 1300 a month.
not_available He cannot drive, he sees his children one day a week and he is being treated for depression.
not_available Your award must fairly compensate Mr.
not_available Ames for past and ongoing medical care, for 25 years of lost wages and for the pain and suffering that this man will experience every day for the rest of his life.
ABBY And you wanna make sure that this part rests against your rib cage not your armpits, and then Oop.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You sure those things are safe? 
not_available Yeah, they just need an adjustment.
not_available Or you can go to the pharmacy and get a new pair.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Careful.
NEELA Should we sign you in as a trauma patient? I would say yes, but my shift is over.
not_available Call me if your spleen ruptures.
not_available Excuse me, hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Pratt around? 
not_available He's with a patient.
not_available Can I help you? He told me he was gonna be right back.
not_available Will you let him know Chaz is waiting? Okay.
not_available Hey, Neela, you have a minute? 
not_available I have 12 hours.
not_available I'm on all night.
not_available It's about Katey, your med student.
not_available Ray.
not_available Hey, hey, she asked me out, all right? Residents are not allowed to date their students.
not_available Not my student.
not_available Never will be.
not_available She's not doing an ER elective, it's not against policy.
not_available Well, then, why even ask? Thanks.
not_available Appreciate your help.
not_available I'm sorry, I gotta go.
not_available Tell Greg I'll call him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Mayday.
not_available Hello.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Small bowel obstruction.
not_available Good times.
not_available So, uh, how's the guy who went up in flames? Minor partial burns to the chest and abdomen.
not_available You know, I hear his aorta was just fine.
not_available There's a lesson to be learned here.
not_available Wise men say only fools rush in Oh, you missed a guy called Chaz.
not_available He left? You were saying? Hey, Chaz, Chaz, hold up, man.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available I got caught up with a patient.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Now, come on, man.
not_available Sounded like something serious.
not_available It's all good.
not_available Hey.
not_available Things are just not going so well at home.
not_available Really? When I wanna study, it's too noisy.
not_available When I wanna bring my friends over, Dad won't let me.
not_available I'm always late to class because the commute takes forever.
not_available What about the dorm? Costs too much.
not_available When you saw me earlier, I was looking for apartments.
not_available But they all kind of sucked.
not_available Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy but I was thinking, maybe I could move into your place.
not_available My place? Yeah, your place.
not_available I mean, it's close to campus.
not_available I can get a part
not_available time job to help you with the rent.
not_available I'm quiet.
not_available We'll probably never even see each other.
not_available You're serious? Ah, Chaz, come on, man.
not_available You know, I got my own style.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available You say the word, and I'm gonna clear out for you.
not_available And if it doesn't work out, I'll be gone real fast, man.
not_available Never mind, it's a bad idea.
not_available All right, look Let's try it for a month.
not_available For real? Yeah, I'll talk to your mom.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm gonna holler at you.
not_available All right, man, take it easy.
not_available Hey.
not_available Haha
not_available ha.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, uh, how was the first day back? It was a piece of cake.
not_available Like riding a bike.
not_available Oh, yeah? You miss your little man? Yeah, but that's okay.
not_available I'll bond with him again when I feed him at 11 and 2 and 5 a.m.
not_available But you know what was nice about today? For 12 hours, I talked like a grownup to grownups.
not_available Well, except for when you had to deal with the surgeons.
not_available Yeah, at least they don't spit up on you.
not_available Much.
not_available Good night.
not_available Try to get some rest.
not_available It's a nice idea.
not_available How long do you think they'll deliberate? Shouldn't take more than a day or two.
not_available Ames' lawyer is a publicity hound.
not_available The local news is having a field day trashing County.
not_available It'd be good to get you in front of the press as the doctor found not guilty.
not_available Well, you are very optimistic.
not_available People need to hear our side of the story to reassure them that the County health system works.
not_available During that videotape, did you see the looks on the jury's faces? Doctors get sued for ignoring and undertreating patients not for doing too much.
not_available Plus, you did a great job on the stand.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I've been to at least a hundred trials.
not_available I can tell when a jury likes the doctor.
not_available WOMAN 
1 He's just another greedy MD getting rich by overtreating.
not_available WOMAN 
2 What are you talking about? 
not_available I've read about it.
not_available The drug companies give kickbacks to doctors who use their expensive drugs.
not_available WOMAN 
2 The judge instructed us not to decide this case based on anything we've heard outside.
not_available WOMAN 
1 They neglected this guy for three days.
not_available WOMAN 
2 His pneumonia was improving.
MAN That doctor used a hand grenade to kill a mosquito.
not_available To me, that's bad medical judgment.
not_available WOMAN 
2 You're not a doctor.
not_available We've got to decide this based on the expert witness definition of the standard of care.
not_available WOMAN 
1 Well, when you're talking about County General the term "standard of care" is a joke.
MAN That's right.
not_available Kovac is part of the system.
not_available And we all know the system sucks.
