not_available Easy, Luka, come on.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Oh You need to be monitored for at least an hour.
not_available I'm fine, Kerry, okay? 
not_available Luka, you were paralyzed and intubated.
not_available You belong in the ICU.
not_available Hey.
not_available All right, get him a stool.
not_available Pressure's up to 110 on two liters, crit's 35, fetal heart tones, 160.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available How are you doing? How'd I get here? 
not_available You passed out, you were bleeding.
not_available I had a cramp.
not_available Probably vagal from the pain.
not_available Has it stopped now? It seems to have slowed down.
MORRIS No sign of abruption, baby's moving around.
not_available Looks healthy.
not_available Congratulations, it's a boy.
not_available Could be a placenta previa.
not_available Uh No, I don't have previa.
not_available They saw a lowlying placenta on the 20
not_available week ultrasound.
not_available That would explain the bleeding.
not_available You may need a C I don't need a C

not_available Okay, get him something to hold him over, but make it quick.
not_available Come on, Alex.
not_available No, Alex stays with me.
not_available I'll take her, let's go.
not_available I'll be back, okay? 
MARY Hey, get me some chips.
not_available I'm hitting the head.
not_available Come on, stand up straight.
not_available Be a man.
not_available You're not a little kid anymore.
not_available Oh, shoot.
not_available I think you're gonna really like Canada.
not_available I like Chicago.
MORRIS More cricoid, Ray.
RAY I'm about to crack the larynx.
MORRIS It's a big floppy epiglottis.
not_available I can't see, it's a long neck.
not_available Eighty
not_available two on the pulse ox.
not_available Pull out the bag.
not_available Give me the flipper.
not_available If we can't get this in then we're gonna need a straight long blade.
not_available You okay? Let me know when the sats are up.
not_available Tight wheezing throughout.
not_available All right, sit down.
not_available Get him an albuterol neb.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available It's bronchospasm.
not_available You probably aspirated some saliva.
KOVAC Guys, I can do this.
not_available If you don't get treated, I'm gonna have two patients to intubate.
not_available Grab an LMA, just in case.
not_available Pressure's down again.
RAY Autotransfuse from the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Okay, let me take a look.
not_available How is he? He's okay, Frank.
not_available Did somebody call his mom? I'll do that right now.
not_available She can meet us up in the O.R.
not_available Yeah, let's hope so.
not_available Hey, grab what you need.
not_available You planning on paying for those? No stealing, baby.
not_available Yeah, these people work for a living.
HALEH He's bradying down.
not_available Should I get Weaver? If you enter the trachea, you'll feel clicks when you pass over the cartilaginous rings.
not_available Heart rate's only 50.
not_available Click.
not_available Click.
not_available Click.
KOVAC Hold it right there.
not_available Ray, pass an 8
not_available 0.
not_available All right.
RAY Here you go.
not_available Okay, advance the tube.
not_available No, it doesn't wanna pass.
not_available Down to 40, amp of atropine.
not_available Rotate counterclockwise.
not_available It's caught up on something.
not_available There we go.
not_available Okay.
not_available End
not_available tidal CO2.
not_available Sensor is yellow.
not_available Yellow means yes.
not_available Thought you were bringing him.
not_available Problem.
not_available We're ready.
not_available His pressure? 
not_available Up to 95 systolic.
not_available Four units.
not_available Two liters autotransfused off cell saver.
not_available Everybody upstairs is doing everything we can to help you guys out.
not_available Well, baby looks good, but you are definitely contracting.
not_available I don't feel anything.
not_available Sometimes you don't.
not_available I think the belly trauma put you into preterm labor.
not_available Baby's head dropped down, caused placental bleeding.
not_available Okay, well, it's too soon, so give me terbutaline.
not_available Come on, you need magnesium.
not_available I know you know that.
not_available I remember all the times you gave it when you were a nurse.
not_available Mag makes you feel like crap.
not_available So why don't we just start with terb? Terbutaline can mask the signs and symptoms of abruption.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available Today you're the patient, not the doctor.
not_available I'm not having an abruption.
not_available Not right now, but the trauma puts you at risk.
not_available And if you do abrupt, we need to know right away.
not_available So you could do a Csection? Four
not_available gram load, then two an hour.
NURSE Yeah.
not_available Let me know if you have any more pain.
not_available Okay.
MARY You got my chips? 
RAFE Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available That the key to the restroom? 
not_available Yeah, but it's nasty there.
not_available No, no, we need to leave.
not_available Let the girl take a pee.
not_available We can't hold it in like you guys.
not_available Hey, can I have my chips? I'm starving.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Next time you try something like that, I'll take it out on your kid.
not_available You're definitely not contracting.
not_available Contractions don't last this long.
COBURN When did the pain start? 
not_available About 15 minutes ago.
not_available How bad, one to 10? I don't know, like a four, maybe.
not_available But it's probably just a bruise from when I fell down.
not_available I just need some Tylenol or something.
not_available Well, there's no evidence of abruption.
not_available Great.
not_available See? I told you.
not_available CBC with platelets, PT/PTT fibrinogen, D
not_available dimer and FDPs.
not_available Why? What for? Twenty percent of abruptions have ultrasound findings.
not_available Let's send the labs to be sure.
not_available Baby looks great, heart rate's good, excellent variability.
not_available Abby, Abby, hey, Abby.
not_available Here's what I would say to you if you weren't a doctor.
not_available The placenta separates from the womb and bleeds the baby can be deprived of oxygen.
not_available Now, even if we don't see a blood clot the labs will give us advanced warning before the baby's in trouble.
not_available Okay.
not_available Twelve of betamethasone.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available We have to mature the baby's lungs in case of an emergent No, no, no.
not_available I have two and a half months left to go.
not_available This baby is not coming until then.
not_available That's what we're all hoping for.
not_available I can wait two more weeks.
not_available The risk of prematurity goes way down at that point.
not_available I can wait, I'll go on bed rest, I'll use a bedpan, I won't move.
not_available You know that I want you to have a healthy baby.
not_available Why do you keep focusing on a worst
not_available case scenario? That's her job.
not_available Eight monitored beds good to go.
not_available Night staff's been called? 
not_available All coming in except two.
not_available You check on Sam? My guy at the district called, still no leads.
not_available OEMC's on the line, wanna know where we're at.
not_available Tell them we can take four critical paramedic runs.
not_available Back on bypass till we see how we're doing.
not_available Got people for treatment.
not_available We'll take care of it.
not_available Chuny, let's set up fast track in the west lobby.
not_available Speed through anybody who doesn't need x
not_available rays or labs.
not_available Pratt.
not_available All right, I'll help set it up.
not_available Great.
not_available How long is this gonna take? 
not_available What are you doing? 
RAFE Shut up.
not_available You're gonna get us all killed.
not_available Relax, train's probably a mile away.
not_available Oh, son of a bitch.
not_available All right, everybody be cool.
not_available Nobody gets hurt.
not_available License and proof of insurance.
not_available We're on our way to the lake so my son can get some fishing in before dark.
not_available It's his birthday.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available That's good.
not_available He's just gonna give us a ticket.
not_available What's he doing back there? 
STEVE He's a local yokel, man.
not_available This is the most excitement he's had all day.
not_available Probably calling for backup.
not_available Sammy.
not_available Every cop within a 1000
not_available mile radius knows what you look like.
not_available He's taking too long, screw it.
not_available Ah So they're trying to find the source of the bleeding and tie it off.
not_available Oh, my Jerry's not the hardy type.
not_available I only hope he doesn't wilt under all this.
not_available He had a good blood pressure and good pulse when he left the ER, so Oh, the ER.
not_available This would never have happened if he didn't insist on working at that fakakta cesspool.
not_available Well, as long as the surgeons find the bleeding and stop it, he should be fine.
not_available He could have gone to law school, you know.
not_available I didn't realize that.
not_available I myself sent the application to Harvard.
not_available Harvard.
not_available But, no, he wouldn't go.
not_available Oh, that's, uh 
not_available Jerry got into Harvard, wow.
not_available No, they rejected him.
not_available Four times.
not_available But that's not the point.
not_available No, of course it isn't.
not_available So how much is all this gonna cost us? 
not_available Um I don't really know.
not_available I mean, I'm sure his health insurance will cover it.
not_available Oh, but they don't cover the deductibles, do they? You know who covers the deductibles? Me, I cover the deductibles.
not_available Why don't you wait here, okay? And I will talk about this with you as much as you want.
not_available But I'll go see how he's doing first.
not_available He doesn't have any savings, you know.
not_available But why would he? He can barely survive off that weekly insult you people call a paycheck.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available A bullet nicked the right ventricle.
not_available Damn it, I was hoping it missed the heart.
DUBENKO Another 3.0 Prolene on a pledget.
SHIRLEY Eighth unit going up.
ARl Systolic's 85.
not_available I mean, a cardiac defect isn't so bad.
not_available It's repairable, right? It's not like he needs a pneumonectomy.

ARl T
not_available waves aren't peaked, but we've got ST elevation.
not_available He's having a heart attack.
ARl What about hypocalcemia? 
DUBENKO Could be high doses of citrates with the transfusions.
not_available Amp of calcium chloride.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Dubenko.
not_available Not now, Neela.
not_available Epi's onboard.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, but is it possible the suture is tying off a coronary artery? What? 
not_available Lf you occluded the coronary artery with the stitch, you'd have an MI.
not_available That's a good call.
not_available I'm near the RCA.
not_available Eleven blade.
SHIRLEY Charged to 20.
not_available You could see inside the field? I just had a hunch.
DUBENKO Sutures cut.
not_available Clear.
ARl Sinus.
not_available Way to go.
DUBENKO Okay, we'll go on bypass for a coronary graft.
not_available Call the perfusionist.
not_available We'll reposition for a clamshell.
not_available Neela, scrub in.
not_available I need another set of hands here.
not_available Whoa, whoa.
RAFE Woohoohoo! 
not_available Oh, man.
not_available They know where we're going.
not_available Just let us out, please.
not_available You don't need us.
not_available You're not prisoners, you're family.
not_available You're gonna get your family killed.
not_available Is that what you want? Steve! What are you doing? 
not_available Cops are gonna be crawling everywhere.
not_available We'll get further off the grid.
not_available They didn't know what direction we headed.
not_available Then we'll change the direction.
not_available Steve, please, just let us out, okay? I can go back and check on that cop.
not_available Shut the hell up, Sam.
not_available Shut up, you're not leaving.
not_available Nobody's leaving.
not_available Do you understand that? Does everybody understand that? 
not_available Whoa.
not_available Hey, buddy, chill out.
not_available We're okay, hey, hey.
not_available Hey, easy, man.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Sam probably saved your life.
not_available Yeah, I hope she's all right.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available Turn and see for yourself.
not_available The magnesium has drained all my life force.
not_available We're so not ready for this.
not_available No one is ever ready for this.
not_available Yeah, but we don't even have a car seat or a stroller We have a crib.
not_available We don't have a name.
not_available I was kind of hoping we could name him after my father.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He would really have loved to have a grandson named Mongo.
not_available Mongo? Yeah, it's a very popular name in Croatia.
not_available I'm just kidding, my 
not_available My father's name is Josip.
not_available I don't care how we're gonna call him.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What is it, contraction? 
not_available I don't know, I think my water broke.
not_available Ugh.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Opening up your saline.
not_available We need some help in here.

not_available Oh, God, how low? 
not_available Okay, get on your left side now.
COBURN Abby.

not_available I'm old enough that I know that there's always gonna be troubles.
not_available War, taxes.
not_available Bad guys now are pretty much the same as bad guys have always been.
not_available That's not how I feel today.
not_available I feel like the world's getting worse and worse and worse.
not_available And what we're watching is the slow, steady descent of the human race.
not_available Uh No, no, I don't buy that.
not_available I think that, um, today was just a rough day for the home team.

PERRY Nothing after 20 minutes.
not_available She's not clotting at all.
not_available Am I in DIC? 
COBURN The FFP should reverse that now that the baby's out.

not_available Then I realized it was always in the cards from the moment that I met you.
not_available You were on your way to becoming exactly what you are right now.
not_available I love him.
not_available I know you don't believe that.
not_available Especially right now.
not_available But I do.
not_available Yeah, you love him, right.
not_available That's why you get some woman to snatch him from school and tie him up and leave him in a van.
not_available You don't even remember his medicine.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available You're right to be pissed.
not_available You're right.
not_available It was my fault.
not_available It was my fault for ever letting us get separated in the first place.
not_available But now we gotta stay together.
not_available The three of us.
not_available There's no other way.
not_available I'd rather we were all dead.
not_available Hey.
not_available I don't want you to be afraid of me.
not_available You don't need to be afraid of me anymore.
not_available As long as we stay together, you and Alex are safe.
COBURN Where are we in factor replacement? 
PERRY Four of red cells, two units FFP, pack of platelets.
COBURN You've had uterotonics, packing an O'Leary stitch and a B
not_available Lynch brace.
not_available Still bleeding? Blood has penetrated the thickness of the uterine wall.
not_available I don't know what else to do.
not_available We can keep waiting for you to clot.
not_available Or we can start thinking about a hysterectomy.
not_available How long can we wait? Too many transfusions put you back into DIC.
not_available And then the bleeding gets even worse.
PERRY Last crit is 21.
COBURN Stay ahead two units.
not_available Uh, Jerry is in recovery.
not_available I thought you'd wanna know.
not_available Um Have we heard anything about Sam? No.
not_available This is a scary place.
not_available I remember the feeling just walking in.
not_available I know your baby is a lot sicker than Henry was but everything turned out okay for my boy, Luka.
not_available And I know that it will for yours too.
not_available Uh They're concerned about prolonged hypotension.
not_available And, uh, he's on 100 percent oxygen.
not_available So there's a risk of toxicity.
not_available And Um They're going to, uh, do periodic, uh, ultrasounds to check for intraventricular hemorrhage.
not_available There's nothing more you can do for him right now.
not_available You should go be with Abby.
not_available She doesn't want him to be alone.
not_available He won't be.
not_available Okay, so Morris got you through the ER.
not_available The first circle of hell.
not_available And Neela got you through surgery.
not_available The second.
not_available I guess it's up to me to get myself through recovery.
not_available Yeah, those are circles three through nine.
not_available Well, here's one way to start, the incentive spirometer.
PRATT It'll keep you from getting pneumonia.
NEELA Suck it to make the balls rise.
not_available Twice an hour.
not_available Do you know what time it is? I've been out there watching the same cable news over and over.
not_available Hey, Ma.
not_available I missed my water aerobics.
not_available You were supposed to take me.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available Oy, vey, you gave me such a scare, my sheyn boytshik.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry, Ma, I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, look at that, look at that punim.
not_available I'm 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available He's fine.
not_available Still intubated? Yeah, but, uh, he's satting well, you know.
not_available Pressure's holding with dopamine.
not_available He's making urine.
not_available Brain scan? 
not_available Clear.
not_available Well, those are all good things.
not_available Yeah, all good things.
not_available Is one gonna be enough? What? One baby.
not_available Um My uterus wouldn't stop bleeding and Coburn did everything she could, but You had a hysterectomy? Well, one is all we need.
not_available So, um, I'm not gonna be able to see him for a while.
not_available I can't get to the NICU for at least 24 hours.
not_available You don't have to wait that long.
not_available That's when I told him to wave to Mom.
not_available Yeah, he's a smart one.
ABBY Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Joseph.
not_available Hmm? I don't remember much about my dad, but, uh I remember when I was little, he used to love to watch boxing.
not_available And especially Joe Frazier because he thought he was the best pure fighter, so I'd like to call him Joe, if that's okay.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Do you need anything? Okay.
not_available Steve.
not_available Steve.
not_available Steve, I have to pee.
