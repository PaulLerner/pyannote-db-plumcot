not_available Someone who is compatible with Lizzie Corday.
not_available Now, word has it you and she have had a couple of run

not_available Can you keep up with her? Absolutely.
not_available Do you have the time? Sure.
not_available Great.
not_available We'll do a trial run, see if we're all compatible.

not_available Did Mark tell you about the scheduling snafu? Very unfortunate.
not_available I need to talk with you.
not_available I'm a little busy now.
not_available Weren't you scheduled to work the ER? I had to take the day off to run the clinic.
not_available Could you spare anyone to help? 
not_available When I signed off on the clinic you promised to find your own personnel and it wouldn't impinge on your regular duties.
not_available I could turf the runny noses, BP checks over to the ER and have your personnel handle them.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll give you Yosh Takata.
not_available Who? Nursing Administration.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Transfer from upstairs.

not_available I just hate to see you give up.
not_available I'm not giving up.
not_available I'm moving on.
not_available Al's in Atlanta checking out leads and a couple of construction jobs.
not_available But it's illegal for them to fire you for being HIV
not_available positive.
not_available You think that's why they fired me? 
not_available You don't? No.
not_available They could've done that last year.
not_available It's because of the budget.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I missed you.
not_available Me too.
not_available You did? Because you didn't call.

not_available Great.
not_available Here's the shadow.
not_available That's the hematoma pressing down on the splenic flexure.
not_available Looks like a rupture.
not_available No, no.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available The film's mislabeled.
not_available The gastric bubble is under the right diaphragm instead of the left.
not_available But with a splenic rupture, the gastric bubble can be displaced.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Not that much it can't Whoa, whoa, wait a minute! That's not his spleen.
not_available That's his liver.
not_available The liver's in the wrong place.
not_available Backwards? 
not_available His abdominal organs are reversed.
not_available That's remarkable.
not_available Let's get him up to Surgery! Move! Ever do a case like this before? No.
not_available This is one in a million.
not_available All right, everybody.
not_available Page Romano! You have previous clinic experience? 
not_available A little.
not_available Where would that have been? 
not_available Chart Review.
not_available You don't see many patients in Chart Review.
not_available No.
not_available But I know a lot about them.
not_available We'll have to double up on patients in here.
not_available Be with you in a minute.
not_available You said that an hour ago.
not_available Sign in patients, start a chart, and check their vitals.
not_available Where? 
not_available Out here.
not_available If anyone seems the least bit emergent, take them over to ER Triage.
not_available Can you handle that? 
not_available If I have any questions, I'll holler.
not_available Great.
not_available Mark! Oh, bring the kid out here, please.
not_available Do you have a sec?

not_available All right.
not_available How's it going, Carol? You know, I would've been organized by next week.
not_available You couldn't help me at all today? Well, it's a little busy not having Doug here.
not_available But I'll see what I can do.
not_available All right.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available I think Carol's mad at me.
not_available No.
not_available She's just got a lot on her mind.
not_available That hospital lawyer dropped off these papers for you to sign.
not_available They're urgent, about the civil rights case.
not_available File them in my box.
not_available Along with the others? Yeah.
not_available I'm not gonna let these bastards get to me.
not_available The man of the hour's arrived.
not_available This is the situs inversus? 
not_available It sure is.
not_available Fantastic case, Peter.
not_available I've never seen one in the flesh before.
not_available It's worth considering a case report.
not_available I'm actually thinking of running a literature review.
not_available I took the liberty.
not_available There's nothing on abdominal situs inversus in Trauma.
not_available I can be the first to write about it.
not_available I just heard the good news.
not_available You've got a nose for sniffing out zebras.
not_available I wish I could take credit, but he landed it.
not_available Finders, keepers.
not_available Peter won't mind you scrubbing in.
not_available Give us a chance to work together.
not_available I think he might.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Of course not.
not_available Great.
not_available You both can run it.
not_available I'll hang out on the sidelines in case I have to take one of you out.
not_available Shall we scrub? So Don't you think it's time we called a truce? I am not at war.
not_available I feel terrible.
not_available I didn't mean to mislead you 
not_available about my family.
not_available It's not that big a deal, okay? No hard feelings? 
not_available No.
not_available Excuse me, John.
not_available I hope I'm not interrupting.
not_available Henry! What are you doing here? 
not_available I wanna thank you for giving me time to finish my brain blots.
not_available Grab the end of that, please.
not_available The end? The results are so promising, I got a Howard Hughes Research Fellowship.
not_available Glad I could help.
not_available You did.
not_available I was wondering if you might do me one more favor here.
not_available Favor, huh? See, I'm not able to
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I can't start a new rotation until you remove these UEs from my evaluation.
not_available So if you could just "Unable to evaluate physical examination.
not_available Unable to evaluate technical and procedural skills.
not_available Unable to evaluate interactions with the health care team.
not_available " Yeah.
not_available You can't just pass me? No.
not_available You barely showed up.
not_available Then the registrar says that I need to repeat this clerkship until I pass.
not_available Anna, you don't have a student, do you? Don't need one.
not_available Well, then, I guess it's just you and me.
not_available Jeanie, I've been looking for you.
not_available Well, you found me.
not_available Good news.
not_available Atlanta Memorial called.
not_available They're very interested in you.
not_available I faxed an excellent recommendation.
not_available You should be a shoo
not_available in for a position.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jeanie, if there were any way I could change things, believe me, I would.
not_available I'm gonna miss you.
not_available I know.
not_available There is no way we can take these people today.
not_available Come back next week, they get priority.
not_available You refuse to give the homeless physicals? I am not refusing.
not_available We don't have any more appointments for today.
not_available But I called two hours ago and a lady said that this was a walk
not_available in clinic day.
not_available Cynthia! Did you give permission to bring in these people? I figured it would be okay.
not_available Are you a complete idiot? Can't you see we're swamped already? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What's going on? She invited the entire Hazelton Shelter for free physicals.
not_available Carol, can I talk to you? So there was miscommunication.
not_available If you have a problem with Cynthia or any employee in the future speak to them privately.
not_available Don't dress them down in front of the entire ER.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available Liver's lacerated.
not_available Excise the left lateral aspect.
not_available Which anatomically is the right lobe.
not_available Correct.
not_available I don't know about you, but I'm getting dizzy.
not_available We should put a mirror on the ceiling.
not_available We could operate from my bedroom.
not_available Get a photo from the other side.
not_available Peter, expose the gallbladder.
not_available Found any family on this kid yet? 
not_available Not last I heard.
not_available Get on it.
not_available I wanna get releases for these photos.
not_available Liver's still bleeding.
not_available You ever use an argon beam coagulator? 
not_available No.
not_available Why don't I do the Pringle maneuver? Go for it.
not_available My colleague would love to get some blood samples from this kid.
not_available Suction, please.
not_available All right.
not_available Here we go.
not_available All right.
not_available Heads up.
not_available Have Pathology pickle this.
not_available Bet no one's ever seen a backwards liver.
not_available We can play "Stump the Med Students.
not_available " 
not_available Not to mention publishing.
not_available We discussed that.
not_available Are you up for it? 
not_available I'm game.
not_available So am I.
not_available Excellent.
not_available We'll fight over whose name goes first on the papers later.
not_available It's a wrist.
not_available That's definitely a fracture of the wrist.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But there are eight bones in the wrist.
not_available Which one? What are the odds of catching TB in this place? Henry, which bone is broken? 
not_available It's the lunate.
not_available No.
not_available That's over here.
not_available Here.
not_available Remember this, would you? It's a mnemonic.
not_available Never Lower Tillie's Pants.
not_available Mother May Come Home.
not_available Maybe you boys should talk privately.
not_available No, I'm just teaching Henry the bones in the wrist.
not_available Here.
not_available "M" for "Mother" is the greater multangular.
not_available You call that the multangular? I was taught it was the trapezium.
not_available Really? 
not_available I call that the scaphoid.
not_available What do you call it? 
not_available Navicular.
not_available So my little mnemonic wouldn't work for you.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I have my own.
not_available Really? Let's hear it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Scared Lovers Try Positions That They Can't Handle.
not_available Go with Anna's.
not_available He already learned yours.
not_available I like yours better.
not_available I don't think that I need either.
not_available I'll just memorize the names.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available If Dr.
not_available Anspaugh calls, tell him I'll have this budget in his hands today.
not_available Do you know who left this note? 
not_available No.
not_available "CH".
not_available That's me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? You drive a Plymouth? Your lights are on.
not_available That's hard to believe.
not_available Herb Spivak, snakebite to the upper left torso.
not_available Know what the venom is? 
not_available No.
not_available It has feet like a piranha, and a head the size of a papaya.
not_available Can you take this nonvenomous snakebite to the left thorax? 
not_available I left my car lights on.
not_available Sure.
not_available Curtain Area 3.
not_available Can you sign off on this budget? Anspaugh's expecting it.
not_available Where? 
not_available Below my signature.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available How did this happen? I was feeding his python.
not_available It bit me.
not_available What do you expect? You spilled soup.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Gary Lomax.
not_available Owner of Jungle Gary's Reptorium.
not_available He spilled chicken soup on himself.
not_available What? Pythons love chicken, so I dipped the rat in my soup.
not_available It spilled on my jacket.
not_available Bingo! The guy got me.
not_available Python thought he was the world's biggest chicken.
not_available Ellis? Fancy meeting you here! Security said my lights were on.
not_available A little ruse to get you out so I could thank you for getting us the contract.
not_available Anspaugh approved it? 
not_available Ink's still wet.
not_available Synergix is now supplying extra Attending coverage to County General.
not_available All because of you.
not_available Why didn't you come into the hospital? I wanted to avoid suggestion of preferential treatment.
not_available It's not preferential treatment.
not_available It's good business.
not_available We have that in common.
not_available It's good business for me to say thanks.
not_available Thanks, Kerry.
not_available Phalaenopsis.
not_available Ellis, you shouldn't have.
not_available You know phals? 
not_available I love them.
not_available Something else we have in common.
not_available Great job.
not_available You really drained the hell out of that liver.
not_available Once I got my bearings, it wasn't difficult.
not_available I'm glad it came along.
not_available Me too.
not_available But a compass would've been helpful.
not_available Check the crits and coags.
not_available Make sure the Jackson Pratts don't clot off.
not_available Catalog the photos and dig up every article you can find on situs inversus viscerum.
not_available I'll watch the temp.
not_available If it drops below 35, I'll use a warming blanket.
not_available I'll alert the Genetics Department, if they want to consult.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, this is Mr.
not_available Price.
not_available Rodney's father.
not_available The school called.
not_available Told me there was an accident, to come right over.
not_available How is my boy doing? We removed part of his liver to control the bleeding.
not_available He's in serious condition but he came out of surgery well.
not_available Aren't you Peter Benton? From Collins High? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Isaac Price.
not_available You two were classmates? Yeah.
not_available Class of '83.
not_available Peter was on that college track.
not_available Nose to the grindstone.
not_available It paid off.
not_available Your son had an excellent surgeon.
not_available Isaac, is your son on any medication or allergic to any drugs? I don't know.
not_available He lives at his mother's.
not_available Listen, is Rodney gonna be all right? You know, we're doing our best, man.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Can I help? 
not_available No.
not_available You've done plenty.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Carol, move your patients out of the Admit area.
not_available We could get cited for blocking fire exits.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle, did you want your December meal tickets? Who has time to eat? 
not_available I'll take them.
not_available They're for the residents.
not_available You heard.
not_available Who has time to eat? You're going to need a tetanus booster, antibiotics.
not_available And I'll have to extract those python teeth.
not_available Okay, doctor.
not_available Malik, can you get me some Betadine? I brought Flora along 
not_available in case you wanted to swab her.
not_available Flora? She's actually quite gentle
not_available When she's not hungry.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available She's harmless except for mouth rot.
not_available You think we should get a culture? I love her dearly.
not_available But her mouth's a cesspool.
not_available Malik you wanna give him a hand? I don't think so.
not_available Just grab her middle.
not_available Don't let go.
not_available This next case of situs inversus apparently shows no cardiac involvement.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available This is a great teaching case.
not_available I discussed it with the residents and students.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton and Dr.
not_available Corday performed the surgery.
not_available Photographs were taken.
not_available Everybody would love to see them.
not_available We need to change the patient's dressings.
not_available No problem.
not_available We'll come back later.
not_available This is great work, Peter.
not_available Don't forget those photos.
not_available Anspaugh's impressed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available How's the kid doing? 
not_available He's stable.
not_available Here.
not_available Lucky break, the father knowing you.
not_available Should make it easier to consent him for blood tests.
not_available Genetic breakthroughs are hovering in the winds.
not_available You'll talk to the family? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, great.
not_available Peter, is something wrong? 
not_available No.
not_available I'd be happy to talk to the father.
not_available Why? I thought it might be more comfortable since you know him.
not_available I don't know him.
not_available What difference would it make? It's tough if you have a personal connection.
not_available I don't have a personal connection.
not_available I don't want him to think we're using his kid.
not_available We've treated him as best we can, haven't we? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then you've got nothing to worry about.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available My fault.
not_available I'm not used to the floor plan.
not_available I don't think we've met.
not_available I'm Jeanie.
not_available Yosh Takata.
not_available New R.N.
not_available The new R.N.? How'd you get past the hiring freeze? I didn't know there was one.
not_available I put in for a transfer to the ER.
not_available How long you been here? Do you like it? 
not_available Two years.
not_available I do.
not_available It's good to meet you.
not_available I gotta run.
not_available How did you get these scars? 
not_available Defending a cave diver.
not_available We got caught in a kelp forest.
not_available Do you dive? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh, spectacular.
not_available When did you start handling snakes? He's defending me in a lawsuit.
not_available Oh, you're an attorney.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Flora ate his neighbor's Jack Russell terrier.
not_available Obviously, they have no case whatsoever.
not_available They're not recognized by the American Kennel Association.
not_available Gary offered to help me work with snakes in exchange for legal counsel.
not_available How could I refuse such an offer? Sure, Al.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Okay.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Bye.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just Al.
not_available Foreman job in Atlanta fell through.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Does he have other possibilities? Al always does.
not_available Let me give you a hand.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How's it going for you? Lousy.
not_available I don't know why I thought I could run a clinic with no supplies.
not_available I can't even write a scrip.
not_available P.A.'s can write them.
not_available But Kerry Weaver won't let me use any of the ER staff.
not_available What's she gonna do? Fire me? Mark.
not_available You are so romantic.
not_available I am? Hiding that note under the charts.
not_available My heart skipped a beat when I saw my initials.
not_available What? 
not_available On the envelope.
not_available "CH"? What you wrote was really sexy.
not_available Did you mean it? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Well, then my answer is yes.
not_available I will.
not_available Everything okay? Well, we just got some labs back.
not_available Rodney's crit is okay.
not_available But his platelets are falling.
not_available We're concerned that his blood might not clot properly.
not_available Is he gonna pull through? Well, he He may need to have a transfusion.
not_available But don't worry.
not_available I'll keep an eye on him.
not_available Thanks, Peter.
not_available I know you're doing everything you can, man.
not_available All the doctors have been in, making sure he's all right.
not_available Isaac, are you aware that Rodney has a rare genetic syndrome that caused his abdominal organs to be reversed? Is that why he's so sick? No.
not_available But when he was hit by the car, his liver was severely injured.
not_available See If it had been in the proper position, the prognosis might be better.
not_available Listen, I I know it's not easy at times like this to ask, but we'd like permission to draw some of Rodney's blood along with yours and your ex
not_available wife's to do a genetic study.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available I'll do anything if it'll help Rodney get better.
not_available Here.
not_available You need to sign the consent.
not_available On a scale of one to 10, how would you rate your pain? Oh, I don't know.
not_available When you push like that, it's a nine or an eight.
not_available But it could be a six or a seven.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Ask him to describe the quality of the pain.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kottmeier, please describe the quality of your pain.
not_available Quality? Is it dull? Is it sharp? Is it crampy? Is it constant? It's crampy, all right.
not_available But sometimes it's sharp too.
not_available When it's not dull.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available I'm a double Libra.
not_available You know how that is.
not_available Not that I believe in horoscopes.
not_available That appears sharp to me.
not_available We're dealing with diverticulitis.
not_available What do you wanna do? Well, that could be surgical or not.
not_available Order an abdominal ultrasound or maybe get a CT.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Why don't we just start with a history and a physical? Can you write me a scrip for erythromycin ointment? I got a kid with conjunctivitis.
not_available Having you here today has been a saving grace to me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You worked hard to get this going.
not_available I wish I had your guts.

not_available Hey, Jeanie, have you seen a chart for Kottmeier? 
not_available No.
not_available Guess I'll start a new one.
not_available And have you traveled anywhere recently? I just did.

not_available And then to Time to wrap up.
not_available History and physical just took 90 minutes.
not_available Shave an hour off, you'd be in passing range for this clerkship.
not_available There's a rectal abscess in 2 with your name on it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kottmeier, someone will see you shortly.
not_available It would've gone faster if my allergies
not_available Take an antihistamine.
not_available Hi, Mr.
not_available Kottmeier.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available I'm gonna examine you.
not_available Boy, when they said shortly, they mean shortly! This new clinic's a godsend.
not_available I work part
not_available time.
not_available No benefits.
not_available So thank you.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you for saying that.
not_available There you go, Hector.
not_available That shot will keep you from getting sick.
not_available If it's not too much trouble, could you look at his chin? He crabs about it, but I don't see anything wrong.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay, Hector.
not_available Does it hurt when I do this? I can't feel it.
not_available You don't feel me pressing on it? 
not_available No.
not_available No? Okay, I'm gonna go see if I can find a doctor.

not_available Pericardiocentesis needle.

not_available The ER budget? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've told you.
not_available It's nothing personal.
not_available I tried everything to try and keep you here.
not_available The numbers don't support it.
not_available If I'm being fired, I wanna see the numbers not hear your interpretation of them.
not_available I've gone over them with a fine
not_available tooth comb.
not_available It's not fair, but that's the way it is.
not_available How do you justify hiring a new nurse? Yosh Takata was hired to replace two nurses who've left.
not_available What about giving yourself a raise? Salaries are confidential.
not_available I sure as hell know why.
not_available Jeanie, I'm sorry I can't help you.
not_available I'll find someone who can.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Have you had a patient complain about his chin falling asleep? Heads up, Henry.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sure if it's contagious, he'll catch it.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Kottmeier's my patient.
not_available Then why did I do a physical on him? I'm quite fond of all of you.
not_available You did remember to sign him out on the board, didn't you? Was I supposed to? 
not_available Where are you taking him? To the surgical ward.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kottmeier has an inflamed diverticulum that perfed into his mesentery.
not_available He needs a colectomy.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Have you considered medical management? Treat the abscess with a course of Flagyl and Cipro before jumping into surgery? 
not_available I'm willing to give it a shot.
not_available No, no, no, wait.
not_available Do you agree because you think I wanna hear that? Or do you really believe that? What? I don't want you agreeing with me just to please me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I've already considered several alternatives to surgery.
not_available You have? 
not_available Shut up, Henry! Mark.
not_available If you have a problem with my salary, come to me.
not_available Don't bring it up with the staff.
not_available Do you have any idea how many hours I work every week? What are you talking about? 
not_available You disclosed our salaries to Jeanie.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available You didn't? 
not_available No.
not_available What happened to all the patients in your clinic? I gave them meal tickets and stashed them in the cafeteria.
not_available Stressful day for you, huh? 
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Anything interesting in Doug's note? I wish I knew.
not_available I lost it before I got to read it.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available How are you on Medline searches? 
not_available Why? I did one on submandibular paralysis and I came up with zilch.
not_available I'm not surprised.
not_available I've never heard of it.
not_available I've got this kid complaining of a numb chin.
not_available What should I do? Why don't you try "numb chin"? "Numb chin.
not_available " That sounds a little too, you know, easy.
not_available Hey.
not_available There you go.
not_available I'm sorry, Isaac.
not_available Can we have a word with you in the hall? I don't wanna leave my boy.
not_available We'd like your permission to perform an autopsy.
not_available Why? Well, because it could be useful.
not_available Did something go wrong? He started bleeding when you stuck him.
not_available No.
not_available His blood wouldn't clot because of the liver injury.
not_available Then why do you need to do an autopsy? 
not_available For research.
not_available It could be helpful.
not_available That's why you're so interested.
not_available Not because he was hurt.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available We were trying to save his life.
not_available When you took his blood and mine, were you trying to save his life? No
not_available We'd like to study his condition.
not_available I don't want him studied.
not_available We understand how youLook at him! Don't you think you cut him up enough? 
not_available Isaac, I'm so sorry.
not_available No! I don't want you cutting up my son! You're right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'll leave you alone.
not_available Focus, Henry.
not_available What do you hear? I'm not
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available What do you hear? He has a pneumothorax.
not_available We'll put in a chest tube.
not_available I'll grab a tray.
not_available It hurts.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I bet it hurts.
not_available Hang on there.
not_available Everything will feel better in a minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available Henry, the first thing that you wanna do is feel for the ribs along the midaxillary line locating the fifth interspace.
not_available Can I get some Betadine? Where you make the incision.
not_available I'm not feeling so good.
not_available What? I'm not feeling so good.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Put your head between your knees.
not_available Lily, give me the Kelly.
not_available How are you doing, Henry? Lydia, do me a favor and slide Henry out of the way.
not_available Carter, he's a little cyanotic.
not_available What? Can't get a pulse on the banger! Lydia, call an Attending! Change the dressing twice a day.
not_available Think twice before defending any skydivers.
not_available Thank you, doc.
not_available We need you in Trauma 1.
not_available Anna, Malik, we may need your help.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Banger had a tension pneumo.
not_available Henry passed out.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll finish the chest tube.
not_available Get your student into Trauma 2.
not_available Okay.
not_available Henry, you're gonna be just fine.
not_available Everybody grab hold.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I showed him how to put in a chest tube and he fainted.
not_available Go on the other side.
not_available Wheezes bilaterally.
not_available Pulse ox is 86.
not_available I need to intubate.
not_available Get me a laryngoscope.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available Did he complain of feeling sick? He always does.
not_available He's a hypochondriac.
not_available Is he on any meds? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get a CBC, Chem
not_available 20, and a tox screen.
not_available All right, I'm in.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Pulse ox is worse.
not_available Down to 82.
not_available What? Get a blood gas.
not_available Pressure's crashing! 
not_available What the hell is going on? His wrist and his left hand are red and edematous.
not_available Right hand's also swollen.
not_available Oh, my God! He's allergic to latex.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's in asystole! Amp of epi, IV push! ET tube cup has latex.
not_available We've got to extubate.
not_available Lily, get me an ET tube from the latex
not_available free cart.
not_available Wash your hands first.
not_available Chuny, get me a basin of water.
not_available Found a non
not_available latex ET tube.
not_available A mg of atropine and 50 of Benadryl! Laryngeal edema.
not_available I'm having a hard time getting in.
not_available How long has he been down? 
not_available 30 seconds.
not_available Watch his teeth.
not_available Can you see the cords? 
not_available I know.
not_available Barely.
not_available All right, Malik.
not_available Hi
not_available dose epi.
not_available Seven cc's.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Just keep sliding it in very gently.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Great.
not_available Good job.
not_available Got a pulse.
not_available Everything okay here? Everything's under control.
not_available Peter, I'd like to speak to you.
not_available I'd like to speak to you as well.
not_available I've been reconsidering the possibility of joining your team.
not_available I understand Mr.
not_available Price refused an autopsy on his son.
not_available Did you try to convince him? He doesn't want us carving his boy.
not_available Did you explain how research might benefit others? He doesn't want it.
not_available Give him some time.
not_available He's emotional.
not_available I don't feel comfortable doing that.
not_available How do you think we made advances in heart surgery, in transplantation? By refining procedures on patients and studying the results.
not_available That kid was a freak of nature.
not_available And we have a responsibility to do research.
not_available That "freak" was a boy named Rodney Price whose father doesn't understand why he lost him.
not_available All you want to do is cut him despite his father's wishes.
not_available We're scientists, Peter.
not_available We're not allowed sentimentality.
not_available Now, you go back and get consent.
not_available Because I want it.
not_available No.
not_available You get somebody else to do it.
not_available I just got a lab report back on one of my patients, a 7year
not_available old.
not_available Turns out he's got acute lymphocytic leukemia.
not_available A doctor should speak to the mother.
not_available How did it present? 
not_available Kid's complaint was a numb chin.
not_available I checked in the computer, ran some tests.
not_available The mom knows you.
not_available Talk to her.
not_available Call me if she has any questions.
not_available And then I plea
not_available bargained her down to a misdemeanor not two weeks after she shot a guy! You could've saved yourself a whole bunch of urgent phone messages if you'd told me Herb was on board.
not_available I didn't know you knew each other.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I served on the Trial Lawyers' Banquet Committee.
not_available Herb was our speaker.
not_available I've been filling him in on that Law family suit.
not_available You got yourself quite a little mess.
not_available I've decided to ignore the whole thing.
not_available Oh, wrong impulse.
not_available You'll get slaughtered.
not_available You had better file this right away to avoid a summary judgment.
not_available Mark, the hospital's board of directors is gonna be very relieved to hear that you have such excellent representation.
not_available You know, you came about this close to losing your job.
not_available Herb, if you have any questions at all, please just give me a call.
not_available I shall.
not_available I shall.
not_available Take care of yourself, Alan.
not_available You too.
not_available Mark.
not_available Why did you let Alan believe that you're representing me? Honestly, doc, he's a lousy lawyer.
not_available He jumps to conclusions.
not_available Nevertheless, I could represent you.
not_available Your fee would be a little too steep for me.
not_available $10,000 retainer fee.
not_available I figured.
not_available But, honestly, I don't need the money.
not_available I'm bored.
not_available I'm looking for new challenges.
not_available Here's the deal.
not_available Let me shadow you.
not_available You throw in a few procedures.
not_available Nothing big.
not_available Maybe a couple of stitches here and there.
not_available And I'll make your little lawsuit vanish just like that.
not_available Gratis.
not_available I got an autopsy consent on the Price boy.
not_available The father just needed more time.
not_available Why didn't Rocket send you? I refused.
not_available That was a ballsy move.
not_available It wasn't a move.
not_available I told him what I felt.
not_available Well, it worked.
not_available Take a look at tomorrow's surgery schedule.
not_available You're scrubbing in on a lap splenectomy at 7 a.
not_available m.
not_available Rocket's team.
not_available He's partial to residents with backbone.
not_available John? Yes, Henry? What happened? You went into anaphylactic shock from latex.
not_available I was near death.
not_available Yes.
not_available And you were there.
not_available Yes, Henry.
not_available I was there.
not_available And so was Anna.
not_available It was like a dream.
not_available Anna! Hey, Henry.
not_available It was the most amazing thing.
not_available I remember being drawn toward this bright light.
not_available And then suddenly I was floating up above you over there in the corner watching as the two of you enveloped in a blue glow worked together, united to save my life.
not_available Thank you, John.
not_available Thank you, Anna.
not_available You are my angels.
not_available You brought me back to the living.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Can't be a chart you're writing.
not_available No.
not_available And from the way you're covering it up I'd say it's something personal.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's a It's a love letter.
not_available The sentimental kind or the "I'd like to rip your pants off" kind? Definitely the latter.
not_available I'd like to be writing one of those.
not_available Pity I broke up with Jeremy.
not_available Could've been more fun, long
not_available distance.
not_available Someone from home? A self
not_available possessed dermatologist.
not_available I'm afraid I broke his heart.
not_available Well, it's 9:00.
not_available And since you're writing rather than living out your prose 
not_available I'd venture to say you're alone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fancy grabbing a drink? I would love to.
not_available It is an unenviable job running the ER and making difficult cost
not_available cutting decisions.
not_available I got your message.
not_available Jeanie came in quite upset about the budget.
not_available And I was just explaining that it appears that you treated her honestly and fairly.
not_available She gave herself a $25,000 raise.
not_available That's from the administrative budget.
not_available I understand that's your story.
not_available But I don't buy it.
not_available Something else is going on.
not_available And what would that be? My HIV status.
not_available Jeanie! I believe that's why I'm being fired.
not_available I see.
not_available Well Let's not do anything rash.
not_available I am late for a dinner at the moment.
not_available But tomorrow I can give the budget another more thorough review.
not_available We've been over these figures a dozen times.
not_available You told me we had to cut P.A.s.
not_available Why don't you give Kerry and me another day to recheck our figures? Thank you, Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available I will.
not_available Jeanie, you're really gonna use your HIV status like this? I call it as I see it.
not_available I tried everything to keep you here.
not_available Then I bent over backwards to help you get a job in Atlanta.
not_available It just isn't fair, is it? I've never discriminated against you because of your HIV status.
not_available I fought to keep you here.
not_available Kerry, like you said before, it's nothing personal.
not_available To your health! 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Here.
not_available What have we here? 
not_available What have we here? Another present? It's beautiful.
not_available Should I try it on? You can try it on later.
not_available I dream of the taste of your neck and the smell of your hair on my pillow.
not_available You do? No, silly.
not_available You do.
not_available Did you mean everything you wrote? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available It was I was homesick.
not_available Do you remember this afternoon when I said that I will? I changed my mind.
not_available I won't.
not_available You won't? Not unless you go first.
not_available Lie back.
