not_available Will you love the baby if the father is black? That's what I thought.
not_available I'm sorry, Kerry.
not_available I misread this.
not_available I'm so sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
not_available You can't be here.
not_available They're gonna kill me! I'm dead! Come on.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available I'll figure out something.
not_available You're pregnant.

not_available They didn't plow my street.

not_available God, it's freezing outside.

not_available Spent the last four hours catching up.
not_available How'd our temp attending do? 
not_available Worthless.
not_available Carter kept the board running.
not_available Thank you, Haleh.
not_available What happened to the attending we had last week? 
not_available Took a job in the Bahamas.
not_available Knew he was too smart for this place.
not_available Where do you need me? 
not_available We're through the thick of it.
not_available Those are the dispos.
not_available I signed out the rest to Malucci.
not_available Will you give Mr.
not_available Phelps a Bactrim and discharge him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And I think I am out of here.
not_available John, I'm sorry that I put you on nights so soon but with Mark gone, the schedule's a mess.
not_available We all do our share of nights.
not_available Have you heard from him? 
not_available Mark? No.
not_available They got there Tuesday.

not_available I waited as long as I could.
not_available I didn't want to wake you.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm not working.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei I'm going to rupture your membranes to help move you along.
not_available When did you go into labor? 
not_available Midnight.
not_available Where? 
not_available Home.
not_available I took a cab.
not_available All done.
not_available You know, I thought I could do this myself, but I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available Hey, it's okay.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available Contraction? Okay.

not_available You're doing great, Jing
not_available Mei.

not_available R.
not_available Peter.
not_available Peter? Yeah.
not_available Listen.
not_available What? Voices.
not_available It's Kynesha.
not_available Talking to herself? She's probably just watching TV.
not_available Peter.
not_available What? You brought her here.
not_available Go.
not_available No, you don't know.
not_available This girl stay uptight.
not_available Can't be too uptight, lets you stay here by yourself.
not_available Get mad every time I turn on a light.
not_available Place this nice, she worried about the electric bill.
not_available Sure has straight teeth.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available I was just looking at it.
not_available Where's Kynesha? 
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Kynesha, who's this? 
not_available This is Tiny.
not_available Hey.
not_available Tiny got locked out.
not_available Her sister ain't coming home till 7.
not_available You went out? 
not_available No.
not_available So somebody else is wearing your boots now? I went to check on my mom.
not_available Tiny said she came back, was looking for me.
not_available Was pretty messed up.
not_available All right.
not_available You live in her building? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Grab your stuff.
not_available I'll take you home.
not_available Kynesha, you better clean this up before Cleo comes down.
not_available Okay.
not_available There.
not_available You have your coffee.
not_available Now let's go.
not_available I don't want to keep this man waiting.
not_available He's jammed us into his schedule.
not_available What is it? 
not_available The kid with the red hat.
not_available What about him? I saw another kid wearing that exact hat three weeks ago.
not_available I was buying groceries for Thanksgiving dinner.
not_available Now I'm in New York waiting for a miracle.
not_available Maybe it's a sign.
not_available Either that or the Grim Reaper wears a red hat.
not_available I didn't come with you to hear talk like that.
not_available I thought that was healthy.
not_available Well, it's not.
not_available I should just stick with denial? I'd prefer guarded optimism until Dr.
not_available Burke maps the brain and gives us his opinion.
not_available Yeah, and then I can hear bad news twice.
not_available If you really believed that, you'd have called Rachel by now.
not_available Just call her up and tell her over the phone? No, you could have flown out there for a day, but you didn't.
not_available Why? I have a feeling you'll tell me.
not_available Yes, because deep down, you really do believe this surgeon can help you.
not_available You don't want to tell her until you know you'll be all right.
not_available Or I'm desperate.
not_available You've seen enough patients overcome illnesses they shouldn't have to understand the importance of a positive outlook.
not_available Now, you have to believe it's possible.
not_available I think I'm a little nervous.
not_available Well, me too.
not_available Heart rate is 150 with type
not_available 1 dips.
not_available Is that a normal decel? Yeah.
not_available It's good cardiac activity.
not_available I thought you got high honors in OB.
not_available I did.
not_available The adoptive parents are here.
not_available Can I show them in? 
not_available Yes.
not_available No! They said they arranged to be present for the birth.
not_available John, do you mind? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll talk to them.
not_available Hi.
not_available You the adoptive parents? Yes.
not_available James and Linda.
not_available You're the doctor? 
not_available I'm a friend of Deb's.
not_available Who? Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available I'm John Carter.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available She's starting to push.
not_available Baby's healthy.
not_available Could be any minute now.
not_available We should get in there.
not_available Well she's feeling a little overwhelmed.
not_available She said we could be present at the birth.
not_available I know.
not_available But labor can be demanding, and she really needs to focus.
not_available We traveled all night from Portland to get here.
not_available I understand.
not_available You can have a seat right here.
not_available Is she changing her mind? About giving the baby up for adoption? No, I think she's a little embarrassed.
not_available Just wants a little privacy.
not_available Look, we really wanted to be there for the birth of our son.
not_available I'll bring him right out to you.
not_available I promise.
not_available Hey, I heard Dr.
not_available Chen's having her baby upstairs.
not_available Malucci, Exam 1 's been here since 9 with reflux esophagitis.
not_available In a minute, chief.
not_available Do you want to send her flowers? 
not_available No.
not_available I could start a pool.
not_available No.
not_available Leave her alone.
not_available Why? Randi, can you just drop it, please? 
not_available Hi, Kim.
not_available Hi.
not_available You have a cyclothymic down here? Yeah.
not_available A guy in Exam 3 trying to set a new world record doing sit
not_available ups.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hey, I tried to call you the other day
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available My machine's been acting up.
not_available I need to get a new one.
not_available I wish I'd known that sooner.
not_available I might have gotten you something different.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I happened across a copy over the weekend and couldn't resist.
not_available Hopefully you don't already have one.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available Should I open it now? 
not_available Or later.
not_available Okay.
not_available You should try drinking water upside down.
not_available It always helps with me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available See you.
not_available You said one night.
not_available It's been a week.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Turn her over to Social Services.
not_available If her mother's been on a drug spree for a month, she needs to be in foster care.
not_available She's 15 years old.
not_available She doesn't want to go in the system now.
not_available Well, I'm not adopting her.
not_available Are you? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available I hate her being in my house alone.
not_available Now she's bringing friends over? I'm sorry.
not_available That won't happen again.
not_available Peter, she's manipulating you.
not_available I got a lead on another halfway house.
not_available I'll make sure she gets into that one.
not_available Two more days.
not_available After that, she's out.
not_available Cleo, I'm working on it.
not_available Good.
not_available LFTs are back on Room 4.
not_available Bilirubin's a little high.
not_available I need help, please! Help me! Someone help me, please! What happened? 
not_available A dog attacked my son.
not_available He's bitten all over.
not_available I can't stop the bleeding.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Oh, God! It looks worse.
not_available Laceration through and through.
not_available Cut his facial artery.
not_available What's your son's name? 
not_available Jeff.
not_available He was crying, but now he's quiet.
not_available Jeff, I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available We need to secure his airway.
not_available What's open? 
not_available Trauma 1.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get him on a monitor.
not_available I need suction and a Pedes intubation kit.
not_available Throw up 40 of sux and five of Versed.
not_available Cutdown tray.
not_available Pulse ox is 86.
not_available Ten liters blow
not_available by.
not_available I need fourby
not_available fours, Merocel sponges.
not_available Sats are dropping.
not_available I need to intubate.
not_available I think I can control it.
not_available Let me get some suction here.
not_available Ma'am, I need some room.
not_available Step back, please.
not_available Damn it.
not_available If only I can tie off this bleeder.
not_available Heart rate's up to 120.
not_available Pulse ox is 82.
not_available Not getting enough oxygen.
not_available We have to intubate.
not_available Why aren't you helping him?! 
not_available Got it! Blow hard.
not_available Three, two, one.
not_available Okay, one more should do it.
not_available I don't want to use suction.
not_available All right? 
not_available I thought you said he was crowning.
not_available He is.
not_available Just one more push.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Just one more push.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Ten, nine, eight, push! Seven, six Okay, the head is out! You can stop.
not_available Stop pushing.
not_available Is it over? 
not_available Almost.
not_available You did great.
not_available You did great.
not_available It's a boy.
not_available He's nice and healthy.
not_available You want to hold him? Wanna hold him? 
not_available No.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I guess this was more than you bargained for.
not_available You did all the work.
not_available No, I mean having to see all this.
not_available It was a blur.
not_available Let's just say we're closer now.
not_available Surprised you? I didn't tell you about the father.
not_available Yeah, kind of.
not_available Are those the adoptive parents? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You didn't meet them? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available About two months ago.
not_available They still want to come in and see you.
not_available What did they do when you gave them the baby? They cried.
not_available They seem nice to you? 
not_available Yeah, they seem great.
not_available Here we are.
not_available Any nausea? Yeah, a little.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll give you some ice chips until it passes.
not_available You don't have to stick around.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You have a night shift? 
not_available Later.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, then you should go rest, crash in the on
not_available call room.
not_available We'll see.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm gonna change your pad.
not_available Then we'll massage your uterus to firm it up a bit.
not_available You don't want to be around for that.
not_available Not really.
not_available You okay? All right, I'm gonna come back and check on you later.
not_available Hey, John? Yeah? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available The whole thing takes about an hour.
not_available You'll be doing language tasks 
not_available as we map out the speech centers.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Burke meeting us? He'll stop by.
not_available Usually you meet the surgeon before he sends you off for a scan.
not_available Burke's one of the best in the world.
not_available He's busy.
not_available Take off your glasses, watch, wallet, pager, cell phone.
not_available Anything metal, anything magnetic, right in here.
not_available Could you call Dr.
not_available Burke and let him know we're here? He likes to be notified when the renderings are up.
not_available So as not to waste time with the patients.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Don't forget the belt.
not_available You'll have earphones, and we'll talk by intercom.
not_available Can I stay for the scan, then? I am a surgeon myself.
not_available You can sit back there.
not_available For the first run, you'll name objects you see projected on fiber
not_available optic goggles.
not_available Do I get to shoot down any aliens? Will he have scars? Surgeons will do everything they can to minimize them.
not_available What are you doing here?! 
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available I was worried.
not_available He almost died, Mona! But he'll be all right? You're putting that dog down! Mom? What are you talking about? 
not_available Maybe this isn't the right time.
not_available Jeff must have provoked him
not_available That animal mauled my son.
not_available You're putting him down.
not_available I want that animal destroyed! Shelly, I
not_available You better leave it alone for now.
not_available Mom? Are they gonna kill Winston? I don't know, honey.
not_available Why don't we find a place for you to sit down? Here we go.
not_available There's good hemostasis.
not_available The repeat crit is 39.
not_available Great, Peter.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available You're not supposed to be in there.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Taylor.
not_available Well, come on out here, Taylor.
not_available I hurt my foot.
not_available If you come out here, I can take a look at it.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available Are you a patient here? Let me see this.
not_available Hey, you're supposed to be up in the blood bank.
not_available You having a blood transfusion? 
not_available I don't like needles.
not_available Yeah, well, none of us do but sometimes we gotta use them to make you feel better.
not_available I'm not sick.
not_available Nicole is.
not_available Who's Nicole? She's my sister.
not_available She has leukemia.
not_available And you're donating bone marrow.
not_available I did that when I was little.
not_available Now they want to take all my blood 
not_available and wash it through a machine.
not_available Yeah, I see.
not_available Every time Nicole gets sick, I have to go to the hospital too.
not_available I tell you what.
not_available You come with me, I'll make your foot feel better.
not_available You won't take my blood out? 
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Where are my shoes? I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
not_available Just think about it.
not_available I have thought about it.
not_available What's up? 
not_available John, I'm leaving.
not_available Can you give me a ride home? You can't leave until Dr.
not_available Coburn gets here.
not_available I'll sign out AMA.
not_available Just get the form.
not_available We keep all postpartum mothers for 24 hours.
not_available Well, I'm not a mother.
not_available I suggested she see the baby.
not_available John, can we leave, please? They observe you for a reason, Deb.
not_available I think you should sit down and relax.
not_available I'll come back for a blood test.
not_available Don't run away from this, Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available It's better for the adoptive parents, better for you if you meet your son, hold him, say goodbye.
not_available I don't think I can.
not_available Can what? Say goodbye.
not_available Last run is word fluency.
not_available For each object, name an action that goes with it.
not_available If you see a dog, you might say, "bark.
not_available " Okey
not_available dokey.
not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available It grows.
not_available Sweeps.
not_available Live in it.
not_available Writes.
not_available Blossoms.
not_available Hey, Marty.
not_available Is this the frontal GBM? Baseline scans are up, but not the functional renderings.
not_available Burke's not gonna want to cut this one out.
not_available I'll take him.
not_available For the Carboplatin trial? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, you had the parietal GBM for that.
not_available He's a good Gamma Knife candidate.
not_available Best you can offer is a 12
not_available month survival.
not_available We see up to 14 with an intra
not_available arterial protocol.
not_available Yeah, and what an enjoyable two months it is.
not_available Hello? It slithers.
not_available I'll be right up.
not_available SVC Syndrome in the unit.
not_available We'll duke it out in tumor board.
not_available Sticks you.
not_available Page me when the renderings come up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Burke gets the first look.
not_available No, he won't be interested.
not_available Entomb.
not_available Hang.
not_available All done.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available "REST" How'd I do? How'd I do? You did brilliantly, Mark.
not_available Can I go home after this? 
not_available We'll see.
not_available Cleo, you have a call on two.
not_available A girl named Kynesha, something about your car.
not_available My car? 
not_available She was talking really fast.
not_available Kynesha? Just gone? Did you see anybody? 
not_available I'll call the police.
not_available Stay near the phone.
not_available What happened? Kynesha says my car is missing, didn't see anything.
not_available Chicago Police Department.
not_available Main number, please.
not_available Always the diplomat, Peter! 
not_available What? Dr.
not_available Duhlstrom just called me, ranting.
not_available Says you stole one of his leukocyte donors, and you won't give it back.
not_available It was a little girl that I found scared, hiding under the stairs.
not_available Finders keepers? Is that it? She cut her foot.
not_available I told him to send her parents down.
not_available If you hadn't hung up on Duhlstrom, you'd know Dad is picking up Grandma and Mom's a little busy with the other daughter puking her guts out from chemo.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Hurry up, suture the foot and ship her upstairs.
not_available Has anyone bothered to explain the procedure to this girl? They've done a few hundred of these.
not_available Well, she's scared right now and feeling a little used.
not_available That's terrible.
not_available You know, the sister's a little scared too.
not_available She's scared of dying! It's not like they're trying to take out a lung.
not_available Well, she has point tenderness over the distal malleolus.
not_available You want to play ER doc, fine.
not_available I'll tell you what.
not_available I'll tell the mother to abandon her child upstairs, come and calm this kid down.
not_available But if she is not strapped in for leukapheresis by 2:30 I'm strapping you in.
not_available What did she say? She said that she would see him, but she doesn't really want to.
not_available Are you sure that you want to force this on her? We have three days until she has to sign the papers.
not_available And if she doesn't see him, she might regret it and then change her mind about the whole adoption.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, she's waiting.
not_available Why don't you bring him in to her, and the Reeds and I will follow in a few minutes so that Jing
not_available Mei can hand the baby back to Linda.
not_available Okay.
not_available I got him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ready? Oh, Carter He's so beautiful.
not_available Hey Hey.
not_available Hope it's like a jury.
not_available The longer they deliberate, the better chance I have 
not_available of getting off.
not_available They could still be waiting for Burke.
not_available I'm starting to think that he doesn't exist.
not_available Maybe he only meets people that he can help.
not_available Mark.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available Positive.
not_available Positive.
not_available That MRI tech sure thought I was a goner.
not_available He just runs the machine.
not_available He can't offer a prognosis.
not_available Come on.
not_available You know that those techs can read a scan better than most surgeons.
not_available No offense.
not_available Do you want to get something to eat? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Nope.
not_available No.
not_available Can't believe they call it a tumor board.
not_available Why? They discuss tumors.
not_available I know, but Think they'd come up with something a little more esoteric.
not_available Like what? 
not_available I don't know, the "You're completely boned" board.
not_available I heard they used to call it the "poor bastard" board but too many people were showing up.
not_available Someone told me heard they tried the "take me out back and shoot me now" board for a while.
not_available What, it didn't stick? 
not_available No, surprisingly.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Too many letters, I guess.
not_available Pity.
not_available Elizabeth? Will you have the baby either way? What? If that man comes out of that room and tells me he can't do anything that there's no way I can beat it will you still have the baby? Yes.
not_available I got a 12year
not_available old in 4 that swallowed a pair of toenail clippers.
not_available I think he's gonna need to be scoped.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available The hiccups.
not_available I thought they went away.
not_available They did.
not_available Teaspoon of sugar's supposed to help.
not_available It didn't.
not_available Is Luka coming back on the 26th or the 27th? 
not_available The 26th, I think.
not_available Where'd he go? Croatia? Yeah, he went to visit his dad for Christmas.
not_available Yo, my moms told me if you stand on your head and swallow, hiccups gone.
not_available Thanks, Malik.
not_available Hey, no problem.
not_available Works every time.
not_available Did you page me, Kerry? Yeah.
not_available We got a bad dog bite in Trauma 2.
not_available Little kid who might need to be plugged into some outpatient therapy.
not_available Sure.
not_available Did you open it? What? 
not_available The present.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available No.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you want a shot of Reglan? For what? 
not_available Hiccups.
not_available No, they'll go away.
not_available What about my toenail clippers? 
not_available Malucci, get him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You're here early.
not_available I was helping Chen with her baby.
not_available Was there a problem? No.
not_available Well, she didn't have a coach.
not_available You were her coach? How'd you do? 
not_available I did fine.
not_available She had a rough time of it.
not_available Should I? 
not_available She doesn't want visitors.
not_available I'll fill you in later.
not_available I'm gonna catch some Z's
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter! They told me you were down here.
not_available She's breast
not_available feeding! She gave the baby back after seeing him we talked, then went back to the nursery.
not_available Then the nurse says she wants to breast
not_available feed! Man, slow down.
not_available What? The nurse has to give the baby back to her if she asks for him.
not_available So she did.
not_available My wife is frantic.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Is my dad coming? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Your mom went to call him.
not_available Is that a problem? He's gonna kill me.
not_available I was gonna put it back without him knowing.
not_available Put what back? Is Winston gonna be okay? 
not_available The dog? They're not gonna put him to sleep, are they? That would be very sad.
not_available But any dog that would attack you for no reason Excuse me.
not_available I didn't mean to.
not_available What? To open my Christmas present early.
not_available I knew what it was.
not_available A BB gun.
not_available Did you shoot at the dog? I was just trying it out.
not_available Why would she need to breastfeed? 
not_available It's not unusual.
not_available Does she still have him? 
not_available She's changing her mind.
not_available I know it.
not_available There's no need to panic.
not_available Why did we have to force her to meet him? Linda, she's giving up her child.
not_available There's a maternal instinct she can't avoid and shouldn't try to.
not_available We'll give her some time and have you rock the baby in front of her.
not_available Won't that make it worse? 
not_available No.
not_available She needs to know at a very basic level that the baby will be loved.
not_available Can you talk with her? Find out what's going on, what she's thinking? Yeah, I can try.
not_available I can't lose another baby.
not_available Deb? What are you doing? You know, they say breast
not_available feeding is good for them in the first 24 hours.
not_available It's mostly colostrum, which boosts their immune system.
not_available Deb, are you having second thoughts? I've always had second thoughts.
not_available What's changed? I saw his face.
not_available I'm being selfish.
not_available I have the money to raise him.
not_available There's no reason I can't.
not_available There's a couple out there who desperately want to raise a child.
not_available And you're giving them a great gift.
not_available What happens 18 years from now? He shows up looking for an explanation.
not_available Well, you tell him the truth, you know? You tell him that you wanted to provide the best home possible for him.
not_available Do I tell him I was a coward? That my bigoted parents were more important to me than he was? Deb, I think that you gotta take your family out of this.
not_available Now, if you want to keep the baby, keep the baby.
not_available But if you don't, or you can't then you want to make sure he goes to somebody who's gonna love him, who's gonna want him.
not_available And know that you're not abandoning your baby.
not_available You're creating a family.
not_available Did you find it? Four blocks away with a burned
not_available out clutch and a busted headlight.
not_available You lucked out.
not_available They could have completely stripped it.
not_available My car wasn't stolen by a thief who doesn't know how to drive a stick.
not_available Kynesha and her friend took the car out for a joy ride.
not_available What? I gave Kynesha's friend a ride home myself.
not_available Just Kynesha, then.
not_available She's the one that called you.
not_available So she's not completely stupid.
not_available Cleo
not_available Get her in here now.
not_available I want to talk to her.
not_available Why don't we just? Get her in here 
not_available or I'll have the police talk to her.
not_available Cleo, I
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Are you Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm Melissa Walker.
not_available You found my daughter.
not_available She's in Radiology.
not_available We just wanted to get an x
not_available ray of her foot.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available It's nothing serious.
not_available We just wanted to rule out a fracture.
not_available She has three stitches.
not_available Did she fight you? She's afraid of hospitals.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know I think it might be more than just the needles.
not_available The leukapheresis requires a big one in each arm for five hours.
not_available Taylor feels the only reason you had her was to help Nicole.
not_available We love both of our daughters.
not_available Of course.
not_available If you had a child dying of leukemia and there was no bone
not_available marrow match what would you do? We were planning to have more children anyway, but I am tired of having to explain this like we did something wrong.
not_available I was just telling you Taylor feels
not_available I know.
not_available She's my daughter.
not_available And I love her, okay? I love her.
not_available Now, where is Xray? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Walker, I was justWhere is Xray?

not_available Elizabeth Corday, Dr.
not_available Greene's fiancée.
not_available Oh, congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available I met some resistance in tumor board.
not_available Is that good or bad? The oncologists and radiation therapists are having trouble embracing the future.
not_available Meaning? Come over here.
not_available They see a lesion like yours, they jump to the conclusion it's inoperable.
not_available But it's not? Not in my hands.
not_available There's your tumor.
not_available Now, as you were doing verbal tasks there was increased blood flow to language centers Those light up in orange.
not_available As you can see, while the tumor's adjacent to Broca's it hasn't invaded yet.
not_available That's not what the neurosurgeon in Chicago said.
not_available That's why you're here.
not_available So you'll operate? Yeah.
not_available We'll do an awake craniotomy.
not_available You'll be conscious and talking while I map out Broca's and resect the tumor, but the real bonus is my ability to insert high
not_available dosage chemotherapy wafers into the tumor cavity and use the malignant cells themselves to create a cancer vaccine.
not_available Thank God for second opinions.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Those idiots on the tumor board are satisfied with 12month survival where most of the patients on my protocol are disease
not_available free So when can you fit him into the schedule? How about December 31? You can ring in the new year with a load off your mind.
