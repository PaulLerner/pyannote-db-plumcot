not_available It's like not one thing I do or say isn't wrong.
not_available It makes sense that there would be a period of time like this.
not_available After I got over there and I told him, I kept waiting for it to get easier.
not_available I kept thinking, okay, the bad part's gonna be over now.
not_available It's not easy to be patient.
not_available I don't know, he's planning things.
not_available You know, without including me.
not_available He's applying for jobs without discussing it with me.
not_available He was looking at the real estate section today.
not_available What does that mean? This is what you signed up for.

not_available You get to wait.

not_available I wanted to come here ever since I was 10.
not_available Sounds like you were a very ambitious kid.

not_available My parents had to give up a lot to send me here.
not_available I'm sure they're very proud, Kwan.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I didn't expect people to be "so " 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What do you think? It's probably an infected cyst, I can do an I and D if you want.
not_available What's an I and D? 
not_available Incision and drainage.
not_available I'll open up the area and clean it out.
not_available Open it up? I don't understand.
not_available It's a simple procedure.
not_available It's to make sure the fluid doesn't reaccumulate.
not_available Can this wait until I'm home? 
not_available It's hard to be far away.
not_available But you're here now, so let us take care of this.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner, labs are back on your guy with the ear worm.
not_available One step ahead of you, Frank.
not_available Wired to receive lab reports, I get them anywhere, anytime.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah, sure, take a look.
not_available Doesn't that raise confidentiality issues? Loosen up, Greg.
not_available Oh, excuse me.

not_available I was thinking about you.
not_available Get a sputum sample from the homeless guy.
not_available Nursing man needs a new diaper.
not_available And swab the dripping ulcer on the diabetic.
not_available I was gonna have Dawn help you, but you could handle it yourself.
not_available Anyone seen Dr.
not_available Brenner? He's around here somewhere.
not_available Yeah, he still has a few more asses to pinch.
not_available What was that, doctor? Where did you find this guy? He's a piece of work.
not_available Is he? Yeah.
not_available I don't wanna be the boy who cries wolf 
not_available He's a wolf.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available Did residency in the finest hospital in Melbourne.
not_available Maybe so, but he ended up without a clue on how to Uncle Donny.
not_available To what do we owe this pleasure? Uncle Donny? 
not_available You're his uncle? My sister had a brief disastrous tryst with an Aussie back in the '70s.
not_available I've been trying to lure Simon to the Northern Hemisphere for years.
not_available Squeeze in a lunch at the Faculty Club? I'd like to introduce you around.
not_available You can survive without Simon for a few hours, right, Greg? 
not_available Definitely.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is my wife here? Car crash, very pregnant? Missy and the baby are doing great.
not_available And you, young lady, you must be Daisy.
not_available Aye? Your mum told me all about you.
not_available I'll take you to her.

not_available Do you think we could talk later? 
not_available I'm a little busy now.
not_available That's why I said later.
not_available If it's one of those amends conversations, I'd rather not.
not_available It's five minutes.
not_available It's all I'm asking.
not_available Look, Abby, this It's not a good day for me, okay? When they told me it had spread, there was no one for me to tell.
not_available So I figured, that's it.
not_available I'll go back to Cayeux.
not_available Where? Cayeuxsur
not_available Mer.
not_available It's a little town on the coast of France.

not_available I met a girl.
not_available I promised her when I left I'd see her again someday.
not_available Did you? 
not_available No.
not_available But when they told me I was dying, I wanted to go " and" then the doctor said I couldn't.
not_available There wasn't time.
not_available Now look at me.
not_available Stuck in this place.
not_available Could've been to Europe and back five times by now.
not_available I just made my first trip back home to Croatia in almost 10 years.
not_available And why did you stay away so long? Two.
not_available When I left, it was a difficult time.
not_available I was determined to forget everything.
not_available Forget what? It's much better now, it's an amazing "place " but back then, you know, things were bad.
not_available There was a lot of chaos and destruction.
not_available Oh, you mean the war? When I left, I thought I'd never go back.
not_available It's called healing via secondary intention.
not_available The hole gets smaller as the wound heals from the bottom up.
not_available Did you like it there when you first got there? It was lonely, but it gets better, give it time.
not_available Trauma 2.
not_available "Hey, it's Simon, is that Sam?" You got me.
not_available I just got a lab report back on my new phone, wanted to let you know.

not_available Kwan.
not_available I don't have cancer.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available Get me out of here.
not_available What's going on? I want to go home.
not_available What did you give him? Propofol.
not_available This never happened.
not_available After all he's been "through " he did not need to learn he had cancer over the speakerphone.
not_available Okay, so your plan was to erase his memory.
not_available He could be allergic, he could stop breathing.
not_available I know the risks of propofol.
not_available He's waking up, come here.
not_available He's a terrified kid, all alone.
not_available We could've helped him deal with that.
not_available This was gonna haunt him for the rest of his life.
not_available However long that is.
not_available Why not take it? 
not_available Start over, do it better.
not_available That's not how it works.
not_available I know how it works.
not_available It's our job to deal with the consequences " you" can't pretend it never happened.
not_available Oh, well, thank you for the lesson.
not_available Look, I'll review the slides at oncology and confirm the diagnosis before I tell him.
not_available He's my patient, how about I deal with it? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available So how long do I have to stay here? I'm kind of starving.
not_available Well, Sam could get you a tray.
not_available No reason he has to be NPO, right? Listen, Kwan, is there anybody here in Chicago that could pick you up? Oh, I'm fine on the el.
not_available I know, but just After the procedure and everything I would feel more comfortable if there was someone to drive you home.
not_available Is there anybody from school? A roommate, maybe? My RA might come.
not_available She's kind of weird, but she's always been nice to me.
not_available Okay, well, let's call her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available So, what brought you to Chicago? County General.
not_available I thought I'd dive into work and leave everything behind " but" it's not so easy, you know? On a good day, you maybe delay death for a while but you never really beat it.
not_available You should try standup comedy.
not_available You're a gloomy bastard.
not_available Sorry.
not_available So, what made you decide to go back home then? My father got sick.
not_available And I thought I can maybe fix things, you know? Bring him back to Chicago, find him the best oncologist.
not_available He wouldn't leave.
not_available You know? He wanted to He wanted to stay in his country, surrounded by the people he loved.
not_available He decided he wants to die there, like that.
not_available Good for him.
not_available At first, I felt angry.
not_available You know? Betrayed.
not_available Why? Because he didn't wanna fight? But, eventually, I let go of it, you know? I just tried to be there for him.
not_available So, what? You learned you can't fix things? That made you feel this might be a good place for you? Kind of.
not_available Two pair.
not_available Two kings and two fours.
not_available Aces over eights.
not_available I believe they call that the dead man's hand.
not_available Hey, listen.
not_available If I'm canceling the hotel, I should let them know.
not_available It's the wreck of the "Northerner.
not_available " Schooner from the 1800s.
not_available It's been there for over 200 years, it should still be there after this weekend.
not_available Uh Okay, Little France will have to wait.
not_available I'm sorry you went through all that trouble.
not_available I feel bad bailing at the last minute, and I really wanna do the dive.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available What if I came with you? Do you even dive? 
not_available I have once, in Belize.
not_available Kind of hated it, but I could hang out on the boat mix martinis, wait for you to come up.
not_available It'll be cold and boring.
not_available Really? I'll see if there's room.
not_available I've had it with Brenner.
not_available Anspaugh's Australian love child? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that nephew story's just a cover
not_available up.
not_available Brenner's not so bad.
not_available You know, I think he has a refreshing energy.
not_available And I think you've got a man
not_available crush.
not_available Don't be ridiculous.
not_available "Wha?" I see the way you look at him.
not_available Just because I can see the appeal of another man Forget it.
not_available Having an extra attending might make it so you can spend time with Bettina.

not_available We're not set up to do that.
not_available She's gonna bleed out.
not_available By the 
not_available Treatment for abruption is delivery.
not_available We can do it now or wait until both mom and baby are hypoxic or dead.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Okay, people.

not_available I told you 13th time's the charm, right? 
not_available Well, then, nice job.
not_available Why, thank you.
not_available Did you hear what we just did in there? Well, what Abby did, rather.
not_available Gotta give credit where credit's due.
not_available What is wrong with you? 
not_available Excuse me? Are you a sociopath? A sadist, stoned? I don't understand how anyone can give a cancer diagnosis with such a lack of sensitivity.
not_available I was talking to his nurse, not the patient.
not_available You were on speakerphone.
not_available And I swear, it was like you were smiling when you said it.
not_available I didn't realize that, and I'm sorry.
not_available But what's done is done.
not_available No, it's not, it's not done.
not_available We have to live with what happened today and it makes me sick.
not_available You know, I heard that you were tightly wound, but I had no idea.
not_available Get the hell away, before I throw that thing against the wall.
not_available What's the deal with the chopper run? We've been suited up for 15 minutes.
not_available Dispatch called, there's a wind advisory.
not_available They closed our helipad, so they sent it to the CALP.
not_available Were you planning on telling us, or leave us hanging? Maybe he likes us in yellow.
not_available Well, your secret's safe with me.
not_available It better be.
not_available Okay, I gotta work now.
not_available Okay.

not_available Frank, you are an officer and a gentleman.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Lucien.
not_available Skye.

not_available What? 
not_available I might get in the way.
not_available Spoil your playtime with the boys.
not_available Is that it? 
not_available Lucien.
not_available What? How come I've never met any of these boys? You're not really doing this, are you? 
not_available Doing what? Look.
not_available I've tried to be cool with your fluidity and your independence.
not_available I've scolded myself for being envious of your dive buddies your climbing club, your bike team.
not_available You don't need to be jealous.
not_available They're all friends.
not_available I happen to have a lot of guy friends.
not_available Yeah, you do.
not_available You do.
not_available In fact, you have a pathologic need to solicit male affection.
not_available Excuse me? You think I don't see the game you're playing with Brenner? Forgive me for being slow.
not_available I'm finally getting it now.
not_available Get what? The whole lovetheoneyour
not_available with thing is nothing but a bogus justification to screw anything that catches your eye.
not_available Well Good.

not_available And you're absolutely right.
not_available I've done everybody.
not_available Pratt, Morris, Gates.

not_available And tomorrow, I promise, I will bend over.
not_available Abby, stop.
not_available Good job today.
not_available That's all I wanted to say.
not_available All right, look, I know I've been judgmental.
not_available I just That I grew up surrounded by people with problems, big problems.
not_available I watched them dig themselves into a hole and not really try to get out of it.
not_available And maybe that's not you.
not_available I hope it isn't.
not_available I'm working really hard for that not to be me.
not_available I know.
not_available Sometimes it's hard for me to be real rah
not_available rah about it.
not_available I hate rah
not_available rah.

not_available Night.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available Hi, Abby.

not_available Um I know I postponed my interview today, but that was a mistake.
not_available I don't know why I thought I should wait, because I shouldn't.
not_available I wanna be an attending here.
not_available And I think I would be a good one.
not_available So I was wondering if, maybe, you could squeeze me in tomorrow.
not_available Or the next day 
not_available I have a few minutes right now.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Honey, listen, a B in history does not ruin your chances of being appointed to the Supreme Court.
not_available Yeah, listen, my doctor's here.
not_available I gotta go, okay, honey? Okay, I'll call you later.
not_available I love you.
not_available My son, Tommy, is so hard on himself.

not_available Right, but now the aortic graft is involved.
not_available And tomorrow we're gonna have to do a surgery to clean it out.

not_available All day long, I've avoided this room and I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's not like I had big plans for the morning.

not_available Yeah, but you've been doing so well.
not_available So? You go back in tomorrow, you do what you have to do.
not_available I survived a ruptured aorta, right? I mean, not such a big thing after that.
not_available I'm gonna have the same surgeon, right? 
not_available Definitely.
not_available Then I'm gonna be fine.
not_available I'm gonna be just fine.
not_available Hey.
