
not_available ER Previously, on ER Dr.
not_available Green, excuse me! I've done quite a few more ER procedures than she has.
not_available I used to sell vitamins over the phone.
not_available That's kind of in the health field, isn't it? You just want your boy to have your last name.
not_available So, what's wrong? How's your busy social calendar? 
not_available It's not as busy.
not_available This is Elizabeth Corday, new surgical resident.
not_available It's a pleasure.
not_available Maybe it would be best if I stepped in and took over some of the administrative duties while you're recuperating.
not_available God bless you, Kerry Weaver.
not_available You got the job.
not_available What? "Freindly Fire" Hold it.
not_available Hold it! Thanks.
not_available It's five minutes by car.
not_available 15 minutes on the El.
not_available You're not enjoying this? 
not_available No.
not_available Should I? It's a secret romance.
not_available It's what sells bad novels.
not_available This shouldn't be a bad novel.
not_available That's my train.
not_available Yeah, get that.
not_available See you at work.
not_available Bye.
not_available He continues to gain weight and he's spending more time awake.
not_available What about his lungs? 
not_available He's down to a quarter liter.
not_available So when can he come home? 
not_available I'd say a week or less.
not_available You hear that, pumpkin? You're gonna come home in a week.
not_available Isn't that premature? What about his immune system? I think there's more risk of nosocomial infection here.
not_available Should he be circumcised before he comes home? That's what my mother told me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Tabash and I decided against it.
not_available Isn't it healthier? Some studies indicate that circumcision prevents UTls and may reduce the risk of cancer.
not_available Yeah, I don't find those studies conclusive.
not_available I'll just teach him proper hygiene.
not_available I don't wanna take any risk.
not_available Dr.
not_available Tabash, what about immunization? After discharge.
not_available With OPV he could shed virus.
not_available I don't want the immuno
not_available suppressed children here at risk.
not_available I got a thymectomy.
not_available Peter, what about the circumcision? Honey, he doesn't need one.
not_available Morning, Doug.
not_available Mark.
not_available You don't wear scrubs to work anymore? I got tired of having people hit me up for a diagnosis in line at Starbucks.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, there's an explosive diarrhea in Exam 4.
not_available What's Weaver doing? 
not_available She's not in yet.
not_available See if Del Amico can take it.
not_available They made me pay $ 1000
not_available Shut up! The decision to appoint you Acting Chief of Emergency Services did not come simply because Dr.
not_available Morgenstern recommended you.
not_available Of course.
not_available In fact, many feel Dr.
not_available Morgenstern's approach to management is not something we wish to see perpetuated.
not_available With all due respect to Dr.
not_available Morgenstern, I agree.
not_available I know we're way beyond our budget.
not_available We are in a crisis situation.
not_available And that's why I've drafted this.
not_available It outlines measures that if applied now would put us back on budget within six months.
not_available So much waste is simply due to lax administration.
not_available Well, you've never struck me as lax, Kerry.
not_available And this job is not about winning popularity contests.
not_available That's never been my goal, Donald.
not_available Just Don.
not_available There will be a reevaluation when Dr.
not_available Morgenstern recovers.
not_available But I'm confident that you'll make things work.
not_available Thank you for your trust.
not_available Yes! Hi.
not_available I'm Cynthia Hooper.
not_available I think they called from Personnel.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Jerry, the Unit Service Coordinator.
not_available I'll be training you.
not_available Come on around.
not_available Cynthia, this is Nurse Haleh Adams.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, Cynthia, my new assistant.
not_available How are you? Nurse Hathaway, hi! Well, here I am.
not_available Yeah, hi.
not_available Cynthia Hooper, remember? You interviewed me? Yes, I did.
not_available Anyone seen Mark? 
not_available Check in the lounge.
not_available So let's start you on some basic procedure.
not_available Anything interesting, Dr.
not_available Carter? Thought I'd take a look at this cellulitis.
not_available Cases will now be taken in order.
not_available No more cherry
not_available picking.
not_available Here's an old lady, weak and dizzy.
not_available Jerry, have you paged my med student? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I paged him twice.
not_available Anna, there's a patient in 3 if you wanna teach your student ulcer débridement.
not_available Thanks, Maggie.
not_available Sure.
not_available Haleh, I'd like each nurse to get a copy of these policy changes today.
not_available Did Personnel get the wrong name? 
not_available I picked her.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available Fine? Mark, she was a disaster.
not_available She has no experience that matches the job description.
not_available I considered the other candidates and she was the best of the lot.
not_available Well, we could always interview more candidates.
not_available It wasn't necessary.
not_available After the interview, she explained to me she was just having a bad day.
not_available A bad day? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She'll be great.
not_available What? New Chief of Emergency Services has decided to change some policy.
not_available No shift overlapping? What's that? If we don't punch out by 7, she'll do it for us.
not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico, do you remember me? 
not_available Of course, Carla.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I hear the baby's doing great.
not_available Yeah, he is.
not_available I was wondering if we could talk when you're finished.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Actually, we can talk now.
not_available Old Tim won't mind.
not_available Débriding his ulcer has a sedative effect.
not_available I've started nursing.
not_available He's coming home in five days.
not_available That's great.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I'm real excited.
not_available Been buying car seats, baby strollers.
not_available I love those baby shops.
not_available Everything in them is so cute.
not_available I was wondering I wanted to ask you a question.
not_available Do you think I should have him circumcised? It would be my preference, sure.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Débride to here, then dress it with Tegaderm, okay? Is circumcision healthier? 
not_available I recommend it.
not_available It's better for hygiene and between us, I just like the way it looks.
not_available Don't let Peter hear you say that.
not_available Oh, yeah? Seriously, having it done is really in your son's best interest.
not_available Could you do it? Sure.
not_available I'll do it today.
not_available Hey, I heard a Le Fort lll facial fracture came in.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle gave it to Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available She's with the surgeon now.
not_available Coming through! I got it! motorcycle versus delivery truck.
not_available Blunt trauma to chest and abdomen.
not_available BP 110/70.
not_available Pulse 110.
not_available We couldn't get a line.
not_available He's a tough stick.
not_available Okay! Follow me to Trauma 2.
not_available On my count, everybody.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available CBC, Chem
not_available 7, type and cross for four.
not_available Let's get a portable C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available No kidding, "tough stick.
not_available " Nothing but track marks.
not_available I'll slide around you, Conni.
not_available Right upper tenderness with guarding.
not_available Get an abdominal CT with contrast.
not_available I can't get a vein.
not_available I got one.
not_available Damn, it blew! Last time they had to stick through the deep vein.
not_available Give me a central line kit.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available I got it.
not_available I'd like to hear it.
not_available motorcycle versus delivery truck right upper tenderness.
not_available I ordered a CT and am putting in a central line.
not_available Anna'll take it.
not_available You do sutures.
not_available Where's your student? 
not_available Come on.
not_available I already started.
not_available Carter! Sutures.
not_available Started a saline.
not_available Vitals are stable.
not_available Estimated blood loss, 300 cc's.
not_available He's gotten 800 cc's in so far.
not_available Al? Al? What happened? Clutch slipped and the cart knocked me and Bill into a ditch.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Just a little dirty.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We've taken harder knocks playing oneon
not_available one.
not_available All right.
not_available Come here.
not_available What do you need? Prednisone.
not_available This med room really needs reorganization.
not_available Why don't you write a prescription? 
not_available He only needs seven.
not_available We can't keep giving away our pharmacy stock.
not_available I was reviewing our records and noticed that your salary's paid by Emergency Medicine and not Pediatrics.
not_available Morgenstern and Bernstein worked it out.
not_available Doesn't that mean the ER is underwriting your fellowship? For which they get my full services.
not_available Morgenstern thinks it's a two
not_available way street.
not_available Morgenstern is not in charge now.
not_available What's the nature of your fellowship? I could review your research proposal.
not_available Sure.
not_available Can you get me a copy today? 
not_available If I can find one.
not_available You're needed in Trauma 1.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yes, this is Dr.
not_available Carter calling again.
not_available Could Henry page me? Actually, don't have him page me.
not_available Have him come to the ER.
not_available Because he's doing a clerkship! That's right, he's on duty.
not_available He's on duty.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle pulled me off of a trauma this morning to cover sutures.
not_available I don't think that's the best use of my time.
not_available Maybe she thought she was more qualified.
not_available She didn't do it.
not_available She gave it to Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available Which has become standard procedure.
not_available The suture room is the intern's place unless you can get your student to carry the load.
not_available Anna, how's your student doing? 
not_available She's a gem.
not_available There you go.
not_available Hello? Hello? Hello? Henry, is that you? 
not_available It's this hallway.
not_available Be careful with that.
not_available I don't use this around patients.
not_available I don't mean that.
not_available I know this guy who got one free.
not_available The first month, his bill was 300 bucks.
not_available Well, I limit my calls.
not_available Plus you can write it off on your taxes.
not_available Right.
not_available So it's like an "economy move.
not_available " It's not bad.
not_available I'll clean it up then suture it.
not_available I guess we lucked out, huh, Bill? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Where did all this blood come from? 
not_available It's Al's, from when he fell on me.
not_available I knew it would tear me up.
not_available But I had to grab the cable.
not_available Can you move your fingers? That's good.
not_available That's good.
not_available Have you had a tetanus shot? Yeah.
not_available About a year ago.
not_available Are you allergic to any drugs? 
not_available None that I know of.
not_available Hey, there's my guy.
not_available How's the hero? How's it look? They'll fix you up.
not_available They can fix anybody up.
not_available You know, this man saved two lives.
not_available How are those guys? They got away without a scratch.
not_available Listen, Casey, I want to take care of you on this.
not_available Whatever this costs, I'll pay for it.
not_available I want everybody working like we've been working.
not_available But I gotta watch things.
not_available I don't want this on workers' comp.
not_available I don't know how bad this is gonna be.
not_available What are we talking about here? Some stitches? A cast? Maybe surgery.
not_available You put it on your health insurance.
not_available I pick up the rest.
not_available And I keep you on the employment rolls.
not_available I don't know how my hands are gonna work after this.
not_available You know what this'll cost me on workers' comp? Without workers' comp, he won't qualify for disability.
not_available Suddenly nurses know everything.
not_available I'm gonna go make some calls.
not_available I had an interesting wound this morning.
not_available A linoleum knife.
not_available The cut was as clean as a scalpel's.
not_available Carter, can you take a case for me? I'm swamped.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, Chasity? Dress that for me, would you? altered consciousness.
not_available No trauma.
not_available Her husband brought her in.
not_available Thanks, Anna.
not_available Mr.
not_available Toren? I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I'll be taking care of your wife.
not_available Last night she was fine, but I couldn't wake her up this morning.
not_available Could she have hit her head somehow? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Did she complain earlier about having a headache? Fever? Nausea? No, nothing.
not_available She was fine.
not_available Heart and lungs are normal.
not_available That's good.
not_available She's not having any trouble breathing.
not_available Kirsty, honey, can you hear me? For God's sake, baby, what's wrong? Please, just wake up.
not_available Pupils are in mid
not_available position and fixed.
not_available Corneal reflexes still intact.
not_available That's good.
not_available What are you doing? Seeing if eye movement adjusts to changes in head position.
not_available It'll tell us if there's brainstem involvement.
not_available No doll's
not_available eye response.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available It's too early to tell.
not_available I want to check some labs and do a head CT.
not_available Wait in the waiting room, and I'll keep you posted.
not_available It's bad isn't it? I can tell.
not_available We won't know anything until we run the tests.
not_available Do whatever you have to.
not_available Anything.
not_available I have really good insurance.
not_available Please? Excuse me.
not_available Where's the Benton baby? Reece? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, Benton.
not_available Reece
not_available Benton? The procedure room.
not_available Okay.
not_available Whoa! Wait! What are you doing? I'm circumcising him.
not_available No, I don't want him circumcised.
not_available You don't want me to leave it half done, do you? There.
not_available I didn't want this.
not_available Who gave you permission? Can you open up the xeroform gauze? His mother.
not_available She had no right to.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I assumed it was agreed.
not_available No, it wasn't.
not_available Well, this isn't between you and I.
not_available This is between you and Carla.
not_available And it's done.
not_available Let's get him back into the crib.
not_available No, I got him.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Edema of the brainstem.
not_available Probably an infarct.
not_available That'd go along with the symptoms you described.
not_available How did she respond to sternal rub? 
not_available Withdrawal.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's see.
not_available She's decerebrating now.
not_available I don't think it'll be long before she goes into full respiratory arrest.
not_available She's 27 years old.
not_available Any family members around? 
not_available Her husband.
not_available He's in shock.
not_available He doesn't know what to think.
not_available Be sure you talk to him about organ donation.
not_available They'll be taking you up to X
not_available ray soon.
not_available How's the pain? Okay, since whatever they're giving me through that tube.
not_available Better living through chemistry, huh? I'm sorry we had to cut your shirt to pieces to get it off.
not_available Time for a new one anyway.
not_available With my first disability check.
not_available Is this yours? No, officer.
not_available Not mine.
not_available Did you smoke this today? Never saw it before.
not_available You were operating dangerous machinery.
not_available Men were hurt.
not_available Men are alive because I grabbed a running cable, lady.
not_available Because I tore my hands to shreds.
not_available You can smoke it or stick it where the sun don't shine.
not_available I told you it's not mine.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll just ask your boss.
not_available Maybe he dropped it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available How's your first day? 
not_available She's doing great.
not_available We're just starting lab requisitions.
not_available I'm so lucky.
not_available After my interview, I didn't think I had a chance.
not_available What happened? 
not_available A disaster.
not_available I cried.
not_available We're glad that you're here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hi.
not_available Heather! I left you a message about the Sports Medicine dinner.
not_available And I left a message that I couldn't make it.
not_available Well, you sounded a little vague, so I'm giving it a faceto
not_available face try.
not_available It's such a coup if I show up with a handsome doctor.
not_available And you couldn't find anyone else? Okay, busted.
not_available I already bragged I was bringing you.
not_available I'll make it up to you.
not_available I promise.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Tonight I just can't.
not_available Is it me or the event? I mean, does "no" mean "never"? No.
not_available Just tonight
not_available There's a truck outside.
not_available Someone's hurt.
not_available I should check this out.
not_available Okay.
not_available A lot of blood.
not_available Could be an arterial injury.
not_available Grab some lap pads.
not_available Get a pressure dressing.
not_available He shot himself in the leg ejecting a clip.
not_available Glenda, take the ordnance.
not_available Lock the ammo in the back.
not_available You can't take weapons in there.
not_available I can't leave our best stock in the truck.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Jer, keep these safe, man.
not_available Jerry, we're going to Trauma 2.
not_available Glenda.
not_available I'm here, honey.
not_available Did you secure the weapons, baby? 
not_available Yes, baby, I did.
not_available We were on our way to a gun show to set up a booth.
not_available Glenda, come close.
not_available Don't let them take the leg.
not_available Don't let them, Glenda.
not_available It was about his health.
not_available My son's health is always on my mind.
not_available Our son! 
not_available What? You can't divide his life into categories.
not_available Say, "I'll do health and you do diapers.
not_available " No.
not_available You hide behind medicine so we don't talk.
not_available Carla, we're talking now.
not_available This isn't a conversation.
not_available Because you don't care what I think or feel.
not_available I may not be your choice for the mother of your child, but we have to share.
not_available Like you shared in the circumcision? I was mad.
not_available Come clean, Peter.
not_available Your attitude is not about his health.
not_available It's that you want him to look like you.
not_available So what if I do? Carla, he's my son.
not_available Then why didn't you say that? I understand that.
not_available Instead of you blowing medical steam that don't make no damn sense.
not_available Carla, what happened to that boy's penis should have been left up to me.
not_available This type of stroke can happen to anybody.
not_available It might be congenital.
not_available It's so unfair.
not_available But as long as she's still alive, there's hope, right? As the swelling increases, it may affect her ability to breathe.
not_available Then the question becomes whether it's in her best interest to put her on a ventilator.
not_available Let her die? We can sustain her life on a respirator.
not_available But the question is, what kind of life would it be? I can't believe it's all just gonna be over like this.
not_available You might think about whether organ donation is something that she'd want.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Kirsten would wanna help people.
not_available Did you see that? She may move a little bit from time to time.
not_available Oh, my God, she's talking! Do you hear her? Kirsty, honey, can you hear me? Steve.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, honey.
not_available It's me.
not_available She's coming around! Oh, my God! She's all right.
not_available Sinus tach on the scope.
not_available Entrance wound on the left thigh.
not_available Exit wound by the lateral fibula.
not_available Really torn up.
not_available Get a portable x
not_available ray down here.
not_available Ed, do you feel this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No DP or posterior pulses.
not_available The woman with the stroke is awake.
not_available What woman? 
not_available The brainstem bleed.
not_available No.
not_available She can't be.
not_available She is.
not_available She's talking.
not_available Go on.
not_available I'll call Vascular.
not_available Did you show me the right CT? 
not_available Yes.
not_available She was comatose.
not_available Carter, people with brainstem infarctions, they don't just wake up.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available What happened to me? 
not_available That's what we want to determine.
not_available Follow my finger.
not_available How do you feel? She's fine.
not_available Look at her.
not_available Fine.
not_available Just a little tired.
not_available How long do I have to stay here? We need to keep you under observation a while.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available See this? This little
not_available Schmutz? Could be an aneurysm leak trickled down and caused the swelling.
not_available Should we do an LP? 
not_available No, it would be a waste of time.
not_available This could blow.
not_available Let's get an MRl right away, okay? 
not_available Brought some clothes for you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Does Bill know you're HIV
not_available positive? No.
not_available I think you'd better tell him.
not_available My blood didn't get mixed with his.
not_available You saw he doesn't have a cut.
not_available He's got some skin abrasions.
not_available Look, Jeanie These are working guys.
not_available Okay? It's not like around here.
not_available That gets out, I'll be out of a job.
not_available It was rough telling people here.
not_available But I did it.
not_available He should be tested and put on the cocktail until his results come back.
not_available For a few scratches? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How long will the xrays take? 
not_available Depends on how backed up they are.
not_available Wow.
not_available How much is this? 
not_available 275 bucks.
not_available Here.
not_available Put this up to your shoulder.
not_available Feel the potential.
not_available Last year we sold those to everybody.
not_available You ever hear of Colonel Draht? He was doing fine work with weapons training patriots in Texas.
not_available Like that guy from Waco? What's the range? That'll chuck a grenade into an area target at 350 meters.
not_available Buy it! I'll give you a break.
not_available What with Ed hurt and all, we won't make the gun show.
not_available Jerry! 
not_available Honey, it's disarmed.
not_available The feds have us hamstrung.
not_available It's illegal to sell usable ordnance.
not_available But if you take that home, there's a kit for 70 bucks.
not_available My neighbor has this dog that barks all night, every night.
not_available Damn! I guess Ed used a kit on that one.
not_available No, I don't belong to any organization.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available You think it's against the law, look it up.
not_available That is our personal property.
not_available I know my rights according to your Constitution.
not_available Can you hear me? How about when I speak like this? Yes, but the ringing is really loud.
not_available What? 
not_available It tickles.
not_available Sorry.
not_available The eardrum is intact.
not_available Let me take a look at the other side.
not_available I hope they're clean, my ears.
not_available Very clean.
not_available If the tinnitus continues
not_available Tinnitus? The ringing in your ears.
not_available You may have to see a specialist just to get your hearing checked, okay? Thanks.
not_available You know, I feel really safe here.
not_available After today? I think it's having all you doctors around.
not_available I don't feel like I'm out there on my own.
not_available Out there on "a smile and a shoestring.
not_available " Isn't that from something? 
not_available Death of a Salesman.
not_available We did it in high school.
not_available My teacher told me I had talent, but he was trying to get into my pants.
not_available I think I saw that play in college.
not_available It's so sad when that guy looks back over his life and there's just nothing there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I better get back to learning codes.
not_available Thanks again.
not_available Sure.
not_available So do we have exposure? We've mobilized the proximal segment and have a clean edge.
not_available This is the weapons merchant who cost us an ambulance? Damned lucky it won't cost him a leg.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday will assist in anastomosis of the popliteal.
not_available Five0 of Prolene on a C
not_available 1 needle.
not_available We normally use six
not_available 0.
not_available Five
not_available 0 is fine.
not_available What is your preference on procedure, Miss Corday? I've had good results with the triangulation technique of Carel.
not_available Favored among the British.
not_available I worked with British surgeons on the joint NATO exercise in 1974.
not_available Tell me, do you know Sir Lyle Sugden? 
not_available Suggy? Yes.
not_available Perhaps you don't know.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Great loss.
not_available Rather a relief.
not_available Towards the end he got a bit shaky for slash and dash.
not_available "Slash and dash.
not_available " I love those British terms.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, suppose Miss Corday asked you for a "torch.
not_available " What would you give her? I've taken to saying "flashlight.
not_available " Once in the field hospital, mid
not_available thoracotomy, we had a power failure.
not_available Sir Lyle yelled, "A torch! A torch! " I thought he had snapped, was gonna burn the O.R.
not_available "I say, when we finish we should break for a cuppa.
not_available What, oh? " Stand back! What have you got? 
not_available Laura Quentin, 18.

not_available I know her.
not_available All right! Let's go, everybody! Ready? Everybody ready? One, two, three.
not_available Get a CBC, PT, and type and cross for four.
not_available Probably from repeated vomiting.
not_available She came in for bulimia weeks ago.
not_available Why wasn't she admitted to Psych? 
not_available I'm scared.
not_available Am I gonna die? No.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available Well, no wonder she's back here.
not_available Run another liter.
not_available Who was the Attending? 
not_available Greene.
not_available So we're picking up his slack.
not_available We are, aren't we? Right there.
not_available That's a bleed in the left anterior, inferior cerebellar artery.
not_available Process the film.
not_available I'll call a neurosurgeon.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Toren? Mrs.
not_available Toren? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, she's decerebrating.
not_available I'll set up for intubation.
not_available Carter, get her husband to consent to immediate surgery.
not_available I'll book an O.R.
not_available She all right? 
not_available She needs surgery.
not_available The MRl showed a leaking aneurysm in her cerebellum.
not_available It has to be operated on.
not_available We'll need you to sign a consent form.
not_available I'm not signing anything! You just told me she was dying.
not_available You wanted her organs.
not_available Now she's fine! She's not fine! She has a hemorrhage in her cerebellum.
not_available When she went in there she was fine! Carter, transport is on the way.
not_available Be ready to intubate.
not_available I'll get Dr.
not_available Corelli.
not_available We don't have consent.
not_available What? She was fine! Talking! I don't want you opening her head! Mr.
not_available Toren, listen very carefully.
not_available Your wife will die if she doesn't have an operation immediately.
not_available I want her moved! That will kill her.
not_available I know you care for her.
not_available But please, let us operate.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available We are talking minutes.
not_available These are the post
not_available op forms Anspaugh prefers.
not_available What a dreadful old gasbag! I mean, he's a decent enough surgeon.
not_available But all that banging on.
not_available Pathetic Anglophilia.
not_available Tell me, do you call it "pimping"? What? Treating you like a med student with those silly questions.
not_available We call that "pimping.
not_available " 
not_available Yeah, that's what we call it.
not_available Fortunately, in the UK the old tossers are too lazy to come to the O.R.s.
not_available What? We don't refer to our senior surgeons that way.
not_available So I should stop speaking my mind? 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Not on my account.
not_available I saw her on the phone to Anspaugh and she did not look happy.
not_available Her first day and the ER blows up! I don't imagine he was saying, "Attaboy! " 
not_available I see they got that door repaired.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available I'm just so relieved no one was hurt.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Doug, I know it's been crazy today.
not_available But did you get a copy of your research? I just haven't had a chance to do it yet, Kerry.
not_available Maggie, what have you got? Abscess.
not_available Simple I and D.
not_available Looks like a fairly deep abscess.
not_available The booths in that bar are all rotten.
not_available There's nails sticking up, maybe an inch.
not_available Did you read my directive? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That really hurts.
not_available Most people don't understand what's at stake here.
not_available The county is just looking for an excuse to close this ER.
not_available Lab tests, x
not_available rays, CT scans that just cannot be justified.
not_available Next time you sit on a nail, get here sooner.
not_available People just won't realize that I'm trying to save this place.
not_available I need the half
not_available inch iodoform.
not_available I'm hoping that a few people will understand and come onboard.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cut? Where's Dr.
not_available Corelli? In 3, finishing a laminectomy.
not_available You can't go in there! Dr.
not_available Corelli? Mark Greene, ER Attending.
not_available This is not allowed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corelli, I've got an emergency! 
not_available It better be good, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available followed by periods of brief lucidity, after which she decompensated.
not_available She's posturing, GCS
not_available 5.
not_available MRl shows a cerebellar bleed.
not_available I took the liberty of booking O.R.
not_available 5.
not_available Helen, can you close for me? Five pounds enough? 
not_available All right.
not_available You'll feel a little pressure at the top of your leg.
not_available I've found ice and Trendelenburg excellent adjuvant therapies for the reduction of these inguinal hernias.
not_available Can we get an ice pack? 
not_available Sure.
not_available All right, buddy, now we're gonna fix you up but the first thing we gotta do is stand you on your head.
not_available Weird, huh? 
not_available I like your technique.
not_available Cranking the bed? 
not_available No, with children.
not_available You're so at ease with them.
not_available It's where I spend all my time.
not_available All your time? That's certainly dedication.
not_available I've come to crave a bit of leisure.
not_available It's not all work and no play.
not_available How you doing there? So when one plays, where does one play? I mean, here in Chicago.
not_available Now, we know you can take pain let's see if you can take a little cold, huh? What a guy! All right.
not_available Why don't we just wait and see? You were about to tell me how to unwind.
not_available Or perhaps show me? That's if you're up to playing Virgil to my Dante.
not_available Nothing really comes to mind.
not_available I have a patient to see.
not_available Well, if you think of a place, I'd like to invite you.
not_available I'm involved with someone.
not_available It's not a problem.
not_available Bring her along.
not_available We ever getting out of here? I think they're about through with us.
not_available How's that wrist? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available The doctor called it a Colles' fracture.
not_available It's not so bad.
not_available Bill, Jeanie's here because you've gotta be tested.
not_available Tested for what? I'm HIV
not_available positive.
not_available You're not talking about having AIDS, right? Yeah, I am.
not_available When we landed together, I was bleeding pretty bad.
not_available I'm sure our blood didn't mix when you were scratched but you should be tested just to be safe.
not_available So I could get AIDS? 
not_available It's a very remote possibility.
not_available You got it? Oh, man! You're out there working with us and you got AIDS? I gotta get by like everybody else.
not_available We can live with it and take precautions.
not_available Except now maybe I got infected.
not_available Jeanie will take some blood so we can be sure
not_available No! Not her.
not_available I want someone else.
not_available Come on, we're talking about Jeanie
not_available Not her! I'll get a nurse.
not_available Carol, I know what you're thinking and you're wrong.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available I'll follow you untilWhy me? Why not follow her? If it wasn't a secret, I'd tell her
not_available I think this secrecy thing works for you.
not_available I didn't flirt with her.
not_available No.
not_available She just likes the way you hold an ice pack.
not_available I told her I was attached.
not_available I didn't say who with.
not_available I didn't say that Carol was my
not_available Your what? I'm your what? Come here.
not_available I want to be with you and be here with you because I want to.
not_available But if you don't trust me, then this doesn't work.
not_available I have a lot of things to do.
not_available I'll be at the El.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? The O.R.
not_available says they clipped the base of her aneurysm.
not_available In time? 
not_available She has a chance at a full recovery.
not_available Her husband wants to thank you.
not_available This was more your case than mine.
not_available You made the diagnosis.
not_available When credit is offered, take it.
not_available It doesn't happen often.
not_available Mark.
not_available Laura Quentin's back.
not_available Who? 
not_available The bulimia patient.
not_available I need your signature so Medicine can admit her.
not_available Is that a problem? Because I didn't admit her before? It was a mistake.
not_available I should've admitted her last time.
not_available She wasn't critical, so technically it wasn't.
not_available I didn't go the extra mile.
not_available It shouldn't depend on doctors to go the extra mile.
not_available We need a safety net.
not_available We're an ER, not a clinic.
not_available She's doing it.
not_available What? Weaver's punched us out.
not_available We're working for free.
not_available She can't do that.
not_available I got another hour.
not_available Kerry? 
not_available This is a really bad idea.
not_available It's not a matter of choice.
not_available I'm not singling out nurses.
not_available All departments have to cut back.
not_available Who'll do nurses' duties? 
not_available Interns.
not_available The interns? Carol, I see people at the end of their shifts talking, planning social events.
not_available It can't go on.
not_available Nurses' time isn't billed for.
not_available They don't generate income.
not_available No.
not_available They just generate care.
not_available No, I just had a change of plans.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available There's a tux rental place right by here.
not_available Listen, instead of that rubber chicken why don't we go to Stella Mare and have a nice dinner? We can be a little late.
not_available Great.
not_available Okay.
not_available Big night? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Sounds great.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Looking good.
not_available Looking good.
not_available There's one spot by the door where the paint's chipped off.
not_available A few more touches and it'll all be clean.
not_available I've been checking your employment file.
not_available You've accrued 26 vacation days.
not_available I've never taken a day off.
not_available I'm thinking about going down to Alabama after the first of the year.
not_available Perhaps you should start taking that time right now.
not_available Now? It's like a million degrees down there.
not_available I understand there's some lovely antebellum homes down in Mobile.
not_available Did you find your student? The lab said he went to the fish hatchery for salmon sperm.
not_available They got pretty backed up in Sutures.
not_available Saying it's my fault? 
not_available It's where I assigned you.
not_available Will Dr.
not_available Del Amico be doing sutures? 
not_available What? I'm just wondering if you'll continue to give her the interesting cases while I get assigned to suture Siberia! What are you talking about? I'm just asking if there isn't something about Dr.
not_available Del Amico that you find especially appealing? Meaning? You know what I mean.
not_available That's great.
not_available That's great.
not_available What? 
not_available Ask him.
not_available By the way, Anna, I love your hair.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's that about? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's the end of the day.
not_available I could use a laugh.
not_available It wasn't that funny.
not_available She has a weird sense of humor.
not_available So it's a private joke.
not_available Congratulations on that stroke lady.
not_available I heard it was a good save.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks for giving it to me.
not_available I was swamped.
not_available I'd like to return the favor.
not_available Don't, please.
not_available I hate feeling indebted.
not_available Wait.
not_available There is something.
not_available Sure.
not_available This morning you were talking about taxes.
not_available I'm getting hammered.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can deduct stethoscope, lab coat, books.
not_available Otoscope? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available All equipment.
not_available What about dinner? We could talk about it.
not_available Tonight's the Laundromat.
not_available Me too! Me too.
not_available We could do our laundry, I'll do your tax plan
not_available Laundry's deductible.
not_available Really? Okay.
not_available I'll get us some sandwiches.
not_available Great.
not_available Doug! I had prepared a very elaborate argument.
not_available This mean I don't need it? I already had the argument, with myself.
not_available I hope there wasn't any name
not_available calling.
not_available No, it was very civil.
not_available You won.
not_available So I do better when I'm not there.
not_available This time, yeah.
not_available So you trust me? This time.
not_available Are you keeping score? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're ahead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What? "Talk on rotator cuff injuries in track and field.
not_available " What exactly does that mean? You're the doctor.
not_available You should know that.
not_available I probably did know that before we drank this.
not_available I have an idea.
not_available Why don't we drink another bottle? Then we can obliterate all medical knowledge.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available What? I missed you.
not_available No, come on.
not_available You never called.
not_available You vanished.
not_available I was a fool, okay? I'll make it up to you.
not_available Promise? It won't work with dimes and nickels.
not_available You gotta use quarters.
not_available You don't have any quarters, do you? Cool.
not_available You should let your wife do this.
not_available My wife? Oh, yeah.
not_available She's getting some sandwiches for us.
not_available You don't know what you're doing.
not_available What are you doing? Sorry.
not_available What's going on? I don't know! This thing just, like, broke on me.
not_available It can't take this kind of load.
not_available Haven't you ever used a dryer before? Yeah, but the one in my neighborhood handles loads like this.
not_available Even bigger ones, all the time.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, we gotta get thisLet me see
not_available Wow! How about a hoagie? Here.
not_available Oh, no! Wow.
not_available It's gonna be a long night in the Laundromat.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available I'm just
not_available I don't know.
not_available I used to turn you on.
not_available No, you turn me on.
not_available I just I guess I've just been a little stressed out.
not_available I'd rather you didn't smoke in here.
not_available I'm allergic.
not_available Maybe it'd be better if I you know, kind of got going.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Maybe it is better if you go.
