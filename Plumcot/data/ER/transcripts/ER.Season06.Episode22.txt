not_available Okay, Abby.
not_available Go ahead.

not_available we're on our way up.

not_available Who? 
not_available The man he abandoned.
not_available I didn't.
not_available He went into asystole near Mercy.
not_available It was too late.
not_available 10 minutes would've mattered? 
not_available We won't know.
not_available The shooter? The most critical patient is the priority! A bullet's in his heart! It can embolize and he'll lose his leg.
not_available Debate this later.
not_available Peter, get upstairs.
not_available Elizabeth needs some help! You didn't care! 
not_available I was caring for the boy! That's enough! That's enough.
not_available Kerry, I need to talk to you.
not_available I can't believe that guy! 
not_available BP 118/78.

not_available Do you need some help? 
not_available Yeah, I might.
not_available It's important.
not_available He needed to get to a trauma center!

not_available He was darker.
not_available Maybe Mexican.
not_available What is it? Single right stab wound to the lower right quadrant four centimeters off the midline.

not_available A gray sweatshirt, I think.
not_available Full trauma panel and check a HemoCue.

not_available Your pregnancy.
not_available When are you due? 
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available You're eight months.

not_available Don't tell my parents.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Gloria.
not_available Gloria Milton.
not_available The stab wound damaged the placenta, causing it to bleed.
not_available It cuts off oxygen to your baby.
not_available I didn't know I had one.
not_available You do.
not_available Right now it looks okay.
not_available But we may need to do a C
not_available section.
not_available You mean cut me open? 
not_available Yes.
not_available 32 weeks is early.
not_available You're on steroids to help the baby's lungs.
not_available I don't want an operation.
not_available It may not be a choice.
not_available The baby will die.
not_available Nothing bad will happen to me? 
not_available Now you're all right.
not_available But
not_available Then don't.
not_available Don't cut me open.
not_available Don't do anything.
not_available Hey, it's Dr.
not_available Torquemada.
not_available Who? Nothing.
not_available Did you discharge your screamer yet? 
not_available It was tough.
not_available You couldn't tell from out here.
not_available He took on the hurt and won.
not_available No brain, no pain? Some cultures see pain as a rite of passage.
not_available Somebody call a staff meeting? 
not_available No.
not_available The kid made it up to the O.R.
not_available Benton's working on the leg.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Age 13, the Masai warriors scar themselves with red
not_available hot spears and yank out their bottom teeth, with no Novocain.
not_available Dave, give us a minute? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Carter, hold on.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I think you know.
not_available The guy leaves a millimeter of coffee in the pot.
not_available Abby saw you.
not_available She saw me what? Abby.
not_available I saw you inject the fentanyl.
not_available What? 
not_available In the trauma room, cleaning up.
not_available I was cleaning up.
not_available Chart says you drew up What is this? 
not_available You gave 150 mics to the patient.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Slow down.
not_available This is a mistake.
not_available You stopped after three cc's.
not_available Haleh gave him a bunch of Versed.
not_available And the rest of the fentanyl? 
not_available Must have wasted it down the sink.
not_available Somebody needs to witness you doing that.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available We do that all the time.
not_available We have a protocol for disposal of narcotics.
not_available Fine.
not_available Whatever.
not_available That doesn't mean that I injected it.
not_available Abby, if you thought you saw something why wouldn't you come talk to me? 
not_available It's appropriate to come to us.
not_available Not when she's wrong! Are you still on medication? Why? What? 
not_available For your back.
not_available Why? A little.
not_available Why? What's "a little"? 
not_available That's between me and my doctor.
not_available So you're not overmedicating? You think I'm a drug addict? Do you honestly think I'm a drug addict? That I sneak around, injecting whatever narcotics I find? You guys, you know me.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available So you deny this? 
not_available Yes, I deny it! Abby! I think you're seeing things.
not_available Maybe you're on drugs.
not_available I saw you with a needle once.
not_available If this is a misunderstanding, I apologize.
not_available This is a misunderstanding.
not_available You know why we had to ask you.
not_available Can I go back to work now? Thank you.
not_available And thank you, Abby.
not_available I really appreciate that.
not_available He's lying, Mark.
not_available I know.
not_available We'll call someone you can talk to.
not_available It can be a friend, a roommate
not_available I don't want to talk to anyone.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available To save that baby, we need to operate.
not_available I told you I don't want it.
not_available Give it up for adoption.
not_available No one would know.
not_available I don't want an operation.
not_available So just leave me alone! All of you! 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Leave me alone! But you'll have to keep monitors on.
not_available Why? 
not_available For your own safety.
not_available We need to know if you bleed internally.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? Spin another crit.
not_available Cycle the dynamap every five minutes.
not_available I thought I'd seen everything.
not_available Are you taking her? 
not_available Not if she says no.
not_available The abruption is progressing.
not_available She needs a C
not_available section.
not_available I made the consequences clear.
not_available She doesn't care.
not_available You can't cut a woman open without her consent.
not_available The baby will die.
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available You can watch it happen? 
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available You can operate.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I'm calling another OB.
not_available I am the department head.
not_available We don't force C
not_available sections.
not_available What if she's incompetent? I don't know.
not_available She seemed coherent.
not_available I think the wound was self
not_available inflicted.
not_available You can prove that? She claims she didn't know she was pregnant.
not_available She was lying, not crazy.
not_available What woman carries for 8 months, then won't let us help her baby? Call Psych.
not_available Give it a shot.
not_available Then I can bring her up? 
not_available If they say yes.
not_available Side
not_available biting clamp.
not_available We're lucky to have this extra time.
not_available Kovac didn't know the bullet moved to his heart.
not_available I'd have trouble helping someone who shoots at playgrounds.
not_available BP's down, 80 palp.
not_available Is that you? No.
not_available No active bleeding.
not_available Femoral vessels are clamped.
not_available Recheck the pressure.
not_available Still falling, 70 palp.
not_available What is it? Did the bullet embolize? Fluoroscope on.
not_available It is moving closer to the pulmonary artery.
not_available We have blood dripping! 
not_available Where from? Take the towel off his shoulder.
not_available He's bleeding out! Saline sponge now! We need six more units of packed cells! What are you doing? 
not_available Locating the source.
not_available I opened his heart.
not_available We need to stop the bleeding.
not_available Just wait! 
not_available Clamp the auricle.
not_available I can't! Just for a second.
not_available The other bullet hit the artery.
not_available Clamp the subclavian.
not_available I need to get this bullet out.
not_available I'll do it myself.
not_available Pressure's down to 60.
not_available Give him a saline bolus.
not_available Come on.
not_available Damn it! I can't reach the artery.
not_available Crank the sternum open a little wider.
not_available He's in Vfib! Paddles! Paddles! 
not_available Get your hands out.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Clear! Now! 
not_available Got it.
not_available Go.
not_available I don't know what to tell you.
not_available I can't miss the tournament next week.
not_available You've broken your collarbone.
not_available Aside from hurting yourself, you'd be useless on the field.
not_available Put a cast on it.
not_available We sling it and you rest.
not_available It can't be that bad.
not_available Could you get him a sling? 
not_available We only have smalls.
not_available He's large.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Make that extra
not_available large, mate.
not_available I'll be back to discharge you.
not_available So I talked to Legal.
not_available Did you use his name? 
not_available No.
not_available I spoke in hypotheticals.
not_available Bottom line, we need more evidence.
not_available He can't treat patients, right? 
not_available We have to be careful.
not_available How about a drug test? He's on medication.
not_available He'll test positive.
not_available I'm afraid just asking will push him further away.
not_available What do you wanna do? 
not_available Get him some help.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available He might open up if it's not a threat.
not_available How could we have let this happen? He showed all the signs.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available But it's Carter.
not_available Your mind just doesn't go there.
not_available She's a little calmer.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available He'll talk her into it.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available He has to.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Vinny Rosato.
not_available The boy's father.
not_available Oh, yes, yes.
not_available Hi, Mr.
not_available Rosato.
not_available Your son is in surgery.
not_available How bad is it? He was shot in the leg and the shoulder.
not_available The surgeons will repair those injuries.
not_available A bullet moved to his heart.
not_available He was shot in the heart? No.
not_available The bullet swept through the vein.
not_available But there shouldn't be any tissue damage.
not_available Can they get it out? We should take you upstairs.
not_available You can get updated information.
not_available I'll take you.
not_available Thank you, Cleo.
not_available She's certainly emotionally distraught.
not_available She could be depressed with a personality disorder.
not_available Is she incompetent? 
not_available She's not psychotic.
not_available She understands not having the C
not_available section can endanger her baby.
not_available You mean kill it.
not_available She's willing to risk it.
not_available It's no risk.
not_available She wants it to happen.
not_available She stabbed herself.
not_available You have no evidence.
not_available She's a danger to others.
not_available Who? The baby.
not_available Doesn't count.
not_available It's still her body.
not_available Is the Csection needed for her? 
not_available There has to be a point.
not_available Is it? No.
not_available Without a court order, you can't touch her.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available That baby needs to come out now.
not_available We can try to expedite it.
not_available We know friendly judges.
not_available You have to write up an affidavit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Whatever.
not_available When did you start smoking? That depends.
not_available Does it make me a druggie? Ask the Surgeon General.
not_available I'm worried about you, Carter.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I got angry when I shouldn't have.
not_available Not that I didn't have a right.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You didn't talk to anyone, did you? Any psychiatrists? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? I didn't feel like talking.
not_available I'm gonna be fine.
not_available Or I hope
not_available I will be.
not_available It's been rough.
not_available You can understand.
not_available I got stabbed twice with a butcher knife.
not_available I'm in a lot of pain.
not_available This place isn't exactly the easiest work environment.
not_available Lucy's dead, partly my fault.
not_available I can't sleep.
not_available I had to take more pain medication just to function.
not_available I didn't steal it.
not_available It was prescribed to me.
not_available Did you take the prescribed amount? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available More or less.
not_available I think you need help, Carter.
not_available I understand that you have to make this your business.
not_available But please, please let me deal with it.
not_available When are you off? 
not_available Midnight.
not_available I don't want you to see any patients.
not_available Work on QA chart reviews.
not_available I can see patients
not_available You have to trust me.
not_available Let me figure this out.
not_available We got to write this one up.
not_available That you lifted him up while I was operating? Cranking his chest and suturing too.
not_available I have moves you haven't seen.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Dibs on the bullet.
not_available It's mine.
not_available I was the one that called it.
not_available I fished it out.
not_available But I
not_available Hi, Cleo.
not_available We just made a great save.
not_available I can see that.
not_available We got the bullet out and Peter saved his arm and leg.
not_available His father's waiting to talk to someone.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available I didn't know what to do, so I asked Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I don't know you, but you're a good doctor.
not_available You've been through a lot that I couldn't handle.
not_available But I felt I had to tell them.
not_available You feel better? I have work to do.
not_available Here's your prescription.
not_available Take one every six hours for pain.
not_available You're gonna want to ice it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tanner? Mr.

not_available He didn't sign? 
not_available They got there at 6:30.
not_available He had left.
not_available The clerk is tracking him down.
not_available Can't we try another judge? 
not_available They're working on that.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available You can't do anything until we get it.
not_available I've waited too long.
not_available Promise me you won't do anything.
not_available No.
not_available I'm going to change her mind.
not_available We need to do this tonight.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available He's so unpredictable.
not_available I thought he was bipolar.
not_available No way.
not_available He as much as admitted it to me.
not_available He's using.
not_available I don't know how long, but the behavior's there.
not_available But is this the right way? He might feel ganged up on.
not_available It's either this or we go to some committee.
not_available I'd rather approach him as a small group so he can clear it up.
not_available And what about Romano? 
not_available No.
not_available We don't want him in.
not_available He can be stubborn.
not_available He might walk out.
not_available We'll be prepared.
not_available We'll be compassionate, but clear.
not_available He has two options.
not_available That's it.
not_available Are you with us, Peter? Kerry? You needed me? 
not_available Yeah, Don.
not_available What's the big emergency? 
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Fetal heart rate down to 60.
not_available Get a baby warmer.
not_available We don't have time to argue.
not_available This baby needs to come out.
not_available I want another doctor.
not_available You'll hemorrhage to death.
not_available You're trying to scare me.
not_available You should be scared.
not_available If not the baby, think of yourself.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available You would've helped.
not_available Heart rate's down to 50.
not_available You're having a boy.
not_available I can tell from the ultrasound.
not_available You want to kill your son? Leave me alone.
not_available I want another doctor! Down to 40.
not_available That's it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Draw up the ketamine.
not_available You can't.
not_available I'll take full responsibility! What are you doing? 
not_available Don't.
not_available I don't want the baby! C
not_available section tray.
not_available I don't want the baby! 
not_available Heart rate's down to 20.
not_available Please, help me!

not_available I won't.
not_available Then get out of the way! 
not_available You'll lose your license.
not_available 10blade! 
not_available Lost the heart rate.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available You can't.
not_available Is it over? Carter, got a minute? No.
not_available I'm done.
not_available If I can't see patients, I'll go home.
not_available Not yet.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Is this my suspension? 
not_available Not here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, God! Give me a break.
not_available Carter, just listen.
not_available I'm on painkillers for my back.
not_available But I'm functioning.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? You would be wise to be quiet and listen.
not_available My van is parked outside.
not_available We have a ticket to Atlanta.
not_available There is a drug rehab The drug rehab center there treats doctors with addiction.
not_available I'm on prescribed painkillers.
not_available That doesn't make me an addict.
not_available I'm not finished.
not_available It's apparent to us that you have a drug problem.
not_available We can't allow you to continue working here or anywhere else as a physician.
not_available So you have two choices.
not_available Get in the van, go to the airport, check yourself in.
not_available And when you come back, we'll support you in any way we can.
not_available Or I'm fired? Yeah.
not_available Everyone in this room cares about you.
not_available No one is judging you.
not_available You are.
not_available You've already judged me.
not_available You have no idea what I've been through.
not_available But I've showed up.
not_available I haven't made excuses or complained.
not_available That's not the point
not_available It is! Can anybody tell me that I have endangered patients? Can anybody here say that my performance has changed? That I'm a liability? You put a patient into anaphylactic shock by giving her Bactrim when she said she was allergic to it.
not_available You left a wire in someone's chest.
not_available Is this about mistakes? We all make mistakes.
not_available I saved you today.
not_available John, you've demonstrated compulsive drug
not_available seeking behavior.
not_available Tell me when.
not_available Mainlining fentanyl.
not_available I didn't do that.
not_available Call me a liar, fine.
not_available I didn't do that.
not_available Show us your wrists.
not_available What? Show us your wrists! Are we looking for track marks? Yeah.
not_available Well, there.
not_available See? You want me to roll up my sleeves? 
not_available Take off your watch.
not_available You know You know what? Forget it.
not_available Forget it.
not_available This is your only chance.
not_available I quit.
not_available Well Is that it? No.
not_available What are you doing? I don't need this.
not_available I've never needed this.
not_available I wanted to be a doctor, wanted to help people.
not_available I don't need their job.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available I'm not doing it.
not_available They are.
not_available Carter, wait! 
not_available No.
not_available You want to piss it away? All you've worked for? You're handing out the ultimatums! Get in that van! 
not_available Like hell I am.
not_available You won't do this! You believe I'm a junkie? You ambush me.
not_available You're out of control! Get into that van.
not_available No.
not_available Get in the van.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available Where does it end? It's fentanyl, then you're dead.
not_available Or like your cousin some babbling gork in a nursing home.
not_available You want to fight, that's cool, but get in the van.
not_available It's all right, man.
not_available It's all right, Carter.
not_available Good job.
not_available That's good.
not_available He's crowning.
not_available Almost there.
not_available One more push.
not_available Ready? And push.
not_available Push.
not_available The head is out.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can stop now.
not_available Clamp.
not_available And cut.
not_available Does she want to see him? 
not_available Would you like to see him? No.
not_available You want me to pronounce him? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Time of death, 19:47.
not_available Is he on the plane? 
not_available Peter hasn't called.
not_available Wonder what he said? 
not_available I just hope Carter goes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nice to see the ER brain trust diligently works after hours.
not_available Hello, Robert.
not_available ICU's a zoo.
not_available It's nice here.
not_available Same old stuff.
not_available Fun never stops.
not_available Walt, the intussusception upstairs.
not_available What about him? Tried to reduce with an enema.
not_available Big mess.
not_available We must go in.
not_available Now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not as sexy as a bullet out of the heart, but it's a life
not_available saving procedure.
not_available I'll be right up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good night, all.
not_available I guess I lost my ride.
not_available That's right.
not_available I'll take the El.

not_available I'll try not to wake you.
not_available Good night.
