not_available Mark.
not_available What? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You did good mom.
not_available I pressured Mr.

not_available Lizzie, you never fail to impress me.

not_available Hello Hi, Mom.

not_available Get an EKG.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rollins, where does it hurt? What? Let go of my hand.
not_available Never mind, Kit.
not_available Unless you have a problem
not_available I do.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm bored.
not_available Well, at least you're still alive.
not_available Oh, you mean unlike that poor woman they say I raped and murdered? 
not_available We both know the truth.
not_available I'm innocent until proven guilty.
not_available And the DA can't prove jack.
not_available Thanks to you.
not_available If I could do things again, believe me, I would.

not_available Get the vitals.
not_available BP's 95/60.
not_available Heart rate's 110.
not_available BP's stable, not hypotensive.
not_available Treat with lidocaine? 
not_available Right.
not_available She's in Vtach! The paddles! 
not_available No! Check the vitals again.
not_available BP's 95/60.
not_available Heart rate's 160.
not_available Lucy? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available With normal mentation, lidocaine is still your first treatment.
not_available It's not a good idea to shock an awake patient.
not_available Back to normal signs.
not_available You feeling better? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wasn't planning on this.
not_available We'll maybe get you home in time to open presents.
not_available Lucy? Lily, draw the labs.
not_available Chuny, order an echo.
not_available Call me back with the results.
not_available You do not know enough to make those promises.
not_available Her meds were off.
not_available She'll be lucky if she makes it through the night.
not_available I didn't realize.
not_available You've accumulated a lot of knowledge.
not_available Apply it.
not_available Go back, get a thorough history.
not_available Find out what you can do for her.
not_available Hey, what's wrong? Nothing.
not_available Thanks for covering transplant.
not_available Sure.
not_available It means I can spend Christmas with Reece.
not_available At least some will be enjoying it.
not_available What about you? Mark's in San Diego helping his father move.
not_available But with Romano gone, it seems like a holiday, doesn't it? You're right.
not_available It does.
not_available Detective Cruson's on the phone.
not_available I've got a consult.
not_available Call me with that appy.
not_available Hello, this is Corday.

not_available I discharged the otitis.
not_available One down, 30 to go.

not_available I need a break.
not_available We all do, Amira
not_available It's Ramadan, I gotta pray.
not_available Okay.

not_available Cardiomyopathy diagnosed three years ago after the flu on her 21st birthday.
not_available Some present.
not_available There's an LV ejection fraction of 10 percent.
not_available Doesn't that meet the criteria to upgrade her for transplant? I'll call UNOS and tell them to move her to level one.
not_available They're ready for you in the O.R.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Go over everything with her.
not_available See if Cardiology has a bed.
not_available Level one? That means I'm a shoo
not_available in, right? There's no guarantee for availability.
not_available A girl can dream.
not_available You know, I almost went to med school.
not_available What changed your mind? 
not_available Hospitals smell.
not_available I hear you.
not_available I opted for a master's in fine arts instead.
not_available I'm supposed to graduate in June.
not_available Really? Me too.
not_available I'm gonna die, aren't I? If you don't get a new heart yeah.
not_available We went over to Marty's for some eggnog.
not_available Hasn't anyone ever warned you about raw egg? 
not_available At least we got to our deliveries.
not_available Charity? No.
not_available Just a bunch of Wall Street sharks.
not_available We take gifts to shelters to keep us human.
not_available We could use a Mrs.

not_available I could use a hot bath.

not_available Claus? Hold it, Carter.
not_available Compazine rectal suppositories for all the Santas.
not_available And rehydrate.
not_available Bah humbug.

not_available Chad? Chad, wha
not_available ? Chad.
not_available Get off of me! 
not_available Chad, it's Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available What happened? He took a header down the stairs.
not_available Watch his neck! Watch his neck.
not_available His foot got caught.
not_available Did he lose consciousness? Maybe.
not_available He's pretty messed up.
not_available On what? On what? 
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Wait! 
not_available Hang in there, dude.
not_available No, Tony! Chad, do you have any neck pain? Does your neck hurt?

not_available You'll be okay.
not_available Ouch! 
not_available That's a delicate injury, indeed.
not_available We were in line to see Santa, and Tommy had to go.
not_available I always tell him to look down before you zip up.
not_available I wanna see Santa! We're gonna have to cut it off.
not_available What?! I meant the zipper.
not_available I'll get the tray.
not_available I wanna go back to the mall! Tommy, I have to clean the area.
not_available This may sting a little.
not_available Hold onto him.
not_available Tight.
not_available Pickup and Metz.
not_available Go away! 
not_available I can't watch.
not_available Okay, Tommy.
not_available This is gonna pinch.
not_available Ouch! All done.

not_available Okay, Tommy, it's all over.
not_available So brave.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available I'm doing an appy.
not_available I've been doing research on Valerie Page's condition.
not_available Watch the sterile field.
not_available I found articles on a Left Ventricular Assist Device.
not_available What about it? A device could keep the blood pumping until a transplant.
not_available Not an option.
not_available Why not? No device.
not_available County isn't using that yet.
not_available A clinical trial starts as of January.
not_available Her heart won't hold out that long.
not_available We transfer her to Rush.
not_available The program's running.
not_available Try and arrange it.
not_available Let me know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available Taking me on a trip? 
not_available You could say that.
not_available Why's he here? 
not_available You'll be transferred to jail.
not_available This is a joke, right? You getting back at me? They found evidence linking you to another murder.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Look, stop! Put him in restraints! Bitch! You cannot do this to me! Oh, yes, I can! Screw you! Ow! 
not_available Okay, spare me the theatrics.
not_available Oh, my leg.
not_available My leg, it's cramped.
not_available And I'm the queen of England.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Damn it, it hurts! Dr.
not_available Corday, wait.
not_available His right leg is dusky.
not_available It's like somebody's jabbing me with needles.
not_available How long have you had this? 
not_available Just started.
not_available Can't feel a pedal pulse.
not_available No popliteal pulse either.
not_available Want an angiogram? 
not_available I suppose so.
not_available Would you hurry up? It's killing me.
not_available Shut up! Excuse me.
not_available Fill out a form, take a seat.
not_available I work here.
not_available It's about time you brought those bundles of joy for a visit.
not_available Hi, Haleh.
not_available It's Auntie Haleh.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I'm not visiting.
not_available Look at them.
not_available They're adorable.
not_available Look, you're almost back to your
not_available Hold it, guys.
not_available Kate's not feeling well.
not_available Is there an Attending free? Let's find out.
not_available We'll take good care of her.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm not worried.
not_available But she may not make it through the night.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Rush turned you down? They can't take her until tomorrow.
not_available No cardiac beds.
not_available Christmas.
not_available Bummer.
not_available Is it possible to get surgical equipment transferred? 
not_available We do it between ERs.
not_available What do you do? Get a transfer form and a doctor's signature.
not_available The mall's closed now.
not_available It's not fair! One more pin should do it.
not_available Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! 
not_available Santa! Oh! Careful down there, little Tommy.
not_available Santa's so sorry that he missed you at the mall.
not_available He hears that you've been a good boy.
not_available You're not Santa.
not_available Sure he is, sweetheart.
not_available The Santa at the mall was fat with glasses.
not_available This is Santa's brother.
not_available Go away! Tommy, stop it! 
not_available Santa's got a toy for you, Tommy.
not_available I want the real Santa! The one at the mall! Okay, Tommy.
not_available Santa's gotta go now.
not_available But he wants to wish you a very merry Christmas! What do we got? 
not_available Yo, Santa.
not_available Taylor Sparks, 15.

not_available Trauma panel.
not_available Chest and left shoulder.
not_available Back looks clear.
not_available Whoa! Ho, ho, ho.
not_available Malik? 
not_available Not the present I had in mind.
not_available That's mine.
not_available If the vessels are intact, we'll leave the bullet in.
not_available Give me my piece! Whatever happened to "peace on earth"? You tell us, Santa.
not_available Hey, you're being a very good girl.
not_available Temperature's 100.
not_available 1.
not_available It was 99.8 earlier.
not_available When was that? Two hours ago.
not_available It takes that long to get us out of the house.
not_available She'd be warm from being bundled up.
not_available Am I being crazy? No, it's good you brought her in.
not_available A fever in a fourweek
not_available old can be cause for concern.
not_available I know all the things that can go wrong.
not_available If you'd like, we can do a septic work
not_available up.
not_available Is that necessary? 
not_available Probably not.
not_available But you need to make that decision.
not_available As a nurse I would say no.
not_available And as a mother? I wanna make sure everything's okay.
not_available How about we get a urine and CBC but hold off on an LP till we get the labs? I want you to draw her blood.
not_available You're the best in the ER.
not_available I'll be nice and gentle.
not_available Okay.
not_available How're you feeling? My mom here? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Chad, is your father around? Sure, saw him yesterday.
not_available Christmas photo of him and his new family vacationing.
not_available I'd like to call him.
not_available He doesn't care.
not_available Me and Mom are better off without him.
not_available When can I go home? We're waiting on test results.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's Christmas.
not_available Cleo? Oh, Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available How is he? Chad has a dislocated right ankle.
not_available We're waiting to rule out head trauma.
not_available Oh, my God! I don't know how this happened.
not_available I thought he was upstairs.
not_available You were home? I had people over.
not_available Holiday party.
not_available Did you hear Chad fall? There was music playing.
not_available People talking.
not_available Your son has a blood alcohol level of 0.26.
not_available Were you aware he was drinking? 
not_available No.
not_available All right, I let him have one beer.
not_available It's Christmas Eve.
not_available He's had more than one.
not_available Maybe he took some from the bar.
not_available You think this is my fault.
not_available No, I'm not blaming
not_available I should've known.
not_available What kind of a mother am I? Why don't you go in to see him? "PEDIATRICS" "E.R." What have we got? 
not_available 71, MVA, on his way to mass.
not_available I hit Mary.
not_available Mary? As in Virgin Mother.
not_available He drove into a nativity.
not_available I passed out.
not_available Complaining of abdominal pain.
not_available BP is 100/60, pulse 90.
not_available Alert at the scene.
not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available Nice and easy, on my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Trauma panel, C
not_available spine, chest films, spin a crit.
not_available Can you tell me where the pain is? Around my belt.
not_available I only wear this suit once a year.
not_available It doesn't fit.
not_available Pulse ox is 95.
not_available Ultrasound.
not_available Find something? Yeah, pulsatile mass on the left side below the ribs.
not_available Could be an aneurysm.
not_available There's a good chance you'll need surgery to repair your aorta.
not_available Anyone we should contact? 
not_available There's no one.
not_available Call the O.R.
not_available Tell them to prep a room.
not_available There's a blockage in your artery.
not_available A clot is preventing blood flow.
not_available This is potentially life
not_available threatening and needs surgery.
not_available I'm not letting you fix me up so they can put me on trial for bogus charges.
not_available Then you'll be set free.
not_available Without surgery, you'll die.
not_available Yeah? Well, I'll take my chances.
not_available Besides, you know, I like it here.
not_available Good drugs, food's not half bad.
not_available I get off just looking at you.
not_available You know, every night after the lights go out I lie back and think about you.
not_available Your answer's no to surgery? 
not_available That's right.
not_available You'll need to sign a refusal paper.
not_available Bring it on.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available What's that? I had an L
not_available VAD transferred here for Valerie Page.
not_available That's a $50,000 device.
not_available I signed your name as the physician.
not_available What? 
not_available You were in surgery.
not_available You should've interrupted me.
not_available No time.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available What do you mean? I mean I'm not qualified to do it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano is the only one.
not_available This could save her.
not_available I'm not qualified.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available He's in V
not_available tach! Grab the paddles! Charge to 100.
not_available And clear! Two hundred! Come on! Come on! Not charged yet.
not_available And clear! Crank it to 360! And clear! 
not_available He's back.
not_available He's back.
not_available I saw her.
not_available What? 
not_available Edith, my wife.
not_available I saw her.
not_available She's not here.
not_available I know.
not_available She's dead.
not_available But I saw her.
not_available I saw her.
not_available Heard about your Santa performance.
not_available My last.
not_available Malik's Gameboy.
not_available Didn't wanna hear his griping.
not_available You're a good woman.
not_available Mom, no need to ruin your Christmas too.
not_available I gotta go, okay? Bye.
not_available Any word on Kate's labs? Her urine is negative and white count is basically normal.
not_available "Basically"? The differential shows five bands.
not_available But that's still normal.
not_available Can't the lab repeat them? 
not_available That means sticking Kate again.
not_available Can we do a manual diff? I'll call the lab supervisor to squeeze one in.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available In all honesty, I'm exhausted.
not_available I'm not surprised.
not_available I can handle 40 patients, but not two infants.
not_available That's parenthood.
not_available Maybe he's out of town.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, this is Lucy Knight.
not_available Fourth
not_available year medical student.
not_available Yes, I realize that it's almost midnight, but
not_available It's about a patient.
not_available It's Christmas! Yes, sir.
not_available I understand that.
not_available Butchief of staff at home! If I could
not_available Hello? I want my piece back.
not_available Your gun is now police property.
not_available It was a present for my little bro.
not_available You were gonna give him a gun? 
not_available Cost me serious dollars.
not_available How much? 
not_available Forty.
not_available Now give it back.
not_available I gave it to the police.
not_available What am I supposed to give him? Here.
not_available It's a Gameboy.
not_available Worth at least twice that much.
not_available Your brother'll love it.
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available Merry Christmas! I'm caught between a rock and a hard place on this.
not_available How so? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Kottmeier cares about her son.
not_available But he needs more.
not_available She's an alcoholic herself
not_available That only factors in if it interferes with her ability to care for Chad.
not_available What if she buys his alcohol? Did he say that to you? 
not_available No, she did, in so many words.
not_available Peter, did you consent Mr.
not_available Waller? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? Better get in here.
not_available Please, no surgery.
not_available You have a life
not_available threatening condition.
not_available I'm not afraid to die.
not_available I saw Edith.
not_available His dead wife.
not_available She waits for me.
not_available I saw her at the end of a tunnel.
not_available And there was this white light? 
not_available Yeah, it was so peaceful.
not_available You experienced an hallucination due to an endorphin release.
not_available No, it was real.
not_available If this isn't happening, I have a pain consult.
not_available If you don't have surgery, you probably won't live through the night.
not_available That means we can spend Christmas together.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I really tried.
not_available I know.
not_available If there was anything I could do, I would.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I plan on beating this thing with or without some stupid device.
not_available Okay.
not_available Get some rest.
not_available Keep your strength up.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Merry Christmas, Valerie.
not_available Breast
not_available feeding was so hard at first.
not_available I felt like a cow with huge udders.
not_available You look like a natural.
not_available Being that I do it every three hours.
not_available When do you sleep, girl? 
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available That's okay.
not_available The kitchen's closed.
not_available Auntie Haleh should get back to work.
not_available May I? 
not_available Thanks for the chair.
not_available OB won't miss it.
not_available The manual diff came back.
not_available Kate's white count is normal.
not_available That's great.
not_available You hear that, sweetie? You'll be okay.
not_available Probably just a virus.
not_available Not too surprising, this time of year.
not_available I'm sorry I've beenA good parent? 
not_available No.
not_available I was gonna say difficult.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Same thing.
not_available I can't believe it's 2:00 a.
not_available m.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's Christmas.
not_available That's right.
not_available It's Christmas.
not_available I admitted him to ICU.
not_available Donald, what are you doing here this late? I had a gastroenteritis turn into an ischemic bowel on me.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available So shall we include Elizabeth in on your dilemma? A patient's refusing surgery because he thinks he saw his dead wife waiting for him.
not_available My patient's refusing surgery too.
not_available But mine's the devil incarnate.
not_available Dean Rollins? 
not_available Good riddance.
not_available Who made you judge and jury? 
not_available You don't know how despicable he is.
not_available I'm sure I don't.
not_available But being a doctor isn't about your personal feelings.
not_available Let's get back to your patient.
not_available He won't listen.
not_available But did you listen? He's probably frightened.
not_available Seeing his dead wife makes him feel less so.
not_available If he thought you understood that, he'd be more receptive to you.
not_available It's the patient's choice.
not_available Of course.
not_available But we must offer to do all we can to keep them alive.
not_available Okay, Gretel! Okay, you can stop now! You've got my attention! Before you speak, I have a dozen reasons why I shouldn't be doing this.
not_available For one, I don't wanna ruin my career.
not_available The police are coming
not_available I have a patient, Valerie Page, She's on UNOS.
not_available An L
not_available VAD could buy her time.
not_available And you think I give a rat's ass? I'm sorry.
not_available What was I thinking, coming to you a seasoned doctor who supposedly has dedicated his entire life to helping people? I'm just a puny student who stupidly thought she could
not_available Miss Knight.
not_available What do you want? I want you to help my patient.
not_available I want you to help me.
not_available Where's the fat dude in the red suit? 
not_available There are many here.
not_available The one giving out the Gameboys.
not_available Chuny, I got this.
not_available Hi.
not_available We heard you give Gameboys for gats.
not_available Well, that's not exactly true.
not_available It happened once, but that was sort of a unique situation.
not_available We out of here.
not_available Well, wait.
not_available Does it have to be Gameboys? Hey, Vivian.
not_available I'm looking for my triple
not_available A.
not_available The guy who saw his dead wife.
not_available Howard Waller? Over there.
not_available He died? 
not_available He coded less than an hour ago.
not_available You miss me? 
not_available I'm curious about something.
not_available Me too.
not_available Are you a natural redhead? I'd like to see for myself.
not_available You're willing to be a vegetable for the rest of your sad life for a pissing contest.
not_available Well, that's one contest with you I'm sure I can win.
not_available Without surgery, the flesh on your leg will rot.
not_available Become infected, probably gangrenous.
not_available You're scaring me, doc.
not_available Next comes septic shock.
not_available Your BP will be so low you will have a massive stroke.
not_available You'll wind up drooling in your food, wearing diapers.
not_available Rather like that pathetic man.
not_available Except you'll only have one leg because they'll have to amputate.
not_available But you'll have won, Dean Rollins.
not_available Now, is that really the best you can do? It's the truth.
not_available If you don't believe me, you'll only have yourself to blame.
not_available You do care about me.
not_available Don't you? 
not_available As your doctor, I do.
not_available No, not as a doctor.
not_available As a woman.
not_available Say it.
not_available Say it.
not_available I care.
not_available Then let's do it.
