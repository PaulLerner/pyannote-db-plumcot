not_available How should I handle it if he's positive? You won't have to.
not_available I will.
not_available Her heart's still beating.

not_available I can't just leave her here to die alone.
not_available Okay, I got a vascular surgeon, an anesthesiologist and three surgical residents in an O.R.
not_available suite that rents $5000 an hour.
not_available He wants to be with his wife.
not_available That's touching.
not_available She's dying.

not_available I explained all that.
not_available I'm going upstairs.

not_available Looks like you have blood in the joint.
not_available Is that serious?

not_available That sounds unpleasant.
not_available It sounds worse than it is.
not_available Could you give us a minute? 
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Espresso's calling.
not_available Girl lives on caffeine and chocolate.
not_available Alderman when Dr.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Is it what I think it is? 
not_available We' re still waiting for the lab results.
not_available But you have some idea.
not_available It's probably syphilis.
not_available That wasn't the diagnosis I was hoping for.
not_available How many partners this year? 
not_available Only one.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll give you a shot of antibiotics and you'll be fine.
not_available Good.
not_available But we'll need to report it to the Health Department.
not_available Any way we can keep it out of my medical record? It's automatic once the labs are done.
not_available But there's no need to worry, your records are confidential.
not_available No, your health records are confidential.
not_available Every time there's an election, I have to release mine.
not_available And syphilis is not a word the voters love to hear.

not_available She can't take care of those kids.
not_available Well, you think stoner boy's gonna do any better? Doug? Okay, guys.
not_available I gotta talk to the doctors, all right? You okay? Yeah, I smoked a little this afternoon, you know, but I'm fine now, so Hey, did I kill her? 
not_available No.
not_available We had to put a tube in her throat to help her breathe.
not_available Why did she cough up all that blood? 
not_available She has an infection in her lungs.
not_available Hey, look, I'm sorry I said all that stuff.
not_available It's just
