
not_available 
Previously on ER Give him back to me! Give him to me! Group therapy in your first week? All I did was observe.
not_available I'm going to have a baby.
not_available I heard there might be a surgical trauma fellowship run out of the ER.
not_available It was my idea.
not_available I brought it to Greene and Weaver.
not_available I need time for Reece.
not_available Don't make him an excuse to screw me! 
not_available I'll find something else! I don't want you to forfeit it to me.
not_available If you want it, go for it! I'll still get it! 
not_available Morning, Carol.
not_available Morning.
not_available Did you see that beautiful blue sky? I came in when it was still dark.
not_available Cracker? No, thanks.
not_available What are you doing? I woke up with a sudden urge to clean.
not_available Do you realize this peritoneal lavage kit expired in 1996? If your symptoms persist, maybe you could work your magic on Admit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think I've been cured, thanks.
not_available Well, it was worth a shot.
not_available Good morning, Ron.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I wasn't looking.
not_available You're looking bright.
not_available I'm presenting on a panel at the Chicago Society of Trauma Physicians.
not_available I'll stop griping about attending.
not_available What's your topic? Ultrasound versus CT in blunt abdominal trauma.
not_available I've had good findings.
not_available I'll look forward to it.
not_available Hey, man! You want to try giving it to me next time? The proper way to throw a Frisbee is off the middle finger, sidearm.
not_available For me, it's the flick of the wrist that gives it that rotation.
not_available Great catch.
not_available For me, the key to Frisbee is a light touch.
not_available So you're on your way to work.
not_available My shift begins in 15 minutes, and today's my last day.
not_available I thought things were going well with the INS.
not_available Oh, it is.
not_available I got amnesty.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm going to school to get my civil engineering license.
not_available You and IKubby gonna stay here in Chicago? 
not_available Great.
not_available Carol? Do you know anything about this woman, Coco Robbins? Her and her baby are coming into the clinic.
not_available She's schizophrenic and Social Services is having us monitor her baby care? To make sure she's taking her meds.
not_available That's a pretty risky proposition.
not_available She deserves a chance.
not_available So this was your idea? I'm in touch with the halfway house where they are living.
not_available I'll volunteer for her appointments.
not_available You asked me to be responsible for the clinic.
not_available I didn't know anything about this.
not_available You're right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I should've told you about it.
not_available No, Carol.
not_available You should've asked.
not_available She's due in a few minutes.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Drafting teams for baseball.
not_available Want in? Can I draft IKen Griffey? 
not_available He's mine.
not_available I've got Sammy Sosa.
not_available Because he's got the "cutest buns in baseball." How would you like to perform a righteous act and make me a happy man? Dean signed us for a mentoring project at the Math/Science Magnet School.
not_available They put some of their top students into area hospitals like an independent study program.
not_available I need you to hold his hand and give him a few errands to run.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available It is a public school, but I'm assured he's not a convicted felon.
not_available When is this happening? Anytime now.
not_available The kid's name is Antoine.
not_available Oh, today? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't leave him unattended around the drug lockup.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available Are you back with us? No, I'm still in Psych.
not_available You'll be back soon.
not_available Don't get used to the cushy life.
not_available Yeah, I won't.
not_available Sally MclKenna? Did they get the glass out? The doctor is still with your husband.
not_available I'm a student doctor in Psychiatry.
not_available Can I ask a few questions? Michael's been very stressed out.
not_available He's in law school.
not_available He's never done anything like this.
not_available The doctor said he attacked a car? He was working on a paper for the last few days, so I left him alone.
not_available And today I woke up and he was in the street smashing our car with a bat.
not_available Does Michael have any history of psychiatric problems? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available Michael ever use any drugs? No! Never.
not_available I mean, well He'll drink a few beers.
not_available A few beers doesn't make a person freak out like that.
not_available I think it's just a buildup of stress.
not_available I will talk to your husband as soon as the ER docs are done.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Still doing triage? So how are you feeling? 
not_available Not bad.
not_available Any side effects from the ribavirin? Nausea, fatigue 
not_available Peter, please.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You look a little tired.
not_available Why don't I check your LFTs? If the meds don't work, we need to know.
not_available I've got a lab appointment today.
not_available Listen, if you need me Thanks.
not_available Excuse me, I've got patients I need to triage.
not_available Carol, your appointment hasn't shown up.
not_available What? 
not_available Coco Robbins and her baby are late.
not_available Did she call? 
not_available I tried calling her.
not_available No one has seen her.
not_available Maybe I should go over there.
not_available Maybe you should call Children and Family Services or the police.
not_available I didn't think she'd do this.
not_available If she doesn't stay on her meds, there's nothing we can do.
not_available There's someone here to see you, a Coco Robbins.
not_available Coco, are you all right? Where have you been? On my way.
not_available I know I'm early.
not_available I wasn't sure I should bother you.
not_available Early? 
not_available Twelve noon.
not_available Yeah, they wrote it down for me.
not_available They must have written it down wrong in the book.
not_available Is it still okay? 
not_available Yes, she'll take you into the clinic.
not_available How's he doing? Good.
not_available He's so beautiful, isn't he? He is beautiful.
not_available Morning, Peter.
not_available Hey.
not_available I understand the trauma fellowship's going to happen.
not_available Look, I'm sorry I came down so hard on you about your interest.
not_available It was really silly of me to be so proprietary about it.
not_available Apparently, they're expecting at least 15 applicants.
not_available Really? Have you given up the cardiothoracic? I haven't made up my mind.
not_available Well, feel free to apply for the trauma fellowship.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available If you do, we have the inside track.
not_available You know, home
not_available team advantage.
not_available Are you planning to go to the Trauma Conference this afternoon? I couldn't get away.
not_available Romano has me doing a keyhole cardiac bypass.
not_available Very fancy.
not_available I don't think you'll be missing much.
not_available I understand it's a dull affair.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, probably.
not_available Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a partial gastrectomy to get to.
not_available Tell me about the patient who smashed his car.
not_available I was just going in.
not_available You haven't worked him up? The ER just got done with him.
not_available I need you to pull the information together and present the patient so I can decide to admit or medicate.
not_available How long will it take? 
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available I'll see you in 10.
not_available Enjoying your Psych rotation? 
not_available You heard.
not_available As a med student, your job is to get to know patients not work up all your Resident's patients for him.
not_available Students who help their Residents get better grades.
not_available Now's the time to learn about talking and listening to patients.
not_available Don't let that get lost in the shuffle.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available She'll need to stay for an albuterol treatment.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available Nita, it's Reverend Lynn.
not_available Would you cancel my morning appointments? Yep.
not_available I'll give you a call.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Sorry this is taking so long.
not_available You're obviously busy.
not_available I can wait.
not_available How'd you do that to your thumb? Hammering the gutter on my church.
not_available Hurts like hell.
not_available I'm Matthew Lynn.
not_available Hi.
not_available Jeanie Boulet.
not_available You're a minister? South Street AME.
not_available You know it? I'm not a churchgoer.
not_available I had my fill of being told what I couldn't do.
not_available I hear you.
not_available You have a subungual hematoma, a collection of blood under your nail.
not_available We'll drain it.
not_available I'll call a doctor and give you something for the pain.
not_available It looks like you also have swollen joints.
not_available Rheumatoid arthritis.
not_available I've had it for years.
not_available I take pills for inflammation, then more so the first don't cause an ulcer.
not_available That's not much fun.
not_available Oh, I'm pretty lucky.
not_available I've seen worse.
not_available I'd lay off the hammering.
not_available Don't want you having anther accident.
not_available I don't believe in accidents.
not_available If I hadn't hit my thumb, we would never have met.
not_available This is a divine intervention.
not_available Something like that.
not_available You Antoine Bell? I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available How are you doing? You'll be spending some time with us.
not_available Let me show you around.
not_available It's a little slow now, but that can change.
not_available Sorry I can't make the conference.
not_available I have a conflict with the committee.
not_available I'll cauterize that bleeder in the abdominal wall.
not_available If you like, I can leave a copy of my talk in your office.
not_available I found the positive predictive value of ultrasounds higher than reported.
not_available Excellent.
not_available By the way, what did you think of Peter's study? He told me he wasn't presenting.
not_available I'm talking about the sternal saw paper he and IKerry got accepted by the Annals of Emergency Medicine.
not_available Quite provocative.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It could attract the grant money we'll need for the trauma fellowship.
not_available I look forward to reading it.
not_available Michael? Hi.
not_available I'm Lucy IKnight.
not_available How are you feeling? Pretty embarrassed.
not_available I'm from Psychiatry, and I want to talk to you briefly.
not_available Law school's been pretty rough going, your wife said.
not_available Yes, but I got out of my system what I needed to get out.
not_available I'm fine now.
not_available I've felt like smashing things before.
not_available What got you to the point where you actually did it? You know, pressure, things.
not_available How have the last few days been? Just formulating my thoughts.
not_available And how do you cope with your stress usually? Not much can be done.
not_available Do you ever have a drink? Maybe a few beers? I do.
not_available And have you been drinking more recently to cope with the stress? How much in the last few days? Drinking helps.
not_available Oh, God! It helps you relax? It helps them be more quiet.
not_available Who does it make more quiet? The demons.
not_available You don't believe me.
not_available But I hear them.
not_available Are you hearing them now? Michael, I'll call Dr.
not_available Myers.
not_available I would never hurt my wife.
not_available I'm stronger than they are.
not_available I wouldn't do what they said.
not_available I hit the car instead.
not_available They wanted me to do it to her but I hit the car.
not_available He took three ounces of Enfamil 20 with iron at 4:25 this morning.
not_available He burped at 4:47.
not_available He peed at 5:05.
not_available You're writing this all down? Is that okay? 
not_available Of course.
not_available I just want to make sure people see that I'm getting it all right.
not_available Could you listen to his heart? It beats so fast.
not_available Babies' hearts beat faster than adults'.
not_available It's perfectly normal.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available I thought maybe something was wrong which is why I came early.
not_available No, he's fine.
not_available Aren't you? Sometimes he spits up a little after he eats.
not_available Which is perfectly normal for a happy, healthy baby.
not_available You can relax.
not_available He's doing great.
not_available And you're doing great.
not_available I think he's a very lucky little boy.
not_available I have to do right with this.
not_available Better than right.
not_available I know.
not_available And you are.
not_available If something goes wrong, I know I'll lose him.
not_available Are you taking your meds? Yeah, it's here.
not_available Look at my journal.
not_available Here.
not_available Everything's good at the halfway house? Great.
not_available There's another woman there with a 2month
not_available old girl.
not_available Everyone's so nice.
not_available They love having these little babies around.
not_available What's not to love? Any questions? You'll be back in two days? 
not_available Two days, 10 a.m.
not_available I'll be here.
not_available You'll have to control your temper.
not_available No more feet through picture frames.
not_available My passion got the better of me.
not_available What can I tell you? She's lucky that's all I put my foot through.
not_available You married? 
not_available Divorced.
not_available Dating anybody steady? Not right now.
not_available There you go.
not_available Fast and loose.
not_available Don't let them get their hooks in you.
not_available From the age they grow boobs till they die they can make you crazy.
not_available Do I tell the truth? All right.
not_available Stay off this foot for a couple weeks.
not_available No, doc, I can't do that.
not_available I gotta get back out on the dance floor.
not_available I go ballroom dancing a couple, three times a week.
not_available Really? 
not_available You dance? Dancing will turn you into a chick magnet.
not_available I'd like to dance.
not_available I just never learned how.
not_available Except for my wedding.
not_available I learned to tango.
not_available Oh, the tango.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available All right, Mr.
not_available Pipitone.
not_available I'll check in with you later.
not_available Two weeks? With the foot? 
not_available Two weeks.
not_available Where's your "Scared Straight" kid? I want to show him the morgue.
not_available He's from the Math/Science Magnet School.
not_available Really? 
not_available Who said he was? No one.
not_available My mistake.
not_available Tell him I'm looking for him.
not_available We got a trauma coming in.
not_available Paramedics are bringing in a stabbing victim.
not_available We'll take him there.
not_available I want you to follow along.
not_available Hang back.
not_available Seth Willows? 
not_available Here we are.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Willows? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm Leila Morgan.
not_available This is my foster son, Seth.
not_available Hi, Seth.
not_available I'm Nurse Hathaway.
not_available What happened here? He put his hand through a window.
not_available Can I take a look? It's not gonna hurt.
not_available Seth, stop! Now, stop this! Carol, you okay? Why don't you take a seat? 
not_available Sit down right there, now, please.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available We're having such trouble with him.
not_available I'm gonna get him into an exam room.
not_available I'm also gonna call for a Psych consult.
not_available We got a 55year
not_available old man stabbed in the neck.
not_available BP's 135/82.
not_available Pulse 110.
not_available Airway seems okay.
not_available Got a zone
not_available two neck injury.
not_available A good carotid pulse.
not_available What else about the third man? Was he big? Small? 
not_available Skinny.
not_available Not big.
not_available Are you usually hoarse like this? 
not_available No.
not_available Could be a nerve injury.
not_available Or expanding hematoma.
not_available Call X
not_available ray.
not_available I need a neck film.
not_available Pulse ox 96.
not_available Want to explore him in the O.R.? 
not_available He's stable.
not_available Skinny and what? What was he wearing? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Dark clothes.
not_available On my count.
not_available He needs a tetanus booster.
not_available Gram of Ancef? Give him three of Unasyn.
not_available Why wasn't I paged? 
not_available Didn't need you.
not_available Okay, here's the plan.
not_available Chest is clear.
not_available We need angiography, esophagoscopy laryngoscopy.
not_available We should protect his airway.
not_available I'm covering the ER, all right? Fine.
not_available I'm finished here.
not_available Draw up four of Versed and 10 of Norcuron.
not_available Sir, we're gonna put you to sleep.
not_available We're putting a tube in your mouth and you won't be able to speak.
not_available I gotta get the descriptions.
not_available He needs to be intubated.
not_available His wife was DOA at the scene.
not_available The killers are at large.
not_available Please.
not_available All right.
not_available Was he darkskinned, lightskinned? 
not_available Medium.
not_available Going my way? If you're going up to the O.R., I am.
not_available Why so glum on this bright spring day? I've got a lot on my mind.
not_available Would that be the trauma fellowship? 
not_available Yeah, it might be.
not_available I'll invite myself to sit on the selection committee.
not_available Anspaugh says you've got a fighting chance.
not_available I did have before Peter decided to apply.
not_available He applied for the trauma fellowship? Yeah.
not_available Hadn't you heard? No! I must be out of the loop.
not_available I'm sure he was planning to tell you.
not_available I'm sure it was just an oversight.
not_available I am so sorry for the wait.
not_available Someone will be in soon.
not_available The sun is shining, the birds are singing and after that Vicodin, I'm feeling no pain.
not_available Wait.
not_available Why don't you do my What did you call it? Subungual hematoma.
not_available I see you're a physician assistant.
not_available I'm working triage.
not_available You said it's a simple procedure.
not_available To tell you the truth, I'm not doing procedures anymore.
not_available Anymore? I have hepatitis C, Reverend Lynn.
not_available I don't want to risk infecting you.
not_available How could you infect me? Well, if I cut myself 
not_available Cut yourself? On what? I thought you just needed to drain the blood blister.
not_available That's true.
not_available If you're careful, shouldn't be any problem.
not_available Right.
not_available Remember, I don't believe in accidents.
not_available What happened to the kid? Blood freak him out? Maybe the cop freaked him out.
not_available What was he locked up for? Antoine is not a juvenile offender.
not_available He attends the Southside Math/Science School and he's here for a project.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Lucy IKnight.
not_available And this must be Seth.
not_available How are you doing in there? I've only had him a few weeks.
not_available He got kicked out of the group home.
not_available I took him on.
not_available I've handled tough ones.
not_available Why was he kicked out? Too much of a handful.
not_available He's been shuttled around for three years.
not_available How are you feeling, Seth? I'm sorry about him kicking the nurse.
not_available I gave him Inderal.
not_available He shouldn't attack.
not_available Inderal.
not_available That's the latest.
not_available What other medications is he on? This is what they gave 
me Tegretol for his impulsiveness.
not_available Ritalin and clonidine for attention deficit.
not_available Mellaril at bedtime to calm him down.
not_available Sounds like he's being overmedicated.
not_available Hey, Seth? You want a cookie? So how are things going? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you ever get dizzy sometimes? Sometimes I do get a buzzy feeling in my head.
not_available Do you find that he's clumsy? That's what happened here.
not_available He fell against a window and put his hand through.
not_available This wasn't from an outburst.
not_available I've been looking for you.
not_available You took off right in the middle.
not_available Was it the recurrent laryngeal nerve? You said he had a nerve injury making him hoarse.
not_available Was it the recurrent laryngeal nerve? Yeah, probably.
not_available Supplies the vocal cord muscles.
not_available That's right.
not_available I like this book.
not_available Puncture wound below the nipple.
not_available Tripped and fell on a sprinkler head while jogging.
not_available BP is 95/65.
not_available Decreased breath sounds on the left.
not_available It hurts to breathe.
not_available Set up for a chest tube, 32 French.
not_available Where's my wife? 
not_available On her way.
not_available Okay, everybody, on my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available You okay? 
not_available I just pinched my finger.
not_available It's all her fault.
not_available Betadine.
not_available Number 10 blade.
not_available And one of Versed.
not_available It's all whose fault? My wife.
not_available Forcing me to exercise.
not_available I should've stayed on the couch.
not_available Carol, chest tube tray.
not_available "It's a beautiful day," she says.
not_available "You should be out." 
not_available Last time I listen to her.
not_available Okay, just relax.
not_available You should finish your rounds.
not_available I'll be admitting this patient anyway.
not_available All right.
not_available Chest impalement, sixth intercostal space.
not_available Possible injuries below the diaphragm.
not_available Ultrasound? Abdomen's soft and non
not_available tender.
not_available I think it's just a chest injury.
not_available Well, we can't be too sure, Peter.
not_available Tube's in.
not_available Hook up the Thora
not_available Seal, Carol.
not_available Where's Carol? Pressure's 110.
not_available No way he got the spleen.
not_available Better safe than sorry.
not_available 200 cc's out of the chest tube.
not_available No fluid in the abdomen.
not_available What did I tell you? 
not_available Still could've nicked the diaphragm.
not_available There was no possibility of that.
not_available Are we taking him up to the O.R.? I'm gonna give him a laparotomy.
not_available I prefer a less invasive laparoscopy.
not_available You might miss a viscus injury.
not_available Why don't you take a moment and figure out what you want to do? I need your help.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I was cramping.
not_available Now I'm spotting.
not_available Is it time for your period? No, Mark.
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available Do you see a heartbeat? I can't tell.
not_available It's hard to get a good view.
not_available Come on, Mark.
not_available No.
not_available I don't see a heartbeat.
not_available Oh, man! Carol, it's not necessarily a blighted ovum.
not_available It's probably just too early to see with this.
not_available I'll call Radiology and set up an appointment for a vaginal ultrasound.
not_available Are you planning on going through with the pregnancy? I was hoping to, yeah.
not_available What does Doug think? I figured I'd wait on that one.
not_available Get through the first trimester.
not_available If I miscarry, there's not much to tell.
not_available He'd want to know either way.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available I'll tell him at some point.
not_available I'm trying to get used to this myself.
not_available Things are complicated enough.
not_available I'll call for that appointment.
not_available Thanks, Mark.
not_available You say he's been irritable? Off and on.
not_available IKind of grouchy.
not_available From all the spitting up and his stomachache.
not_available Has he lost any weight? I think so, now that you say that.
not_available His pants used to be snug.
not_available Where do you live? 
not_available Apartment on Cottage Grove.
not_available Pretty old building? 
not_available Yeah, I'd say so.
not_available Roaches be having family reunions.
not_available Peeling paint? Peeling everything.
not_available I bet Lonnie likes to put things in his mouth.
not_available Yeah, he do.
not_available Has he been screened for lead? Lead? No.
not_available What's wrong with him? We'll run more tests, get a better sense of what's wrong.
not_available So let's get a CBC and a lead level.
not_available Right.
not_available We're gonna see if his symptoms are a result of lead poisoning.
not_available Maybe from eating flecks of paint, which kids do.
not_available The lead
not_available level results won't be back for a while but we can learn some things from the blood work.
not_available Just make him better.
not_available Aesop, down.
not_available Dissect and mobilize the internal mammary.
not_available Got it.
not_available Excellent, Peter.
not_available You definitely have the dexterity for cardiothoracic, no doubt about it.
not_available This is amazing.
not_available It's like operating a marionette.
not_available Cutting edge in cardiac bypass.
not_available Didn't I tell you? 
not_available You told me.
not_available All right, let's keep flooding the field with CO2.
not_available We'll spoon up the artery and lift it off the anterior wall and anastomose the mammary to the anterior branch of the coronary.
not_available Make an end run around the diseased artery.
not_available You're familiar with the concept of an end run? 
not_available Of course I am.
not_available Yes.
not_available I know that you are.
not_available High levels of lead can cause basophilic stippling in the blood cells.
not_available And there it is.
not_available See this? The red cells are hypochromic, or less red than normal red cells which is a sign of anemia.
not_available Anemia.
not_available That's low iron in the hemoglobin.
not_available That's right.
not_available Red blood cells need iron so they can deliver oxygen to the tissues.
not_available Right.
not_available IKids who are anemic lack iron which makes it very easy for the lead to bind to the red blood cells.
not_available So you can see how this puts kids like Lonnie in a doubly bad position.
not_available How? Poor children are more likely to be anemic because of inadequate diet.
not_available And poor kids are more likely to be exposed to lead paint 
not_available Because they live in older buildings.
not_available Yes.
not_available So this kid's got lead poisoning.
not_available Looks like a pretty severe case.
not_available Are you upset about something? Why would I be upset? I've been talking you up for the cardiothoracic fellowship to anybody who will listen to me.
not_available And today I find out you're vying for the ER trauma fellowship.
not_available It's a bit confusing.
not_available Well, I wasn't taking the cardiothoracic fellowship for granted.
not_available So the trauma fellowship is just a fallback.
not_available I see.
not_available And if you were selected for both, you would choose? Cardiothoracic.
not_available Any indecision you're feeling about your future, I can help.
not_available Just say the word and I'll take the cardiothoracic fellowship off the table.
not_available No.
not_available That's my first choice.
not_available Just be clear, Peter.
not_available For your own sake, and mine.
not_available Radiology can see you at 5:00 for the ultrasound.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Why don't we get out of here? Take a walk, grab a movie.
not_available I thought you had to go to a Trauma Conference.
not_available Who wants to hang out with a bunch of doctors? Go to the conference.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I just thought we I could use this time by myself right now.
not_available All right.
not_available But I'm around if you need to talk.
not_available I know.
not_available I told IKerry you were feeling ill.
not_available So if you have to take off early Thanks, Mark.
not_available Nurse Hathaway? Coco, what are you doing back here? If I didn't do something right with the baby, would you have to tell on me? How are you doing, Seth? Got any more cookies? 
not_available Sure I do.
not_available I was talking to your foster mom.
not_available She seems like a pretty nice lady.
not_available What do you think? She's new.
not_available She said your natural mom died a few years ago.
not_available I never knew my dad.
not_available It's hard to grow up without a parent.
not_available She died in a car crash.
not_available It was my dad's fault.
not_available That's an awful thing to happen.
not_available Do you think about it a lot? No.
not_available Does it make you mad sometimes? You got any more cookies? That was my last one.
not_available If you don't want to talk about your parents, we don't have to.
not_available Why do you want to? I like talking to you.
not_available I want to know what's on your mind.
not_available My dad gets drunk a lot.
not_available That why you have to stay with foster parents sometimes? He's an alcoholic.
not_available A lot of people have that problem.
not_available It makes it kind of tough on you, though.
not_available I only wish that my dad would come and see me sometime.
not_available Taxi! Taxi! Come on! Taxi! Hey! Taxi! 
not_available Thanks a lot, buddy.
not_available Hey! Hey! Thank you very much! Elizabeth? You all right? I cannot get a cab in this bloody city.
not_available Listen, we can take the EI.
not_available It goes right near the hotel.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wasn't sure about the bath.
not_available Nobody showed me.
not_available I didn't know what to do.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available You knew to come back and ask for help.
not_available I was afraid to look stupid.
not_available Well, you did the right thing.
not_available Hi.
not_available Just support him with your hand like that.
not_available And then just gently wash him with a mild soap.
not_available You're good at this.
not_available You must do it a lot.
not_available No, not really.
not_available You'll get good at it too.
not_available Here.
not_available Why don't you give it a try? Hey! 
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Carter, did you need me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cracking the whip on you, Toine.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Friends of yours from school? 
not_available Friends from the neighborhood.
not_available You don't have to worry about the tie.
not_available It's not necessary.
not_available Well, my mom said to wear it.
not_available You ever had a job before, Antoine? 
not_available No.
not_available This isn't a job, but there are things I feel I ought to tell you.
not_available Not to give you a hard time, but You're bright, you'll learn it anyway.
not_available Might as well be now.
not_available All right.
not_available All right? With any job you have in the future, things will be expected of you.
not_available That means no hanging with buddies.
not_available I had a reason.
not_available I don't want to hear it.
not_available I'm not giving you a hard time.
not_available Just letting you know what I expect of you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available What's next? 
not_available Specificity.
not_available I got Sensitivity.
not_available It's a little crumpled.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Methodologies? 
not_available No.
not_available False Negative Rates? Bingo.
not_available Okay.
not_available Outcomes? It's got a footprint on it.
not_available Looks kind of interesting.
not_available Oh, it's not very sexy.
not_available Just meta
not_available analysis.
not_available Thought it might help me bag the trauma fellowship.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can't hurt.
not_available Be better if I had it published.
not_available I'm sorry about that chest wound today.
not_available Why are you sorry? You did a great job.
not_available Trauma shouldn't be a battleground for surgeons.
not_available Oh, you mean Peter.
not_available Yep.
not_available Well, that must be tough.
not_available What? 
not_available Competing with your boyfriend.
not_available Not boyfriend.
not_available Just competing.
not_available I thought you two were 
not_available History.
not_available I gotta get better sources.
not_available This is us.
not_available Think they'll still let me speak? 
not_available Ten minutes? That's nothing.
not_available I was supposed to go first.
not_available Well, you were busy saving someone in the ER.
not_available Four hours ago? 
not_available Work with me.
not_available So why aren't we stopping? 
not_available Guess it's not a weekend stop.
not_available We can get off at the next stop.
not_available Does that feel better? 
not_available Much.
not_available You should be taking care of people not working up front, checking pulses and doing paperwork.
not_available I'm sorry I took so long.
not_available I got held up.
not_available Reverend, how are you? 
not_available Can't complain.
not_available She's been taking good care of me.
not_available You two know each other? Since Peter was a little boy with straight A's.
not_available I haven't seen you around lately.
not_available Well, I've been pretty busy here and taking care of Reece.
not_available My mother used to attend Reverend Lynn's church.
not_available Are you the Jeanie that helped Mrs.
not_available Benton? 
not_available I am.
not_available She spoke of you.
not_available Just before she passed.
not_available She told me you were her angel that you brought her comfort.
not_available I'll never forget how much you meant to my mother.
not_available You see? I told you we didn't meet by accident.
not_available So Dr.
not_available Benton and I are both in your debt.
not_available I'd like to offer some healing prayers.
not_available I need all the help I can get.
not_available You mean right now? 
not_available The spirit has moved me.
not_available Amen.
not_available That wasn't so bad.
not_available No.
not_available Conference Room C.
not_available Which way? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You been here before? 
not_available I don't know the rooms.
not_available Conference rooms.
not_available Right.
not_available But I'm serious.
not_available I'm gonna marry this girl.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Can you tell us where the Trauma Physicians' Conference is? Did you check the directory? 
not_available Conference Room C, but it's a wedding.
not_available That's Ballroom C.
not_available Conference C's on the lower level.
not_available Where's the elevator? 
not_available Through the bar.
not_available That makes sense.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Want a drink? 
not_available Sure.
not_available We got time.
not_available Look! A giant pig ice sculpture.
not_available Oh! Sorry.
not_available She's had a little too much to drink.
not_available So you here for the conference? It's taking too long.
not_available Let's take the stairs.
not_available Good idea.
not_available You're terrible.
not_available Who? Me? You ran into them.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available I'm in heels! Well, take them off, woman.
not_available "Woman"? Did you call me "woman"? 
not_available Who? Me? I'll let it slide.
not_available You did rush to my rescue.
not_available I haven't saved you yet.
not_available At least we can make an appearance.
not_available It's a dead end.
not_available Uhoh! 
not_available Very funny.
not_available No, really.
not_available It's locked.
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
not_available I think somebody didn't want us to make this conference.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Could I see you over here for a minute, please? This is Sharice Haines.
not_available And this is her son, Andre.
not_available I think he has lead poisoning.
not_available Could you take a look? Sure.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available He's been feeling sick.
not_available I don't know why.
not_available I sent some of my friends to go bring Andre and his mother in.
not_available I can examine him now.
not_available And do those blood tests? If it's needed.
not_available First thing is to take a history and do a physical exam.
not_available May I see your son? Let me ask you a few questions.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? I know it's past 4:00 but can I hang around and see how this goes? Absolutely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Does it hurt when I do that, Andre? When I press right here? Seth is overmedicated, sent from one foster home to another.
not_available Each time, he gets a new med without regard to the old ones.
not_available You found out just in time.
not_available The credit really goes to my student.
not_available Lucy found the problem right away.
not_available Good job.
not_available We can put him on proper medication.
not_available I think he could benefit from psychotherapy as well.
not_available All he really needs is for someone to listen to him and to care.
not_available Glad to hear you say that.
not_available Most students think it's about meds.
not_available Not many take the time to do therapy.
not_available Residents are like that too, right? I suppose so.
not_available You might learn from your student.
not_available Could I continue counseling this kid? Your rotation's almost over.
not_available Then I start my second ER rotation.
not_available I'd still like to see him if possible.
not_available I'll supervise you myself.
not_available This would be a great case for you.
not_available Well? I don't understand.
not_available We can look into transplants, talk to 
not_available They're fine.
not_available What? My liver function tests are almost normal.
not_available The meds must be working.
not_available Yeah, I'll say.
not_available Maybe I stressed myself out and made myself sick.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess you can't underestimate the power of prayer, huh? I need you to take everything off and put on the gown.
not_available The radiologist will be in very soon, okay? We have a struggling national health service, but I believe in it.
not_available No.
not_available I meant for the surgeons.
not_available You seem so desperate to stay.
not_available Am I that transparent? Well, not "desperate." 
not_available I like it here.
not_available It suits me.
not_available You don't get homesick? A little.
not_available I do get Ionely sometimes.
not_available I complain about work.
not_available But it's my most loyal companion, really.
not_available It's hard to get used to it.
not_available You know, being alone.
not_available But After a while, you expect it.
not_available I mean, you just have to appreciate it.
not_available You really believe that? 
not_available I'm full of crap.
not_available You two locked in? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available You still want that drink? You got it.
not_available You haven't learned your lesson.
not_available It's a character flaw.
not_available I'm a stubborn old mule.
not_available I hear you.
not_available So you're here.
not_available It's a start.
not_available Is there a heartbeat? You said you've had some cramping? A little.
not_available And earlier today, some spotting.
not_available There we go.
not_available Right there.
not_available Strong, steady heartbeat.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available No doubt about it.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Not 100o/o guarantee that everything will be okay, but it's a good sign.
not_available The bubonic plague? 
not_available I was 9 years old.
not_available The counselor said not to feed squirrels that we might get bubonic plague.
not_available Could you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But Timmy fed the squirrels! So Timmy had to be locked in the cabin? "Timmy." Not "Jimmy." I said "Timmy." 
not_available It sounded like "Jimmy." Listen.
not_available What? 
not_available It's weird.
not_available What's weird? They're playing a tango.
not_available You know the tango? Want to crash a wedding? You do know how to do this? It's a traditional American wedding dance.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Just follow my lead.
