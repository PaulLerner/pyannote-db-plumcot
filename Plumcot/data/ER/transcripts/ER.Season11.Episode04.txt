not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available Who are you? Dubenko, surgical Attending.
not_available I'm covering trauma.
not_available What did you do? Hire the only candidate I didn't endorse? Maybe something's opened up at the hospital.
not_available I don't wanna work in the hospital.
not_available Welcome to Jumbo Mart.
not_available Can I help you? What are you doing? 
not_available Working.
not_available You can stay here for tonight.
not_available Actually, you can stay as long as you like.
not_available Sometimes I get nervous.
not_available It didn't seem like nervous to me.
not_available Do you have OCD? It's against the law to harvest organs from an HIV
not_available positive patient.
not_available The recipient is HIV
not_available positive.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available UNOS won't approve and no surgeon's gonna operate.
not_available But it is ridiculous to let a perfectly good organ go to waste.
not_available Prep him.
not_available I'll mobilize the team.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 11x04 "FEAR" Go away! Let me in! Open this damn door! 
not_available Why can't you leave us alone? Mama, what's wrong? Just leave us in peace! I'll kill all of you! The kids too! Just let us alone.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Is that what you want? You want me to kill the kids? 
not_available Mama, please.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available We just gotta go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Open it or I'll kill them one by one, and make you watch.
not_available Go where he can't find you.
not_available Open this damn door! Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Saige! Mama! The transplant wasn't a total success.
not_available I still have to meet with the Medical Executive Committee.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Makes me nervous too.
not_available Mommy, in the picture? Look, John, I'll have to go.
not_available I'll call you when I hear something, all right? Yeah.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Sorry, sweetheart.
not_available What were you saying? Is this Daddy? Yeah.
not_available You know that.
not_available Who are they? That's your nana and your grandpa.
not_available Are they dead too? I've been to the science museum like 10,000 times.
not_available Why can't I just stay home? This way maybe you'll learn something instead of zoning out all day in front of that Xbox.
not_available You can learn from that too.
not_available Luka taught me how to rob all 15 stores in Vice City.
not_available Looks cool on his plasma.
not_available You like it over there at Luka's? Like the neighborhood and everything? Guess so.
not_available You like him too, right? 
not_available Yeah, why? Just wondering.
not_available Well, then how would you feel about maybe moving in with him? You serious? 
not_available He offered.
not_available You want to? I don't know.
not_available We never really lived with anyone before.
not_available We lived with Dad.
not_available Can I put our TV in my room then? 
not_available Maybe we should think about it more.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sir, please don't read that paper until you've paid for it.
not_available Just this, please.
not_available Sure, $1.19.
not_available Oneone
not_available nine.
not_available I'll be right with you.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available I got it.
not_available I'll get it the next time.
not_available I think Howard has a touch of OCD.
not_available Is that even possible, to have a touch of OCD? Three
not_available ten, please.
not_available Busy over there today? 
not_available I wouldn't know.
not_available I thought you'd gotten out of your mandatory ride
not_available along.
not_available It doesn't matter that windowless vehicles make me sick.
not_available That's why they call it mandatory.
not_available How's it going here? Eightforty
not_available two, please.
not_available Great.
not_available I get 10 percent off all my purchases.
not_available Abby, we gotta roll.
not_available See you later.
not_available Bye.
not_available I talked her into doing it.
not_available Your hand never touched a scalpel.
not_available Look, we're just trying to determine Dr.
not_available Corday's understanding of the law
not_available That's about to change.
not_available Find the current law regarding HIV
not_available positive organ transplant.
not_available The donor was originally my patient.
not_available I'm just trying to ask for an opportunity to speak in her behalf.
not_available Attendance is limited to department heads.
not_available Last I checked, you weren't one.
not_available Bring it on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt is on the clock, and ready to rock.
not_available Which reminds me, I'm concerned we have doctors using work as therapy for post
not_available traumatic stress.
not_available He's fine.
not_available I'm not talking about him.
not_available Look, I got your request for extra shifts and it seems to me you're glossing over some of your susceptibilities.
not_available Hold the elevator.
not_available Too late.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm sorry to bring up your history of substance abuse but the fact is, you're still an addict.
not_available You've been through an emotional roller coaster.
not_available And I know what it's like.
not_available Why push it? Why tempt fate? God knows you don't need the money.
not_available There's no problem, Kerry.
not_available Good.
not_available Because I'm not in the business of safeguarding doctors' licenses.
not_available Not twice anyway.
not_available So no extra shifts? Go to the movies.
not_available Take trips.
not_available Do something other than hang around this hellhole.
not_available Kerry.
not_available What? I tried to make an appointment.
not_available Your assistant's being snarky.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available You want to extend your maternity leave.
not_available I was wondering if you found a permanent replacement for the chief of Emergency Medicine? Someone you want to recommend? 
not_available Yeah, me.
not_available Told her you're busy.
not_available I offered you the position 
not_available and you turned me down.
not_available That was pre
not_available baby.
not_available Postbaby that bad? 
not_available I like kids better when they're not sucking the life force out of me.
not_available Chuck doesn't mind staying at home as long as we can make up the lost income.
not_available A grand more per week with a two
not_available year commitment.
not_available Deal.
not_available When do I start? We need six months' worth of variant x
not_available ray interpretation unscheduled returns and a pneumonia pathway compliance by day's end.
not_available Oh, and the toilets in the ER are backed up.
not_available Good luck finding maintenance.
not_available About time.
not_available Getting crazy out here.
not_available How young are the kids? 
not_available Four and five.
not_available Three
not_available story fall from a window ledge.
not_available Miracle they're breathing and talking.
not_available What happened? Some domestic disturbance.
not_available Mom's pretty worked up.
not_available Please, God, please.
not_available He tried to kill my babies.
not_available Who did, ma'am? 
not_available My husband.
not_available Looks like an angulated fracture.
not_available Spontaneous resps.
not_available Get her on O2, and start a line.
not_available I need a leg splint.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available Can you tell me your name? 
not_available Kali.
not_available Okay, Kali.
not_available He had a gun.
not_available Any idea where he is now? Oh, God, why did you let this happen? Oh, God.
not_available Can you wiggle your toes? Great.
not_available That is perfect.
not_available Are you an angel? Vascular's intact.
not_available A what? An angel? Gonna take me to heaven? Will somebody please answer my question? Are we talking urticaria? We're not sure.
not_available Insect bites, lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum.
not_available It's possible.
not_available Which one is possible? All of the above.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Were the bumps firm? Were they nontender? Were they freely moveable? 
not_available They're just bumps.
not_available All right.
not_available Hold on, hold on, hold on.
not_available First of all, read up on derm.
not_available Secondly, learn to describe lesions systematically so your superiors don't look at you like you're complete dumbasses.
not_available How are you doing, Mr.
not_available Hayslip.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available You mind if I take a look? 
not_available That's what I'm here for.
not_available Good.
not_available Alrighty.
not_available So what are they? Let me run some tests and we'll find out, okay? In the meantime, take a more thorough history and get his labs cooking.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei, hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Ortho's slammed.
not_available Borrowed a cast cutter, figured I'd do it myself.
not_available I know you're limber, but you're not that limber.
not_available Come on, let me help you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Anytime.
not_available It happened so fast.
not_available BP's 106/60 after morphine.
not_available Pushing another two.
not_available I got it.
not_available The way he came right at us, and then my babies were down here
not_available Ma'am, we're taking your kids to County Emergency.
not_available Up we go.
not_available Meet us there.
not_available Do you have family or friends that can drive you? What if he comes back? 
not_available The police are here.
not_available No, we gotta stay together.
not_available Sorry, it's against policy.
not_available My children need me.
not_available Let her in.
not_available What? 
not_available Let her in.
not_available Hey, Pam? 
not_available What? Will you take the brother? This way your sister won't be alone, okay? Thanks.
not_available You're just supposed to be along for the ride, remember? You feeling that at all? So no John Hancocks? Your cast.
not_available Nobody signed it.
not_available I could have asked the night nurse, I guess.
not_available You know, I haven't left the house in weeks.
not_available The only reason why I'm here is because I decided to hitch a ride with my dad's transport ambulance.
not_available He's got pneumonia again.
not_available For the third time.
not_available And phlebitis and a UTl.
not_available Admitted him this morning.
not_available You could have just called me.
not_available I could have picked you up.
not_available I think it's gonna be a while before I get into a car with you again.
not_available Don't forget your rangeof
not_available motion exercises to build up your gastroc.
not_available You ever think about him? Who? Elgin.
not_available A 5yearold, displaced tibia fracture after falling from a third
not_available story window attempting to escape an abusive father.
not_available GCS fifteen, vitals stable after six of MS.
not_available Distal neurovascular status? 
not_available Intact.
not_available The mom? Yes, big red taxi thanks to Abby.
not_available Brother and sister in the next rig.
not_available We're gonna do everything we can for them.
not_available I promise.
not_available Tenderness at the olecranon and distal radius.
not_available Multiple fractures.
not_available Her name's Kali, after the Hindu goddess.
not_available Any LOC? 
not_available Not according to bystanders.
not_available Switching teams on us now, Lockhart? 
not_available It's pretty, you know? CBC, lytes, type and cross for two.
not_available Lateral C
not_available spine, chest, pelvis, left elbow, wrist and femur.
not_available Put CT on hold for head and abdomen.
not_available Very good, Howard.
not_available But it means "destruction.
not_available " 
not_available Dumar, go.
not_available He only used to hurt me.
not_available Why'd he have to hurt my babies? We need Social Services here right away.
not_available Let's get Mom to the family room.
not_available Sure.
not_available Ma'am, you want to come with me, please? It's okay.
not_available Good breath sounds, good sats.
not_available I'll check on number two.
not_available They catch the bastard that did this yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay, we're out of here.
not_available Old man found down, Lincoln Park.
not_available Tracheal midline, no JVD.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available I know.
not_available Abby, come on.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm gonna catch you on the next run.
not_available Set up for that neck film.
not_available You don't have 12 hours, you're not gonna get credit.
not_available Right or left side? 
not_available No hemotympanum.
not_available Little sister's stable for now.
not_available TKO saline after 500 cc's.
not_available Are you coming or not? 
not_available Someone get me a lead apron.
not_available There was no next of kin.
not_available And you know that because the hospital's policy of due diligence was exercised? The organ had to be procured quickly for the operation to be successful.
not_available There wasn't time for a 24
not_available hour family search.
not_available Was the rest of the surgical team aware they were performing an illegal procedure? I'm sure they assumed that consent and UNOS approval were in place.
not_available Did they know both patients were HIV
not_available positive? Universal precautions are taken in surgery regardless of a patient's HIV status.
not_available Look, this was a unique situation requiring decisive action.
not_available That now exposes us to huge civil liabilities.
not_available Only if negligence or malice are proven, which is clearly not the case.
not_available The recipient is thriving.
not_available It's against the law, Elizabeth.
not_available At the moment, yes.
not_available But the bill changing all of that is sitting on the governor's desk as we speak.
not_available Unsigned.
not_available So a liver that would have been destroyed was transplanted into a man who wouldn't have qualified for one a day or two earlier than the law allows.
not_available Where's the harm in that? 
not_available I saved a patient's life.
not_available Actually, our patient died.
not_available This other fellow just happened to benefit from it.
not_available You breached hospital policy, state and federal law.
not_available Any of which is grounds for dismissal, and/or loss of your license should we report this to the state board.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Got stuck in a hemorrhagic Meckel's diverticulectomy.
not_available Why is he here? 
not_available He's on the Medical Ethics Committee.
not_available If you had followed protocol and presented to them, you would know that.
not_available What's the next step, then? We'll make a decision.
not_available You'll be notified as soon as we reach one.
not_available Right.
not_available Damn, these veins are tiny.
not_available You're gonna have to settle down or it's gonna hurt even more.
not_available Mama C
not_available spine is clear.
not_available Sats, 97.
not_available Need some help? 
not_available I've done it before.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bet you were pretty good at it too.
not_available Parietal abrasion.
not_available No step off.
not_available What do we have? 
not_available I thought they paged Dubenko.
not_available Well, you got me.
not_available Mama Fouryear
not_available old with chest contusion.
not_available Rib fractures.
not_available Eight, nine, 10 on the left, but the lung is up.
not_available Sisters, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's check for tamponade.
not_available As soon as Sam sticks the kid.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I got a flash but no return.
not_available Try the other side.
not_available We need another nurse? 
not_available No.
not_available Where's my mama? Hey, Tamira, do you like the Wiggles? Which one is your favorite? Anthony? Murray.
not_available He plays guitar.
not_available DTRs two plus and equal.
not_available Good answer.
not_available I like Jeff because he's always sleeping.
not_available Got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good bowel sounds.
not_available No guarding.
not_available How do you know about the Wiggles? 
not_available I try to keep up with kids' TV.
not_available Gives you something to talk to them about.
not_available You're kidding me, right? 
not_available Okay, she's stable for CT.
not_available I hate the bloody Wiggles.
not_available Kali, you have big beautiful brown eyes, and they are both equal and reactive.
not_available No murmur, rub or gallop.
not_available How's it going in here? 
not_available Pretty severe pelvic fracture.
not_available Call Ortho? 
not_available Yes.
not_available In the meantime, use sheet traction.
not_available Pocket Doppler to Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available How'd it go upstairs? I'm not sure.
not_available I'll know in a couple of hours.
not_available Thanks for asking.
not_available I can't imagine they'll give you anything more than a slap on the wrist.
not_available Good pedal pulses.
not_available Foley's in.
not_available Dip it for blood.
not_available Angel? Angel? Abby, I think she's talking to you.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available You're still here, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're all still here.
not_available She'll need a second IV.
not_available I can start a central line.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt? What? We have the chest x
not_available rays for Mr.
not_available Hayslip.
not_available Who? 
not_available The guy with the bumps.
not_available He has a huge left hilar mass.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available I got Abby.
not_available Yeah, but she's playing paramedic.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, I got Howard too.
not_available Howie.
not_available How's the urine? 
not_available Negative.
not_available But I should try with a reagent strip from another bottle.
not_available I only dipped it twice.
not_available Why? Once is sufficient.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, we need you in here.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Sats dropped to 79.
not_available Probably a pulmonary contusion.
not_available Tamira? Tamira, can you hear me? 
not_available She's barely moving air.
not_available Get an ambu
not_available bag and intubation tray.
not_available Should we get the mom in here? 
not_available I'm not planning on her dying, are you? Is the universe punishing me for being a bad mom? There are charts here that haven't been picked up in six hours.
not_available Good help is hard to find.
not_available Like if you order a no
not_available foam latte, there should be no foam.
not_available Yeah, Neela burned my bagel earlier.
not_available You finish those QA reports? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Yeah, I thought you'd be a little rusty.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available In Trauma.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell her to find me when she's out.
not_available It's important.
not_available Oh, and St.
not_available Joe's is closing its ER next week for renovations.
not_available Plan on doubling your intake down here.
not_available Congratulations on your promotion.
not_available What's this? That is my timeoff request demand for a 5
not_available percent pay increase and my letter of resignation if neither condition is met.
not_available Welcome to management.
not_available How are you doing, Kali? 
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available Tachy at 130.
not_available Okay, we got a big pelvic bleed.
not_available Let's hang some O
not_available neg.
not_available Let's get a pressure bag on that saline.
not_available Where are they? 
not_available No, I don't want to.
not_available Okay, Kali, you need to relax.
not_available No, tell me what's happening to my kids.
not_available We're doing everything we can for them.
not_available Mommy, no.
not_available You're hurting her! What are you doing to her? 
not_available No, no, Nichelle.
not_available Abby.
not_available Oh, my God! What are they doing? 
not_available Come on, Abby.
not_available Listen to me, okay? Why aren't they helping? Why aren't they helping my kids? They are.
not_available They are.
not_available Okay? Okay, come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's let the doctors do their work, okay? Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's non
not_available productive.
not_available Any hemoptysis? Cough's chronic, but getting worse.
not_available Yeah, after two packs a day for 25 years, no kidding.
not_available Should I cancel the derm consult? The guy's got stage
not_available four lung cancer with 100 skin mets.
not_available What do you think? You have a primarycare doctor? 
not_available No.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hayslip.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available More tests? 
not_available Actually, that won't be necessary.
not_available Good.
not_available Give me a nice little cream for my rash, and I'm out of here.
not_available It's not a rash.
not_available Look, I don't know how to say this so I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
not_available You've got advanced lung cancer.
not_available What? Which has metastasized to your skin.
not_available These are little cancers? You need to see Oncology.
not_available They'll have the results of your biopsy and can recommend a course of chemotherapy.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Stay with the patient.
not_available He'll need somebody to hold his hand.
not_available Heart pressure's up.
not_available Repeat the bolus.
not_available All right, I'll take that.
not_available You, chart.
not_available Chuny, hang the blood.
not_available On it.
not_available You running this trauma now? 
not_available Guy's sweating bullets.
not_available All right, first hematocrit is 34.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available One room over.
not_available Circumferential traction.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pelvic and femur fracture with retroperitoneal bleeding.
not_available TPOD's better.
not_available You should get it from Central.
not_available And mobilize angio.
not_available Didn't know we stocked the TPOD.
not_available That must be new.
not_available Let's give her 10 liters O2 by mask.
not_available I'll call Central.
not_available Yeah, you do that.
not_available Is my sister gonna die? Saige, right? Well, we're doing everything that we can to make sure that that doesn't happen.
not_available Wanna up the FiO2.
not_available Howard, can you please take him out? 
not_available That's a social worker's job.
not_available They're not here right now.
not_available Typespecific's ready? 
not_available So get a nurse to talk to him.
not_available I'm a little busy right now.
not_available I'd rather talk to him.
not_available Who, him? Go.
not_available I asked for blood.
not_available I wanna repeat the crit I want a unit of FFP.
not_available I wanna know where the damn social worker is.
not_available Covering two hospitals by herself till midnight.
not_available That's my excuse for being late.
not_available What's yours for being an ass? Where's the HemoCue? 
not_available Foot of the bed.
not_available Fourteen centimeters at the lip.
not_available Can you see well enough? Most time we can't get one surgeon down here how did we manage two? 
not_available Getting harder to bag.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Rib sliced up the spleen.
not_available The large amount of fluid in the sub
not_available diaphragmatic space is obvious.
not_available Consent for an ex
not_available lap and a splenectomy.
not_available Sats are dropping.
not_available Tachy at 140.
not_available No breath sounds.
not_available She has a tension pneumo.
not_available The first chest x
not_available ray was clear.
not_available Okay, open a 20 French and a Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Toss in an 18
not_available gauge angiocath.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? Sometimes endotracheal intubation with positive airway pressure exacerbates an imperceptible pneumo.
not_available Okay, sats are up.
not_available I was about to perform a needle thoracostomy.
not_available You can place the chest tube.
not_available O.R.
not_available can take her as soon as that's in.
not_available Who should I put down as the Attending? 
not_available Dubenko.
not_available Corday.
not_available It will help to talk about what happened.
not_available No.
not_available I can't.
not_available Is there anyone we can call for you? I just need to pray for my children to live.
not_available Pray for some peace in my heart and my mind.
not_available Pray for him to die.
not_available He's an evil man.
not_available Oh, he's an evil man.
not_available But he gave me my children.
not_available Now he's gonna take them away.
not_available Need me to answer some questions for you? You wanna watch some TV? Is my mom gonna be okay? Well, it's pretty hard for her right now.
not_available She's worried and upset.
not_available I'm sure you are too.
not_available But hopefully your sisters'll get better real soon.
not_available They'll be back at home getting on your nerves in no time.
not_available Hey, you see those guys right there? They're gonna do everything that they can to keep your family safe from your father.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Scrubs are in the first supply closet.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available How's it going? Not so good.
not_available We can't find this guy.
not_available There's some indication he left the state a year or so ago.
not_available If he came back, no one saw.
not_available Neighbors didn't help? Woman next door was passed out drunk, never heard a thing.
not_available People on the other side, they weren't home.
not_available Well, she's still very upset and a little scattered.
not_available Yeah, I would be too if I saw my kid fall three floors.
not_available But I would want to catch the guy who did it to them.
not_available Hi.
not_available Wendall Meade, Social Services.
not_available Detective Maskins.
not_available Ma'am let me say how sorry I am that this happened.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Nichelle this detective needs to ask you about your husband.
not_available Do you have any idea where he's staying? Where he might go? The time.
not_available What's the time? Twelve
not_available fifteen.
not_available He likes to drink.
not_available Get drunk soon as he could every day.
not_available Did he have a favorite bar? 
not_available She's a survivor, this one.
not_available Let's hope.
not_available Look, I've been wanting to congratulate you on the transplant work you did with the HIV patients.
not_available Groundbreaking stuff.
not_available I wasn't trying to break any ground.
not_available Right.
not_available Well, in a more perfect world, you'd be given an award for it.
not_available Weaver is waiting on you.
not_available She says it's important.
not_available Anyways, I think what you did was great.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko, TPOD's ready in Trauma One.
not_available I'll send another surgeon down.
not_available The sheet traction method you used is a little archaic.
not_available This gives a better hug around the hips and upper thighs.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What about Weaver? 
not_available Tell her to wait.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available She's asking for you.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Slowly pull the handle straight out.

not_available I was hoping to have seen you earlier.
not_available Yeah, I got caught up in that trauma.
not_available So I have good news.
not_available Though certain members of the committee lobbied for your dismissal I was able to craft a proposal that I think will benefit all of us.
not_available Really? How would you feel about accepting a nontenure
not_available track position as clinical instructor here at County? So after giving seven years of my service to this hospital I lose my tenure over a single patient.
not_available Elizabeth, you broke the law.
not_available What did you think was gonna happen? I don't know.
not_available That I might be appreciated for saving a life.
not_available That 
not_available That friends might have fought for me.
not_available I did fight for you.
not_available I had to beg, borrow and steal just to keep them from giving your name to the state board.
not_available What the hell.
not_available Let them pull my license.
not_available Let them make it ugly.
not_available I'll go public.
not_available I'll tell anyone who cares to listen this hospital was willing to let a man die because a bloody bill was signed on a Tuesday rather than a Monday.
not_available We did something extraordinary here, Kerry.
not_available You're right.
not_available We did.
not_available But that's not our purpose.
not_available We can barely service the community's basic medical needs as it is.
not_available And that's it? Just stay open, get through each day? Isn't that enough? Howard.
not_available You shouldn't have stopped me.
not_available Howard, you need help.
not_available There are medications for this, therapies.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I don't think you're fine.
not_available I saw you doublecheck and triplecheck every lab form and blood unit 
not_available that went into that.
not_available Probably AB/O incompatibility.
not_available No, listen to me.
not_available The transfusion was fine.
not_available Nobody did anything wrong.
not_available Howard, we didn't kill her.
not_available Her father did.
not_available You're not gonna get betterI'll go into Derm or Radiology
not_available You're not being rational.
not_available I'm being thorough! Why is that such a problem for you people? What was that all about? 
not_available Howard has OCD.
not_available Please don't tell me I just lost a doctor.
not_available She would have started kindergarten this year.
not_available You all right? I'm hanging in there.
not_available How about you? Personally or professionally? First
not_available year resident.
not_available It's probably one and the same at this point.
not_available Today was hard.
not_available I can't imagine what it must feel like to lose a child.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Big brother just told me he hadn't seen Dad in a while.
not_available It might be because he died a year ago.
not_available Any candidates that did match for an internship? 
not_available He seemed reasonable to me.
not_available Only four in the entire country? A friend is taking a year off after school to live with wolves.
not_available I can see if she's still in town.
not_available I'm sure if you talked to him 
not_available he would change his mind.
not_available And one in the Dominican Republic.
not_available Can I do a phone interview? I did talk to Howard but he kept locking and unlocking his doors.
not_available There's a doc in Neurology.
not_available Says he's looking to start over.
not_available In Milwaukee? Can I get an interview? 
not_available He's close to 60, but he's still spry.
not_available Yes, thank you.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Did you hear? 
not_available What? Tamira died in the O.R.
not_available Police went to Dad's favorite bar and confirmed he died last year.
not_available Shot to death in some holdup.
not_available After that, kid says she couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.
not_available After years of abuse, she probably didn't know what to do with herself.
not_available Any psychiatric history? 
not_available No, but records show that her clinic had her on Valium three times a day.
not_available On it 6 months till she ran out of money.
not_available How long ago was that? 
not_available Last week.
not_available So she was hooked.
not_available We're talking benzo withdrawal.
not_available If she quit cold turkey could be psychosis, delusional thinking, hallucinations.
not_available Did the oldest kid say what really went on? No, and you can forget about him talking to the cops.
not_available Hey, Lockhart, EMS coordinator called for you.
not_available Sounded pretty pissed about your ride
not_available along.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hey, Chuny, how's she doing? 
not_available Better.
not_available I gave her 10 of Valium, PO.
