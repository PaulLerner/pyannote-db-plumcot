not_available You said you were picking up.
not_available Who's lying now? You're right.
not_available The truth is I was searching your room.
not_available I don't know if I can trust you.
not_available You came on to me.
not_available You are not out.
not_available I am not out at work.

not_available The tomatoes are killers.
not_available Yeah, I figured that part out.

not_available You like Smurfs? 
not_available You liked The Smurfs.
not_available I liked the news.
not_available So we did what I wanted to do? It's hard to argue with a 2year

not_available That's gross.

not_available Except you can't.
not_available I'm under house arrest now? Not yet, but you're making me think about it.
not_available You talk to my teachers, screen my calls, search my room which even my guidance counselor considers uncool.
not_available Enough.
not_available I have to report to the hospital.
not_available It's like living in a prison.
not_available Go to bed.
not_available Mark? 
not_available Here comes the warden.
not_available Hey.
not_available Why won't you treat me like a thinking person? Hey, what's going on?

not_available Do you have his number? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? 
not_available He didn't give it to me.
not_available Well, I'm sure that he intends to.
not_available Did he say something? Maybe you should just let it sit for a little while.
not_available Actually, I was hoping that you would call him for me.
not_available Sure.
not_available Or better yet, the three of us could dip ourselves in a vat of acid.
not_available We made mistakes, John.
not_available I made mistakes, I know.
not_available But I don't believe that it's too late to fix it.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I know we argue a lot.
not_available We didn't mean to bother you.
not_available You were screaming for help.
not_available I know.
not_available I called help.
not_available Brian and I have been together since high school.
not_available And there's a lot of history and a lot of passion.
not_available Passion? Anyway, sorry to bother you.
not_available Is it your ankle? 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Let me take a look at it.
not_available I don't need any help.
not_available Joyce.
not_available I'm sorry, I'm late for work.
not_available It's gotta be hard.
not_available She should deal with it herself.
not_available Maybe she doesn't know how.
not_available Mom's not the retiring sort.
not_available She's tougher than he is.
not_available Nobody's tough when your life's falling apart.
not_available You haven't met her yet.

not_available Thanks.
not_available Jennifer Lampkin.
not_available Her ex

not_available How'd you manage that? I explained that she'd been to the ER over 10 times.
not_available The pain meds were no longer appropriate.
not_available They accepted that? 
not_available Even got her Medicaid paperwork started.
not_available That's excellent.
not_available I have Attendings that can't turf a stable patient to Surgery.
not_available Have her call me at the hospital.

not_available You caught me.
not_available I was up all night slapping Frank's ass raw.
not_available Raw? Have you seen him sit down today? Come to think of it Hey, Frank, have you sat down today? What?

not_available I'm waiting for a chest pain.
not_available Hey, did you reach her? 
not_available Who? Jen.
not_available What did she say? 
not_available She wants to think about it.
not_available Think about it? She's her mother.
not_available We can't let Rachel make these decisions.
not_available Act up, get angry at one and then punish us by moving back to the other.
not_available You know, you might consider boarding school.
not_available She could use some structure.
not_available Yeah, I could sell her off to pirates.
not_available You develop a sense of self
not_available worth, community, responsibility.
not_available It worked well for me.
not_available Yeah, but 
not_available But what? You're British.
not_available Mark, she's out of control.

not_available In high school I was voted "most likely to marry a convict.
not_available "

not_available Scheduled June 6th, 02.
not_available Almanac says it's gonna rain.
not_available Who believes the weatherman? Yeah.

not_available Not like all these poor saps you see every day.
not_available Go to work in the morning after fighting with their wives.
not_available They never get the chance to say I'm sorry or goodbye.
not_available I'm out of gauze.
not_available Would you? Would you
not_available ? Would you keep me here a while? Just so I don't have to be there a little bit longer? You might need to be observed for a couple hours.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Kinney, let her go.
not_available I'll straighten him out.

not_available Mr.

not_available We have to put you on a monitor.
not_available Would you like us to call your daughter? No, don't ruin it.
not_available She'll wonder where you are when there's no one there to give her away.
not_available She won't.
not_available That was fast.
not_available Nucleic
not_available acid amplification test.
not_available It's new.
not_available What'd it say? 
not_available Positive for chlamydia.

not_available I do the clinics.
not_available Does Aisha know this? 
not_available Aisha? No.
not_available Zachery.

not_available How? I don't know, but Aisha should be tested too.
not_available I told you, she's clean.
not_available She needs to be tested anyway.
not_available I got confidentiality, right? 
not_available You can tell her.
not_available What if I don't want to? She's at risk.
not_available You need to tell her.
not_available The high
not_available five is heavy.
not_available I ain't letting that word spread.
not_available Dimon, it is really important that we find out how you contracted the virus.
not_available No root beer, D.
not_available Grape? 
not_available Let's jet.
not_available You need to sit in the chair.
not_available This is messed up.
not_available We're out of here.
not_available No.
not_available Aisha, I need to look at your lip.
not_available We need to run some tests.
not_available She's fine.

not_available What are you doing? Enter.
not_available Kerry, your response time is impressive as always.
not_available I didn't know that we had a meeting.
not_available You remember Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available I'm on shift, Robert.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen would like to be reinstated.
not_available We're fully staffed at the moment but if something opens up, I'll keep you in mind.
not_available I'm not asking you to consider it.
not_available It was your choice to step down.
not_available I've changed my mind, then.
not_available I'm sorry that only with hindsight you decided
not_available I didn't decide anything.
not_available You decided I was expendable.
not_available I'm not the doctor that blew out that man's aorta.
not_available No, you're the doctor who wasn't there.
not_available You were reprimanded for making a mistake.
not_available The only mistake I made was allowing you to sacrifice me like you did Malucci, to save your own ass.
not_available Easy, ladies.
not_available If I want to see a good catfight, I'd watch The View.
not_available Let's try to keep this civil.
not_available I respect your abilities as a doctor, but the position's already been filled.
not_available We're prepared to file suit unless that and two other conditions are met.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen's record needs to be expunged.
not_available And an official statement of correction attached to her file.
not_available We' re trying not to tarnish reputations.
not_available I don't respond well to threats.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available You know what? You can't screw up and then whine about being mistreated.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei, you need to grow up.
not_available No, I don't think it's broken but I want to get an x
not_available ray just to be safe.
not_available He's got it, doesn't he? What do you mean? 
not_available Dimon.
not_available He's got the high
not_available five.
not_available What? 
not_available HIV.
not_available We can't discuss Dimon's medical status with anybody but him.
not_available I feel you.
not_available But I see he's tripping, because he never hit me before.
not_available Does he know that you're HIV
not_available positive? My viral load's been zero.
not_available He only gives.
not_available I told him, "Wear a rubber anyway.
not_available " He said, "What for? " It wasn't sex to him.
not_available He's on the DL.
not_available The DL? 
not_available Down low.
not_available See, he ain't gay.
not_available You can't be a faggot and be legit.
not_available He only does guys because women get so stressful.
not_available Does Aisha know about this? I was just keeping it going waiting for the day he'd come around and get real.
not_available I didn't even think about her.
not_available CC, it's really important we find her.
not_available She has a pager.
not_available I don't know the digits.
not_available Think you can get it? 
not_available I can try.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Order a Water's view to rule out an orbital
not_available rim fracture.
not_available Page me if he gets that number.
not_available So "down low" is bisexual? 
not_available No, "on the side," "in secret.
not_available " "In the closet"? 
not_available To be in the closet, you have to be gay.
not_available He is gay.
not_available CC's gay.
not_available Dimon's on the down low.
not_available Well, if he's having anal sex with his friend, he's gay.
not_available Not to him.
not_available He's got a girlfriend.
not_available He just gets down for release.
not_available So "down low" means "in denial"? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you injured it before? 
not_available No.
not_available You feel a pop or a snap? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Over the bone or to the side? 
not_available Both.
not_available Okay.
not_available There? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, that's a pretty good sprain.
not_available How'd you do that? My husband bought me those roller shoes.
not_available I was practicing in the apartment.
not_available It turns out I was worse than I thought.
not_available Has the swelling increased? You triage her? 
not_available We're neighbors.
not_available I saw her this morning.
not_available Oh.
not_available Could be an avulsion off the lateral malleolus.
not_available Get an ankle series.
not_available Is it broken? I don't see a fracture, but Dr.
not_available Weaver's gonna have to check it out.
not_available Am I gonna have to get crutches? 
not_available Maybe until you can bear weight.
not_available You're gonna need help getting around.
not_available How are you getting home? I called Brian.
not_available It's not all him, you know.
not_available I give as good as I get.
not_available Well, I don't see him sitting in an ER needing x
not_available rays.
not_available Well, it's not the way it seems.
not_available Our walls are pretty thin, Joyce.
not_available He's the only guy I've ever loved.
not_available Will you talk to a social worker? Someone with experience who could maybe help you lay out some ways you might want to deal with this.
not_available Joyce, I think you came here for a reason.
not_available I can help you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I came here because I didn't want to answer a bunch of questions.
not_available If a patient with the same history presents again tomorrow I expect you to order the workup I requested today.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, glad I caught you.
not_available You can go away now.
not_available I was gonna page you, but I couldn't be sure you'd be wearing your pager.
not_available Robert, you're not gonna be intimidated by these baseless accusations.
not_available They have someone on record, Kerry.
not_available About what? A waitress at that dump across the street said you were looking for your pager the night Chen and Malucci killed that guy.
not_available That's an important detail.
not_available Robert
not_available I don't need to hear it.
not_available No explanation.
not_available No spin.
not_available Just fix it.
not_available Fix what? 
not_available All she wants is an Attending position with standard pay scale and a personal apology from you.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available A first time for everything.
not_available I wouldn't have any kind of authority over her.
not_available We've settled with this dead kid's family.
not_available I won't open it up again because you have a management problem created by your own negligence and deceit.
not_available She's not interested in taking you down.
not_available All she wants is her job.
not_available Give it to her today.
not_available And super
not_available glue the pager to your forehead if you have to.
not_available Excuse me, I'm looking for Julio Echeverria.
not_available He had a heart attack.
not_available Check in at the desk down the hall.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, I need help in Trauma 2.
not_available That's Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Sats are dropping.
not_available What's wrong with him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Fifteen liters by mask.
not_available Sir, I need you to take a deep breath.
not_available Did you get a 12lead? 
not_available No ischemic changes.
not_available What happened? Decreased breath sounds on the right.
not_available Lung exam was normal 15 minutes ago.
not_available Is this new? 
not_available Yeah, they had to straighten me out.
not_available Prep for a chest tube.
not_available I need lidocaine.
not_available What are you doing? A broken rib collapsed your lung.
not_available We need to put a tube in to help you get oxygen.
not_available No.
not_available We have to.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available You'll die if we don't inflate your lung.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Ten blade.
not_available Hold on, Kerry.
not_available We need consent.
not_available I'm done anyway.
not_available Please.
not_available Kerry.
not_available A curved Kelly.
not_available Susan, I need the Kelly now.
not_available Please.
not_available They'll keep beating on me.
not_available Susan, open up some Vaseline gauze.
not_available Susan, now.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I was looking for a parking place.
not_available You want a drink? I'm boarding.
not_available I should be boarding now.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available So, what's so urgent? 
not_available Nothing really.
not_available I was just checking in.
not_available So how's the new place? 
not_available Sparsely furnished.
not_available But there's something to be said for that.
not_available For sparseness? 
not_available Final boarding for all passengers.
not_available Clarity.
not_available If I knew your mother was moving in I would have taken some of the New York furniture.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She mentioned to me that she doesn't have your new number.
not_available You should give her a call, check in.
not_available Why? 
not_available You were married to her.
not_available She wants to negotiate.
not_available Who knows when she started looking at life the way other people read the stock reports, but it's over.
not_available I don't think she shares that assessment.
not_available You're her ambassador now? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm just suggesting you take time to make sure this is what you want.
not_available I do.
not_available Thanks to you.
not_available Me? 
not_available I was part of this lie this illusion we were living in order to hold it together.
not_available It took losing Dad and thinking about what you said to make me see that I was lost.
not_available I can't find my way back with her.
not_available Final boarding call to all passengers.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I've never, ever seen her reach out like this before.
not_available That's my flight.
not_available Careful, John, she's an emotional vampire.
not_available Is he dying? He's had a pretty big heart attack.
not_available He may need surgery to replace a valve.
not_available Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I was scared you wouldn't want me there.
not_available After all this time, you show up now? I've got 200 people waiting.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available Be happy.
not_available Six years and nothing? Why, Papi? I should have let you come back home.
not_available It was a mistake.
not_available Why now? My little girl's getting married.
not_available It's supposed to be the best day of my life.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to ruin it.
not_available And you're not going to.
not_available I'm happy now.
not_available Rene is a wonderful man.
not_available And I don't need you anymore.
not_available Maria? Miss Echeverria.
not_available I've got the best caterer in Chicago setting up at the Hilton.
not_available Let me talk to you.
not_available Nothing's refundable.
not_available Your father is very sick.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Don't leave it like this.
not_available He didn't care when I called him from Wichita, begging him to let me come back.
not_available He wanted to see you get married.
not_available Look, he abandoned me.
not_available Okay? Turned his back.
not_available Nobody does that.
not_available Only a stubborn, heartless man.
not_available He's trying to reconnect.
not_available You're not gonna make me cry.
not_available This makeup took three hours.
not_available He was fine when I left him.
not_available I didn't touch him.
not_available He has broken ribs and a collapsed lung.
not_available He was flailing against the side rails.
not_available We had to restrain him.
not_available With your nightstick? 
not_available Why do you care? He's a murderer.
not_available He killed two teenage kids on the way to a movie.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Get it off of him.
not_available What happened? I was looking at the x
not_available ray, and he flipped the gurney.
not_available Are you all right? Help us! Chest tube's out of his Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Asystole! 
not_available No, no, no, he pulled his leads off.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kinney.
not_available Low sats.
not_available He's dropping to 85.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kinney, open your eyes.
not_available Blood from the ear canal.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kinney? Left pupil is 9 millimeters and sluggish.
not_available GCS is 12
not_available 1.
not_available Probably an epidural bleed.
not_available Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.
not_available An 8
not_available O ET tube.
not_available Bag him, Susan.
not_available Get a head CT and call Neurosurgery.
not_available Kerry, the guy's gonna die in a couple months by lethal injection.
not_available Bag him now.
not_available He asked for no heroic measures.
not_available He's a death
not_available row inmate attempting suicide.
not_available He can't ask for a DNR.
not_available Tube him now.
not_available Whatever you say, Kerry.
not_available Hey.
not_available I got your message.
not_available Yeah, we've been backed up all day.
not_available You told me to come by.
not_available Actually, I left another message on your machine that I'd get back to you later.
not_available Well, I'm here.
not_available Okay? I came to see Marty from the 38th.
not_available What do you want to say? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, Dr.
not_available Chen's looking for you.
not_available Yeah, tell her to wait.
not_available I just wanted to make sure that you were all right.
not_available I heard it was a big fire.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Can you sign an order for a socialservices consult? 
not_available They won't come without a signature.
not_available Not now.
not_available Well, it's Joyce Westlake.
not_available The ankle.
not_available There is domestic violence involved.
not_available Yeah, I'll come down and talk to her.
not_available So that's it? What? You're gonna keep playing this game? 
not_available I'm not playing a game.
not_available So you just want to check on me? 
not_available Is that all right? Just write the order, I'll take care of it.
not_available No, I'm the treating physician.
not_available Okay? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Why are you avoiding? I'm not.
not_available Can you tell I'm a bit swamped? Kerry, excuse me, you want to talk to me, talk to me.
not_available Okay? I'm not gonna hang around for your convenience.
not_available You know, forget it.
not_available Please wait.
not_available No.
not_available Bye.
not_available Let me just check onSandyYou know
not_available Goodbye, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available You packed me a lunch? 
not_available We call this an escape kit.
not_available Money, medication, phone numbers, anything you might need is in here.
not_available For what? In case one night you decide you don't feel safe and you have to get out.
not_available He's my husband.
not_available I don't need that to feel safe.
not_available Okay.
not_available But it can't hurt having it around.
not_available Right? 
not_available So I'll put it with the rest of your stuff.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Joyce, this is Adele.
not_available She's a social worker here at the hospital.
not_available I told you I don't need a social worker.
not_available In situations like this it's policy for me to interview the patient.
not_available Situations like what? 
not_available Abby, I need you.
not_available Brian's gonna be here.
not_available If he finds her, he'll get upset.
not_available Okay, I'll be back.
not_available Well, has that happened before? Kid named Ricky gets on the phone, transfer to Trauma 1.
not_available Who? 
not_available Choirboy.
not_available He's gonna hold up the phone from the church vestibule.
not_available Did you see it? What? 
not_available Me either, but I heard it was steamy.
not_available Your rehiring will necessitate the scaling back of the hours of others so don't be surprised if your return is not met with open arms.
not_available I'm sure they'll look to you for any scheduling complaints.
not_available You start tomorrow at 7.
not_available A.M.? 
not_available P.M.
not_available You're putting me on overnights.
not_available Under the circumstances I don't think you're in any position to complain about your schedule.
not_available You know that's not true, Kerry.
not_available So let's stop lying.
not_available Okay? I'm getting my job back with the following conditions.
not_available I didn't agree to any conditions.
not_available I'm returning as an Attending.
not_available I expect shift equity and equal pay.
not_available I'll report to more experienced faculty, but not to you.
not_available We both know what you did here.
not_available Yes.
not_available And we know what you did too.
not_available So while we're being truthful, let me just say it's not me with blood on my hands.
not_available If you were a more thorough doctor you wouldn't have needed me there in the first place.
not_available A kiss could mean anything.
not_available Not that kind of kiss.
not_available I guess Kinney's gonna get executed after all.
not_available The inmate.
not_available He's in a post
not_available op coma, not even triggering the vent.
not_available Well, we did what we had to do.
not_available $4000 a day to keep this guy alive so they can kill him hardly seems like the best use of resources.
not_available You know what? Just save the patients.
not_available I'll worry about our resource management.
not_available Oh, John.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Carter here? 
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Carter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Aisha.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available I got a page.
not_available Dimon's always had an act, but I thought he was real with me.
not_available No, no, I'm just glad you came back.
not_available What do you need, Malik? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, then why don't you find something to do.
not_available Warm for January.
not_available Maybe we'll luck out and have a mild winter.
not_available Why are we going this way? 
not_available Thought it'd be nice to walk by the river.
not_available I have a lot of homework.
not_available I called your mom today.
not_available And did you tell her I'm going back? We talked about it, and I decided that it wasn't good for us.
not_available You and me, or you and Mom? 
not_available You and me.
not_available I don't have a say? 
not_available Maybe in a few years, but no, not yet.
not_available Rachel, I want you to stay here.
not_available I missed too many things in your life to let you leave angry with me.
not_available I'm your father.
not_available I'm not gonna pass you off when things get rough.
not_available And what makes you think things will get better? We both try harder.
not_available Neither one of us is very good at listening.
not_available I just don't want to be treated like a kid.
not_available Good.
not_available I don't want to be treated like an old man.
not_available Brian? Brian? 
not_available Hi.
not_available What happened? Hi.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available Joyce's ankle was bothering her.
not_available She sprained it pretty badly.
not_available I told her those things don't have ankle support.
not_available She's not a great skater.
not_available They can be dangerous.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry you got pulled into this little domestic drama.
not_available I think you got the wrong idea.
not_available Evidently, I did.
not_available We have tempers.
not_available And once in a while things get out of hand.
not_available This is really none of my business.
not_available If it infringes on your life, it is.
not_available Our neighbor in San Francisco thought there was an earthquake.
not_available It was just Joyce smashing all my softball trophies because I went to a game instead of going out with her folks when they were in town.
not_available Right.
not_available They told me Room 3.
not_available It's over here.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available Joyce is almost finished.
not_available You could pull your car around, and I could wheel her out.
not_available And we can meet you.
not_available I can get her.
not_available But it's a long walk to the parking lot.
not_available And she's really supposed to stay off the ankle for a day or two.
not_available So Well, is there a problem? Abby? 
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Better.
not_available The throbbing stopped.
not_available Did they give you lots of drugs? 
not_available A few.
not_available You hungry? 
not_available A little.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why don't we go over to Angelino's and get some pasta, a bottle of merlot? 
not_available I feel more like a cheeseburger.
not_available It's your call.
not_available Thanks, Abby.
not_available Is this yours, Joyce? No, I have what I came with.
not_available Bye.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available We got a call, Kerry.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, who the hell are you? 
not_available I live my life without apologies.
not_available Right.
not_available You make choices for your life.
not_available You don't make choices for mine.
not_available I didn't choose to be lied to or have my time wasted.
not_available I never misrepresented myself.
not_available You pretend to be something you're not.
not_available Lopez, let's go! 
not_available You know what? It's my employees, my colleagues, my workplace.
not_available I choose to keep my private life to myself.
not_available You can't separate who you are from what you do.
not_available That is not your decision to make.
not_available I stand up and face it every day.
not_available You want the life without hardship.
not_available You don't get one without the other.
not_available Not with me anyway.
not_available So you did this out of spite to teach me some kind of lesson? I did you a huge favor.
not_available You just don't know it yet.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available The light went out.
not_available Why don't you tell Henry? 
not_available I'm not incompetent.
not_available I'm capable of changing a light bulb.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Here.
not_available Come down from there.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available No, screw it.
not_available I'll get it later.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Have you been drinking? Norman Tucker sent Millicent a bottle of 40yearold Bordeaux as a get
not_available well gift.
not_available And you what, helped her open it? I spent the entire afternoon at that children's cancer center for Millicent.
not_available There was this one boy I came home, and I made the mistake of getting in the middle of an argument between Millicent and her physical therapist.
not_available Yeah, Gam's having a little trouble losing her independence.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Sit down.
not_available She told me that my presence was, in fact, hindering her recovery that if she needed a caregiver I would be the last person she'd call.
not_available That's a defense mechanism.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Checking your pulse.
not_available Did you speak to your father? Sixty and weak.
not_available Are you taking something? Xanax.
not_available He's giving up on me.
not_available When did you start taking Xanax? 
not_available I have a prescription.
not_available And you took it with alcohol.
not_available How many pills did you take, Mom? 
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You shouldn't have to go through this.
not_available How many? Two.
not_available I just took two.
not_available She asked me to leave.
not_available Do you want me to leave, John? No.
not_available You're right.
not_available I've failed you.
not_available I failed your brother.
not_available And then I failed you.
not_available Mom He was tired before we left for France.
not_available That was 20 years ago.
not_available Millicent insisted he just needed some fresh air.
not_available He'd been inside all winter.
not_available It delayed the diagnosis by less than a month.
not_available It wouldn't have changed anything.
not_available I was his mother.
not_available I just stood by while it was eating him alive.
not_available I just stood by.
