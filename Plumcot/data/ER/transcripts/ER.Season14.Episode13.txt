
not_available Ah.
not_available Imagine waking up here every morning.
not_available Bettina, I can't afford this.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available I did the math.
not_available You did the math? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Time to move out of your med school apartment and invest in something.
not_available My apartment is fine.
not_available So, what do you think? 
not_available Oh, it's beautiful.
not_available Told you.
not_available The sellers did a great job on the renovation.
not_available The kitchen, the moldings, these yummy floors.
not_available Bamboo flown in from Brazil.
not_available And there's a gym and a children's game room in the basement.
not_available You two got kids? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Listen, don't rush it.
not_available When you're newlyweds and it's just the two of you against the world well, you can't beat that.
not_available Okay.
not_available It'll be gone by the end of the week, so if you're at all "interested " make an offer.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available It's, uh, the first place he's seen.
not_available Think about it.
not_available I'll call you tomorrow.
not_available No, don't, please.
not_available I'm just looking.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available It wasn't just the battery.
not_available Where'd you get my keys? 
not_available You also had alternator issues.
not_available You stole my keys and fixed my car? I think the proper response would be, "Thank you, Tony.
not_available " Also, I tightened the connections and got you all charged up.
not_available Ooh.
not_available That sounds like fun.
not_available Thought you were dating the chaplain.
not_available He's talking about my car.
not_available Car.
not_available She made a reasonable assumption about our relationship and you had a seizure.
not_available I wasn't feeling the realtor.
not_available I wanted to get out.
not_available We're adults.
not_available The topic of commitment shouldn't be off
not_available limits.
not_available It's not off
not_available limits.
not_available Really? You haven't looked me in the eye since we left.
not_available Come on, it's not like that.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available There's a kid and an old guy who've been pulled out of the lake.
not_available Take one with Grady.
not_available You got it.
not_available Let's talk about this later, okay? You're admitting there's something to talk about.
not_available Hey, Chaz, how you doing? 
not_available Fine, thanks.
not_available What up? Robert Truman, 68.
not_available Jumped in after a kid who fell into the lake.
not_available Thought I could get in and out.
not_available Too cold.
not_available Heart rate's 68, pulse ox good.
not_available Temp was 90.
not_available My lungs froze up, couldn't swim.
not_available Does anything hurt, sir? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Take care of the boy.
not_available Barely moving air.
not_available Too cold, can't get a sat.
not_available Twentyfour gauge Plv, that's it? 
not_available He needs central access.
not_available Mom is here.
not_available It's okay.
not_available This is your fault.
not_available You made this happen.
not_available He needed my help.
not_available I thought if I could only do Why won't you leave us alone? No, I'm sorry, I tried to 
not_available Stay away from my son.
not_available He's hypoventilating.
not_available We need to bag him.
not_available Doctor, please take care of that child.
not_available We're gonna concentrate on you now.
not_available If you wanna help me, you need to help that boy.
not_available Mr.
not_available Truman 
not_available Please save him.
not_available Save him or I'm going to hell.
not_available The nurse wants to bump our meniscus repair until tomorrow.
not_available Tell her to kiss your ass, or maybe mine.
not_available She's cute.
not_available What's up, Ortho girl? Morris, what are you doing here? 
not_available I'm a surgeon for the day.
not_available What? Yep, it's the ER's new trauma
not_available exchange program.
not_available I never heard anything about this.
not_available ER staff can spend a day following trauma patients to the O.R.
not_available You gonna scrub in on cases? 
not_available Hope so.
not_available Be good and Harold might let you hold his retractor.
not_available Definitely.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Dude, I gotta go.
not_available There's like a hundred doctors here.
not_available After you.
not_available No, after you.
not_available Rasgotra, you're up.
not_available Silas is our snowmobile versus brick wall.
not_available Post op day one She's so cute, isn't she? Day one from laparotomy 
not_available With her little accent.
not_available Hemoglobin's stable, slept well.
not_available Got a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available No infiltrates.
not_available Mild atelectasis bilaterally.
not_available Okay.
not_available That means areas of collapsed alveoli.
not_available We know what atelectasis is.
not_available It's probably nothing, but I can repeat the film this afternoon.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, what's the definition of a doubleblind study? 
not_available Two ortho docs looking at a chest film.
not_available Zing.
not_available Don't pretend that's not funny.
not_available You taught me that joke.
not_available Oh, my God, I love this girl.
not_available He was collecting samples from the lake for a science project.
not_available Something about algae in winter.
not_available Core temp's 74.3.
not_available More suction, please.
not_available Then that man just appears out of nowhere again.
not_available Tube.
not_available He's been to the store, trying to talk to me while I work.
not_available I thought he was just some lonely old guy.
not_available And yesterday, I saw him outside of my house.
not_available Then when he saw me looking, he just walked away.
not_available And then today at the lake I went there to tell him to stay away.
not_available I told him I was gonna call the police.
not_available Gabriel must have slipped in while my back was turned.
not_available I have no idea how long he was there before I realized.
not_available That man jumped in after him? He said, "Call 911," and then he just jumped.
not_available Sam, call Respiratory for a vent and set up for bilateral chest tubes.
not_available Have Central bring in a circulating
not_available water blanket.
not_available He'll do better with a Bair Hugger.
not_available Both work.
not_available Bair Hugger's better.
not_available Show me the data.
not_available You kids work it out.
not_available You guys all right in here? Yeah, his core temp's up to 94, but his EKG shows ischemic changes.
not_available Could have been caused by the strain of the cold swim.
not_available Hey.
not_available These flattened T waves.
not_available I've had those for years.
not_available It's definitely not an MI.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available Retired six years, but I can still read an EKG.
not_available Okay, well, let us check your troponins just in case.
not_available Yeah, just knock yourself out.
not_available Where'd you practice? Stateville, 12 years.
not_available Stateville Penitentiary? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Bet that was intense.
not_available You guys seem fine.
not_available I'm going back in with the kid.
not_available How is he? 
not_available I can't talk about his treatment.
not_available Of course.
not_available Hey.
not_available Fun rounding with you this morning.
not_available Hi, Archie.
not_available Want some advice? 
not_available No.
not_available You need to work on your style.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Yeah, you're too serious.
not_available Have fun, take some joy in your work.
not_available I'm fun.
not_available You're English.
not_available I get it.
not_available It's hard to let your hair down.
not_available You are in America now.
not_available You know, I don't know what you're basing this on since You know how hard it was to find a jersey that small? Hockey? 
not_available See? I'm fun.
not_available We're gonna finish then head to the rink.
not_available Oh, Neela, this is so hot.
not_available Can you do a triple axel? 
not_available Dude, that's figure skating.
not_available Oh.
not_available You friends with that guy? Sort of.
not_available Oh, tell the truth.
not_available We slept together.
not_available She gave me a rash.
not_available Hey, I'm sorry about the last few days.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available I've been working 11 a.
not_available m.
not_available To 11 p.
not_available m., which is like falling off the planet.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I've been slammed too.
not_available I'm leading a seminar at the CAHC tomorrow and I'm way behind.
not_available What's CAHC? Complementary Alternative Health Conference.
not_available I told you all about it.
not_available You didn't.
not_available You may have been in a post
not_available coital stupor.
not_available But I am presenting data on the effects of prayer on healing.
not_available They actually have data on that? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Several studies have shown that patients who have people praying for them get well faster than those who don't.
not_available Ooh.
not_available Spooky.
not_available Shut up, the results are cool.
not_available When you get a minute, I got a guy for you in Trauma.
not_available No, no, not another consult.
not_available I have to get this talk together or I'm screwed.
not_available He saved a kid from drowning in a lake.
not_available The kid's not doing so well and he's freaked out.
not_available Come on, now.
not_available Okay.
not_available I have a baby
not_available naming ceremony in the NICU and then I am meeting with a statistician to go over the slides for the talk.
not_available I'll come back after that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Chest x
not_available ray on Robert Truman.
not_available Good.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available Ugly, right? 
not_available Yeesh.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Old lake guy.
not_available Order a chest CT and I'll get an official read on that.
not_available Tell me you don't need a radiologist to see this film is abnormal.
not_available Diffuse lung nodules, I know.
not_available Lung mets.
not_available I called you to get your take on the differential before I go in there and tell the man he has metastatic cancer.
not_available Couldn't it be miliary TB or cocci or sarcoid or something? Yeah, but in a 68year
not_available old guy, odds are it's gonna be mets.
not_available Great.
not_available So anything else? Guess not.
not_available Thanks for the consult.
not_available Dr.
not_available Truman.
not_available Robert, please.
not_available In your days as a prison doc, did you ever get tested positive for TB? No, I had the PPD every four months.
not_available Any coughing, fevers, night sweats? Huh.
not_available The chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Metastatic prostate cancer.
not_available It spread to my lungs and my bones before I even knew I had it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Well, I guess it's my retribution.
not_available Excuse me? When men try to do God's work, bad things happen.
not_available I wish I'd realized this before I killed that boy's father.
not_available Another run of v
not_available tach.
not_available Two hundred of bretylium and start an infusion.
not_available Core temp's down to 71.
not_available He's getting colder? Cold blood in his extremities rushes up to his heart and drops the core temp.
not_available Your Bair Hugger worked a little too well.
not_available His heart can't beat normally at this temperature.
not_available Sam, call the ECMO tech.
not_available Don't you think that's jumping the gun? What about peritoneal lavage? What's ECMO? 
not_available Cardiac bypass.
not_available It's the only thing that's gonna warm the core.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available His temperature is 71.
not_available He's having runs of v
not_available tach.
not_available We're there.
not_available Bleeding, infection He knows the risks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But I'm with Sam.
not_available Gabriel's got a pulse and a decent BP.
not_available Exhaust all options before jumping to ECMO.
not_available I'll get the stuff.
not_available Put a tube in belly and flush warm fluids to see if we can raise his core temp.
not_available Hey, Sam, what's with you today? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Then why do you have to plan B me? 
not_available Plan B you? Whatever I say, you have a better idea.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Yeah, Sam, it is true.
not_available Bair Hugger versus water blanket.
not_available Morphine versus fentanyl.
not_available Okay, come on, you sound crazy.
not_available Whatever I want, you give me that look.
not_available What look? 
not_available That look, that one, right there.
not_available I don't accept orders from "someone " because they come from a doctor or a man.
not_available I've been doing this a lot longer than you have.
not_available If you don't like that, it's too bad.
not_available Back at Stateville, my job was to give lethal injections to death
not_available row inmates.
not_available Wow, that's heavy.
not_available Yes.
not_available People could watch through a window.
not_available And I remember I remember her.
not_available Trying to be brave for the baby as I injected the thiopental the Pavulon potassium.
not_available Gabriel was only 2.
not_available He never knew his dad.
not_available Dr.
not_available Truman, you don't really have to talk about this.
not_available No.
not_available Back then, I thought it was the right thing.
not_available I thought there were criminals who deserved to die and lethal injection was the most humane way.
not_available As time went on, my thinking's changed.
not_available About the death penalty? Who lives and dies should be decided by God, not a jury.
not_available I've spent the last five "years " tracking the loved ones of the men I've killed.
not_available Trying to make amends with those families.
not_available And how do you make amends? Financial aid, mostly.
not_available It's all I have to offer.
not_available I paid a mortgage, bought a car, sent a child to college.
not_available Some people told me to get lost.
not_available Others took what I could offer.
not_available Well, that's really brave.
not_available And generous.
not_available No.
not_available They're all acts of contrition.
not_available Small things.
not_available Nothing will ever bring back a husband or a son, father.
not_available Saving a kid's life isn't a small thing.
not_available I'm just trying to tell God how sorry I am for what I've done.
not_available Please.
not_available I need that boy to live.
not_available Tell that freak to stop staring at me.
not_available Not many people would jump in a frozen lake for a stranger.
not_available He's not a stranger, he's a stalker.
not_available V
not_available tach, lost the pulse.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What's happening? His heart has stopped beating effectively.
not_available We can't shock it back until he's warmer.
not_available This looks like the right room.
not_available Who called for ECMO? The conservative route wouldn't work so I gave Teddy the heads
not_available up.
not_available Put him on.
not_available This is a cardiopulmonary bypass machine.
not_available It will function as Gabriel's heart and lungs.
not_available Sam, you should've listened to me.
not_available Well, let's hope it works.
not_available Celia, do you have any family we need to call? Or Gabriel's dad? 
not_available His dad's been dead a couple years.
not_available How about your family? Father's out of the picture.
not_available Haven't talked to my mother.
not_available Anspaugh's on his way to cannulate.
not_available Do it here.
not_available Surgery has to.
not_available It's protocol.
not_available Chief is coming for a central line? They're a little short
not_available staffed today.
not_available All up at a big conference or something.
not_available Yeah, let's do this, let's go.
not_available Rasgotra, isn't this fun? Uh, especially the part where I get to see my Attending in his jock strap.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available I'm streaking to the blue line in the dump and chase.
not_available What do you do? 
not_available Head to the far corner, dump in the net.
not_available That is exactly right.
not_available Okay, everybody, listen up.
not_available Smart, aggressive, no mercy.
not_available Smart, aggressive, no mercy.
not_available Smart, aggressive, no mercy.
not_available Smart Machine is doing the work for his heart and lungs.
not_available We're gonna take out the breathing tube.
not_available I see.
not_available When his temp's up, his own heart will kick back in.
not_available Well, that's the hope.
not_available What do you mean, that's the hope? Well, I'm sure Dr.
not_available Gates has explained that Gabriel's "tissues " may be permanently damaged because of the cold.
not_available I explained that, but we're trying to think positive here.
not_available Right.
not_available Look, we all hope this brings him back, but he's been down for a long time.
not_available Did over an hour of CPR.
not_available Celia, call someone.
not_available A friend, family, it doesn't matter.
not_available You just need some support.
not_available You don't know what I need.
not_available I'm a single mom.
not_available I know asking for help feels like cheating sometimes.
not_available Jimmy, Gabriel's "dad " he was one of those guys who couldn't stay out of trouble.
not_available Running drugs, stealing cars.
not_available I was an idiot.
not_available I thought he'd change.
not_available That's human.
not_available And I told my mom Jimmy and I were gonna raise the baby together and she kicked me out of the house.
not_available She said, "You may be "lost " but I am not gonna have a guy like that around the rest of my kids.
not_available " Looking back, she was probably right.
not_available Celia, there's a very good chance that Gabriel's heart won't start up again.
not_available No, please, please don't say that.
not_available This is gonna work.
not_available Guys, I need another liter of NS and an ABG kit.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available And check an ionized calcium while you're at it.
not_available The last one was low.
not_available That's my mom.
not_available Could you call her? Right away.
not_available Yeah! Game on.
not_available Who are we playing? 
not_available Pedes, I think.
not_available I saw the pathologists practicing in the parking lot.
not_available And now, the starting lineup of County General's very own.
not_available Unstoppable, irrepressible, the Mighty Docs.
not_available Playing right wing, Lucien Dubenko.
not_available They are such drama queens.
not_available We're playing the trauma surgeons? Beat them in the last five seconds of the finals last year.
not_available Left wing, Dusty Crenshaw.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available On defense, Harold Zelinsky.
not_available Playing 
center 
not_available Archie Morris.
not_available Oh, no way.
not_available Way.
not_available Oh, this explains everything.
not_available Weird behavior, the program Ruse to play on this team and kick your ass.
not_available He's a ringer.
not_available Yeah, baby, huh? I had a 26year
not_available old kid on the table, convicted of killing a cop.
not_available I could see his family, pleading, praying.
not_available I injected the drugs and he didn't die.
not_available He lay there, awake, quivering.
not_available Lethal doses of three different agents and he was still alive.
not_available Parents were crying, claiming a miracle.
not_available What happened? 
not_available The IV infiltrated.
not_available The drugs pooled in his soft tissues instead of going into his bloodstream.
not_available So I placed another IV, drew up another round of meds and pushed.
not_available And this time it took him 90 seconds to die.
not_available Seven months later, a police officer came forward.
not_available The boy was framed for the murder.
not_available Hm? He didn't do it.
not_available You couldn't have known that.
not_available God tried to stop me from killing an innocent man and I ignored the sign.
not_available How can I even hope for forgiveness? I think sometimes it's easier to feel guilty than forgiven.
not_available Which means what? That maybe your guilt over these deaths has become your reason for living.
not_available Maybe you need a new reason to go on.
not_available I don't want to go on.
not_available Can't you see I'm old? I have cancer.
not_available I've had enough.
not_available The only thing that is holding me back is that I am afraid.
not_available I'm afraid of what comes next.
not_available And what do you think that is? Oh, you tell me.
not_available Is atonement even possible? What does God want from me? I think it's up to each one of us to interpret what God wants.
not_available So people can do anything? They can rape, murder, steal, all in the name of God and it's okay? 
not_available No, that's not what I'm saying.
not_available What are you saying? Because all I'm hearing is some newage, Godislove, onesizefits
not_available all crap.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Truman 
not_available No, I don't have time for this now.
not_available Greg, it's okay.
not_available Look, I understand 
not_available No, you don't understand.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available How could you possibly say that? Now, you listen to me.
not_available I want a real chaplain who believes in a real God and a real hell.
not_available You're frustrated, but you need to ask yourself No, I don't need to ask myself.
not_available I need answers.
not_available And all your questions and your uncertainty are only making things worse.
not_available I know you're upset.
not_available God.
not_available I need someone who will look me in the eye and tell me how to find forgiveness because I am running out of time.
not_available I'm trying to help.
not_available Well, don't.
not_available Just get out.
not_available Get out! Get out! Hey, Julia.
not_available Julia, come on.
not_available Listen, come on.
not_available Come on, the guy's just freaking out.
not_available He didn't mean what he said.
not_available Yeah, he did.
not_available He absolutely did.
not_available Okay, don't choke, Neela.
not_available Don't cough it up.
not_available It would be real embarrassing if you lost that puck to me.
not_available Neela.
not_available Yes.
not_available Stay down.
not_available Yes! Get up! Oh, let's see.
not_available Your eye, crap.
not_available Concentration, crap.
not_available Coordination, crap.
not_available How do we let this girl operate? Hit me.
not_available Come on, hit me.
not_available You know you wanna.
not_available I don't.
not_available Come on, hit me.
not_available Lucien.
not_available Everybody wants to take a shot at their mentor, don't they? Ha! Come on, Neela.
not_available Untie the piano, you'll skate faster, huh? Ah! Oh, no.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Neela, you're dead.
not_available Whoo! Hey, Gates, hold on.
not_available Have you seen Julia around? 
not_available No, not since this morning.
not_available She's not answering her pager.
not_available She usually turns it off when she's with patients.
not_available This guy in 1, it's a mess.
not_available Do you have any questions for us, Mrs.
not_available Davies? No, Celia explained it all.
not_available She always had a head for science.
not_available Gabriel does too.
not_available He wants to be a marine biologist.
not_available ACT is 224.
not_available Let's keep the heparin where it's at.
not_available You sure you wanna do that? Never mind.
not_available What are you doing here? I wanted to let you know 
not_available You can't be here.
not_available Please, I want to say Get out.
not_available Please, just go.
not_available Maybe you should just go back to bed.
not_available Hold on, Sam, hold on.
not_available Look, ma'am, he tried to save your son's life.
not_available Just give him a chance to say what he came to say.
not_available And afterwards you'll give this family their privacy, right? Yes.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
not_available I'm praying for your boy.
not_available Sir, thank you for your bravery.
not_available I'm very grateful.
not_available So is my daughter.
not_available Right, Celia? Celia, tell him.
not_available Tell this man thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Like you mean it.
not_available I am not 3 years old anymore.
not_available I have to call work.
not_available That's That's all.
not_available Come on, let me get you back on the monitor.
not_available Lucien, five hole or top shelf? 
not_available I don't care, just make it count.
not_available We need a goalie here.
not_available Hey, you guys ever seen Neela drunk? You should have seen her at the ER Christmas party.
not_available She gave Anspaugh a lap dance.
not_available Woo
not_available hoo.
not_available Could have blocked that with a wad of toilet paper, Morris.
not_available I hear she still sleeps with a blankie.
not_available She calls it her nubbie.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? Whoa! 
not_available Nice.
not_available That's right.
not_available Your career as a goalie doesn't pan "out " you can go back to work at the Jumbo Mart.
not_available You guys know she used to work at the Jumbo Mart, right? Hey, Skye.
not_available Have you seen Julia around? 
not_available No.
not_available She had trouble with one of my patients and went AWOL.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Are you ready for this one? My guy in 1 gave a lethal injection to the father of your boy in 2.
not_available What? 
not_available He was a prison doctor.
not_available He used to push the drugs into the guys on death row.
not_available I guess he's had a change of heart.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey, Chaz, hey.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Hey, Celia.
not_available Everything all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it's just work, you know? I guess she wants a commitment, but I don't know.
not_available Maybe I'm not that kind of guy.
not_available So why don't you just tell her that? Bettina's great.
not_available It's not like I'm looking for something better.
not_available You been together for a while now.
not_available Yeah, nine months.
not_available Hm! That must be a record for you.
not_available I like her, all right? So that's not the issue.
not_available Well, why don't you just give it a try and see what happens? It's easy for you to say.
not_available You're 20 years old and still playing the field.
not_available Greg, I've been with the same guy for almost a year now.
not_available Really? Why didn't you tell me that before? 
not_available You never asked.
not_available All right, well, I should take these.
not_available Cool, thanks for the coffee.
not_available Oh, anytime.
not_available Hey, what's his name? 
not_available Andrew.
not_available Well, I'd like to meet him sometime.
not_available We can all go to a drag club or something.
not_available Ha! Just kidding, man.
not_available That'd be cool.
not_available What you got? Mass cas at the ice rink.
not_available Ortho versus Trauma.
not_available What? You.
not_available You were a complete goon out there.
not_available I hit you because you elbowed me.
not_available Headhunter.
not_available Octopus 
not_available Slasher.
not_available Can't we all just get along? Rasgotra, this isn't over.
not_available I saved your ass so many times out there.
not_available Well, maybe I wouldn't have to if you weren't such a goon.
not_available You should practice a little more.
not_available You've had plenty of practice swinging stick.
not_available Could you lay down? I don't recognize you standing up.
not_available Hey, get off of him, you wanker.
not_available The ECMO tech needs you in T
not_available 2 right away.
not_available That kid's awake.
not_available Cripes! What's going on? We see this after a few hours on the machine.
not_available They just wake up.
not_available Sat's okay on room air.
not_available Mommy? What happened? Oh, baby.
not_available Hi, baby, hi.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Attaboy, Gabriel.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available He's okay.
not_available He's gonna be okay.
not_available I know, baby.
not_available Core temp's up to 94.
not_available This family will never forget what you did here today.
not_available Just doing our job.
not_available Well, I don't care what you say.
not_available It's a miracle.
not_available What do you say we take this kid off the machine? Sounds good.
not_available Size 8 gloves okay? Looks like good news in there.
not_available This doesn't absolve you.
not_available Don't think it does.
not_available I don't forgive you.
not_available I will never forgive you.
not_available You have to live with what you've done.
not_available Julia.
not_available Well, the lake kid is doing great.
not_available But our guy He needs you in there.
not_available I can't.
not_available All right, well, I need you in there.
not_available He's asking me all kind of questions that I don't know how to answer.
not_available You know, doubt " it's" uncomfortable.
not_available But certainty " I" don't think it's real.
not_available I mean, I went to seminary.
not_available I studied Buddhism, I spent time at an ashram.
not_available Who really knows anything with absolute certainty? Not me, that's for sure.
not_available That's why I thought an inclusive approach to spirituality would work well in a place like this.
not_available It does.
not_available It does.
not_available The patients, they appreciate what you do.
not_available No, people in crisis want rules.
not_available They want structure.
not_available Something to lean on, I get that.
not_available But it's not me.
not_available You know, we all wonder what we're doing here sometimes.
not_available That guy needs help.
not_available So come on.
not_available Come back in there with me.
not_available Let's go talk to him.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available All right.
not_available Ramsey, did you trip over the blue line? Yeah, fell on me.
not_available Morris, hurt yourself doing a triple axel? 
not_available So who won? It was a mutual forfeit.
not_available Didn't know you had it in you, Mayday.
not_available Me neither.
not_available X
not_available ray's negative, home with splint.
not_available All right, who's next? Hey, Neela, how's your boo
not_available boo? It's my dominant hand.
not_available Lf I can't operate, you're dead.
not_available Wuss.
not_available You hack.
not_available Beyotch.
not_available Who are you yelling at, Harold? 
not_available I don't really know.
not_available No tenderness, bearing weight.
not_available Hey, how's my team? They need ibuprofen, a hot tub and a glass of wine.
not_available I like the way you think.
not_available Okay, listen up, everyone, fun's over.
not_available Orthopods are rounding on the hall in 10.
not_available Trauma to the ICU.
not_available What about me? There's an ingrown toenail in Exam 3 with your name on it.
not_available Sam.
not_available What's up, buddy, you sick of us down here? No, I like it.
not_available You like it? You're a weird kid.
not_available He likes the Jell
not_available O.
not_available Thanks again, doctor.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available You take care of your mom, okay? Sam, any beds open up? Well, I had to threaten the charge nurse with physical violence.
not_available But something opened up.
not_available All right, we're going to Ike Ryan's.
not_available You should come.
not_available Should I? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available As long as if I order you a beer, you don't change it to vodka gimlet.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I have to report upstairs.
not_available I gotta do stuff here.
not_available How often do we get an outcome like this? A pulseless ice cube turned into a JellO loving 11year
not_available old in the same shift.
not_available That doesn't happen every day.
not_available That's for sure.
not_available Well? 
not_available Well, I'll see if I can make it.
not_available I have sinned against heaven.
not_available And in your sight are no more worthy.
not_available Gracious God.
not_available My mortal sentence I accept.
not_available Stop.
not_available What the hell are you doing? 
not_available I am in hell.
not_available Do you understand? I am in hell already.
not_available I might as well go.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You saved a little boy's life.
not_available No, it is not enough.
not_available I can't change my destiny.
not_available There isn't time.
not_available Did it ever occur to you that your destiny was for you to be on that pier this morning? That maybe your life's path and all the choices that you made led you right there.
not_available Why? 
not_available So you could save that kid.
not_available Why? Why would God do that? Why would he have me kill 17 people to save one? You may not understand it but that little boy is alive because you were there.
not_available Now, whatever you need that to count for, it counts.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available It doesn't have to make sense.
not_available That's why it's called faith.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Hey, Sam, great job today.
not_available Thank you, you too.
not_available Hey, Gabriel all tucked in? Yes.
not_available The ICU nurses are fawning all over him.
not_available My turn to win some money.
not_available All right.
not_available So, what are you drinking? 
not_available Actually, I can't stay.
not_available So you came here to tell me that you can't come here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Really? Have you heard of the cell phone? You know what, you're right.
not_available It's dumb.
not_available I shouldn't have come.
not_available I wasn't thinking.
not_available Wow, she admits that she wasn't thinking.
not_available Alert the media.
not_available Screw you, Gates.
not_available Come on, stay here.
not_available Will you get her a beer, please? You got it.
not_available Vodka gimlet with a twist.
not_available Okay.
not_available Definitely the most insane shift I've worked since I started here.
not_available You said that exact same thing yesterday.
not_available I did not.
not_available So are you going to Ike's after this? No, I'm not much of a group person.
not_available I need my alone time at the end of the day.
not_available Is that why you're not married? No.
not_available Then why isn't a hot, smart woman such as yourself shacked up by now? And I'm not hitting on you.
not_available Just wondering if some people aren't cut out for commitment.
not_available Nobody's cut out for commitment.
not_available It fights our DNA.
not_available You don't believe in monogamy? 
not_available No, I believe in monogamy.
not_available I just don't believe in the concept of forever.
not_available People force the issue and then act surprised when it doesn't work out.
not_available You know, some people might say that your theory is a cover for a fear of commitment.
not_available Well, it takes a lot of courage to reject the widely embraced social construct of marriage.
not_available Most people assume you've got some kind of problem.
not_available Well, seems like you've got it all figured out.
not_available Some days.
not_available Night, Skye.
not_available Night.
not_available How'd you hurt your shoulder? Checked by Grossman after the face
not_available off.
not_available But I hurt him worse later.
not_available Ever seen bonobos at the zoo? What's a bonobo? Pygmy chimp.
not_available Famous in the primate world for their social
not_available sexual behavior.
not_available How fascinating.
not_available In bonobo communities sex is a way to say hello.
not_available Oh, really? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Hello.
not_available This is so awesome.
not_available I didn't know these were here.
not_available Hot tubs are for therapy during the day, but night? They belong to the hockey team.
not_available Lucien, Skye, how's the water? Hot, very hot.
not_available Guys, this job rocks.
not_available I'm not sure what the point of that would be other than to make him feel guilty on top of everything else.
not_available Uh, I gotta go.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's up? We need to talk.
not_available I'm sorry about this morning, okay? You had the right to be mad.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available Look This is all new to me, okay? I haven't been down this path before.
not_available But I really, really want this to work.
not_available Do you know if you stare at an x
not_available ray for more than 38 seconds you start to see things that aren't there? Because that's what's this is, Greg.
not_available We've stared at this thing too "long " and tricked ourselves into seeing something that isn't there.
not_available You're not listening, okay? I wanna do this.
not_available This morning, you seemed totally unsure.
not_available Who's sure about anything? This shouldn't have to be this hard.
not_available Eventually you know we would end up right back in the same place.
not_available And frankly, I don't have the time.
not_available Thank you for waiting with me.
not_available No problem.
not_available Oh.
not_available ECMO was a good call with that kid.
not_available We probably should have done it sooner.
not_available It's annoying but you were right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And, Sam, I do like working with you.
not_available Other than the relentless interrogation and secondguessing and you constantly blowing me off 
not_available Shut up.
not_available when I give you orders.
not_available I hate you.
not_available I hate you too.
