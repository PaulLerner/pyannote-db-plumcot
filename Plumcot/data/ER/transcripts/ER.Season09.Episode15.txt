not_available Well, at least it's not growing.
not_available Right? How long? Four minutes and 30 seconds.
not_available How long do you wait? Five minutes.

not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Mommy's here, Jared.
not_available Mommy's here.
not_available Oh, sweetie.
not_available I got you.
not_available Nothing? No change at all? Some cancers are more resistant than others.
not_available Then why would the oncologist put him through that? He said 20 percent.
not_available Well, if you would give me the appropriate IV antibiotics, and oxygen and whatever pain meds he needs to stay comfortable 
not_available I would like to take him home soon.
not_available My white count's up, Mom.
not_available I can beat the pneumonia.
not_available Sean.
not_available Think about how aggressively you wanna handle this.
not_available There's a possibility you'd be put on a breathing machine.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available And then what? More pain? More nausea, more infections, vomiting.
not_available I can take it.
not_available I know you can.
not_available You have been so brave and so strong.

not_available Toes.
not_available You took the big one.

not_available Not anymore? The Alzheimer's started affecting her speech a few months ago.
not_available But now she can only speak French.
not_available Her first language? I never bothered to learn.
not_available I never needed it.
not_available It means, " I would like a taste of melon.
not_available " It's the first full sentence I learned in high school and the only one I remember.
not_available We'll try and find a translator.
not_available Maxed out on atropine.
not_available Try another round of epi.
not_available What was that? 
not_available I may have broken a rib.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Okay, charge to 100.
not_available Were gonna have to shock him.
not_available Will he feel that? 
not_available You don't have to be in here.
not_available I'm not leaving him.
not_available Okay, clear.
not_available Heart rhythm.
not_available Got a weak pulse.
not_available Is he alive? 
not_available He has a pulse.
not_available Mix up some dopamine.

not_available No.
not_available No, he was not.
not_available He did not.
not_available He was in therapy.
not_available He was on his meds.
not_available You sure about that? 
not_available Yes, I'm sure about that.
not_available Did you watch and make sure he swallowed? 
not_available He was not suicidal, Abby.
not_available I saw him.
not_available Two weeks ago he came to see me, and I didn't get it then.
not_available But now, I understand what it was.
not_available He was at peace because he had a plan.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available He was doing well.
not_available Yes.
not_available He apologized to me.
not_available He even showed me a picture of the plane.
not_available Planes crash and people walk away.
not_available He came to say goodbye.
not_available People walk away, Abby! It was goodbye! Youre in the wrong place if you got a sore throat.
not_available I have a specimen.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Put it with the rest.
not_available I was told to wait while you did it.
not_available You see this body here? I got three more just like it before you.
not_available Okay.
not_available I guess I can leave it and come back later.
not_available Like I said, put it with the rest.
not_available Sounds like you'll need another specimen.
not_available Dr.

not_available What? 
not_available Oh, you know.
not_available You like kids.
not_available You like pregnant women.
not_available That's great.
not_available How about you just relax? I didn't expect you to be a mom, that's all.
not_available I'm not a mom.
not_available I had a baby, that's all.
not_available Hey, I feel for you.
not_available But we all made mistakes when we were young.

not_available With bubbles.
not_available I don't want Sean to suffer anymore.
not_available I know it's grim right now but he seems pretty determined.
not_available Can you tell me something different than all the oncologists? Every specialist? Because if you can tell me that he has a chance And it's Sean's decision.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available He didn't even wanna do the second round of chemo.
not_available But he did it for me.
not_available I made him.
not_available Do you have any idea what it's like to watch someone you love suffer like that just because he loves you? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Simmons
not_available He went through hell to get to the point where he and I finally accepted that he was going to die.
not_available And then he met you.
not_available He likes you.
not_available As a doctor and as a woman.
not_available And without meaning to or not, you' re giving him false hope.
not_available I just want Sean to come home.
not_available He'll listen to you if you tell him that's what's best.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kroll.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available But your son has suffered a severe head injury.

not_available I didn't I didn't see him, Michael.
not_available I didn't see him.
not_available Okay.
not_available There must be some kind of hope.
not_available I know that you need to believe that, but you have to understand your son is gone.
not_available He died.
not_available Multifocal PVCs on lidocaine.
not_available What does that mean? He'll soon fall back into cardiac arrest.
not_available And we might be able to stop that temporarily but not indefinitely.
not_available I need to see him again.
not_available Can I see him? 
not_available Of course.
not_available I don't know how you work here.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't
not_available Abby, don't say anything.
not_available I thought I could control him.
not_available I thought I was.
not_available Maybe I was blind or stupid or refused to see the signs.
not_available Or maybe I'm just nuts.
not_available But I'm not ready to bury him.
not_available Last time I saw my son, he was alive, and that's my reality.
not_available Until someone proves otherwise, he is alive.

not_available It's not a cure.
not_available My mom wants you to talk me into going home with her, doesn't she? What would you do? I can't answer that.
not_available I don't wanna die.
not_available Then you should fight.
not_available With everything you have.
