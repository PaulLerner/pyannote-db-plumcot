not_available I'm sure it will though.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis? Yeah? Could you order a Social Services consult on Megan Nesbitt? Kovac's patient? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We just disagree on how to handle it.
not_available Oh, are you guys fighting? Lack of money, sex, communication? 
not_available The last one.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's a lot of that going around.
not_available Where is he? Who? Luka! 
not_available What are you doing? My job.
not_available Come here.
not_available Sam thinks that Megan Nesbitt needs a Social Services consult.
not_available Went over my head? You totally blew me off.
not_available Okay, despite working here This is a workplace.
not_available It's an emergency room, my emergency room.
not_available If you're having trouble, see a therapist.
not_available If you can't, work separate shifts.
not_available Does that make sense? 
not_available Yep.
not_available And as far as a consult goes, just call them because the parents will probably get here before they do anyway.
not_available I took the clavicle fracture out of a figureof
not_available eight.
not_available All your fault by the way.
not_available What? Morris.
not_available If you'd taken the job, we wouldn't be living this.
not_available First day and already a mutiny? I'm ready to keelhaul him.
not_available I'll try back.
not_available MRSA abscess.
not_available Allergic to sulfa.
not_available Clindamycin.
not_available Two 
words voice mail.
not_available What's all that? Friends of mine bugging me to go out and party after a long 12
not_available hour shift.
not_available That's the problem with non
not_available medical.
not_available They don't get it.
not_available Dodged the admission of Eugene Bradley, foot pain.
not_available Party at Ike's tonight.
not_available Boss man is buying.
not_available Who's onboard? 
not_available Half the time medical types don't get it.
not_available Ray? 
not_available Other plans.
not_available Neela? 
not_available The Apprentice is on.
not_available Pratt? 
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Happy tenure to you Happy tenure to you 
not_available Don't I get a cake? Happy tenure, Dr.
not_available Carter Happy tenure to you Thank you.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available They said my wife was in a fire? It's just down here.
not_available She responded very well to the cyanide antidote.
not_available Her blood pressure and pulse normalized.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available A piece of shrapnel from the blast may have perforated her bowel.
not_available She's gonna need surgery, maybe a colostomy.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Which hopefully will be temporary.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I'm sorry? 
not_available How this happened.
not_available From what I was told, there was an explosion
not_available We're going over here.
not_available Followed by a fire.
not_available We live in Tinley Park.
not_available Why was she at some apartment in the city? I don't know.
not_available She told me she had a dance class.
not_available Have a seat right here.
not_available I know she's alone a lot.
not_available It's my job.
not_available We fight about it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, listen.
not_available Let me see if I canCan I talk to her? You probably wouldn't be able to
not_available Can you tell her something? Yeah.
not_available Tell her that I'm here.
not_available Susan.
not_available How long have you been standing there? Not long.
not_available Sorry I'm early.
not_available You wanted to talk later.
not_available Oh, sit down.
not_available No point in rushing to tell me I didn't get tenure.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've just been incredibly busy.
not_available You wanna at least tell me why? There were a number of factors.
not_available Significant budget cuts, your lack of published materials The criteria are complicated.
not_available How about I simplify it? I've been an Attending for seven years.
not_available Two more than Carter.
not_available I've been an outstanding doctor a dedicated teacher and a committed chief.
not_available No one's refuting your abilities as a clinician or a teacher.
not_available And you do an excellent job running the department.
not_available Which is where you want me to stay until you replace me.
not_available I don't follow.
not_available The ER runs smoothly.
not_available One less thing for you to worry about.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available Because if I was tenured, I might work less shifts in favor of doing research and you might actually give a damn about the first floor of this hospital.
not_available Did you honestly think your interest in an academic track would be taken seriously? What? That you could wait until your seventh year to start aggressively pursuing grants? 
not_available I've brought in some grants.
not_available $75,000.
not_available By now you should've hit at least a million.
not_available The university depends on grants to cover your salary.
not_available That's not only unacceptable for a physician seeking tenure that's embarrassing.
not_available So forget excellence, forget performance just write a check to build a new wing.
not_available This hospital is in the business of staying open.
not_available We have to make our choices accordingly.
not_available Finger dislocation's at X
not_available ray.
not_available And shrimp allergy needs a recheck after sub
not_available Q epi.
not_available So why tell me? If I don't leave now, my band can't make its Evanston gig.
not_available And that's my problem how exactly? Neela, I dispo'd ten patients in the last hour.
not_available You get to pop a finger back in place.
not_available Please? 
not_available Fine.
not_available But you're cleaning the bathroom.
not_available All right, deal.
not_available With actual cleaning products.
not_available Banker's hours now, Ray? 
not_available I'm like an ATM, babe.
not_available Do business 24/7.
not_available There we go.
not_available Oh, taxi! Hey! Hey, taxi! Damn it.
not_available Eugene? What are you doing? Hey, you need el fare? There we go.
not_available Well, it's getting pretty late.
not_available Your mom's gonna worry.
not_available She's still at work.
not_available Eugene, you need to go home now.
not_available We are not going to admit you.
not_available They're not gonna give you any more drugs.
not_available You need to go home now.
not_available Man, I ain't going back.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why not? He'd be there.
not_available Who? 
not_available Her boyfriend.
not_available Your mom's.
not_available Okay, so the two of you don't get along? He just does stuff.
not_available Stuff like what? I just need to get some Dilantin.
not_available Where is? Whoa, did somebody alphabetize these? Yeah, believe it or not.
not_available Why don't you just say it? Say what? 
not_available You're mad.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Right.
not_available It didn't bother you one bit that I went over your head.
not_available See, that's what I'm talking about.
not_available What? You won't tell me how you feel.
not_available Because it's fine.
not_available It's not fine, Luka.
not_available If it were fine, you wouldn't have avoided touching me just now.
not_available What? You
not_available You bury your feelings you pretend that they're not there.
not_available I have feelings.
not_available But I don't need to share them.
not_available And I don't need to share them here, okay? Sorry to interrupt, but Megan says she's in a lot of pain.
not_available Give her another four of morphine.
not_available Bye.
not_available Just try four of Zofran.
not_available How's your cake? 
not_available It's good.
not_available It was unexpected.
not_available They should've waited.
not_available Could've had a cake for both of us.
not_available Snack cake? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I didn't get tenure.
not_available What? Wait.
not_available Susan, who got the slots if you didn't get it? Slot, single.
not_available Well, that'd be you.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Yeah, they gave me the usual drivel about budget cuts and No, no, no.
not_available They've always had more than one tenure slot.
not_available Well, till now.
not_available Too bad it was the year you applied.
not_available What do you mean by that? Just that
not_available Nothing.
not_available No, what do you mean? I didn't earn it? My funding of the outpatient clinic got me tenure? 
not_available Don't put words in my mouth.
not_available Worked my ass off.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Brought grants, published, taught.
not_available I never asked for this.
not_available You never wanted it, Carter.
not_available You never did.
not_available This is my home.
not_available This is where I started.
not_available This is where I want to stay.
not_available And I get the feeling that half the time, you would rather be anywhere but here.
not_available Yeah, I thought so.
not_available Iron Chef in 3 needs a non
not_available occlusive dressing, then he can go.
not_available How about you? You gonna go? 
not_available You don't give up, do you? Car's outside.
not_available Give me trouble, you ride in the trunk.
not_available All right, give me two minutes.
not_available Don't try sneaking out the back.
not_available Jerry, what's open? I thought you'd be covering "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Anything in Exam Two? 
not_available We got one free bed.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Admitting him.
not_available I can see that.
not_available The question is why? Chuny? Yeah? Can you get Eugene settled in? 
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available You wanna come with me? He was raped.
not_available This'll make you feel better.
not_available I know her.
not_available She lives in my building.
not_available Her burns are minor.
not_available She's gonna be okay, like you.
not_available She used to bring food to the guy next door.
not_available He was weird.
not_available Had all this stuff stacked up.
not_available He's probably dead, isn't he? Your neighbor? I don't know.
not_available I was the one who called 911.
not_available Smart girl.
not_available They didn't come as quick as I thought they would.
not_available I thought if I called them before I did it I tried to put it out but it got too big.
not_available Honey, are you okay? Mommy.
not_available Mommy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available It'll be okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now, how do you get an Irishman up on the roof, huh? You tell him the drinks are on the house.
not_available There's a man from Kerry, comes into the bar with a pig under his arm.
not_available The bartender says 
not_available There you go.
not_available Thanks, lady.
not_available Hey.

not_available Who's the holdout? 
not_available Aunt Cecelia.

not_available Tell them I'll be right there.
not_available Yes.
not_available No, I realize that.
not_available Ray.
not_available But no, no.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Yeah? Yes? You dispo patients faster than a speeding bullet and not in a good way.
not_available Now that we're slammed, you dump a drug seeker on the next shift so you can get to your next gig? 
not_available I tried to warn him.
not_available It's more complicated.
not_available Know what? You wanna be a rock star, go for it.
not_available But play weddings and bar mitzvahs to make ends meet.
not_available Because medicine is not a hobby or another way to pay the bills.
not_available Or plan B in case you don't sell a million records.
not_available It's what you wanna do or not.
not_available Didn't mean for the fire to get so big.
not_available She just wanted the firemen to come.
not_available Pretty desperate for her parents' attention.
not_available I think she felt shut out, you know? Now she has to live with even more pain.
not_available Three people dead, more wounded.
not_available Social worker said she's gonna go to juvie.
not_available Twelve years old.
not_available Sad.
