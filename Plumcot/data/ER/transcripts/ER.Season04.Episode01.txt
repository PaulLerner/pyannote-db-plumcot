not_available You can relax and speak naturally.
not_available Carter wasn't acting.
not_available He's really like that.
not_available They're focusing on Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available But their goal is to get a sense
not_available Kerry, nice do.
not_available and portray it in a positive light.
not_available It says nothing about "positive light.
not_available " It only talks about their rights to use my name and image.
not_available Why not take this in the lounge? Anspaugh and Morgenstern think this will increase public awareness of the health care issues we face
not_available I understand.
not_available Sorry, what's your name? 
not_available Luis.
not_available Luis.
not_available I'm not saying you're here to ambush us or do an exposé but there's nothing to stop them.

not_available It's cheap.
not_available Hi.
not_available My husband and I are the directors.

not_available Think he's up to it? Yeah, sure.
not_available Why not? Cameras all over, it makes me uptight.
not_available I know.
not_available We'll all be hiding out here.
not_available Mark seems a little shaky right now.
not_available Oh, he's gonna be fine.
not_available I'd be shaky if I had the crap beaten out of me.
not_available He wanted to do this.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available Maybe he's back on his game.
not_available Maybe.
not_available They're here.
not_available They're shooting.
not_available There's nothing we can do except stick up for Mark.
not_available Standing by him.
not_available You look like a star out there.

not_available Do you smoke? 
not_available Not cigarettes.
not_available He recently took up cigars.
not_available I don't inhale.
not_available I started a cardiac workup, ordered a CBC, Chem7, cardiac enzymesThat's a little gung
not_available ho for a guy who ate too many burritos.
not_available He was concerned enough to come in.
not_available That's no reason to order a million tests.
not_available You can lie back now.
not_available You know where I can get ahold of any Havanas? My taste is a little more pedestrian.
not_available I'm happy with one of these.
not_available No wonder you're short of breath.
not_available Seriously? You think it's the cigars? Those aren't fit to be called cigars.
not_available Lay off the cheapos for a few days and I think you're gonna feel fine.
not_available Give up the stogies? 
not_available At least get something decent.
not_available You think this'll be in the movie? I just dropped by to thank you again and see how things are going.

not_available The best one was the guy with the transistor radio.
not_available He said he slipped in the shower and he sat down.
not_available Ouch! While it was still playing? "Oops! There it is! " I asked Mark
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, if he was going to extract the foreign body.
not_available He said, "No.
not_available But I think I'll tune it to the ball game.
not_available " I got a head lac for Carter.
not_available Has anybody seen him? Seems like there's a camaraderie between doctors and nurses.
not_available What about dating? 
not_available Who, Mark? You tell me.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I
not_available I'll get that.
not_available Actually, we do socialize, but more as a group.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene comesWell, he used to come
not_available He's been taking it slow.
not_available Since he got beat down.
not_available I mean, beat up.
not_available You know about that, right? It's a myth about doctors and nurses dating so much.
not_available More nurses date cops, firemen, paramedics.
not_available Now, that cliché is true.
not_available Especially cops.
not_available Especially young cops.
not_available Getting back to Dr.
not_available Greene
not_available I need a nurse in 3.
not_available Okay.
not_available Everybody, that was great.

not_available Stay with them.
not_available They're miked.

not_available I'll tell you later if you bring the cuffs.
not_available I was gonna get some sleep tonight.
not_available Don't count on that.
not_available Look at him.
not_available I bet he wishes he could read lips.
not_available Hi there, dumb
not_available ass! Doug, he's waving.
not_available You got a mike on? Do you think he could hear me? Turn it off.
not_available But that's the thing about the ER.
not_available You got to stay on your toes.
not_available Lily's looking for you.
not_available On my way.
not_available You're also more on your own.
not_available When I was up in Surgery there was someone looking over my shoulder, critiquing every move.
not_available Here the residents are responsible
not_available Carter, help me! I can't get him rolled.

not_available Stick around for one more test.
not_available Troponin T.
not_available It's just for clarification.
not_available We can do it on the blood we've drawn.
not_available Better safe than sorry.
not_available While you're waiting we're gonna stick you back on a monitor.
not_available An elevated CK
not_available MB indicates heart muscle damage.
not_available A heart attack? 
not_available Right.
not_available I'll get another EKG.
not_available Can it mean something else? It's probably an Ml.
not_available The other tests will confirm.
not_available And then what? Well, regardless of the other results an elevated CK
not_available MB means he's had an Ml.
not_available I'm just giving him a little time to adjust to that possibility.
not_available And, of course, since I missed it I'm buying some time to cover my ass.
not_available A 37year
not_available old man in respiratory distress! He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer six months ago.

not_available Stand back, sir, please! Suction these secretions.
not_available Hang two liters of saline.
not_available Pulse ox is 89.
not_available Should I intubate? With this mass, we'd have to crike him.
not_available I don't want to use extraordinary measures if he has a DNR.
not_available Do you know anything about his wishes? He's the best bass player ever.
not_available You can't light that in here.
not_available Chuny, keep suctioning.
not_available Grab blood gas.

not_available Crike tray! Do it! Do it! No, no.
not_available You do not want to know.
not_available I wouldn't ask if I didn't.
not_available I have done this too long not to know.
not_available This job, people don't wanna hear about.
not_available Why? Because of what you clean up? This is nothing.
not_available Believe me, this here is just a little picnic.
not_available You ought to see what some of them do.
not_available A body is only so big.
not_available You couldn't hardly believe all that comes out if it.
not_available You get used to it, though.
not_available Like every mama and daddy gets used to changing a baby's diaper.
not_available But the blood and the gore You know what the gore is, right? That's the part you don't talk about when you go home and they ask you how your day was.
not_available No, no.
not_available It doesn't bother me.
not_available You see, I'm a religious person.
not_available And I believe human beings were created in God's image.
not_available So whatever I'm cleaning up must be just fine.
not_available You believe? I don't know.
not_available You mean, believe in God? You couldn't do my job if you didn't.
not_available You could maybe be a doctor or a nurse or make a movie.

not_available I'll tell you something else
not_available We need you.
not_available This guy stopped breathing.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available I'll catch you later.

not_available But there was this one girl my first year.
not_available I got used to this as a county facility.
not_available I treated a lot of homeless people, people from the projects.
not_available One day this girl came in, traffic accident in a coma, brain dead.
not_available And I realized I knew her.
not_available She was the sister of a guy I had gone to med school with.
not_available One night, she tried to show me how to slam dance, just fooling around.
not_available I realized that trauma isn't something that happens to other people.
not_available It could happen to you.
not_available That's right.
not_available Does it change things when it is you? 
not_available What do you mean? When you yourself are traumatized as a doctor You have a splint on your wrist.
not_available I heard that you had an incident recentlyIs that what you' re doing here? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't agree
not_available Everybody worries about safety.

not_available Are you sure you wanna speak to the wife? She's young.
not_available It may be difficult to get her to understand the situation.
not_available No, I'd like to try.
not_available Normally, we wouldn't have an intern take this on.
not_available But Carter's been around.
not_available Technically, I'm not an intern.
not_available I'm second
not_available year.
not_available No, you're an intern.
not_available I am? You can't switch your specialty 
not_available without starting over.
not_available I've done a year.
not_available In Surgery.
not_available This is Emergency Medicine.
not_available I thought you understood.
not_available We'll discuss this later when we're not in the middle of all this.
not_available Where do you start? When you have to counsel family about something like this? It's tricky.
not_available People are hearing a lot of complex information.
not_available An Emergency resident, or intern, has to establish a rapport with
not_available Excuse me, doctor.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available I was just coming in to see you.

not_available For all the good it did.
not_available A feeding tube can be inserted
not_available The cancer eats right through it.
not_available There's an option, the Jtube
not_available We're not screwing around with that.
not_available The sucker's on his aorta.
not_available He's dead.

not_available It's a "Do Not Resuscitate" order
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got it.
not_available There was one by his bed, but Rog sort of freaked.
not_available I'm sorry.

not_available Let's rule out intra
not_available abdominal bleeding.
not_available Let's set up.
not_available Let's get a lap! Move! What else should we order, Dr.
not_available Del Amico? High
not_available dose steroids.
not_available And why? Improves motor function and sensation after spinal cord injuries.
not_available Spinal cord?! Wait.
not_available Would somebody shut that guy up?! 
not_available We're trying to assess your injuries.
not_available How much do you weigh? Call me Theo, all right? I'm 165.
not_available It's negative.
not_available I'm gonna go check on the kid.
not_available All right.
not_available Start dopamine at 10 mcgs.
not_available We're out of the woods.
not_available Theo, we need to check your motor responses.
not_available Okay, Dr.
not_available Del Amico? Sir, can you squeeze my hand? What's wrong with me? Can you shrug your shoulders, please? We wanna talk to him.
not_available See if he's okay.
not_available Chairs.
not_available You have to sit in Chairs.
not_available It ain't got nothing to do with you.
not_available They tailgated me all the way here.
not_available Where's Chico, huh? I'll go see if your friend's okay.
not_available Just wait here, okay? Is my brother gonna be okay? 
not_available Mannitol, 75 grams.
not_available Blown left pupil.
not_available He's hyperventilating.
not_available Intracranial hemorrhage.
not_available Call for a stat head CT.
not_available Decorticate posturing.
not_available GCS, 8.
not_available It was 12 in the field.
not_available Randi's got a situation at the desk.
not_available Don't bring that kid to CT right now.
not_available Why not? 
not_available His homeys are there.
not_available They came here? Those bastards! You stay away from him, okay? Take it outside! 
not_available Just stay away! Your brother's a ranker.
not_available You almost killed him! What more do you want?! You know? Call the cops! They're murderers! They did it.
not_available You pushed that guy right over the rail! You didn't even know that man! He was just trying to help, and you pushed him over! All he wanted was a chance! At the moment, his C
not_available 4 nerve, the one between the fourth and fifth vertebrae, is still functioning.
not_available Meaning he can move his diaphragm and shrug his shoulders.
not_available But if the swelling continues, then he becomes a C
not_available 3.
not_available He will lose the ability to breathe on his own.
not_available How is the shooting going? Are you getting everything you need? Yeah, I think so.
not_available It's been good.
not_available I noticed that you might be missing the importance of women
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Women working in the ER.
not_available It's changed dramatically over the last few years.
not_available All kinds of diversity among medical workers.
not_available It's crucial to how Emergency Medicine evolves.
not_available I'll mention that to Agi and Stuart.
not_available What was that you were pointing to? Here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is a fracture of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae.
not_available What does that mean? That Mr.
not_available Williams, who tried to be a Good Samaritan and stop a young man he didn't know from being beaten to death is now paralyzed from the neck down.
not_available Kerry, may I interrupt? 
not_available David, come on in! Come in.
not_available I'd rather
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Morgenstern our too
not_available modest Chief of Emergency Services.
not_available If you're here about our little altercation, it's settled.
not_available The police subdued the perpetrators
not_available The police? David, you're diaphoretic.
not_available Is something wrong? 
not_available Chest pain.
not_available Radiating? 
not_available To the jaw, started 20 minutes ago.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Let's get you on a monitor.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Gently.
not_available You get out.
not_available Out! Get out! Out! Lydia! Lydia! Grab me some atropine, nitro and a 12lead EKG! 
not_available Oh, my God! Pulse ox monitor and start a line.
not_available Here you go, David.
not_available We're gonna take good care of you.
not_available How about there? No.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Anything at all? No, ma'am.
not_available Will the feeling come back? That's what the doctors are trying to find out.
not_available Felt that.
not_available Good.
not_available Mark it.
not_available Sir, we'll have to watch you very closely.
not_available If the swelling continues, we'll have to put you on a ventilator.
not_available I got a hold of a babysitter at your house, your wife's at school.
not_available Right.
not_available It's Thursday.
not_available She won't get in until midnight.
not_available We'll get a message to her.
not_available Get that babysitter on the phone, now.
not_available Malik! Malik! Hold on! I'll bring it back! 
not_available I need it now.
not_available Kerry, I was about to
not_available It's David Morgenstern.
not_available It's the kid that got beat up earlier.
not_available It may be his spleen.
not_available Is it the kid with the head trauma? You have to get in line.
not_available I need a CT.
not_available Drill the burrholes up in the O.R.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available I'm bagging him.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Go.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He's a little disappointed I left Surgery.
not_available I'm Miss Corday.
not_available Could you point me towards Casualty? Sorry.
not_available "Trauma.
not_available " I mean Trauma.
not_available Trauma's that way.
not_available You need help? 
not_available I'll call out if I get lost.
not_available You okay? Kid was trying to get out of a gang.
not_available You're in the ER.
not_available Get them on the elevator alive, you've done your job.
not_available How do you think he'll do? A blown left pupil, probably means a chronic vegetative state.
not_available If he doesn't bleed to death first.
not_available How bad's he look? His ST's are sky
not_available high in two, three, and F.
not_available His father had an Ml at 40.
not_available Yeah, I'll hold.
not_available I wonder if we could talk now.
not_available Later.
not_available He's throwing multifocal PVCs.
not_available Should we give him lidocaine? Cath lab's ready for us.
not_available Let's get him up! I wonder if you're aware of my situation
not_available I got the babysitter.
not_available Later, Carter.
not_available Excuse me, Lily.
not_available Is this the Williams' sitter? This is Dr.
not_available Greene from the Emergency Room at County General Hospital.
not_available Do you understand me? How far away are you from where Mrs.
not_available Williams goes to school? Good.
not_available Get a neighbor to watch the baby and run there as fast as you can, and get her.
not_available Tell her it's an emergency and every minute counts.
not_available Put her in a cab.
not_available We're about a 10
not_available minute ride away.
not_available You got all that? Any questions? Good.
not_available Go.
not_available Is he losing his ability to breathe? The rate his pulse ox is falling, I'll need to intubate.
not_available You need the wife here to sign a consent? He's paralyzed, probably for the rest of his life.
not_available Right now he can speak.
not_available It would be nice if he and his wife could talk, while he still can.
not_available Theo, can you take a deep breath for me? 
not_available I'll go get Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm Miss Corday.
not_available I was bleeped down for a consult.
not_available Are you a doctor? Oh, don't mind them.
not_available These gentlemen are making a movie.
not_available I'm a surgical lecturer in Orthopedics and Trauma.
not_available There was an adolescent who decompensated? Dr.
not_available Benton took him up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available You call your surgeons "doctor.
not_available " "Miss Corday" won't get me very far around here.
not_available Just to the Waiting Room.
not_available I'm Carol Hathaway.
not_available It's a pleasure.
not_available How did he look? The boy with the positive lavage? Not good.
not_available Blown pupil, deep coma.
not_available This is the kid I saved? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, man! We're keeping our fingers crossed.
not_available Are you still experiencing the same amount of pain? Okay, on a scale of one to 10, how would you rate that pain? Pardon? Eight.
not_available Okay, let's get him on very gently.
not_available They're set up for us and know we're coming.
not_available Here we go.
not_available What the hell? Hey, what are you doing? No! I asked you not to.
not_available You going to the Cath Lab? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Isn't there another patient who's been waiting? What do you mean? Do some patients get preferential treatment in the ER? Look at me.
not_available I'm talking to you.
not_available Is this recording? Are you a doctor? Do you have experience with myocardial infarctions? How is he doing? Sinus rhythmThen how can you make an accusation about patient treatment? Your camera sees a picture of one man going to the Cath Lab so you assume preferential treatment? Do you know ST elevations? Is there another patient who had Vtach? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available How's the ectopy? 
not_available Under five per minute.
not_available What do you want? What can we tell you? I'm sorry.
not_available I got carried away.
not_available You did.
not_available What do you got? Eightytwoyear
not_available old male.
not_available Shocked twice without success.
not_available Shall I defibrillate? 
not_available Be my guest.
not_available Charge it to 360.
not_available Has he had epi? 
not_available Three minutes ago.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Juice it up.
not_available Three
not_available sixty.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Agi, I need a battery.
not_available Another 50 of lidocaine.
not_available Again, 360.
not_available Agi, my camera battery's dying.
not_available Keep shooting.
not_available Got a rhythm.
not_available Pulse? Faint.
not_available But it's there.
not_available We gotta bag him.
not_available I'm losing power.
not_available How does that feel, doctor? To bring somebody back? Oh, that's the That's the 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available Yeah? Elizabeth Corday.
not_available Visiting surgical lecturer and your savior.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available You've been on call forever.
not_available You're free to go.
not_available I'm on now.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Are you the doctor who was taking care of my brother? You still down here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had to talk to the cops.
not_available How is he? 
not_available They removed his spleen.
not_available The neurosurgeons are still working.
not_available Does he have brain damage? Let's call and see if there's news.
not_available Here we go.
not_available I thought I was a goner.
not_available Yeah? Me too.
not_available You'll get a lot of thank
not_available yous from the female population at Riverview.
not_available I don't wanna brag, but 
not_available You a popular guy over there? Well, I seem to be I never was much of a Casanova in my day.
not_available I didn't go in for all the wild positions and so forth.
not_available Ladies need that.
not_available All the positions.
not_available So I've heard.
not_available And the sweet talk.
not_available I never was much for that either.
not_available I was mostly meat and potatoes.
not_available But now I'm 82.
not_available I'm a man.
not_available I'm breathing.
not_available The odds are 12to
not_available 1 in my favor.
not_available I'm getting it anytime I want.
not_available Not too bad, old age.
not_available I'm glad to hear it.
not_available Glad to hear it.
not_available It feels good to save a man who's performing such a service to society.
not_available Stud service.
not_available Get that in.
not_available He was found outside the Stones concert.
not_available It looked like he fell through a sheet of plate glass.
not_available Easy.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available We're just gonnaNo, no! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available No! Don't touch me! 
not_available Get Security.
not_available Security! 
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available Get away from me.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Just relax.
not_available No! Stay away from me! It's all right.
not_available I'm sick, okay? Just stay away from me.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I'm sick! I'm HIV
not_available positive.
not_available I've got AIDS.
not_available Just stay away from me! 
not_available Please.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stop! Okay.
not_available All right? Just lay back and let us help.
not_available Don't.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It itches.
not_available I know it itches.
not_available All right.
not_available Just take it away.
not_available I'll take it away.
not_available Okay? Lay back.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available We'll make it better.
not_available Help me.
not_available I'll do what I can.
not_available I'll do what I can.
not_available So when did you decide to become a surgeon? Well, that gets into pleasing my father, rattling my mother and all sorts of boring family secrets.
not_available The short answer is, my father is a surgeon, as was his father.
not_available And my father had no sons.
not_available Are you a resident in the U.K.? It's a different system altogether.
not_available I'm an FRCS, a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a lecturer.
not_available That's roughly the equivalent of senior surgical residents.
not_available But not really because I have six I'm sorry.
not_available You can't possibly be interested in this.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, please rescue me from these well
not_available intentioned people.
not_available We're talking about surgical service.
not_available Have you seen that young lady I was talking to? The sister of the boy up in Surgery? 
not_available I got some news.
not_available I'll keep my eyes open.
not_available Paralyzed? For good? It's too early to say if he'll have any recovery of function.
not_available What did he think he was doing? 
not_available He was trying to save a boy's life.
not_available I know.
not_available He's very eager to talk to you.
not_available I'm afraid it'll have to be brief.
not_available Just give me a second.
not_available I wouldn't wanna be in those shoes.
not_available Whose? Mark's or the wife's? Neither.
not_available Sometimes I hesitate with a family before I give the news.
not_available I'm gonna say something that will change their lives.
not_available If you don't say it, it'll be okay for a little while.
not_available I told this one mother that her son had been killed.
not_available And she said, "Is it broken? " I'm looking at her and I didn't know what she was saying.
not_available So she said, "His arm, is it broken? It's his pitching arm.
not_available " And she just walked away.
not_available Did you just let her leave like that? I called Carol.
not_available I had her take care of it.
not_available That's a true story.
not_available At least At least we shot those videos of us on the playground, me and him, huh? I guess it's a good thing.
not_available I mean, TG'll be able to see what his daddy looked like or used to be like.
not_available You're gonna be that way again.
not_available You hear me, Theo? We are not giving up that easy, okay? His blood gas showed PO
not_available 2, 65 and PCA 250.
not_available We're standing by with Versed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter needs you now! I'll be there in a minute.
not_available I'm afraid we have to interrupt.
not_available Just another minute? Can you have somebody drive her home? Stop bossing me around.
not_available I'm staying here.
not_available Pulse ox is down to 89.
not_available He's getting dusky.
not_available Two of Versed.
not_available We can't wait any longer.
not_available Once this sedative takes effect, I'll intubate your husband.
not_available When you wake up, you're gonna have a tube helping you to breathe.
not_available Mind if we interrupt? Miss Cruz's brother came out of surgery.
not_available The head CT showed no bleeding.
not_available That is really good news.
not_available Thanks.
not_available The boy? The boy's gonna be okay? Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You saved my brother's life.
not_available That's good.
not_available Can you feel that, honey? I'm in.
not_available Is he breathing? We're breathing for him now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, you need to come now! Excuse me.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He went into fib.
not_available Clear! He went into asystole.
not_available I've given high
not_available dose epi and atropine.
not_available Charge, 360.
not_available Why didn't you call me? I did! 
not_available Two minutes ago.
not_available Clear! I was following ACLS algorithms.
not_available I thought I could handle it.
not_available Charge! 
not_available Go ahead and call it.
not_available Clear! Charge it again.
not_available Call it, Dr.
not_available Carter! Time of death is 9:56.
not_available Call an Attending when there's a full arrest! You get help! 
not_available I've run them before.
not_available That was Surgery.
not_available You work here now.
not_available Did I miss anything? Not that I can see.
not_available Sorry, I didn't think I was gonna lose him.
not_available I'll sign the code sheet.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Do you want that interview? Do you? You'll answer our questions? 
not_available If you don't use what you just shot.
not_available The walk away? The whole thing.
not_available Him losing the patient and me chewing him out.
not_available It wasn't bad.
not_available Do you want the interview? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Look, I need a death kit in here.
not_available Probably the best part of my job is that sometimes working here you can repair some of the violence.
not_available Some of the bad things that happen to people.
not_available Not always.
not_available We couldn't do much for that guy who was paralyzed.
not_available Probably on a vent for the rest of his life.
not_available I guess we did save the kid that he was trying to help.
not_available So his sacrifice wasn't for nothing.
not_available And yes, I was attacked myself right here in this hospital.
not_available They haven't been able to catch the guy who did it.
not_available At least, they haven't been able to charge anyone.
not_available The worst thing about it isn't what it did to me.
not_available The worst thing is, it meant that some of the world's violence has leaked into our own ER.
not_available This is meant to be a safe place for fixing people.
not_available Now it's vulnerable.
not_available And as an ER doctor, that's hard to accept.
not_available It sounds frightening.
not_available Are you scared? Sure.
not_available Of losing control.
not_available Control of what's outside? And what's in me.
not_available Is that enough? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then turn it off.
