not_available I made a series of critical errors including depriving the patient of oxygen.
not_available I refused to let Dr.
not_available Lewis take over and proceeded to put the Shiley in the pre
not_available tracheal space.
not_available The only thing I didn't do was put a bag over the guy's head 
not_available and hit him with a brick.

not_available So do I.
not_available What? 
not_available Koko wants to collect semen from her husband who is 93 and just had an Ml.

not_available We wanna make sure that he doesn't die.
not_available Well, we can still get it now.
not_available Oh, it was always about the money, wasn't it, Koko? If she doesn't get pregnant before he dies, she doesn't inherit anything.

not_available Seven million, roughly.
not_available My husband signed a release.
not_available I know my rights.
not_available I want his semen.

not_available He left.
not_available What? 
not_available He had an emergency again.
not_available Leon.

not_available And I didn't have it.
not_available I got scared.
not_available And they' re so mad at me.
not_available It was Dukey's gun, right? They stabbed you? Where did they stab you? 
not_available In the ass.
not_available In the ass, G.
not_available Come on.
not_available We got to go to the hospital.
not_available No, no.
not_available Where's the gun, G? 
not_available They' re outside.
not_available We have to go to the hospital.
not_available No.
not_available They' re gonna kill both of us! 
not_available Nobody's gonna kill us.
not_available No
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available Where are we? Don't even bother gloving up.
not_available Time of death, 18:44.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I came as soon as I heard.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available Carter, labs on your cranky old doctor.
not_available McNulty.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But he's MIA.
not_available He's diabetic.

not_available I have to go.
not_available I ovulated this morning.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We' re killing spermatozoa.
not_available Did he just say "spermatozoa"? 
not_available That man has an electroejaculator.
not_available Electroejaculator? Does that come with a costume? 
not_available Nope.
not_available An extension cord.
not_available Oh, the mighty Gilman pulled through.
not_available An inspiration to us all.
not_available Gallant, Pratt for you.
not_available Abby, have you ever heard of an electroejaculator? 
not_available You just like saying that word.
not_available No.
not_available I had an instant ejaculator once.
not_available Tommy Reynolds, 10th grade.
not_available Poor kid never made it out of his jeans.
not_available Ixnay on the jaculator
not_available ay.
not_available Hey, has anybody seen Pratt? 
not_available Gallant's on the phone with him.
not_available I don't feel comfortable doing that.
not_available I want to talk to him.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter wants to talk to you.
not_available Where the hell are you? Pratt? What's going on, Gallant? I'm only gonna ask you once.
not_available It hurts, G.
not_available All right, there he is.
not_available Lay on your stomach.
not_available It hurts all over, G.
not_available Gallant, what took you so damn long? 
not_available I see I got through to you earlier today.
not_available Running a clinic out of the apartment? 
not_available Come on.
not_available Who's hurt? It's my brother, Leon.
not_available Who are you? G? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He's a doctor too.
not_available Looks like he should be in the hospital.
not_available No, man.
not_available I heard that.
not_available Calm down.
not_available We' re not going anywhere.
not_available I ain't going.
not_available Just calm down.
not_available Listen, we' re staying right here.
not_available Either you' re gonna help or you' re not.
not_available This is not smart, Pratt.
not_available Everything in my life is not smart, Carter.
not_available How long ago did you get hurt? 
not_available Three hours ago, but he's okay.
not_available Gunshot? Stab wound.
not_available Also fractured fourth and fifth metacarpals.
not_available He's got broken ribs, bloody nose, no septal hematoma.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm good, I got this.
not_available I mean, you can go now.
not_available All I needed was a suture kit.
not_available Why don't you wanna go to the hospital? You don't want the assault reported? 
not_available They gonna kill us.
not_available Nobody's gonna kill us.
not_available Let it go.
not_available Why'd you get beat up? I didn't have the gun when they asked for it.
not_available We gotta get it back, G.
not_available They want it.
not_available Holding the gun for someone else, huh? My friends.
not_available Some friends.
not_available I'm a danger to myself and others.
not_available If you went home, what would you do? I don't know.
not_available You have to tell him what you would do.
not_available Stop coaching him.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available I have patients.
not_available Chip, listen to me right now.
not_available If you don't tell the truth, we can't help you.
not_available This is your last chance.
not_available I'm picking up my ex
not_available girlfriend's son from school and having sex with him in my car behind the baseball field as soon as I leave here.
not_available Okay, I'll make room for him.
not_available How are you feeling? Good.
not_available Did you call your parents? They' re gonna worry about you.
not_available What did she say? "They'll worry about me more if they know I have a boyfriend.
not_available " What? She doesn't want to disappoint them more than she already has by being deaf.
not_available No.
not_available You can't go home.
not_available You have to stay here tonight.
not_available I'll call.
not_available Why was I a patient? You saw me? I was Leon, he's your brother? No.
not_available Well, yeah, kind of.
not_available He came to live with me and my mom when he was 9.
not_available I was 6 then.
not_available I idolized him.
not_available Then when I was 15, my mom died of liver cancer and Leon took care of me.
not_available Made sure I went to school.
not_available So when I was in college, one day he got into a fight in a bar in Detroit.
not_available Believe me, this is one tough son of a bitch.
not_available I'm trying to tell you, I mean, he survived a 9 mm bullet to the brain.
not_available But in turn, his IQ dropped about 40 points.
not_available Do you have any help? No.
not_available I've been doing it on my own for years.
not_available I'm good at that.
not_available Well, we work as a team.
not_available We cover for each other.
not_available We lean on each other.
not_available The job's too big to do solo.
not_available And if you can't get that maybe you should be a surgeon.
not_available Or a superhero, or something else that doesn't require trusting people.
not_available I've never been big on trust.
not_available You know what that turns into? Nobody trusts you either.
not_available Look, self
not_available sufficiency's a good thing, but it's not the only thing.
not_available Asking for help when you need it doesn't make you weak.
not_available Maybe I should go inside now.
not_available All right.
