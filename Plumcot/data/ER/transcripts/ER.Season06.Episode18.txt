not_available No! I don't have time to eat.
not_available You weren't starving yourself to induce a miscarriage, were you? We both wanted a big family.
not_available I just thought I'd get a break.
not_available Your body protects the fetus first.
not_available But you're putting your own heart and kidneys at risk.
not_available Were you trying to terminate? There are safer ways to do that.
not_available Have you considered an abortion? I can't have another baby right now.
not_available I just can't.

not_available inch.
not_available You okay? 
not_available They deserve a father, Mark.

not_available Go ahead.
not_available I got this.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's up? 
not_available She was starving herself to miscarry.

not_available She didn't ask for one? 
not_available She's scared.
not_available Come here.
not_available She doesn't want her husband to know.
not_available Refer her to the GYN clinic.
not_available I offered to arrange things for her upstairs.
not_available Today.
not_available What's the rush? 
not_available This might be her only opportunity.
not_available She can't get out of the house? 
not_available She needed me to make it happen.

not_available No, she just needed a push.
not_available And you pushed her? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Did you give her options? Yes.
not_available The husband won't let her adopt out.
not_available It's gonna push her over the edge.
not_available If she's gone to this much trouble to avoid an abortion there's a part of her that has a problem with it.
not_available Or her husband does.
not_available Can GYN even do it? 
not_available I haven't asked them.
not_available All right.
not_available Talk to them.
not_available It might not even be possible.

not_available up.
not_available You think he's faking? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available So is it anxiety attacks? I'm not sure.
not_available But your cardiac enzymes are normal.
not_available And I'm not seeing irregularities on the EKG.
not_available I didn't think it was my heart.

not_available They need to eat.
not_available They're eating now.

not_available I am not taking a dump in your living room, Mark! I am not an invalid! I can still make it to the bathroom! Dad.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Come on, sit down.
not_available Sit and relax.
not_available This is what I didn't want happening.
not_available Relax.
not_available I won't use it.
not_available I'll get your albuterol, okay? I'll take it back, all right? Here.
not_available Just take a few puffs.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available The suit.
not_available Mr.
not_available Parker? I'm Abby.
not_available Hi.
not_available You're taking care of my wife? Yes.
not_available She was a little dehydrated and tired.
not_available She came by ambulance.
not_available It's standard when patients lose consciousness.
not_available God.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Mostly, she just needs to rest.
not_available She overdoes it.
not_available She does too much.
not_available You should get her some help at home.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can I see her? 
not_available She went upstairs for tests.
not_available What kind of tests? She was anemic.
not_available We checked her heart and blood.
not_available Let's find your kids.
not_available Okay.
not_available But she only needs rest.
not_available She does.
not_available We're being thorough.
not_available I should be there.
not_available That'd be difficult.
not_available What's all this? I've got an ex
not_available lap.
not_available Were you going to call me? 
not_available I didn't know I needed permission.
not_available Did your friend tell you I'd examined the patient? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch advised me of your opinion.
not_available I bet she did.
not_available I made my assessment.
not_available That boy is asymptomatic 
not_available except for a bruise.
not_available His white count rose.
not_available She should've called me.
not_available You'd made up your mind.
not_available I was observing him.
not_available She may not be as comfortable with me as you but I might have changed my mind.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Stop scrubbing.
not_available What? 
not_available You heard me, I said stop.
not_available I'm operating on him.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available I am.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Sorry to have wasted your time.
not_available It's my prerogative to schedule cases especially ones I've seen first.
not_available You mean you're pulling rank on me? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dan Shine.
not_available You sent me a patient for a biopsy.
not_available How'd it go? 
not_available His bone marrow is normal.
not_available No.
not_available He had 95% blasts.
not_available Someone else did.
not_available He's normal.
not_available What? They mixed up records.
not_available Do you have a patient named Simpson? 
not_available Can you find Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Just a second.
not_available No, now! Did you talk to him? 
not_available You might want to go up.
not_available I stuck him, then told him we were wrong.
not_available That he wouldn't die.
not_available He wants to sue.
not_available I'm sure he did.
not_available Excuse me? They took my wife up.
not_available I wanted to see if she was back.
not_available The name's Parker.
not_available Gynecology Clinic.
not_available Wait.
not_available Gynecology Clinic? I thought she was anemic.
not_available I didn't take care of her.
not_available You can wait right over there.
not_available Call me if you find Simpson.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Excuse me, what's your name? 
not_available Abby.
not_available Abby, yeah.
not_available It says "GYN" by my wife's name.
not_available Is that right? Why don't you have a seat? I'll check.
not_available Is there something wrong? 
not_available No, she's fine.
not_available Why is she in Gynecology? Is she pregnant? You should wait.
not_available I don't want to wait anymore! Tell me what's wrong with her.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why? Medical information is private.
not_available It's my wife.
not_available What can't I know? 
not_available Mr.
not_available ParkerIs she having an abortion? Is she? 
not_available I can't say.
not_available What floor is Gynecology on? What floor is Gynecology on?! 
not_available Ninth.
not_available You needed me, Carter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're sure it's not another mistake? We double
not_available checked.
not_available How long? 
not_available It's hard for me to say.
not_available Ballpark, best guess.
not_available With a bone
not_available marrow transplant there's a 60 percent survival rate at five years.
not_available Without one? Chemotherapy alone? About half of that.
not_available We'll do what we can to find a match.
not_available Type your 
family brothers, sisters
not_available I don't have any brothers or sisters.
not_available Are your parents living? 
not_available I have an uncle.
not_available That's good.
not_available And your son.
not_available He's only 8.
not_available Probably the best chance.
not_available I should call my wife.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You called for a consult? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abdominal pain.
not_available A hot appy.
not_available Didn't bring them to the O.R.
not_available yourself? 
not_available Temp's 101.
not_available I just closed Eli Emerson's belly.
not_available I thought Peter was
not_available No, he was my consult.
not_available There's no perforation.
not_available What a relief.
not_available Pity I had to cut him open.
not_available Better to know than regret it later.
not_available Yes.
not_available You may have special access to Peter but from now on, come to me if you have a problem.
not_available Obviously you agreed with him.
not_available "Yes, Elizabeth," will do.
not_available Do you want this? Which room? 
not_available Four.
not_available Hey, what's going on? 
not_available They took all my stuff.
not_available The city swept his street.
not_available When was your last drink? 
not_available I tried to get up on a dumpster.
not_available They pushed me down.
not_available How much have you had? They took my pillows.
not_available I had a tarp for rain.
not_available Have you eaten? 
not_available No money.
not_available Let's get a banana bag.
not_available CBC and blood alcohol.
not_available Did you hit your head? What? Did you hit your head? 
not_available Hold still, Pablo.
not_available Let me go.
not_available Hold still.
not_available No.
not_available Soft restraints.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Call Security.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Pablo, be still.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Haldol.
not_available What? No! 
not_available Let me go.
not_available Carter, what are you doing? 
not_available No.
not_available Carter.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available He's violent.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available They don't come any gentler.
not_available Are you going to help? 
not_available No! All right, fine.
not_available Call me when he calms down.
not_available You got any fourbyfours in here? 
not_available Let me check.
not_available Xeroform, Adaptic 
not_available If not, in the suture room.
not_available Hold on, I'm still looking.
not_available Here we go.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available What, with Pablo? Your overreaction to Pablo.
not_available Or am I now overreacting? I was being careful.
not_available Maybe it was a bad call.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah, I think so.
not_available I know what it's like to have life change.
not_available A year ago I was living with Doug.
not_available Now I'm living alone with two babies.
not_available Go figure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It takes a while to deal with it to get used to it.
not_available You still need to get used to it.
not_available Lucy matched.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Where? Here.
not_available Got a spot in Psych.
not_available Go figure.
not_available There's always gonna be something.
not_available Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to work.
not_available She's not really Swedish.
not_available What? Fredriksson.
not_available She's married to a Swede.
not_available She's Dutch.
not_available So you did talk to her.
not_available No, I didn't talk.
not_available She yapped and yapped.
not_available Finally, about halfway through watching Rosie O 'Donnell I said to stick her thumb in her dike and shut up.
not_available You didn't.
not_available Sure, I did.
not_available To stick her thumb in her dike? She got what I meant.
not_available And it worked.
not_available Not another word.
not_available What is this? 
not_available Meatloaf.
not_available The only recipe of Mom's I remember.
not_available Where's the egg? 
not_available What egg? Your mom cooked it with an egg.
not_available You'd get a sliver per slice.
not_available I forgot.
not_available I never much liked the egg, always ate around it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Work was pretty decent today.
not_available That's good.
not_available So anything happen here? Like what? I don't know.
not_available Maybe you and she did something.
not_available What the hell would we do? Play Parcheesi? Dad, forget it.
not_available Okay? I was just making conversation.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Your mom served it with peas.
not_available Not with string beans.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess so.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Pretty well.
not_available She's gonna be okay.
not_available That's good.
not_available I want to apologize.
not_available I let my emotions get the best of me.
not_available Of course.
not_available Lynn let herself get rundown.
not_available She just got depressed.
not_available I guess I didn't see.
not_available It's easy for that to happen.
not_available She's resting now.
not_available I'm gonna check on my kids.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hi, how are you doing? 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I saw your husband.
not_available He was upset, but he's better now.
not_available He forgave me.
not_available He forgave you? 
not_available We all make mistakes sometimes.
not_available What you did today was a mistake? He didn't call it that.
not_available Just a moment of weakness.
not_available Well, what do you think? 
not_available He talked to a doctor.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available We'll be able to try again soon.
not_available For another baby? Ken's a wonderful father.
not_available We both love kids.
not_available We've always wanted a big family.
not_available Kids are great.
not_available Why don't you rest, okay? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Look at Kate's hat.
not_available She's so cute.
not_available Isn't that Tess? Nope.
not_available Tess is the one eating the hat.
not_available Hey, Luka.
not_available You off? 
not_available No.
not_available Heading out to meet a trauma.
not_available You? 
not_available After I pick up the girls.
not_available Isn't that adorable? Yeah.
not_available Very beautiful.
not_available See you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Has anyone seen Benton? 
not_available I think he crashed.
not_available Oh, God! Dr.
not_available Kovac What? 
not_available He had two children.
not_available Two, wasn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where are the girls? I'm on my way up to get them.
not_available How much longer are you on? If Romano has his way, probably forever.
not_available Luka, I just realized, looking at those pictures I've never seen any pictures of your children.
not_available You want to see one? 
not_available That'd be great.
not_available Jasna.
not_available That was her birthday party.
not_available She was 4.
not_available She's beautiful.
not_available So is your wife.
not_available Yeah, she was.
not_available Can I see your son? 
not_available I don't have any.
not_available You don't have any now, or at all? I'm lucky to have this.
not_available No, to see Marco I just have to close my eyes and he's there.
not_available Usually with chocolate ice cream on his face and hands.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Thank you for asking.
not_available Oh, here I go.
not_available Back to work.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Bye.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Cleo.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Lie down.
not_available I thought you were going home.
not_available Maybe later.
not_available This is okay for now.
not_available Dr.
not_available John.
not_available I thought the dog got in.
not_available No, it's just me, Corrine.
not_available Couldn't sleep? 
not_available No.
not_available You want me to make something? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Mark! Mark! Dad? 
not_available Mark! Just a second.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I told you this would get in the way.
not_available What happened? I was trying to go to the bathroom.
not_available I got tangled up in these.
not_available Damn! 
not_available I should've moved this stuff.
not_available I should be able to go to the bathroom by myself.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available I didn't leave a lamp on.
not_available I tried.
not_available But I got tangled up It's no big deal, Dad.
not_available My pajamas are soaked! Well, don't worry.
not_available I haven't wet the bed since I was 5! All right.
not_available Just sit down here, okay? I'll put the shower on.
not_available You shouldn't have to do this, Mark.
not_available Think how many times you did this for me when I was little.
not_available Well, I'm a grown man.
not_available Whoa, wait, wait.
not_available This isn't right, Mark.
not_available It just isn't right.
not_available I know, Dad.
not_available I know.
not_available Let's just rest for a minute.
