not_available Trent's mother died of AIDS when he was 2.
not_available He tested HIV
not_available positive.
not_available You need to be careful.
not_available He didn't say anything.
not_available He doesn't know.
not_available We never told him.
not_available What? 
not_available We just wanted him to be normal like other kids.
not_available What about the medications? 
not_available He thinks he has a vitamin deficiency.
not_available And your doctor plays along with that? 
not_available Well, he understands.
not_available Trent needs to know.
not_available Yes.
not_available When he's older.
not_available When he can better understand.
not_available Your grandson could be sexually active.
not_available He's not.
not_available I've asked him.
not_available Are you sure he's telling the truth? Doctor, I know my grandson.
not_available You don't.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Larson, I have a legal right to tell Trent that he's HIV
not_available positive.
not_available You have no right to interfere.
not_available HIV is a sexually transmitted disease.
not_available And if he's having unprotected sex, he could be putting others at risk.
not_available Well, I think we better leave.
not_available Well, he can't leave.
not_available Let me by.
not_available Chris? Let me by! 
not_available Could you escort Mrs.
not_available Larson to Chairs? 
not_available This way, ma'am.
not_available Don't touch me.

not_available It's a great feeling.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's your fiancée's name again? Janet.
not_available I'm calling the ER.
not_available See if they can get ahold of her, and she can meet us there.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available Hi, Randi? It's Mark Greene up in the helicopter.
not_available Who's around? Dr.
not_available Corday's right here.
not_available It's Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I need to speak to him right away.

not_available Dr.
not_available Dietrich? This is Dr.

not_available I'll try and get ahold of her.
not_available No, he's a great kid.
not_available Listen, if I was to get a needlestick, is there anything I should know? Did you get in touch with that hotel? 
not_available There's still no answer.
not_available Could you call the manager and see if they can send somebody up there? Detective? You keep coming by, I'm gonna have to get you a badge and a gun.
not_available So, is there anything? Dr.
not_available Kovac, now, you know the minute there's anything new, I'm gonna call you.
not_available We take photos for the medical record.
not_available I thought it might help.
not_available His morgue photo's already on the police bulletin.
not_available Maybe you could go back to where it happened, show this around? We've done our interviews, doc.
not_available No one knows him.
not_available What about fingerprints? Have a seat.
not_available Have a seat, doc.
not_available Look, I understand how you feel, okay? But the fact is, you're probably better off if no one IDs this guy.
not_available No one's gonna come crawling out of the woodwork with a wrongful death suit.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I just need to know who he was.
not_available Take my advice, doc.
not_available You were defending yourself.
not_available Dedicate yourself to believing that.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep that clean and dry.
not_available All right.
not_available Cool.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Carter, is my grandmother here yet? Yeah.
not_available But first we need to talk.
not_available Why? It's just a cut.
not_available Yeah, actually, I need to ask you something.
not_available All right.
not_available It's about your mother.
not_available How much do you remember about her? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You sure? Yeah.
not_available She's dead.
not_available She was a loser.
not_available A heroin addict.
not_available She died of AIDS.
not_available And she had the virus when she was pregnant with you.

not_available Wait a second.
not_available So I have AIDS? 
not_available No.
not_available You have HIV.
not_available And you're healthy because you've been taking medication.
not_available No, no.
not_available See, I just take a bunch of vitamins.
not_available That's it.
not_available No.
not_available You've been taking medication to combat the virus.
not_available No.
not_available They're just vitamins, man.
not_available No.
not_available Your grandmother told me.
not_available And I confirmed it with your doctor.
not_available Why wouldn't she tell me?! I think she wanted to protect you.
not_available But you need to know.
not_available So my whole life everybody's lied to me.
not_available I'm not lying to you.
not_available How much longer do you think? Gordon, what's our ETA? Well, there's the Kankakee River.
not_available About 20 minutes.
not_available You all right? It's all right.
not_available Just a little chest pain.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available Nitro spray.
not_available Open your mouth, under your tongue.
not_available On a scale of one to 10, how bad is the pain? Big

not_available But we're giving you clot
not_available busting medicine.
not_available Pulse ox down to 82.
not_available You want to intubate? Not if I don't have to.

not_available No.
not_available Doctor Greene Dr.
not_available Greene, you'll get me there, right? Yeah.
not_available I'll get you there.
not_available Do you have a girlfriend? Because if you've slept with anybody, they'll have to be tested.
not_available It's important, Trent.
not_available You have to use condoms.
not_available Can I go now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yep, your grandmother's waiting.
not_available So a case manager's gonna phone you tomorrow, see how you're doing.

not_available Great.
not_available And now he's bleeding out.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available M.A.P.

not_available Yeah? We finished the autopsy.
not_available I can review some of the pertinent findings.
not_available There were multiple contusions to the occipital cortex with herniation through the foramen magnum.
not_available And if you'll take a look here, you'll see numerous fractures consistent with repetitive blunt trauma.
not_available I know how he died.
not_available Well, I can tell you that he was a smoker based on the lung findings.
not_available Also, he probably once lived in central California.
not_available There were foci of pulmonary fibrosis consistent with coccidioidomycosis.

not_available Tonight? 
not_available We can't move him.
not_available We gotta do it here.
not_available Were you able to get a license? 
not_available I tried.
not_available But city hall's closing.
not_available You don't have a marriage license? 
not_available Can you do it anyway? A marriage isn't legally binding without a license.
not_available How about tomorrow? Okay.
not_available He may not make it until tomorrow.
not_available Can't you help them? They want your blessing.
not_available They have very little time.

not_available Kovac, did you trade your shift? 
not_available No.
not_available Where have you been? They couldn't reach you.
not_available You didn't answer your page.
not_available What's the problem? That I had to come in today and cover for you.
not_available I thought I was on tonight.
not_available No.
not_available You were on today.
not_available Then I'm sorry.
not_available There must have been some mistake.
not_available There was no one with enough experience to cover you.
not_available We almost lost two patients.
not_available Luka, this is grounds for dismissal.
not_available Fine, Kerry.
not_available Fire me.
not_available I know that you've been through a lot.
not_available If you need to take time off, tell me.
not_available But you can't miss any more shifts.

not_available What? Wait a minute.
not_available Don't walk away.
not_available Where have you been? 
not_available Abby, please.
not_available I want to help.
not_available Just talk to me.
not_available There is nothing to say, okay? To have and to hold, to love and to cherish as long as you both shall live.
not_available "The union of husband and wife in heart, body and mind is intended by God for their mutual joy.
not_available For the health and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity.

not_available Congratulations.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I'm gonna break all the rules and allow you to have one sip of champagne.

not_available We're very grateful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available For everything.
not_available Nice folks.
not_available Tell them to get a license, and I'll do it again.
not_available No charge.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, what about our wedding coordinator? I totally forgot to call and cancel.
not_available She'll be furious.
not_available Blame it on me.
not_available I mean, it was a medical emergency.
not_available The hell with her! 
not_available Excuse me? This is all so silly.
not_available I don't want a rose
not_available entwined arbor with trained doves.
not_available I don't want champagne served out of crystal flutes.
not_available I understand.
not_available Who cares about a bloody ice sculpture? 
not_available Not me.
not_available I just want to get married in a simple ceremony.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I was looking forward to those doves.
not_available So I spoke to the O.R.
not_available The aneurysm repair's going well.
not_available I'm glad to hear it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think it's best for now if you just see patients.
not_available Here.
not_available Well, if that's what you want.
not_available You're an excellent surgeon.
not_available But ER management is not the best use of your skills.
not_available Leave that to us.
not_available Hello, Mrs.
not_available Barnwell.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available So I understand you have a pain in your hip.
not_available That's right.
not_available And I've been lying here for three hours.
not_available Well, I'm very sorry about that.
not_available Pardon me for asking, but are you an intern? No, no.
not_available I'm a faculty physician.
not_available Your mother must be very proud.
not_available Yeah, she was.
not_available So how long have you had this pain? Before we get much further I'd like to say that I would be more at ease with another doctor.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available You look like a fine young man.
not_available But I've always had white doctors.
not_available I've always felt more comfortable that way.
not_available So you're saying that you only want to see a white doctor? If it's all right with you.
not_available That's fine.
not_available You'll just have to wait another three hours.
not_available What happened to him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hey, have you seen Abby? 
not_available I saw her punch out.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available You got a minute? 
not_available Actually, I'm just on my way out.
not_available Carter, wait.
not_available John, you had a bad day.
not_available We all have bad days.
not_available Look at me.
not_available You have to make tough choices, do what you think is right and accept the outcome.
not_available I shouldn't have told him.
not_available You had to.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Hey I'm off in 20 minutes.
not_available You wanna get some dinner? 
not_available I got an AA meeting at 9:00.
not_available You'll make it.
not_available Can I join you? It's a counter, Peter.
not_available You can sit anywhere.
not_available So you survived.
not_available Weaver said I was incompetent.
not_available Really? Well, that's what she implied.
not_available The per diem job is just temporary until you get back into Surgery.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I needed to show them that I could run the ER.
not_available Why? It has no bearing on your surgical career.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But it reflects on me, you know? I should've been able to handle it.
not_available You can't be perfect at everything.
not_available Yeah, but, Cleo I can learn a job if I can do it well.
not_available So do you feel better having said this to a sympathetic ear? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You know, I've had some problems, and I haven't had anyone to talk to.
not_available Are you ever going to be there for me? Because you sure as hell haven't been.
not_available Who is it? It's me.
not_available Can I come in, please? Sure.
not_available Abby
not_available You don't have to talk.
