not_available If we'd sent off a CBC earlier we could have started the transfusion and antibiotics on time.
not_available But now he's showing signs of brain damage because he was deprived of oxygen for too long.
not_available Isn't it possible he could still get better? 
not_available It's unlikely.
not_available But it's not impossible, right? No, it's not impossible.
not_available We waited out here for so long before they took us in.
not_available I know.
not_available So many people got seen before us.
not_available Why did we have to wait so long? 
not_available He should have received better care.

not_available An operation could save that girl, but we have to catch it in time.
not_available I'm sorry, I should have pushed her ahead.
not_available I need to know that when I ask you to do something, it'll get done.
not_available Okay.
not_available Whatever happens outside the hospital doesn't change anything when at work.
not_available Is this about last night? I'm just trying to get through the shift.
not_available How are his sats? RT's coming.
not_available Only 82.

not_available Why not? You dress like a doctor.
not_available I need my tox screen back on the girl in 2.
not_available Where'd we put the tinsel last year? 
not_available In the drug lockup, behind the Viagra.
not_available Hey, what happened to my menorah? 
not_available We had a security breach.
not_available Bring the food poisoning from Triage.
not_available Already got it.
not_available This is bad, Frank.
not_available A menorah has great symbolic value.
not_available Do you know what it represents? Anyone taken the GERD in Exam 4?

not_available Me either.
not_available Luka, do you have a minute? This is a serious matter.

not_available A capillary sample? 
not_available Pulled from his purple top.
not_available Did you draw above the IV site? 
not_available Luka.
not_available It's from his angiocath before he had fluid.
not_available He needs cultures and a workup.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Do another HemoCue.
not_available Type and cross? 
not_available She's seizing.
not_available Just check the CBC and hold the clot for the blood bank.
not_available What's happening to her? 
not_available Push four of Ativan.
not_available She's not breathing.
not_available Okay, let's bag her.
not_available Open a crash cart.
not_available She bit her tongue.
not_available Why is she still here? 
not_available CT said they were backed up.

not_available Should I go ahead without you?

not_available Not important what he says.
not_available He's not thinking clearly.
not_available But he's here? You' re helping the person who hurt my father? That's our job too.

not_available What are you doing? Why not just give it up? 
not_available He's 80 years old, Pratt.

not_available I took a hard check in practice.
not_available My helmet flew off.
not_available Coach had me sit down for a few minutes, but I wanted to get back in.

not_available They won't understand, the police.
not_available They'll put me in jail, but I did nothing wrong.
not_available Didn't you attack Mr.
not_available Dorich? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Why would you do something like that? Are you Jewish? 
not_available No.
not_available Still, maybe you can understand.
not_available I didn't see that man for almost 60 years then I see him on the street, on my own street an old man now, like me.
