Previously on ER 
not_available Thanks for covering.
not_available Lf you don't know, ask.
not_available You mean the EMS Medical Director is a real person? Yeah, he's an ER doc.
not_available I thought it was a name on top of memos.
not_available Not when I do it.
not_available You're a Pediatric Emergency Fellow? 
not_available One under the boss.
not_available You're thinking of starting over? It's a means to what I want, which is to stay here.
not_available I'm an ER doc, just like you.
not_available Not like me.
not_available You acted without the consent of your colleagues.
not_available Reece can't hear talking or the phone.
not_available It's a severeto
not_available profound loss.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You gonna be long? No, almost done.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Why start with the copy room? 
not_available Got a work order.
not_available Well, other rooms in the ER need paint more than this one.
not_available Lady, I just do what they tell me to do.
not_available So how was your skating party? Did you have fun? Yeah.
not_available Mostly kids from your soccer camp? Some.
not_available Juliet? It's Julianne.
not_available She wasn't there.
not_available So who was there? Just kids.
not_available Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.
not_available I just knew it was you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I had a great time.
not_available Oh, you'll never guess who was there.
not_available Well, Stephanie, she had this sort of yellow sweater.
not_available Remember that time I went to the mall with you and I saw that orange sweater that really matched my blue skirt? Well, this one looks even better.
not_available Interim? Yes.
not_available Well, has there been any change in my responsibilities? No, it's just around the table we felt that "interim" was a more accurate term.
not_available So you're the Interim Chief, Kerry.
not_available Fine.
not_available But, Don, it has been over 90 days since Dr.
not_available Morgenstern resigned.
not_available Then policy dictates that a permanent chief be named.
not_available It's all in the process.
not_available We've put out feelers.
not_available Thus far we have four outstanding candidates.
not_available We're forming a committee.
not_available So four candidates, including me? Actually, you make it five.
not_available Just one more thing.
not_available You know, I did a performance review of Doug Ross.
not_available You gave me an evaluation of the ultra
not_available rapid detox.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is an overall evaluation of his work.
not_available It'll help in deciding whether he should be made an ER Pedes Attending.
not_available I'll pass it along.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Ethan Luitly, remember? The guy next door plays Pumpkins so loud I can't study.
not_available He told me he'd stop.
not_available It's okay now but I'm sensitive 
not_available I'm late.
not_available Can we talk later? 
not_available Oh, God! Log jam.
not_available Dude! It's flooding my stall! Not again! All right, I'll fix it.
not_available Come out.
not_available I'll fix it.
not_available Shut off the water before it floods the hall.
not_available Lift the lid.
not_available I've done this before.
not_available Just pull the chain.
not_available Maintenance uses the shut
not_available off valve! Randi, have you seen my student? She was just looking for you.
not_available What? 
not_available You're looking mythical.
not_available Carter, Curtain 4, LOL, weak and dizzy.
not_available Hey, Mark? What does What does "interim" mean to you? "In
not_available between." Do you think that's a stronger word than "acting"? Your new title? I liked "acting" better.
not_available They're forming a review committee.
not_available Anspaugh told me.
not_available He asked me to be on it.
not_available Do you think that's a good idea? 
not_available Why not? I can be impartial.
not_available But my hat's in the ring and we work together.
not_available I'd hate for there to be any suggestion of favoritism.
not_available You don't think I should? 
not_available Well, I just want to be fair.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll pass.
not_available Hey, want to sneak away for lunch? Rosebud.
not_available On me? What's the occasion? 
not_available Just to talk.
not_available About what? 
not_available Over lunch.
not_available Okay, sure.
not_available Good.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is Carol around? Yeah.
not_available She's just 
not_available Hey, you're back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I am reborn.
not_available Oh, God, you look great! 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Where did you go again? 
not_available The Laurentian Wilderness.
not_available I'd stay away from anyplace with "wilderness" in its name.
not_available It was great.
not_available I was in the music camp.
not_available We jammed all night long, every night.
not_available Rock, salsa, gospel, whatever.
not_available That kind of "wild" I can get with! Jeanie, this is Lynette, our own nurse practitioner.
not_available Welcome.
not_available I'm not on until noon, guys.
not_available I'm doing paperwork, so tell me if you need help.
not_available Volunteering? You did just come straight from the wilderness.
not_available Well, here you go.
not_available How about John Esmond? Seven years old, losing weight, no insurance, Curtain 2.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's 8:30 already! 
not_available Hello.
not_available You know how long we waited? Sorry about that.
not_available Hey, John.
not_available My name is Jeanie.
not_available I'm putting this thermometer under your arm.
not_available Hold it there for me.
not_available Has he complained of cramps or diarrhea? No.
not_available But look what he threw up.
not_available What are those? 
not_available Roundworms.
not_available Worms? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's everything going? 
not_available Well, you know, back to civilization.
not_available My findings are nearly identical to the audiologist's.
not_available With the results of both tests being so close I'd say this is reliable data.
not_available I've done research on cochlear implants.
not_available How they've restored hearing to the deaf.
not_available But implant surgery requires destruction of residual hearing.
not_available But what difference does it make if the surgery will allow him to hear? Given the FDA criteria, he's not a candidate at this time.
not_available Your son can be helped by less invasive methods.
not_available Hearing aids.
not_available The new digital hearing aid.
not_available Paired with intensive speech therapy.
not_available What about sign language? Why limit him to signing when we can teach him to hear and speak? Okay.
not_available So, what do we do to get this digital hearing aid? So they do this thing with scallops and a white wine sauce What is this lunch about? All in good time.
not_available Just tell me.
not_available You can't keep secrets.
not_available I'm in control.
not_available It's a new me.
not_available Really? Could the "new you" see a kid? 
not_available He's got a parasite infection.
not_available I have 10 minutes.
not_available I have paperwork.
not_available Is it bad? It might kill your interest in the scallops.
not_available Yeah, found these in the copy machine.
not_available Hey, throw that in Dr.
not_available Ross' box.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, do you remember me? Roxanne? I spoke to you at Jerry's surprise party.
not_available You were selling disability insurance.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm "more likely to be maimed than killed"? Sorry, I didn't mean to pressure you.
not_available I'm here to sign up one of your nurses.
not_available But my toe is still a little sore.
not_available The one I dropped the weight on.
not_available Would you mind taking a look? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hop up here.
not_available Did I tell you I'm also selling mutual funds now? I just started.
not_available Such an exciting arena.
not_available A little tender right there.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Selling straight funds or variable annuities? You know about annuities? Once your Keogh's maxed out, you need a vehicle for tax
not_available deferred income.
not_available But most people can't lock up their money until retirement.
not_available That's where muni bonds come in.
not_available Well, this is healing.
not_available It'll just take a little more time.
not_available Avoid stomping your feet.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available No slam dancing to the Beastie Boys? 
not_available Slow dancing.
not_available Whatever you say, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is rather nostalgic.
not_available My last day as a Surgical Fellow.
not_available At least it's a beginning of something rather substantial.
not_available A gastroplasty on a 400
not_available pound gentleman.
not_available Did I make the wrong choice? It's not for me to say.
not_available Still, I wouldn't mind hearing your opinion.
not_available Is there some ominous portent in that long pause? I just can't imagine being an intern again.
not_available I'm determined not to whine about it.
not_available And I feel very good about not leaving the hospital.
not_available You might as well take a coffee break.
not_available Our patient just expired in the SICU.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Rodney MacMullen, 48.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Carving knife versus forehead.
not_available Good vitals, no visual complaints but drunk and combative.
not_available Lucy, come on! Damn beans! You give them work, they don't care! Son of a bitch! All right, everybody.
not_available Be nice and gentle.
not_available On my 
count One, two, three.
not_available Pancho must die.
not_available I'll blow his brains out 
not_available Hold him down.
not_available I got his legs.
not_available Lucy, get his arm! I'll get restraints! CBC, Chem
not_available 7, PT, PTT, type and cross for two units.
not_available Pupils equal, react to light.
not_available Sir, hold still.
not_available Let me get up.
not_available How do I tie him? 
not_available Tie his wrist to the frame.
not_available Gram of Ancef? Do you have any allergies? Just let me up! 
not_available Go with the Ancef.
not_available Carol, can you hold his head? I want to look in the mouth.
not_available Sir, open your mouth.
not_available He's tied! 
not_available Okay, Lucy, take a look.
not_available The blade's in the oropharynx and penetrated the frontal sinuses.
not_available Missed the eyes completely.
not_available Son of a bitch! Lucy! Lucy, you tied him to the rail, not the frame.
not_available You don't listen.
not_available Hey, hey! Don't spit! Carol, give him five Haldol, I.M.
not_available Sir, don't spit.
not_available Put this on.
not_available Not you, Lucy! Him! 
not_available Dana, this is Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey, Dana.
not_available How are you feeling? I'm okay.
not_available Any more pain? It's still there a bit but I don't mind.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's take a look at the damage here.
not_available Now, how exactly did this happen? I moved up for the goal and had a side kick right in the net.
not_available And as soon as my foot touched the ball I heard a crack.
not_available Then I went to take a step and it just gave out and started hurting.
not_available Did you collide with anybody? Anybody fall on top of you? 
not_available No.
not_available Anybody kick you in the shin? No.
not_available All I did was kick the ball.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available It's a severe break.
not_available I want to understand how it happened.
not_available We're gonna get you some more pain medication.
not_available And we're gonna run some tests.
not_available All right? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you see that? The bone looked like it exploded from the inside.
not_available I want a CT
not_available guided needle biopsy.
not_available Tumor? Remotely possible it's an infection.
not_available The parents? One of the soccer moms is calling them.
not_available We need their consent for the biopsy.
not_available You have a call on 35.
not_available A Mr.
not_available Davidson from some insurance company calling you back.
not_available What is this? 
not_available They found it in the copy room.
not_available It's not mine.
not_available It has your name on it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He has the same coverage I have.
not_available No insurance covers it? So if I needed them, you wouldn't buy them? Well, that's not acceptable.
not_available Listen Can I speak to your superior, please? Fine! Fine! I'll call him back.
not_available Problem, Peter? Just bureaucracy.
not_available Drives you crazy.
not_available So I'm supposed to treat this knife wound? It's not just a knife wound.
not_available No hurry, I gave him five of Haldol.
not_available We got a hostage crisis and shootout.
not_available They'll need a triage officer.
not_available They'd want someone more experienced.
not_available I start tomorrow.
not_available The rush is the best part.
not_available Maybe we'll see you on TV.
not_available A shootout? 
not_available Yeah, Wild West.
not_available How about it, doc? Tell Dr.
not_available Weaver that I'm going on a run.
not_available $920.
not_available Malik, could I ask you a question? Which do you think is the better vein? 
not_available Let's see.
not_available That's the one.
not_available Big and straight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just slide it in.
not_available He can't feel anything.
not_available It's going in.
not_available Got a flash.
not_available I'm advancing.
not_available Sapphire pinkie ring? This man ain't got no class.
not_available Hooked up the line.
not_available Got the tape.
not_available How come it's not running in? It's infiltrated.
not_available You went through the vein.
not_available No, I was really careful.
not_available You gotta be kind of Zen with it, okay? Now, watch the master, okay? It's not about seeing.
not_available It's not about feeling.
not_available It's about knowing.
not_available Malik, you got a phone call in Admit.
not_available It's in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now, finish it up.
not_available I'll take it out there.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Now, keep an eye on this guy too.
not_available When you finish, there's a head lac to irrigate in Curtain 2.
not_available Wow! Oh, the knife tip is posterior to the uvula and the oropharynx.
not_available So everything under control in here? It's fine.
not_available I asked Malik for some help with the IV.
not_available Good.
not_available Use the nurses.
not_available That's an important lesson.
not_available We exchanged gunfire.
not_available The assailant is down.
not_available Bomb squad's checking him.
not_available Bomb squad? He took four employees hostage with explosives.
not_available What's his problem? 
not_available He works here.
not_available Guess he didn't like it.
not_available The docs are here.
not_available How's he doing? The guy's covered in dynamite.
not_available Got chicken wire all over his body.
not_available Lots of blood coming out of his neck.
not_available How long's he been down? 
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available Can we get in? 
not_available When we clear the explosives.
not_available Clark, can I send a doc in there? Well, I've cut the main fuse.
not_available But it's not safe without a 7B suit.
not_available What's that? 
not_available A bomb suit.
not_available Put me in that thing.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available If anyone goes, it should be you.
not_available You're the doctor.
not_available I'm not pressuring you.
not_available If he dies, it wouldn't ruin my day.
not_available But it just looks bad on the evening news.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll go in.
not_available Jeanie, hey.
not_available That was Pathology about Dana.
not_available Full workup will take a while.
not_available Looks like Ewing's sarcoma.
not_available Lf you want to beg off 
not_available No, I want to help.
not_available Good.
not_available Female, 77, found unconscious in her home.
not_available Her name is Emily Holmes.
not_available She says she has very good health coverage.
not_available We found her with BP 90/60, pulse 120.
not_available Started a line.
not_available She arrested en route.
not_available History? 
not_available No meds in the bathroom.
not_available Does she have any medical problems? I'm just her neighbor.
not_available She always seemed all right.
not_available Just forgetful.
not_available Let's get her on a monitor, There were three newspapers at her door, so I knew something was wrong.
not_available All right, I'm in.
not_available Bag her.
not_available Full compressions.
not_available V
not_available fib, no pulse.
not_available Charge, 200.
not_available Is she dead? What's happening? Can I help? 
not_available Everyone clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Sinus tach.
not_available I got a pulse.
not_available Why do you think she arrested? Could've had an MI.
not_available Could be septic, hypoxic, electrolyte imbalance.
not_available BP's 90 palp.
not_available Let's start her on dopamine.
not_available Let's get a 12
not_available lead.
not_available She's not out of the woods yet.
not_available Does that mean she's gonna die? That's a possibility.
not_available Do you know her family? I never saw anyone come to see her.
not_available I only ask because my sister's on a waiting list for an apartment in the building.
not_available I don't really understand why a biopsy was done for a broken leg.
not_available The fracture didn't match what Dana said had happened.
not_available It seemed unusual.
not_available How? 
not_available It may have been caused by a tumor.
not_available A tumor? 
not_available It weakened the bone.
not_available We have more tests but the biopsy showed blue cells, malignant cells.
not_available Are you saying she has cancer? Everything is still in the diagnostic stage.
not_available You're not certain, then.
not_available The indication is that there is a sarcoma.
not_available So you should speak with an oncologist.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Oh, here she is.
not_available Hey, honey.
not_available How are you feeling? Did you hear how it happened? It was so stupid.
not_available I'm sure you played a hard game.
not_available How much longer? With detonators, all this damn wire I hate amateurs.
not_available The wacko must have spent hours wrapping this.
not_available Oh, God, his guts! His guts are coming out under this stuff.
not_available Don't cut any more, okay? That's small intestine.
not_available It's all wrapped up in the wire.
not_available His pulse is getting weaker.
not_available We gotta get him to the ER.
not_available Is that black box a bomb? I got rid of the dynamite.
not_available Let's be safe and wrap it in a ballistic blanket.
not_available If it blows, no one gets hurt except Boris.
not_available Zadro, get the gurney down here now.
not_available We're moving him out.
not_available Dr.
not_available Olivas said that with these digital hearing aids he'll be able to understand and talk as well as you and I.
not_available So he won't be deaf? His residual hearing is something that we can work with.
not_available If he does the treatment twice a week for an hour.
not_available One of us has to be with him.
not_available I can do that.
not_available Well, so can I.
not_available This treatment It's natural hearing input.
not_available The more we talk to him, the better his speech will develop.
not_available You're gonna be okay, honey.
not_available Hear that? You're gonna be okay.
not_available Of course he is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There is one thing, though.
not_available This hearing aid is expensive and my insurance won't cover it.
not_available Why won't they? If no one's covered, neither are the elderly.
not_available Oh, that's so low.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I hate asking this but it's $5000 and I've only got $2700 in the bank.
not_available So I was Peter, I said that we share everything and I meant everything, okay? It means we share everything.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Just be happy that something can be done.
not_available Okay? PH, 7.32.
not_available PO
not_available 2, 345 on 100 percent.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Turn it down to 50 percent.
not_available Check another gas in a half an hour.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is this Emily Holmes? 
not_available Yes.
not_available John Carter.
not_available She was found in her apartment.
not_available Margo Aikin.
not_available I authorize admissions for Blue Beacon, her HMO.
not_available This lady's a DNR.
not_available She came in full arrest.
not_available She didn't have any papers or any family.
not_available Let's step outside.
not_available I don't know what your plans are, but I can't admit her.
not_available This patient's critical.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, I can't justify an expenditure of $5000 a day on a patient who should not be alive, does not want to be alive.
not_available I wasn't gonna let her die.
not_available That's not what we do here.
not_available Her choice was not to be resuscitated.
not_available It's in the HMO file.
not_available That's the guideline I follow.
not_available She's on a vent.
not_available You have to take her.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available You tubed her.
not_available You take her.
not_available Four units O
not_available neg.
not_available What's his airway? 
not_available Intubated in the field.
not_available Hey, what's going on? 
not_available GSW.
not_available Bomb squad is coming with him.
not_available Bomb squad? This the guy with the dynamite? 
not_available Should be safe.
not_available "Should"? 
not_available Gunshot wound to neck and abdomen.
not_available BP was 100 palp.
not_available Very gently on my 
count One, two, three Open this blanket nice and easy.
not_available Eviscerated bowel.
not_available CBC, chem panel, coag, type and cross for four.
not_available Gram of cefotetan.
not_available Pressure's down to 85 systolic.
not_available I'll throw in a subclavian.
not_available You want O
not_available neg? Yeah.
not_available Two units.
not_available Bowel's wrapped around this chicken wire.
not_available What is this? May be a detonator.
not_available I won't know till it's open.
not_available Can it go off? 
not_available Lf there's a blasting cap.
not_available Just don't mess with it.
not_available Jeanie, let's irrigate with some saline.
not_available Let's get some sterile lap pads.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, man! We'll resect this mess in the O.R.
not_available You're coming with us.
not_available Someone get some scrubs for Officer Clark.
not_available Okay, I'm in.
not_available Hook me up.
not_available Pulse ox 98.
not_available Let me get this under there.
not_available Come on.
not_available Clean it out.
not_available Good.
not_available It's shorting! You got about five seconds! Everybody out of here! Out! Now! Let's go! All right! We've got an open bowel in here! Let's move, people! Let's get him up to the O.R.! 
not_available I got the line.
not_available O.R.
not_available 2 is ready.
not_available There you go.
not_available So this is shrimp? And what's the red shredded stuff? That's Maui onions.
not_available No pepperoni, cheese, tomatoes? 
not_available It's gourmet.
not_available The bomber spoiled my gourmet lunch.
not_available So the heroics give you an appetite? Oh, no.
not_available The running from the Trauma Room gave me an appetite.
not_available What is this lunch about? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available First a reading.
not_available "Performance Review, Dr.
not_available Douglas Ross, by Kerry Weaver, M.D." Where did you get that? 
not_available It was found in the copying machine.
not_available "Dr.
not_available Ross repeatedly demonstrates a complete disregard for policies and procedures.
not_available For example, in regard to patient discharge" Wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available "In spite of mandatory counseling to correct a history of disrupting workplace behavior Dr.
not_available Ross exhibits ongoing problems with impulse control." That's right, Kerry.
not_available I'm a psycho.
not_available She could've given that to the Pedes Review Committee.
not_available It's too late.
not_available I brought you here because I wanted you to toast the new Pedes ER 
Attending Me.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available A buddy on the committee told me at 6:00 a.m.
not_available I'm approved.
not_available They're telling Anspaugh right now.
not_available I am so proud of you.
not_available I am so thrilled.
not_available Aren't you thrilled? He's got his doubts a little bit, right? Whatever my doubts were, in all honesty I'm very happy for you.
not_available Happy for both of you.
not_available Mark, Rachel's here.
not_available She wants to see you.
not_available Sure.
not_available She seems a little upset.
not_available Honey, what's up? Dad, can you come outside? There's sort of a problem.
not_available He was ill when we left Vermillion.
not_available We got a rodeo in Louisville It's colic for sure.
not_available I ain't seen a load in 12 hours.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available My dad can help you.
not_available He's a doctor.
not_available Honey, I'm not a vet.
not_available Last time he got impacted, mineral oil enema did the trick.
not_available We don't have the facilities to treat animals, but we can find you a vet.
not_available Nearest large
not_available animal is in Buffalo Grove.
not_available Two hours in traffic.
not_available Dad, we gotta help him.
not_available Please? He's one of the finest roping horses there is.
not_available Poor thing.
not_available If he goes down in the trailer, he could die.
not_available That's right, miss.
not_available He sure could.
not_available That would be tragic.
not_available What's his name? Cherry Blossom.
not_available Say hi, Cherry.
not_available Hi, Cherry.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available My dad's gonna make you all better.
not_available It's clean.
not_available No money in tobacco, polluting chemicals, mining.
not_available It's like charity.
not_available But it's an investment.
not_available It's a White Hat Fund.
not_available What's the return? Over the past five years it's been about 7.9 percent.
not_available You got anything dirtier with a better upside? Sure, here you go.
not_available Pure 
petrochemicals Dr.
not_available Carter? My toe is feeling so much better since you retaped it.
not_available Good.
not_available Why don't we get together sometime? Maybe a little hot talk about dollar
not_available cost averaging I'm really not much of a customer these days.
not_available This isn't really a sales pitch.
not_available You work out? 
not_available Yeah, when I can find the time.

not_available It's been a rough day.
not_available The bomber and I'd like to get something out in the open.
not_available I know it's not been easy being with me.
not_available But if it's not working out, and if you and Carla are back together I'd appreciate hearing it from you.
not_available What? What are you? It's got nothing to do with that.
not_available You've been avoiding me.
not_available What's happened? I'm not avoiding you.
not_available I'm dealing with some things.
not_available Well, what things? What is it? Reece is hearing
not_available impaired.
not_available How bad? 
not_available He's profoundly deaf.
not_available Peter, I'm so sorry.
not_available I didn't tell you about it because it's private.
not_available I haven't been avoiding you.
not_available It's just that, you know what? I don't know how to talk about that.

not_available Okay.
not_available Here goes.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Good.
not_available Nice, even flow.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing? What's an oncologist? He's a doctor that deals with abnormal cell growth.
not_available He's a cancer doctor? Why can't you be honest with me? My parents were talking to an oncologist outside the room.
not_available He said something about amputation.
not_available They're with him right now.
not_available There were indications in your biopsy.
not_available You may have a tumor.
not_available That means they'll cut off my leg? The specialists will look at their options and then make a decision.
not_available Stop ducking my questions! Can't you be honest? All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Amputation offers us the best choice.
not_available I don't want to live without my leg.
not_available I'd rather be dead.
not_available When they finish diagnosis, they'll talk about all treatments.
not_available Treatments that could save my leg? The kind of tumor that you have amputation offers us the best chance.
not_available If they amputate is it certain I'll live? No.
not_available But it's your best shot, kiddo.
not_available If you were my daughter, I would try to persuade you to do it.
not_available Would you still do it if I said no? We get all the facts.
not_available It's a decision you and your parents will have to make together.
not_available Okay? You have power of attorney for over 700 clients? So you've never actually even met her? Yes.
not_available Yeah, any information that you Could you fax it over? I guess that's what we'll do.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Everything okay, Carter? Yeah, I intubated a DNR patient.
not_available HMO won't admit her, no family, only a lawyer with durable power.
not_available And he's never even met her.
not_available What are you thinking about? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I mean, should I extubate? It just seems kind of wrong.
not_available DNR means she did not want heroic measures.
not_available The real question is whether or not you're ready to do it.
not_available Have you ever done it? 
not_available Yeah, once.
not_available But I had family support.
not_available Vitals are stable, pulse ox 98.
not_available I weaned her off the dopamine.
not_available I'm going to turn off the vent.
not_available Do an apnea test.
not_available Should I get an Attending? 
not_available I already talked to Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available She's a DNR.
not_available She didn't want this.
not_available Spontaneous respiration.
not_available Just one breath.
not_available That might be it.
not_available No, she's breathing on her own.
not_available I'm gonna extubate.
not_available Let's give her five liters of oxygen.
not_available Hey, any luck? Dr.
not_available Greene wants an enema update.
not_available No.
not_available No movement yet.
not_available I'm learning all about taking care of horses.
not_available It might not hurt to let him out a bit, let him walk around.
not_available Movement's good for colic.
not_available You want to get in and give him a pat? Help me ease him out? I don't have any experience with horses.
not_available I never even touched one before today.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Just don't show any fear.
not_available And don't worry about showing him who's boss.
not_available Come on, Blossom.
not_available You got all these nice folks concerned about you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, good boy.
not_available Hey, now! You brought us some good luck, son.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Can we talk? 
not_available I was going out to see the horse.
not_available Yeah, it's important.
not_available What's up, Kerry? Let's go in the lounge.
not_available Did you know Doug Ross was made a Pedes Attending? That they're fixing up a suite of rooms for him? Yeah.
not_available He told me at lunch.
not_available Really? Oh.
not_available Well, I was told by the painters.
not_available I had to read it on a work form.
not_available What's going on around here? What do you mean? 
not_available Why was I left out of the loop? Kerry, Ross is the new Pedes ER Attending.
not_available That's a fact of life.
not_available We should learn to accept it and move on, okay? Wait a minute.
not_available How can I "move on" when you express disfavor about Ross as an Attending to my face and then celebrate his dubious achievement behind my back? Is this really about Ross? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, it's about Ross.
not_available I don't think he's qualified.
not_available The hospital doesn't agree.
not_available You're not angry about him.
not_available This is about you obsessing over a silly title.
not_available Make a decision, Kerry.
not_available You want to be a doctor or an administrator? I'm gonna go examine a horse.
not_available I finished my write
not_available ups on the chest pain and the altered mental status.
not_available I need you to cosign these charts before I go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Those PVCs? That's right.
not_available Shouldn't we give something for that? No.
not_available V
not_available tach! You shock that, right? Not this time.
not_available Watch.
not_available Vtach V
not_available fib then asystole.
not_available She's not suffering.
not_available It's what she wanted.
not_available I'll sign those charts now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? You spoke to our daughter about treatment.
not_available She's very upset.
not_available Why would you do that? Why did you advise against amputation? I didn't advise against it.
not_available I said it was her best chance.
not_available But you gave her other alternatives.
not_available We want her to live.
not_available So do I.
not_available But she has to accept what'll happen to her not end up fighting some edict that gets handed down.
not_available This is our decision, not hers.
not_available She's 15.
not_available She's old enough to be involved in decisions about her own health.
not_available Stay away from her.
not_available You don't speak to her again.
not_available Understood? All right.
not_available To survive, she needs your support.
not_available She has to feel that you are working for her, not against her.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available On the search committee for chief, have you set the days for meetings? Yes.
not_available I was sorry to get your message this morning that you won't have time to participate.
not_available I've shifted some things around and made some room.
not_available Really? We're getting together Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6 p.m.
not_available Lf you can make it.
not_available I'd like to be involved.
not_available Good.
not_available I've lived in worse places.
not_available It just needs fresh paint, some posters.
not_available I can live anywhere as long as I've got music.
not_available Sure you're up for this? 
not_available I worked for Best Buy.
not_available I assembled systems all day long.
not_available What have you got? Bose.
not_available Top of the line.
not_available This is a very expensive system.
not_available I guess these are the cables that go with that? Actually, those are RCA cables.
not_available You must've hooked up your VCR through your amplifier.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Some guy came over and hooked it all up.
not_available You got a CD? We could try this out.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available "Jimmy Smith." Jazz? 
not_available Jazz.
not_available Organ.
not_available I like it.

not_available It might even be therapeutic.
