not_available Say, "Ah." What the hell is that? 
not_available Narcan.
not_available Sublingual? Are we authorized for that?

not_available Perfusion sucks, no access.
not_available I was thinking an EJ.
not_available No, no, no, Gates, you cannot put in an EJ.
not_available Why not? Because it's out of your scope of practice, that's why.
not_available We're ten minutes out.
not_available Yeah, fine, I'll see you then.
not_available What was that? Unresponsive overdose ten minutes out with one cocky
not_available ass paramedic.

not_available we know, we know.
not_available We're still We're still making a decision.
not_available Spontaneous intestinal perfs, bleeding, neurodevelopmental delays Theoretical risk, Abby.
not_available I don't want to subject our child to an experimental protocol when we haven't exhausted all of the standard Because he still doesn't have an adequate blood pressure.
not_available Yes, but why just dopamine? Why not dobutamine and
not_available and an epi infusion? Don't micromanage.
not_available Don't you 
not_available I won't.
not_available Don't.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, why don't I just leave the consent form, just in case you change your mind? Excuse me.
not_available She's just trying to give him the best possible chance.
not_available From the second we walked in here she's been pushing this trial.
not_available Come on, Abby, that's ridiculous.
not_available Is it? Why do you always have to assume the worst about people? It's not about me being negative.
not_available It's I
not_available I'm You need to pay attention and wake up.
not_available This is our baby.
not_available Can you believe him? I think I think he's right.
not_available You don't really know the first thing about it, so Abby, maybe this new drug would turn everything around.
not_available I know it's tough, but I think we have to consider it.
not_available Now sometimes you just have to use your instincts about these things.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Shut up! Please, please, just shut up.
not_available You know, I
not_available I didn't ask you to come here.
not_available I didn't ask you to be involved.

not_available No, I ought to report you! Dr.
not_available Kovac was running the floor when Clemente had his meltdown.
not_available Yes, he was.
not_available And he was here the day that Clemente and his girlfriend came in with multiple gunshot wounds? Um, I believe so, I'd have to check the schedule.
not_available Yeah, he was.
not_available And he was there the day that he signed off on the diabetic whose family is now bringing a multi
not_available million dollar lawsuit against us.
not_available Donald, where you going with this? I've drawn up a press release announcing Dr.
not_available Kovac's dismissal.
not_available You're firing him? There was negligent management here.
not_available Shouldn't we give him a chance to defend himself? It is too late for that, Kerry.
not_available I'd like everyone to look this over before I send it out.
not_available This sounds right.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm, works for me.
not_available Look, I am the one who hired Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available But you didn't keep him here.
not_available You even said that you wanted Dr.
not_available Kovac to get rid of him, but he ignored you.
not_available That's not how it happened.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Not now.
not_available Uh, rehire me, please.
not_available I'm efficient, I'm personable, I'm a walking encyclopedia.
not_available I said not now.
not_available I'm not trying to toot my own horn, okay? But had Jerry wound up in the hands of Barnett or Lockhart, he'd be rapping with Tupac right now.
not_available Morris, I can't help you.
not_available I know I look good in this suit, I know I do.
not_available But I am not an ass
not_available kissing company man.
not_available I'm an asskissing ER man and I want my scrubs back! I said that I can't help you! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, please, please,

not_available Oh, my God, listen to me.
not_available Get off the floor, you idiot.
not_available You're embarrassing yourself.
not_available I don't care! I'm desperate! Please! 
not_available Stop it! I can't rehire you because I am no longer Chief of Staff.
not_available Third of Narcan, still no response.
not_available This isn't an overdose.
not_available I'm going to need a little cricoid here.
not_available I got it.
not_available I wasn't talking to you, Gates.
not_available All right, got it, I'm in.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Run of ten, systolic's only 78.
not_available and 50 of mannitol.
not_available Mannitol? He doesn't have a head bleed.
not_available Pratt, we don't know what this is.
not_available Until then, keep your mind open.
not_available Add a gram of ceftriaxone.
not_available You're throwing the kitchen sink at the guy.
not_available V tach, no pulse.
not_available Aww, damn, starting compressions.
not_available The strip looks weird.
not_available Why? It just doesn't look right, look.
not_available Uh, ST depressions and U waves.

not_available Still V tach.
not_available Resuming.
not_available What about periodic paralysis? What? 
not_available Potassium's in.
not_available Yeah, I got it wrong on the boards, I had to go back and look it up.
not_available It's a total zebra, Gates.
not_available It says something about being common in Asians.
not_available Treat with beta
not_available blockers, not KCL.
not_available Metoprolol.
not_available May I? Well, we've got nothing to lose.
not_available All right.
not_available The condition could have stopped his breathing.
not_available Okay.
not_available Holding compressions.
not_available Back in sinus.
not_available Wow.
not_available Periodic paralysis? Really pulled that one out of your ass.
not_available Sometimes you have to try everything.
not_available Even the kitchen sink, huh? Pratt, call the ICU.
not_available Stay with him until he gets upstairs.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, I need to talk to you! 
not_available Not now, Morris.
not_available No, no, it's an emergency.
not_available I mean, not like an emergencyemergency, but it's
not_available it's important.
not_available Find me later.
not_available I want I need I need my job back! Later! They didn't have sugar, so I brought the fake stuff.
not_available They don't allow coffee in here.
not_available No one's looking.
not_available You know, um when Eric was about three months old, he got this really terrible strain of pneumonia and ended up in the ICU.
not_available Do you remember that at all? You were so little.
not_available His kidneys were shutting down, and the doctors said he wasn't going to make it.
not_available Your father and I fought because he wanted us all to say good
not_available bye to him.
not_available He even dressed you up and brought you down to the hospital.
not_available Don't you remember any of that? Well, I wouldn't stand for it.
not_available I didn't care what the doctors said.
not_available It didn't matter what the doctors said.
not_available I wouldn't give up, I couldn't.
not_available Well, I'm not like you.
not_available I think we've proven that.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Abby, you are like me.
not_available You are like me.
not_available You have to find the strength to get Joe through this so you can take him home with you.
not_available I don't know if I can.
not_available Oh, Abby, you've spent your whole life getting strong enough to do this.
not_available Abby? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I I I know the fludrozalone trial scares you, and trust me, it scares me, too.
not_available But No, stay.
not_available Sometimes a long shot, you know, that weird kitchen sink thing, sometimes, sometimes it really works.
not_available What if something goes wrong? What if it goes right? 
not_available Can't take it back.
not_available I know that.
not_available Okay, let's do it.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available Day of 
life 15.
not_available Day seven of fludrozalone protocol.
not_available Baby's off pressors, weight's up 37 grams.
not_available Excellent.
not_available DC the antibiotics, decrease labs to QOD, and Baby Joe is now officially a feeder and a grower.
not_available We'll take that as a compliment.
not_available He's so alert.
not_available Eyes wide open.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Wonder what he's thinking.
not_available "Get a life, Mom." 
not_available Oh, gee, thanks.

not_available The two of you, go.
not_available Go away for awhile.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm here.
not_available That's obnoxious.
not_available Well, the nurses keep yakking.
not_available You could just ask them to stop talking.
not_available Oh, just go.
not_available Go on.
not_available Let's take a walk.
not_available It'll do us good.
not_available You're leaving her here? She'll be okay.
not_available Has anyone got any tape? How far was the gun from him? About ten inches or so.
not_available It's in the detective's report.
not_available That's funny, because there was no gunshot residue on Mr.
not_available Curtis' body.
not_available In fact, the autopsy shows that you would've had to have been at least five feet away.
not_available Well, maybe I was further.
not_available It's hard to say.
not_available Big difference between ten inches and five feet, Ms.
not_available Taggart.
not_available Mr.
not_available Evers, can I call you Byron? You're a very sharp guy.
not_available You got a bright future ahead of you.
not_available You think your boss is gonna want you chasing your tail now over a guy who just shot up a hospital and raped this woman here? Maybe we should call my boss and ask him.
not_available You think? 'Cause I talked to him just this morning.
not_available In fact, we confirmed our dinner for 7:15.
not_available We go to Gibson's every second Thursday for the rib eye.
not_available This guy was murdered.
not_available My job is to prosecute the law We're not talking about the law here, we're talking about time and money and how you're wasting both on a creep who deserved what he got.
not_available Now I'm going to give you this opportunity to drop this right now on your own, okay? Or you want me to handle it over a steak and a martini? Have you looked at the mail? 
not_available Nothing too urgent.
not_available You should maybe check the electric bill 'cause the water was cold this morning.
not_available How's it going? Hey.
not_available It's a little bit better today.
not_available Just get off? 
not_available Yeah, I'm exhausted.
not_available I'm going to go and grab some dinner at Ike's and then go home and crash.

not_available She still in your place? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She hasn't found anything.
not_available And, you know what, I'm never there.
not_available I should just give it up.
not_available Well, you don't have to make any decisions right now.
not_available I know, but we're a family.
not_available We can't just keep having slumber parties.
not_available Have you thought about what I asked? I have uh and I haven't.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll convince you later.
not_available You know, we have a great life together.
not_available I don't need a ring or a white dress to prove that I love you.
not_available I'll take love.
not_available We can save marriage for later.
not_available Luka I hope she's okay.
not_available Who, Neela? The NICU nurse.

not_available Well, that could take hours.
not_available If you overreact to every little blip and bleep in this place, you'll make yourself crazy.
not_available Page Doctor Raab.
not_available What? Why isn't anyone listening to me? Page Dr.
not_available Raab.
not_available Page Dr.

not_available He's getting a massage from a home care nurse.
not_available Your big daddy called, wants you to meet him outside.
not_available Really? Courtesy of Maxanoxx.
not_available Oh, come on, buck up, Morris.

not_available Corporate jet, actually.
not_available Sounds corny, but I never appreciated how great it is to have a job that really matters.
not_available That suit matters, Morris.
not_available You know, that day with Jerry was so terrible, but also kinda the best moment of my life.
not_available You know? Look at me now.
not_available So silly.
not_available Ah, well, you know, you're you're doing a service.
not_available I mean, you're educating the medical community for, uh Oh, it's a load of crap, Greg.
not_available We all know it, okay? 
not_available I sold out to the man.
not_available Well, I guess you never spoke to Kovac.
not_available No, he didn't return my calls.
not_available Well, he is pretty preoccupied these days.
not_available I guess I could always try doing this somewhere else.
not_available At least I figured out what's important, and I want to practice medicine again.
not_available I'm gonna go do my thing for the Critical Care Department.
not_available I'll see you around.
not_available All right, man.
not_available That waffle iron thief left AMA.

not_available What are you doing here? Well, the DA determined it was justifiable homicide.
not_available This is over.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available Every day I keep thinking they're gonna come and arrest me.
not_available Well, you stop worrying about that.
not_available Just focus on Alex.
not_available You talk to him about it? Uh he knows his dad has gone, but I need to talk to him more about it.
not_available You're a good mom.
not_available I just wanted to tell you that in person.
not_available Anything else you need The key here is the glucuronyl side group, which gives Maxanoxx higher specificity for the alpha one receptor.
not_available Why
not_available why invest in a course of Maxanoxx when we have cheaper drugs for pulmonary edema that are entirely effective? Well, you'll see here that a subgroup of patients had .4 fewer ICU days But there was no difference in the overall outcome.
not_available Do you know what one day in the ICU costs taxpayers? I mean, this hospital? Society? Morris.
not_available May I speak to you out here now? Not a good time, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Uh, you'll save money in the long run.
not_available Trust me.

not_available Excuse me a moment.
not_available What? What is it? Can't you
not_available can't you see I'm working? Kovac is gonna offer you the job.
not_available You know, stick with Lasix.
not_available Maxanoxx is a scam.
not_available You know, it's great Kovac offered Morris that attending spot.
not_available Well, he's like a stray dog.
not_available He'd just keep coming back.
not_available Hey, you know that blunt chest trauma today? Stuck a needle in the heart and got half a liter out of the pericardium.

not_available I'd say "Honey, wear the cute little pink dress," so you'd wear the jeans.
not_available I'd say, "What a nice little drawing you've done," and you'd throw it in the trash.
not_available I told you to be a lawyer and you became a doctor.
