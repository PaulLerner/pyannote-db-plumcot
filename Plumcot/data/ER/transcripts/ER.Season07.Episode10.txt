not_available The speech arrest you were experiencing was probably the result of a focal seizure.
not_available You'd lose all ability to comprehend, interact with the world around you.
not_available I had a biopsy While the tumor's adjacent to Broca's it hasn't invaded it yet.
not_available We'll do an awake craniotomy.

not_available Not with that attitude.
not_available You wanna end up working in a factory like me and your Uncle Don? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, you're damn right you don't.
not_available Want a good job, go to college.
not_available To go to college, you'll need a scholarship.
not_available You're a bright kid, but you won't get a scholarship with those grades.
not_available Well, maybe my grades would be better if I wasn't playing hockey all the time.
not_available Dad! It's okay, keep it.
not_available Nice tip.
not_available It's New Year's Eve.
not_available He's got a long day ahead of him.
not_available Sounds okay to me.
not_available Drive around Manhattan, listen to the radio talk to people, no brain surgery.
not_available Very funny.
not_available It's weird.
not_available You know, I've sent a couple thousand people to the O.R.
not_available And? 
not_available And I've never been myself.
not_available You're a virgin.
not_available I still have my appendix, my tonsils.
not_available The only general anesthetic I've ever gotten was in a dentist's chair.
not_available It's no different, really.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Pull a tooth, have my skull sawed open, it's pretty much the same thing.
not_available I mean the anesthesia.
not_available Except for the part where they wake me.
not_available At that point, you'll know things are going well.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Are you ready? Let's do it.

not_available That's funny.
not_available Dan Harris, auto versus garbage truck.
not_available Restrained passenger air bags deployed.
not_available I cleared his neck on the ride.

not_available All right, C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis, trauma panel and a UA.
not_available BP 130/92, pulse 116.
not_available My wife just bought those pants.
not_available Have you ever been in this hospital before? No, I haven't been in a hospital since my son was born.
not_available Give me 20 cc's of 1 % lido with bicarb.
not_available That's cold! Who's your family doctor? Klizowski at the Morgan Family Clinic.
not_available What are you doing? Putting a tube in your chest to reinflate your lung.
not_available I got a collapsed lung? 
not_available It happens with your type of injury.
not_available But you'll breathe easier once it's in.
not_available Thora
not_available Seal's ready.
not_available Is there anyone we can notify? 
not_available My wife, Debra.
not_available 28 French.
not_available Do you have the number? I can't remember.

not_available Let's culture the bone.

not_available Gram of Ancef and 100 of gent.
not_available Paul! 
not_available Give me a large Kelly.
not_available Paul! Dad, is that you? 
not_available Can you? Can you open that door? I need to see him.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available This is the father.
not_available I'm right here, son.
not_available Irrigation saline, sterile fourby
not_available fours.
not_available Dad? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They stuck a freaking tube in my chest.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Hook me up to low suction.
not_available I'm okay, though.
not_available Hey, you know, your mom's gonna be really pissed off about her truck.
not_available I'll tell her you were driving, okay? Hey, Cleo.
not_available Need some Xeroform over here.
not_available Paul? Don't be scared, Paul.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Be strong, now! Be strong.
not_available He's gonna be okay, right? 
not_available Looks like a tough kid.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available Are you finished? Yeah.
not_available I just need you to sign this.
not_available It's a power of attorney.
not_available Something goes wrong
not_available Something goes wrong, what? No heroic measures.
not_available No ventilators, no feeding tubes if there's no hope of meaningful recovery.
not_available You're going to be fine, Mark.
not_available Elizabeth, you're a surgeon.
not_available You know that
not_available That you're going to be fine.
not_available You don't want the responsibility? 
not_available It's unnecessary.
not_available I don't want to end up like that.
not_available Now you're being dramatic.
not_available So if I end up in a persistent vegetative state
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available What's in the ThoraSeal? 
not_available Minimal blood loss.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available No hemothorax.
not_available Mr.
not_available Harris? I need you to sign this consent for treatment for your son.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Radiology.
not_available What's he doing there? We had to get x
not_available rays of his leg.
not_available He'll probably need surgery.
not_available Can't you just put a cast on it? 
not_available The bone penetrated the skin.
not_available But there's no joints involved, and it's midshaft, so it'll probably heal nicely.
not_available Mr.
not_available Harris, I gotta take you for a head CT.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Head CT? CAT scan.
not_available It's pretty standard after you hit your head and lose consciousness.
not_available Did you tell her yet? Who? 
not_available Weaver.
not_available Oh, no, not yet.
not_available But it's part of my New Year's resolution.
not_available No, really.
not_available It is.
not_available You okay? Am I bleeding? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Did you call the furnace guy? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Last week.
not_available Is he coming over? You don't want the pipes to freeze.
not_available Larry let him in.
not_available Who's Larry? 
not_available Larry Corbin, the neighbor.
not_available In the blue house? 
not_available No, in the brown, actually.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available Oh, damn.
not_available You're gonna have to put on scrubs anyway.
not_available Scrubs? You were planning on coming in? Don't you think Burke might object? 
not_available You're probably right.
not_available It's gonna be pretty crowded in there.
not_available Mark, do you want me to come in? No, I'll be fine.
not_available You go get cleaned up.
not_available I can finish this.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've never been so claustrophobic before.
not_available Happens to many people.
not_available Is everything all right? Looks good, but a radiologist has to review the films.
not_available Can I sit up? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Let me know if you get lightheaded.
not_available We contacted the school.
not_available They're trying to reach Debra.
not_available God, I hope she doesn't get in a car accident rushing over here.
not_available Hey, can we see Paul before his operation? That depends on when the orthopedic surgeon can schedule the surgery.
not_available It's just his leg, right? 
not_available No, he had a head trauma.
not_available Trauma? What do you mean trauma? 
not_available He hit his head just like you did.
not_available He's stable now, but we observe head injuries carefully.
not_available You mean he could be unstable? 
not_available I'm sure he'll be fine.
not_available Oh, God, she's gonna think it's my fault again.
not_available What? Our first son died of SIDS.
not_available He'd be about 20 now.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah, he was 3 weeks old.
not_available I sent my wife out, you know, to get some rest you know, for herself for a couple hours.
not_available The baby had been up all night, finally fell asleep.
not_available I must have dozed off myself.
not_available Because I didn't wake until I heard her scream.
not_available She had come home to find Nathan had died in his crib.
not_available I mean, we didn't have baby monitors and stuff like you do nowadays.
not_available I mean, she didn't blame me.
not_available But I know I know that she thought if she'd stayed home that night he'd still be alive.
not_available There's no way you could have known.
not_available Stick out your tongue.
not_available Show me your teeth.
not_available Repeat after 
me Ready to rock 'n' roll.
not_available "Ready to rock 'n' roll.
not_available " 
not_available And that we are.
not_available So you know the procedure, you've had your meds.
not_available Anything on your mind? 
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available You won't see me in there, but I'll be talking to you.
not_available Good luck.
not_available We don't need it, but thank you, Mark.
not_available So, what are you here for? I'm Leo.
not_available I'm Mark.
not_available What are you here for? I've got something growing on my heart.
not_available I'm not sure how to say it.
not_available Myxoma? 
not_available No, but it sounds like that.
not_available Teratoma? How did you know? 
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Doctors get sick too, you know.
not_available I got something growing on my brain.
not_available What do they do for that? Same as you.
not_available Operate, take it out.
not_available Does it hurt? They told me it wouldn't hurt.
not_available You'll be asleep the whole time.
not_available And when you wake up, if you're sore, they'll give you medicine.
not_available This sucks.
not_available It'll be over before you know it.
not_available It still sucks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is Trauma 1 still open? Not for long.
not_available Blast injury to face coming in.
not_available A guy testing Roman candles.
not_available I have to park you until I find you a room.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No, I've been waiting three hours.
not_available Happy New Year.
not_available Okay, Gordy.
not_available Back to bed.
not_available Hey, Randi.
not_available Randi, get Blue Beacon on the phone.

not_available A guy in Curtain 2 has a beeper up his rectum.
not_available What? 
not_available Has it on vibrate.
not_available Can't figure out how he slipped it in.
not_available Ma'am? Never underestimate the elasticity of the anal sphincter.
not_available Excuse me, excuse me.
not_available You're the doctor who's taking care of my son, Paul Harris.
not_available The car accident? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Is he? Is he all right? They've arranged to send him up to the O.R.
not_available We need you now.
not_available Sats are dropping.
not_available To what? Seventy
not_available four.
not_available He was getting sleepy.
not_available But now we can't wake him.
not_available Heart rate down to 50.
not_available Paul! You want atropine? 
not_available Push a milligram.
not_available Rapid induction.
not_available Paul!

not_available I'm in.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Paul! Do you hear me? Be strong, Paul! Don't quit! 
not_available Hey, Mr.
not_available Harris.
not_available Feeling any better? 
not_available No.
not_available You got a collapsed lung.
not_available Blood bank's low.
not_available Weaver wants everybody to donate before their shift's over.
not_available I always do.
not_available That's very generous of you.
not_available That, and I get drunk for half as much when I'm down a pint.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Good news.
not_available Mr.
not_available Harris, your CT looks normal.
not_available I know, but this tube you stuck in my chest is killing me.
not_available Abby, give Mr.
not_available Harris here another 5 of morphine.
not_available We're gonna admit you and monitor you for a day or two.
not_available And then we'll take that tube out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Listen, did you find out anything at all? His oxygen level was low for a while.
not_available We're not sure why.
not_available Is that your son? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What are his sats? 
not_available 100% after intubation.
not_available GCS is 10.
not_available What's that mean? 
not_available It could be a bruise to the brain.
not_available We won't know for sure until after the scan.
not_available When is that? 
not_available Any minute now.
not_available Mr.
not_available Harris? Yes? 
not_available I'm Officer Darcy.
not_available How you doing? Well, I've been better.
not_available I have to write an accident report.
not_available Can you tell me what happened? Well, I You know, I honestly don't remember.
not_available One minute, I'm driving the car with my son.
not_available And then the next minute, the paramedics are just dragging me out.
not_available That guy came out of nowhere.
not_available You failed to stop for the red light.
not_available I would never do that.
not_available No, it wasn't my fault.
not_available Several witnesses say it was.
not_available I guess it's too late to change my mind now.
not_available Would you? 
not_available No.
not_available They took that kid in for a teratoma resection while you were gone.
not_available He was pretty freaked out.
not_available I'm sure they'll be here soon.
not_available Okay, time to go.
not_available Okay, you need help? 
not_available Nope, I've got it.
not_available You gonna go see a movie? 
not_available I'll be right outside.
not_available Hey, your hands are like ice.

not_available For the burr hole, I'll need a Midas Rex with an M
not_available 8 bit.
not_available Then I'll switch to a V
not_available 1 for the bone flap.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Burke? You said you'd give me a little something to take the edge off.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Burke? So, what? It's a coma? 
not_available It's not what you think of as a coma.
not_available He's having what we call "purposeful movements.
not_available " And the CAT scan shows there's no sign of hemorrhage or skull fractures.
not_available You know, he's unconscious, but if you'd like to talk to him I'm pretty sure he'll be able to hear you.
not_available Hey, son.
not_available It's time to wake up now.
not_available You ready to go home? Well, you gotta open your eyes.
not_available Every day, I used to do this to get him up for school.

not_available How many? Three.

not_available I thought you might like some company.
not_available Nice hat.
not_available Thanks.
not_available All right, Mark.

not_available You used to think I was gonna drop him.
not_available Remember that? Paul.
not_available Debra, I ran a red.
not_available We were arguing about him quitting hockey, and the music was really loud.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I must have missed the light change.
not_available Honey, it was an accident.
not_available Debra, I'm sorry.
not_available Mr.

not_available We should get you back to bed.
not_available I wanna stay with my son.

not_available I think you'd feel more comfortable if you were lying down.
not_available No, I wanna stay here! Debra? How's your breathing? Having any chest pain?

not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Cool saline, please.
not_available Sats are 92.
not_available What's happening? Electronic stimulation
not_available induced seizure.
not_available Dousing the brain with saline should cool it down.
not_available You said you'd be home at 5.
not_available Mark.
not_available It's now 9:00.
not_available Give him Ativan.
not_available We can't sedate him, we won't be able to talk to him.
not_available Cancel the surgery.
not_available Try propafol.
not_available What else can you do? Give it a minute.
not_available Too severe.
not_available Mark! Mark! 
not_available He's postictal.
not_available What now? We can't resect the tumor until he's awake and alert.
not_available Mark.
not_available Mark, it's Elizabeth.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Mark, come on home.
not_available Mark, we need you to talk to us.
not_available Mark.
not_available That's a good gag with the scope.
not_available He might be lightening up.
not_available Mark? Come on, Mark.
not_available Come on, buddy.
not_available Try and wake up.
not_available Mark! No response to painful stimuli.
not_available His eyes are open, but he's out of it.
not_available How long since the seizure? 
not_available Half an hour.
not_available Still no significant change in GCS.
not_available Maybe we should close up and come back in a few days.
not_available In a few days? You've just opened his skull.
not_available Hey, what? What's going on out there? You had a seizure during mapping, Mark.
not_available We had to wait.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Keep going.
not_available You heard the man.
not_available Dr.
not_available Malcolm?

not_available Come on now, Mark.
not_available Things that begin with B.
not_available Baby.
not_available Boy.
not_available So you think we're gonna have a boy, do you? Just a hunch.

not_available Is that bad? 
not_available You could be at risk for heart attack.
not_available We need to admit you for observation.
not_available Did they start his surgery? My son.
not_available They took him to the Operating Room for his leg.
not_available But nobody's told me how he's doing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac can find out for you.
not_available Good luck, Mr.
not_available Harris.
not_available Happy New Year.
not_available Were you having chest pain before your collision? No, I don't remember anything.
not_available Did you pass out? 
not_available What do you mean? With angina, you can get an irregular heartbeat.
not_available And that can cause you to pass out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Because your heart doesn't pump enough blood to your brain.
not_available Could that have caused my accident? 
not_available It happens a lot.
not_available So it wasn't my fault? What?
