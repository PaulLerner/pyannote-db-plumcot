not_available You go first.
not_available I know I've been somewhat closed
not_available off about all this but I was afraid that if I discussed it with you, you'd convince me to stay.
not_available Well, I certainly would have tried.
not_available But you know what?.
not_available It's a good thing you're going.
not_available lt is?.

not_available Okay, I'm gonna do everything that I can to make that happen.

not_available Frank really out did himself.
not_available I took Mr.
not_available Walters up to the MRA suite, they' re gonna try and squeeze him in.
not_available What?.
not_available Nothing.
not_available If it turns out to be an aneurysm, they can embolize it if it's caught early.
not_available You don't think Neela noticed that you weren't there?.
not_available I meant to go, but I was dealing with this
not_available You couldn't find five minutes to stop by?.
not_available Gates, I'm signing out to Morris for a while.
not_available It's me.
not_available I'm at the airport.

not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank God for this storm or you'd be somewhere over Missouri by now.
not_available Geography's pretty good for a foreigner.
not_available Look, l, umI just
not_available I thought that if I didn't catch you now, then maybe we'd never speak again.
not_available Today's been strange and difficult.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available For me too.
not_available Oh, and don't mutter in Spanish when you're angry.
not_available It's a cliche.
not_available I understand a lot more than you think I understand.
not_available Fine, you win.
not_available I'll stay home with my hair in curlers, knitting and baking.
not_available You know that's not what I'm talking about.
not_available Apple pie or cherry?.
not_available lf you'd just listen to what I'm saying.
not_available Give up, Archie.
not_available This conversation is over.

not_available story fall with LOC, that's all I know.
not_available What the hell is that?.
not_available It's something for Neela.
not_available It's her last day.
not_available Pinata?.
not_available What is she, 5?.
not_available It's not just any pinata
not_available I had this custom made.
not_available It's a Gandhi pinata.
not_available That is scary.
not_available Uh, not to mention offensive.
not_available Who's gonna wanna bash Gandhi's head in with a bat?.
not_available You have no sense of culture.
not_available Gary Walters, 53, fell head
not_available first down a flight of stairs after a few too many.
GARY I slipped on the rug.
not_available Observed LOC, awake at scene, but disoriented.
BRENNER Do you know what day it is?.
not_available I told you, I slipped on the rug.
not_available Okay, Gates, what do you want?.
not_available Uh, head CT, C
not_available spine, trauma labs, tox screen and, uh, ETOH level.
SAM I'm on it.
not_available Good.
not_available And, uh, get him to surgery.
not_available They're gonna need to see him.
not_available Neela's already on the floor.
not_available She's guarding.
not_available How's the CBC?.
not_available First was good.
not_available Send a repeat now.
not_available Does anything hurt you, ma'am?.
not_available Remember what happened today?.
REBECCA Nobody will listen.
not_available Drove her motorcycle into the museum warning about the end of the world.
not_available Psych history?.
not_available lt seems.
not_available I'll check if she has a record here.
REBECCA Equilibrium is shifting.
not_available I thought that was just me on account of it being my last day here.
not_available It's Claudia's first day back at work.
MARQUEZ Good.
MORRlS I mean, I'm not sure that it is.
not_available LFTs and lipase are normal.
not_available I think, ma'am, you might be my last surgical case.
not_available I thought I was okay with it.
not_available I really did.
not_available It's her job and I respect that, but she got shot.
not_available Why couldn't I fall for a nice librarian?.
not_available A librarian in Springfield died last month.
not_available Bookshelf fell on her.
not_available I swear, it was in the paper.
not_available Guys, we need a surgeon in here.
NEELA Andrew, check the tox screen and let Dubenko know we've got a possible laparotomy.
not_available What've you got?.
not_available fell down a staircase.
not_available Multiple contusions to head, hip and back.
not_available Decreased on the left, sats in the 8Os.
not_available Hello, I'm Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Do you remember falling?.
not_available I was dizzy, I guess I tripped.
not_available Smells like ETOH was involved.
not_available Belly's benign, I figured you'd sign off.
not_available Happy to help.
not_available SONY 
A Thank God.
GARY I'm fine.
not_available You're not fine.
not_available Just a few scrapes and this headache won't go away.
not_available All right, a little pinch here.
not_available What are you doing?.
not_available Well, he may have broken a rib when he fell, punctured a lung.
not_available Tube'll help inflate it.
not_available When is this gonna stop?.
not_available It's not even 1 0.
not_available Mom, don't start.
not_available Woke up this morning with a headache.
not_available It's called a hangover.
not_available I just needed something for the pain.
not_available He's a drunk, but you've probably figured that out by now.
not_available Let the doctors work.
not_available Two people ahead.
not_available Type and cross and let me know when the scan is back, please.
not_available Sorry, uh, my in
not_available laws have been through some messy stuff.
not_available No worries.
NEELA We all have messes in our past.
not_available Shouldn't have been hard on you.
not_available Wasn't the best way to end things.
not_available You were right.
not_available I was righteous.
not_available Which isn't my best quality, honestly.
not_available For my whole adult life, I've been doing exactly what you said.
not_available I'm not sure what you mean.
not_available Disappearing.
not_available Using sex as an escape or worse, as a weapon, a way of disarming people.
not_available Look at you two.
not_available So sweet.
not_available Like nobody else is in the room.
not_available You want another round?.
not_available Uh, sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm in.
not_available 0
not_available silk, elastoplast.
not_available I'll get the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Hey, guys, look.
not_available lrregular rhythm, looks like A
not_available fib.
not_available Nice pick up.
not_available Do you have a history of atrial fibrillation?.
not_available He didn't tell you?.
not_available You didn't tell them?.
not_available I don't know, I forgot.
not_available Forgot.
not_available That's a load of crap.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What meds is he on?.
not_available Uh, calcium blockers and some other pill to thin his blood.
not_available Coumadin.
not_available He's bad about taking his meds.
not_available He drinks.
not_available He forgets.
not_available Or at least that's what he says.
not_available But really, it's a death wish.
not_available He thinks if he doesn't take his pills he'll figure out a way to disappear.
not_available Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
not_available Today of all days, you couldn't control yourself?.
not_available What's so special about today?.
not_available It's been 1 O years.
not_available SONY 
A Here we go.
not_available He has this pathetic need to tell everyone.
not_available Mom.
not_available Please.
not_available Um, today is the anniversary of their son's death so everyone's a bit tense.
not_available My dad blames himself.
not_available I let Timmy go.
not_available I'll be outside.
LlLY Mom.
not_available Sam, add an lNR and rush the head scan, please.
not_available I keep thinking it's gonna get easier, it doesn't.
NEELA Staircase fall in 1 with a pneumo and a headache and a motorcycle crash in 2 with a seatbelt sign.
not_available Okay, sounds good.
not_available Who do you want me to see first?.
not_available Motorcycle looks like she might need O.R.
not_available and you know what?.
not_available This'll be case number 25OO.
not_available 25OO?.
not_available No way.
not_available Y eah, can you believe it?.
not_available I'll have logged That's impressive.
not_available Serial crits?.
not_available Not back yet.
not_available Ah, surgeons, perfect timing.
not_available I have a question for you.
MARQUEZ Haldol's in.
NEELA How's she doing?.
not_available Fast is negative, CBC's good.
DUBENKO Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Dubenko.
not_available Reckoning is here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why are eschatological delusions common among psychotic patients?.
not_available Escha
not_available what?.
not_available Eschatology.
not_available Pertaining to the end of the world.
not_available I checked, no psych hospitalization at County.
not_available She doesn't look familiar.
not_available There's no hiding from the fifth cycle.
not_available Okay, sweet dreams, my dear.
not_available Your girlfriend gets shot on the job.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Seeing that you care about her and want her to not die you gently suggest that she do another job.
not_available Is that sexist?.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available Tomato, ""tomato.
not_available "" 
not_available What?.
not_available Rigid abdomen, probably needs the O.R.
not_available You can scrub in.
not_available Awesome.
not_available She's seizing.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Look out.
not_available I see that.
not_available Two of Ativan.
not_available Crank up O2.
not_available Haldol lowers the seizure threshold.
not_available Call me when she's ready for the scanner.
not_available Andrew, let's go.
not_available You want me to cover the ER?.
not_available Forget about the ER, meet us upstairs.
not_available You've got to log case number 2500.
not_available What's with him?.
NEELA Denial, avoidance.
not_available Fear.
not_available There's so many things I've missed out on because I was afraid.
not_available Well, you're obviously not afraid to fly in really bad weather.
not_available You know, when I was 6 my, um, aunt took me to a toy store and gave me 5 pounds and said I could buy anything I wanted.
not_available I wandered around the store for what seemed like hours terrified I'd choose the wrong thing.
not_available Wrong doll and my sister would laugh.
not_available Wrong book, my brothers would take it.
not_available Wrong teddy, the kids at school would think I was a baby.
not_available I left the store with nothing.
not_available My father put the money in the bank.
not_available Sensible kid.
not_available Well, the point is, is that for as long as I can remember I've carried this irrational dread of making a mistake.
not_available It's with me all the time.
not_available And why on earth I decided to become a doctor where the cost of a mistake is so high.
not_available It's insane.
not_available It's masochistic.
not_available I know.
not_available And this is all my way of saying I know I helped screw things up.
not_available I'm not following.
not_available Well, there's
not_available So many times in my life, I've
not_available I've failed to take a chance.
not_available Even when it was clear to everyone else, including me, that I should have.
not_available That's why I gotta go.
not_available Even if it scares the hell out of me.
not_available I just don't want to be that person anymore, you know?.
not_available Me either.
not_available Don't worry, Neela.
not_available I'm not here to try and convince you to stay.
not_available Then why are you here?.
not_available I really, really don't know.
not_available How'd you get past security?.
not_available Don't you have to have a ticket?.
not_available You bought a ticket.
not_available So you got any, um, good ideas of things to do in Detroit?.
not_available Detroit?.
not_available Y eah, well, it was the only way.
not_available It just seemed wrong.
not_available It just seemed terribly wrong to let you go and not even say goodbye.
not_available Do you wanna take a walk?.
not_available Head looks good, Mr.
not_available Walters.
not_available No bleeding.
not_available You didn't need to stay for this.
not_available I know.
not_available I wanted to.
GARY Jay was my boy's best friend.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available He pulled Tim out of the water.
not_available Did CPR for an hour till the coast guard got there.
not_available Let's not go there, okay?.
not_available After the funeral, everyone got on with their lives.
not_available Jay came by every day just to check on us.
not_available It was just an excuse to flirt with your daughter.
not_available lt looks like it worked.
not_available We've been married three years now.
not_available I lost Tim, but you became like a son to me.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available At least you're affectionate when you're drunk.
DUBENKO You guys having a party?.
not_available We need the scanner.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Walters.
not_available How are you feeling?.
not_available My head's killing me.
not_available But the, uh, CT's clear.
not_available No bleed?.
not_available No edema?.
not_available Who's that?.
not_available The other case.
not_available Staircase fall.
not_available Uh, did you think of tapping him?.
not_available Uh, tap him?.
not_available Why?.
not_available I don't wanna miss subarachnoid bleed.
not_available Could be the cause and not show up on the CT.
not_available That's pretty rare.
not_available Extremely rare.
not_available I know, but the cause of his dizziness, the headache before the fall.
not_available He was drinking.
not_available Well, his ETOH wasn't all that high.
not_available Not for a chronic alcoholic.
not_available We don't tap all our negative CTs.
not_available Well, if it was up to me we would.
not_available Let's not risk missing something we can fix.
not_available You on board with this?.
not_available Me?.
not_available I trust her instincts.
not_available She's gonna be her own boss starting tomorrow so I don't have much leverage, really.
not_available The ad said snake charmer.
not_available I brought tarantulas too if you think she'd prefer that.
not_available No, I was thinking of a turban and a flute and a snake in a basket.
not_available Not this S &amp; M getup.
not_available People dig the outfit.
not_available lt won't work.
not_available Go.
not_available Here.
not_available For your trouble.
not_available What was that?.
not_available Ah, when Neela first got here, we kind of got off on the wrong foot.
not_available I said some things I shouldn't have said about her ethnic background, and.
not_available Frank, come on.
not_available That was six years ago, I'm sure she's over it.
not_available Well, I would just like to show her how much I've changed.
not_available Why don't you try something simple, like flowers.
not_available Flowers?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's not even remotely original or cultural.
not_available Just because her parents were born in lndia doesn't mean she's gonna appreciate some kind of lndian cliche.
not_available In fact, she may very well find it offensive.
not_available What?.
not_available She's English, Frank.
not_available Okay, so a Gandhi pinata or a turbaned snake charmer is gonna end up working against you here.
not_available Well, thank you, Sam, I'll take that under advisement.
not_available No free fluid.
not_available Aorta's intact.
not_available And lVC.
not_available Kidneys look functional.
not_available Ureters.
not_available I know how to read an abdominal scan.
not_available Of course you do.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available I'll meet you in the O.R.
not_available The O.R?.
not_available But the scan's perfect.
not_available Rigid abdomen, it's surgical.
not_available Doesn't matter what the scan says.
not_available Her vitals are good, her counts are unchanged.
not_available Why not watch her in the lCU, move her at first sign of instability?.
not_available By then she'll be unstable.
not_available Lucien
not_available Small bowel perforation, mesenteric injury.
not_available Let's not risk missing something we can fix, right?.
not_available Meet you in the O.R.
not_available in 1 0.
not_available Sometimes there can be a head bleed which we can't see on CT.
not_available A more sensitive test is to place a small needle into the spinal canal and remove some fluid.
not_available If the lab finds red blood cells then we know there's a problem.
not_available What are the risks?.
not_available Infection and bleeding are the main ones, but we'll take precautions to avoid both.
not_available What do you think, Jay?.
not_available Right.
not_available Fluro's here, so we should step out.
not_available Hang in there, Dad.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner, no disrespect but, uh, this is stupid.
not_available His mental status is getting worse, we don't have a good explanation.
not_available Subarachnoid bleed's a theory.
not_available Except that he's on Coumadin.
not_available The chances of bleeding complications is higher than even finding a problem.
not_available His lNR is less than two.
not_available There's something subtle that led Neela to ask for this.
not_available Yeah, it's her last day, she doesn't wanna make a mistake.
not_available But she'll feel bad if the procedure leads to an uncontrollable spinal bleed.
not_available Got your LP kit.
not_available I'm not gonna do it.
not_available We'll use Fluro, give FFP, it'll be fine.
not_available You will be there to assist.
not_available We could go in laparoscopically.
not_available Have a look.
not_available We'll be doing it open.
not_available Recovery time would be easier.
not_available I'm aware of advantages of laparoscopy.
not_available All serial ultrasounds are fine, normal CT, vitals are good, crit is stable.
not_available You wanted to log 2500 surgeries.
not_available Don't rush a patient to surgery because you're mad at me.
not_available I'm not mad.
not_available I'm amused by your narcissism but the patient has a surgical abdomen, okay?.
not_available I suggest it is your judgment being clouded by the significance of the day.
not_available Lucien, please.
not_available Why don't you say what you need to?.
not_available I don't need to say anything.
not_available One minute you're strange and loopy, the next you're gritting your teeth.
not_available Look, it isn't personal.
not_available Maybe you can just wish me luck.
not_available I'd like to, but I can't.
not_available I can't accept the fact that you've accepted a job at an academically and clinically inferior institution to spite me.
NEELA Oh, now who's the narcissist?.
ANDREW Patient is prepped, Ancef is running.
DUBENKO Can't wish you luck, I want you to hate it.
not_available You are unbelievable.
not_available I haven't spent these years helping you be an incredible talent so you could work at a B
not_available list institution.
not_available T en blade to Dr.
not_available Wade.
ANDREW Sweet.
NEELA It's not B
not_available list, you're a snob.
not_available You're better than that place.
not_available They have a busy trauma service and catchment area.
DUBENKO No medical school, research.
not_available Which allows me my time in the O.R.
not_available Why can't you respect that?.
DUBENKO I imagined something better for you.
NEELA No, it's not what you imagined for you.
not_available Which is fine.
not_available But it's my life.
not_available If I stay here, I'll always be your protegee, little Neela.
not_available It's time to move on.
DUBENKO What the hell are you doing?.
not_available You just contaminated yourself.
not_available Hyperpigmentation.
ANDREW Starting the incision.
not_available Andrew, wait, stop.
not_available Go and get the Woods Lamp.
not_available Why?.
not_available Just get it.
not_available Go.
not_available Now.
not_available Bingo.
not_available Wow! Hey, what the hell?.
NEELA Call Heme, they'll admit her.
not_available Heme?.
NEELA Doesn't have internal bleed, she's acute porphyria.
DUBENKO Disorder of heme synthesis pathway.
NEELA Rigid abdomen, hyperpigmentation on the extremities psychosis, seizures, it all fits.
not_available Y eah, she's the right age for first presentation.
not_available Okay, reverse the anesthesia, she doesn't need surgery.
not_available I guess 2499 will have to be enough.
not_available That's a big needle.
not_available Y eah, well, if we've done our job right, he won't feel a thing.
not_available You do a lot for their family.
not_available I've no choice, I married into it.
not_available Lily's worth it, though.
BRENNER That's better.
not_available I'm in.
not_available I don't feel right.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Almost done.
not_available Gary?.
not_available You okay?.
not_available Take the needle out.
not_available Almost done.
not_available Take the needle out.
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Another unit of FFP.
not_available Mr.
not_available Walters?.
not_available Mr.
not_available Walters?.
not_available All right, Jay, talk to him.
not_available His heart rate is 48.
not_available Wake up, do you hear me?.
BRENNER Transcutaneous pacer.
GATES Atropine in.
not_available Chase it with epi.
not_available I've lost the pulse.
not_available Oh, my God, what's happening?.
not_available His heart is beating dangerously slow.
not_available It could be a vagal reflex or to do with what's going on in his brain.
GATES Overdosed on the calcium blockers?.
not_available Let's get 500 of calcium gluconate.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Atropine and set up for a dopa infusion.
not_available Let's pace him.
not_available lt was a fight, okay?.
not_available A stupid fight.
not_available Increase voltage.
not_available We need a hand in here.
not_available I meant to tell you so many times.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available lncrease the volume.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available He slipped.
not_available lt was an accident.
not_available All right.
not_available Quiet.
not_available We got capture.
not_available It's a strong carotid.
not_available This is good.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'll go let the family know he's okay.
not_available Jay.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available I met a man today who accidentally killed his best friend.
not_available That's awful.
not_available They were out on a boat, and they got into a fight over a girl.
not_available And the guy punched his friend and he tripped and fell overboard.
not_available And that was that.
not_available They brought the friend to the ER?.
not_available This happened 1 0 years ago.
not_available Now, the guy never told the family the truth until today.
not_available And for years they were
not_available Well, their lives just stopped.
not_available Sad.
not_available Y eah.
not_available Thank you for helping me see that I was stuck too.
not_available You know, I'm the last person who should be telling
not_available Neela, look, you were right.
not_available I can't love anyone until I sort some stuff out.
not_available But maybe, because of you, I've started to do that.
not_available Simon
not_available This is why I came here.
not_available Neela, this really
not_available God, this mattered so much to me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for saying that.
not_available You know, it's gonna be so weird not to see you all every day.
not_available Frank, the soft collar ever come down from central?.
not_available Yes.
HALEH Were you gonna tell me or keep me waiting?.
not_available I forgot.
not_available So shoot me.
not_available Don't tempt me.
not_available Could you get it please?.
not_available No.
not_available No?.
not_available Oh, I'm gonna miss this.
not_available Neela.
not_available Morris has a complicated hand lac he wants you to look at.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, might be my last consult.

not_available Brenner.
not_available Have you seen Archie around?.
not_available I'm here.
not_available What is going on?.
not_available Come with me.
not_available I stuck myself with a needle today and it made me realize that I was an ass this morning about your work thing.
not_available An ass.
not_available I get it, Archie.
not_available What's with the pie?.
not_available A symbol of my temporary chauvinism and a gesture of apology.
not_available My original idea was to bake you a pie wearing nothing but an apron but I had to work late and I don't own an apron.
not_available Me either.
not_available See?.
not_available We're perfect.
not_available If you can handle being with a guy who gets stuck by needles and kicked by patients and takes an occasional slug of radiation to his cojones.
not_available What are you talking about?.
not_available Well, then I can certainly stomach some occasional gunfire.
not_available As long as you promise not to get shot again.
not_available What?.
not_available See, I just wanted to see how much Spanish you really understand.
GRAHAM See that?.
GATES Y eah, I think so.
BRENNER Ten
not_available millimeter aneurysm at the vertebrobasilar junction.
not_available The headache he had was probably the initial leak.
GRAHAM Yeah, leak was tiny.
not_available No way it would show up on CT.
not_available More contrast, please.
not_available By all rights, this thing should have been missed.
not_available It's nice work.
not_available Neela was right.
GRAHAM We use electrolytically detachable coils to fill the lumen.
BRENNER Cool.
GRAHAM Clot forms around the coils, blocking off the aneurysm Ieaving the vessel open.
not_available Dometoneck ratio looks
not_available Damn it.
not_available Stop the heparin.
ANESTHESlOLOGlST It's off.
not_available What's happening?.
not_available Coil went beyond the confines of the road map.
not_available You ruptured the aneurism?.
not_available Looks that way.
not_available Contrast.
not_available Doesn't he need the O.R?.
not_available We can continue with softer coil.
not_available I'm not waiting around to test that theory.
GATES Heart rate's down.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Brenner from the ER.
not_available I need an O.R.
not_available and a neurosurgeon for an acute cerebral hemorrhage.
not_available I believe that's my call to make.
not_available Get the portable monitor.
ANESTHESlOLOGlST Systolic's 62.
not_available lt'll limit the bleeding.
not_available And deprive the brain of oxygen.
ANESTHESlOLOGlST What are you doing?.
not_available Taking care of my patient.
GATES I got the femoral site covered.
GRAHAM This is totally out of line.
not_available I'm gonna write you guys up.
not_available Hey.
not_available You're still here?.
not_available I crashed in the call room for a bit.
not_available The, uh, the surgeons were able clip the aneurism quickly so the bleeding was contained to a very small area.
not_available Is he gonna have brain damage?.
not_available He's got a very good chance of doing well.
not_available But we won't know the answer to that for a while.
not_available Where is your wife?.
not_available She went home for a shower.
not_available I don't know what she's gonna do now.
not_available About us.
not_available You two will work through it.
not_available Easy for you to say.
BRENNER The truth is a time bomb.
not_available But once it's out, it can't hurt you anymore.
not_available You can move on, you can move forward.
not_available Get some rest, Jay.
not_available I'll, um
not_available I'll drop by later.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll appreciate that.
MAN 
not_available bill to crack down on experiments on animals is to become law today.
not_available Animal
not_available rights activists have been pushing for the bill for nine years and have taken part in mass demonstrations.
not_available The bill will outline just what animals will be allowed to be used in labs along with penalties.
not_available How are you doing?.
not_available Fine, you?.
not_available Sure.
not_available Fine.
DUBENKO Andrew, what do you think of the patient's tachycardia?.
not_available Uh, probably volume
not_available related but could be due to fever, pain, infection.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Good, more.
ANDREW Uh, drug withdrawal, toxins, vascular.
not_available More.
not_available Uh, trauma, iatrogenic.
not_available Neela never taught you VlNDlCATE?.
not_available No.
not_available It's my favorite mnemonic for post

not_available you will never miss major complication.
