not_available I think one of the kids from the coffee shop broke into the apartment.

not_available I don't believe in breakfast.
not_available It's the most important meal of the day.
not_available That's never been medically proven.
not_available Why are you up? It's morning.
not_available I got coffee, bagels and a real
not_available estate paper.
not_available I'm thinking I should get a new place.
not_available What, did the hotel fire you for getting up too early? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, somebody should.
not_available Hey! Look, there is an entire warehouse in here for the price of some condos.

not_available Especially in the summer when all you smell is dead flesh.
not_available That's the slaughterhouse district.
not_available It's still a good deal.
not_available You know, first you live in a boat, then a hotel, and now a meat plant.

not_available You'll just have to be a little quieter.
not_available Me?

not_available These are good eggs.

not_available It was my job to determine if the patient needed to be admitted.
not_available For a psych hold? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And it was your professional opinion that she did? Dr.
not_available Legaspi? Yes.
not_available She was confused about her sexual identity.

not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available You're quiet this morning.
not_available I was just thinking.
not_available About? 
not_available Nothing important.
not_available I hope you're not worrying about this silly competency evaluation.

not_available They're merely a formality.
not_available NASA astronauts take fewer tests.
not_available If I don't score above average
not_available Mark, stop.
not_available You're a brilliant doctor regardless of whether you put a round peg in a square hole.
not_available Where did you hear I put a round peg in a square hole? Hey, easy.
not_available You don't want to shake up that kid more than he has to be.
not_available Listen, our baby's fine.
not_available I've taken every necessary precaution.
not_available I've been extremely careful.
not_available I haven't had a contraction in two weeks.
not_available You still need to take it easy.
not_available I'm medicated, I'm monitored.
not_available I'm more than able to go back to work.
not_available So stop being such a nervous Nellie.

not_available And 
two If you overdo it, you can go into preterm
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available I am a doctor too, you know.
not_available Well, this doctor's orders are to slow down.
not_available I remember giving you similar orders after your surgery and I don't think you listened to me.
not_available Meet me for lunch.
not_available If you're not in labor.
not_available Is that decaf? Some guy swallowed a couple dozen on a bet.
not_available Now he's got tummy trouble.
not_available No doubt.
not_available Any suggestions? Get some colored rocks, maybe one of those deep
not_available sea divers with bubbles.
not_available Carter, you want a pet? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available How about some coffee? 
not_available What's this? A guy dropped it off a few minutes ago.
not_available Want me to read the card? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Too late.
not_available It's from Rena.
not_available Who's Rena? Child
not_available life specialist.
not_available Helped me with an unruly kid last week.
not_available Really? So, what does she look like, Carter? 
not_available You know, I don't know.
not_available She's blond.
not_available Like, that tall.
not_available Kind of cute in her own way.
not_available Right? Don't ask me.
not_available I didn't get a gift basket.
not_available If she helped you, why are you getting all the goodies? Because I gave her a good assessment on her internship.
not_available Actually, the card says 
not_available Thank you very much, Amira.
not_available "Thanks for a great evening.
not_available You can bring your own coffee next time.
not_available " Must've been one hell of an assessment.
not_available We're gonna move you to your own room.
not_available Okay, Mary? What if Jesus comes for me and I'm not here? I'll have one of the nurses send him upstairs.
not_available Will you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Hey.
not_available Got a minute? So Bloody Mary's back? 
not_available She's harmless.
not_available Tried to page you.
not_available Well, it's been pretty crazy upstairs.
not_available Not just because of the patients.
not_available What was with the police? You should have stayed.
not_available It was a party.
not_available I had to be on at 7:30.
not_available So did I.
not_available I didn't abandon you on purpose.
not_available I didn't say you did.
not_available Okay.
not_available What did they say? They were following up on Shannon Wallace the attempted suicide who caused that train derailment.
not_available They probably wanna talk to you.
not_available Why? The patient has accused me of sexual harassment.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She told the police that I came on to her and I touched her.
not_available Why would she say such a thing? She caused over 30 deaths.
not_available She's probably trying to divert the heat off of herself.
not_available Yeah, but why would she accuse you of that? How would she even know you were? 
not_available Gay? I told her.
not_available You what? 
not_available I was trying to help her.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Kim.
not_available Kim, what were you thinking? I don't know, Kerry.
not_available That she needed help? So you disclose your personal life to an unstable patient who you don't know? Well, I 
not_available Mr.
not_available Hollis is crashing.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Elizabeth, I thought you were on bed rest.
not_available Hardly.
not_available Is this another one of my patients, Peter? What? You seem to have taken on several additional responsibilities in my absence.
not_available Well, I didn't have really much choice.
not_available So you had to organize the educational conferences for the next two months and do my interview? I thought you were on leave for preterm labor.
not_available Romano told me to keep this place running.
not_available Well, I was on medical leave.
not_available But now I'm back.
not_available I am ready to resume my responsibilities as Associate Chief of Surgery.
not_available And if anyone has a problem with that, they can come and see me.
not_available Think Greene developed that brain tumor after she got pregnant? Can I help you? 
not_available A glass of water would be nice.
not_available My throat's a little dry.
not_available Has anybody seen you? 
not_available Why, no.
not_available I didn't want to bother anybody.
not_available That's why we're here.
not_available You need to check in with the receptionist at the Admit desk.
not_available Then you can speak with a nurse.
not_available I'm afraid there's nothing they can do for me.
not_available I'm dying.
not_available Who's your doctor? I don't have one.
not_available Never did.
not_available Then how do you know you're dying? 
not_available It's in the cards, dear.
not_available You read tarot cards? Cards, palms, tea leaves.
not_available Give me your hand.
not_available Come on.
not_available I won't hurt you.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available You do have a bit of a black cloud hanging over you, don't you, dear? 
not_available See, there's a crack in your lifeline.
not_available It's probably dry skin.
not_available Listen, while I'm here, why don't you let me check you over.
not_available Well, you can if you want to.
not_available The cards have already told 
me I will be dead by sundown.
not_available Bolus a liter of saline and call Animal Control.
not_available How's our old friend Super Larry doing? He's got a fever of 100.8 but no source of infection.
not_available You might check for an aspiration pneumonia.
not_available He had one last year.
not_available Hey, wake up, Super Larry.
not_available You know what? Get a head CT.
not_available He's got abrasions.
not_available He might have fallen.
not_available You would too if you slept on a sidewalk.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Weaver, this is Detective Graham.
not_available You ran off before I could talk to you.
not_available Why do you want to talk to me? You saw a patient named Shannon Wallace that Dr.
not_available Legaspi also treated? 
not_available I called for the psych consultation.
not_available But you didn't stay with her? No.
not_available We had a mass
not_available casualty situation.
not_available She only had minor injuries.
not_available So you effectively left Dr.
not_available Legaspi alone with the patient? I suppose.
not_available Do you know the patient said Dr.
not_available Legaspi sexually assaulted her? Yes, and it's ridiculous.
not_available The young woman had psychological problems.
not_available She tried to kill herself.
not_available We have to follow up the accusations.
not_available What exactly is your relationship with Dr.
not_available Legaspi? We' re colleagues.
not_available Do you live together? 
not_available No.
not_available You were at her house this morning
not_available I really don't have time for this now.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available County is hard
not_available core blood and guts.
not_available But I guarantee you'll rack up more surgical hours here than anywhere in the country.
not_available I must admit I'm intrigued, Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available I'll be in touch.
not_available I look forward to that.
not_available Is she another one of my replacements? Lizzie, my, how you've grown! How you feeling? 
not_available I was wonderful until I got to work.
not_available Work? I thought you're on bed rest.
not_available I wish people would stop saying that.
not_available I took time to recoup some energy 
not_available but now I'm fine.
not_available That would explain the baby monitor I see strapped to your belly.
not_available Or are you just glad to see me? I spent 48 hours in the hospital.
not_available Yes, I'm doing home monitoring.
not_available I can assure you, I'm ready, willing and more than able to return to work.
not_available For how long? A week? I appointed you Associate Chief so I'd have a lieutenant that I could count on.
not_available You want to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, you have my blessing.
not_available But this is why surgery is an old boy's club.
not_available Have you any idea of the hospital's policy on sexual harassment and discrimination? We still have one of those? 
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available I'd be happy to reacquaint you on the section of maternity leave.
not_available Well, I'd rather do a bowel resection.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I read somewhere about a pregnant woman who killed her husband and got off on a temporary
not_available insanity defense because of hormone imbalance.
not_available Okay, you want to work.
not_available Fine.
not_available We're presenting three cases for M and M tomorrow.
not_available Pull the charts from Records, find the x
not_available rays in Radiology and get the slides from Pathology.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I want back in surgery.
not_available First things first.
not_available Then you can set up the projection microscope and make 35
not_available millimeter slides of the gross pathology specimens.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Make sure there's coffee and doughnuts for 100.
not_available Especially ones with sprinkles.
not_available Give them back.
not_available Give them back! 
not_available Mr.
not_available Perkins, keep it down.
not_available Give them back! This bitch stole my teeth.
not_available You call me that one more time, I'm gonna put that Foley bag in you.
not_available Okay, here.
not_available You might want to wash these off bef
not_available Before you put them back in.
not_available Abby, can you help me with this? 
not_available Sure.
not_available So how long has she been sick? 
not_available A few days.
not_available I thought it was just a cold.
not_available Any fever? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Any problems with birth? History of lung disease? 
not_available No.
not_available She's been a really healthy baby.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, could I speak with you for a minute? Yeah.
not_available Get a quick set of vitals and put her on a pulse ox.
not_available So have you figured out what's causing Super Larry's fever? No, no.
not_available Not yet.
not_available I'm still waiting on the lab for his blood work.
not_available Maybe something will turn up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Luka, wait.
not_available You're probably wondering what that police detective was all about today.
not_available Not really.
not_available There were some charges filed against Dr.
not_available Legaspi.
not_available I'd like to keep the rumors to a minimum, for Dr.
not_available Legaspi's sake.
not_available I understand.
not_available I bring it up because this place seems to feed on gossip.
not_available And in light of an investi
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Romano's looking for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He wants you now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He said if you didn't come up when you heard this message, he'd fire us both.
not_available Temp is 100.2, pulse is 120 with a pulse ox of 94.
not_available That's not too bad.
not_available No wheezing.
not_available I appreciated some retractions.
not_available A little.
not_available We'll get a chest film just to make sure.
not_available In the meantime, put some saline in her nose for a few minutes and use the bulb syringe.
not_available See if that helps.
not_available Is she gonna be okay? Well, she doesn't have a fever, and her lungs are pretty clear, which is good.
not_available Yeah, but she still seems to have trouble catching her breath.
not_available Well, babies tend to breathe through their nose so they have difficulty when they're stuffed up.
not_available But I'm sure she'll be fine once I help her with that.
not_available He knows that I'm here, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And he is aware that I am working in the ER today? 
not_available I would imagine so.
not_available He made this sound like an emergency.
not_available I'm sure he won't be much longer.
not_available Okay.
not_available He can page me when he's ready.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi.
not_available Kerry.
not_available What are you waiting for, Dr.
not_available Weaver? A written invitation? Is that it? Is it fixed? Can I go? We have to put a splint on and check another x
not_available ray.
not_available Just try and relax, okay? Malik, why don't you finish this splint and order up a Chem
not_available 7, cholesterol and a tox screen.
not_available You got a skin infection on your forehead.
not_available It could move into an infection around your brain.
not_available How's it going, Dave? The Weasel is suffering from a self
not_available inflicted wound.
not_available Weasel? 
not_available That's my ring name.
not_available Todd's a basement wrestler.
not_available I had an uncle who was a closet ballerina.
not_available So is your friend there a wrestler too? 
not_available James is awesome.
not_available Calls himself Mr.
not_available Midnight.
not_available How'd you manage to do this? He sliced himself with a razor blade.
not_available It's called blading.
not_available Fans love it.
not_available Yeah, I bet.
not_available You got this, Dave? 
not_available I'm just trying to convince Superfly here that slicing open his scalp not such a good idea.
not_available Update his tetanus if he needs it.
not_available See? There's another risk.
not_available Tetanus.
not_available Then, of course, there's nerve damage, otitis, you could put your eye out.
not_available And don't forget about scarring.
not_available Scarring's
not_available That's not a good one.
not_available Chicks don't dig scarring.
not_available They don't dig that Frankenstein look.
not_available You know? Right, Dr.
not_available Greene? What's that? 
not_available Never mind.
not_available At least give me a heads up.
not_available This is the first I've heard of these allegations.
not_available But you must have had some indication that she was a lesbian.
not_available What has that got to do with anything? It seems that's the crux of the problem, don't you think? No.
not_available The problem is a false accusation from a patient with psychological problems.
not_available She could have easily made a similar indictment against a male doctor.
not_available Yeah, but she didn't, did she? Have you had other complaints against Legaspi? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available And she's never displayed any unacceptable sexual behavior that you've witnessed? Well? What do you think? I'm getting a suspicion that you're holding out on me.
not_available Please, Robert.
not_available I think you're trying to protect her.
not_available Of course I'm trying to protect her.
not_available You should be too.
not_available She is a damn good doctor.
not_available I'm calling for an emergency disciplinary hearing with you and Anspaugh.
not_available Why? You know these charges are a joke.
not_available No one's laughing, Kerry.
not_available This is a witch hunt.
not_available This is damage control.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are we finished? 
not_available For now.
not_available Can I give you some friendly advice? 
not_available No! We spent an hour hooking up two of my grandfather's polo ponies to a pushcart.
not_available Were you insane? 
not_available We were, like, 9.
not_available We didn't know better.
not_available It was so cool.
not_available It was just like Spartacus, you know? Right up until when my grandmother sees us.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available She screams.
not_available The horses spook.
not_available My cousin, as usual, bails.
not_available The horses go one way, I go the other.
not_available And I'm left holding onto the reins.
not_available Actually, I'm still working on it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How was the seminar today? It was a lecture on developmental psychology.
not_available Freud, Piaget, Kohlberg.
not_available It was boring.
not_available Blast from the past, huh? It's like being back in college.
not_available Well, I am in college.
not_available No, I meant as an undergraduate.
not_available I am.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I thought you said you were a Pedes intern.
not_available I'm doing a child
not_available life internship in the Pedes department.
not_available I need 480 hours of clinical experience to certify.
not_available And I figured if I start now, I'll be done by the time I graduate.
not_available Graduate.
not_available How old are you? 
not_available Twenty.
not_available Well, in September.
not_available You're 19? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you okay? Oh, my God.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is she doing better? She's still not getting as much air into her lungs as we'd like.
not_available It might be her cold.
not_available We're gonna get a chest x
not_available ray just in case.
not_available Can I go with her? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Are you all right? Yeah.
not_available She just hasn't let me get much sleep in the last couple days.
not_available Why don't you get a cup of coffee while we wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You got a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What's up? I just had I just had lunch with Rena, and I think there's a problem.
not_available What? She chews with her mouth open? She's young.
not_available So? You're not exactly an old man.
not_available You could use someone to loosen you up.
not_available She's really young.
not_available What, is she, like, 23 or something? Twentytwo? Is she 20? 
not_available In September.
not_available She's a teenager.
not_available Carter.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available You didn't ask? 
not_available Women don't like to tell you their age.
not_available Well, she's not a woman.
not_available She's a girl.
not_available She's a woman.
not_available Believe me.
not_available Did you sleep with her? Oh, my God! You did.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available You couldn't tell? Did you break up with her? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Why wait? Gonna call your lawyer? Well, she's very mature for her age.
not_available She's cool.
not_available She's fun.
not_available She's She's Britney Spears' little sister.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me? Yeah? Did they bring May to Radiology? 
not_available No.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Then where is she? They must have picked her up when I was in the hall talking to Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Darryl.
not_available Hey, Darryl, did you take the little girl in Exam 4? Not yet.
not_available You didn't take her? 
not_available No.
not_available She's my next pickup, okay? If he doesn't have her, then who does? 
not_available Might've been moved to another room.
not_available Hey, hold that elevator! Is that May Jeffries? Who? 
not_available May Jeffries.
not_available She's a 4month
not_available old in Exam 4.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Please tell me what's happening.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just a second.
not_available Did you move a 4month
not_available old baby out of Exam 4? No.
not_available I can't find her.
not_available Where is she? I need Security.
not_available Where's Secur? What did they do
not_available ? I need someone to lock down the ER.
not_available Now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Just a second.
not_available Can you call
not_available ? I'm missing a baby.
not_available I think someone took her from Exam 4.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What? I was waiting for Transpo.
not_available I stepped outside to talk to CarterWhere's my baby?! 
not_available Alert Security.
not_available Sorry.
not_available May! May! Grab nurses.
not_available We'll do a roomby
not_available room search.
not_available Hey! Hey! Please.
not_available Look out! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Wait! What's your problem? Sorry.
not_available You didn't see anyone enter the room? Did you? 
not_available What? See anybody? A doctor, a nurse, an orderly? No.
not_available No.
not_available I feel like I should be helping them look.
not_available We've got that covered.
not_available We're searching the hospital.
not_available How long were you out of the room? 
not_available Like a minute.
not_available Maybe the person that took her is distraught over losing their own baby.
not_available I could check the hospital records.
not_available We'll tell you if we want to pursue that.
not_available Did you see anyone unusual? Someone you didn't recognize? This is an ER.
not_available It's filled with strangers.
not_available I've told you everything I know.
not_available I'm wasting my time.
not_available I should be doing something.
not_available Just a few more questions.
not_available It's okay, dear.
not_available Sometimes God calls little babies home to be his angels.
not_available Is there someone you want me to call to be here? Your husband, maybe? 
not_available I'm divorced.
not_available What is his name? 
not_available Ed.
not_available Ed Jeffries.
not_available But he lives in Boston now.
not_available Okay.
not_available The police would like to ask you some questions.
not_available Do you feel up to that? Okay.
not_available I will be back when they're done, and we'll talk.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available How is she doing? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Better than I would be.
not_available How was your meeting with Romano? Homophobic.
not_available Misogynistic.
not_available The usual.
not_available Degrading.
not_available What did you tell him? 
not_available The truth.
not_available Shannon Wallace was a young woman experiencing a sexual
not_available identity crisis.
not_available She needed to know that being gay is not an affliction.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And what did you tell him about us? Oh.
not_available Oh, I see.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Your secret's safe.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available No? What did you mean? 
not_available No.
not_available You think that I am the only one who has problems with this that it's universally accepted.
not_available But that is not true.
not_available So we skulk in the shadows because narrow
not_available minded individuals disapprove? No.
not_available No.
not_available I just think that you are fooling yourself if youHow many openly gay women do you know in hospital administrative positions? Kerry
not_available None.
not_available It doesn't happen.
not_available What does that have to do with it? I'm explaining why this is difficult for me.
not_available Guess what, this isn't about you.
not_available This is about a confused, frightened woman who would rather kill herself than deal with the stigma of being gay.
not_available Maybe it is about you.
not_available Abby? What are you doing? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I heard about a baby that got scooped up with the laundry in another hospital.
not_available I know it's stupid.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Can you help me with a squirmer? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Sit still, Jason.
not_available I need to look into your ears.
not_available Do you think it's his adenoids? His brother had them taken out with his tonsils.
not_available Abby, can you hold him still, please? 
not_available Haleh, can you help Carter? Sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Did you find her? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Okay, I was thinking, she's sick so whoever took her might take her to a pharmacy to get some Infant Tylenol.
not_available They'll need diapers and formula
not_available Right, thanks.
not_available And it also seems that she's not in the hospital anymore.
not_available Shouldn't you set up a roadblock or check the neighborhood? 
not_available We're doing everything we can.
not_available Shouldn't we have heard something? I mean, the chances of finding her get worse every passing second, right? Abby? Abby? Did you get the labs on the jaundice guy? Who? 
not_available Jagadeeshan.
not_available No.
not_available Could you try and find them? No.
not_available Sorry.
not_available These are the most recent photos I have.
not_available Can I have them? Look, I promise to return them.
not_available May I, please? Thank you.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Jeffries, I know I can't say anything to change the situation.
not_available I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
not_available She's my only baby.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sure she's gonna be fine.
not_available Why would somebody take my baby? Mr.
not_available Kinney can go home.
not_available There's no known cure for being a pain in the ass.
not_available Any news on the baby? 
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, labs are back on that wrestler.
not_available Anything show up? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What are you looking for? Nothing on the tox screen.
not_available Cholesterol level's a little high for a teenager.
not_available Too much fast food.
not_available I think he's on steroids.
not_available He's got acne, hirsutism, aggression.
not_available What teenage boy doesn't? What's the turnaround time on a steroids test? Five days? At least.
not_available Hey, look, if you think he's using, just ask him.
not_available He might cop to it.
not_available I thought you forgot about me.
not_available Look, man, I need to go home.
not_available All right? I ordered some tests.
not_available What kind of tests? The kind that show that you're using steroids.
not_available I don't know what you mean.
not_available I think you do.
not_available What you might not know is that you're putting yourself at risk for kidney failure, stroke, impotence 
not_available You're crazy.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available Home.
not_available Sit back down.
not_available Screw you, man! I'm leaving! No.
not_available You gotta stay here until your parents come and get you.
not_available You called my parents? 
not_available Todd left.
not_available Someone has to get you home.
not_available Forget this! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Leave me alone! Hey, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Just go get him.
not_available Don't let him leave.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, man, what are you doing? 
not_available Leaving.
not_available What are you afraid of? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I've had enough of this place.
not_available We weren't finished.
not_available We're only here to help.
not_available Then let me go.
not_available Well, what's the big rush? Look, look.
not_available Just take it easy, all right? Stay out of my way! Look, I don't want to hurt you! Look, look, look.
not_available Just relax, all right? Come back inside.
not_available You can't keep me here! My old man will be pissed if I can't leave! Your father wants us to take care of you.
not_available That doctor's telling him I use steroids! Look, my old man will kill me if he finds out! 
not_available He doesn't have to find out.
not_available He said he was gonna tell! Look, James, you need to just settle down and come inside, okay? Look, you don't know my father.
not_available He'll kill me if he finds out.
not_available You're right.
not_available I don't know your father.
not_available But I know the type.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Okay? Okay? We'll work something out.
not_available Right, Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on.
not_available You have my word on it.
not_available Deal? Come on.
not_available Who's got the guy in Exam 2? 
not_available Carter.
not_available He's been restrained in there for hours.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Did you see all those bite marks? Those are self
not_available inflicted.
not_available That guy almost ate himself alive.
not_available Get somebody from Psych.
not_available Let's get rid of him.
not_available We've been waiting.
not_available Psych's been slower than usual answering consults.
not_available I hear they've got a shakeup going on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi's being fired.
not_available Let's keep gossip to a minimum, Haleh.
not_available That's not gossip.
not_available The gossip is she's a lesbian.
not_available Legaspi? 
not_available That's what I heard.
not_available Really? Follow my finger.
not_available What happened? He got whacked in the head by a patient.
not_available Show me your teeth.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You should get a head CT.
not_available I'm sorry about that.
not_available I got a little worked up.
not_available That's what steroid rage will do to you.
not_available Cleo, could you find James a bed? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on.
not_available Mark, you should get a head CT.
not_available He didn't mean it.
not_available He's scared.
not_available Scared he's gonna get busted.
not_available Scared he's gonna get beat up.
not_available The kid's petrified of his old man.
not_available I got a feeling he's an abuse case.
not_available Abuse? The kid's a tank.
not_available The steroids, the aggression, the tough
not_available guy routine.
not_available It's a defense mechanism.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I don't think you should tell his parents.
not_available Too late.
not_available They're on their way.
not_available I said we'd work something out.
not_available I gave him my word.
not_available Well, you shouldn't have.
not_available He's not your patient.
not_available Tumor! What was that? 
not_available The old Dr.
not_available Greene would have helped.
not_available I am.
not_available Maybe there's something to this competency stuff.
not_available Keep it up, Malucci.
not_available You'll be looking for a new job.
not_available Her name's May.
not_available And she's really got a pretty bad cold.
not_available So if you could just please return her.
not_available She's just a baby.
not_available It doesn't matter why you took her.
not_available It's just that she really needs medication.
not_available If you could just bring her back.
not_available Have somebody bring her in.
not_available Drop her off at the police department.
not_available Call an ambulance.
not_available You should have your coat on.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Why don't you come back inside.
not_available Come on.
not_available You can help cast the twins who rode their wagon down the steps.
not_available You should get someone else.
not_available I want you.
not_available Could you just leave me alone, please? I can't do that.
not_available I lost that woman's baby.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available Real nice.
not_available Can't take notes in class.
not_available Dad, it's not that bad.
not_available How we doing in here? You a nurse? 
not_available Doctor.
not_available You Greene? 
not_available Malucci.
not_available They told me to wait here for Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I was assisting Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Yeah, fine, whatever.
not_available So is he gonna be okay or what? Well, he dislocated his hand, but it'll heal.
not_available What about his head? 
not_available He didn't injure his head.
not_available Oh, no? Jumping around in a costume like an idiot seems like a sign of brain damage.
not_available Can I speak with you outside, please? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get yourself together.
not_available We're leaving right after this.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available What? SUPPLY ROOM Your son, you know, hurt himself.
not_available He needs a little compassion.
not_available And you come in here and you humiliate him.
not_available You don't know him.
not_available He needs discipline.
not_available He's always doing stupid stuff like this.
not_available Ever wonder why? Maybe there's a reason he behaves this way.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's called being crazy.
not_available And a cure for it's a good kick in the ass.
not_available Around here we call that abuse, man.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Where are you going? Go work on your golf game, doc.
not_available Golf? What the hell is going on? I'm gonna sue your ass! 
not_available Kiss it while you're at it.
not_available Get out! 
not_available The guy abuses his son.
not_available Malucci, out now! Let's go! 
not_available Let me take a look at that.
not_available Get away from me.
not_available Are you sure you've done this before? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm having a little trouble finding the vein.
not_available Can I get another nurse over here, please? 
not_available Let me just take a little break.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is there anything I can get you? Just my baby.
not_available Maybe you should go home.
not_available Someone will call you if we hear anything.
not_available I don't think I can leave without her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Not you again.
not_available This is County.
not_available This is Rescue 62 en route with what appears to be a 4month
not_available old infant girl found abandoned on the El platform.
not_available What's her status? Pulse, 120.
not_available Resps, 60.
not_available Got a weak cry and is cold to the touch.
not_available Is there any sign of trauma? 
not_available No.
not_available Is she alert? 
not_available Hard to tell.
not_available She's a baby.
not_available Is she making eye contact? 
not_available Not really.
not_available What's your ETA? 
not_available Less than five.
not_available Did you talk to Rena? What? Your That child
not_available life specialist.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available But I'm You know, where are they? It's been almost 10 minutes.
not_available I think I hear an ambulance.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I hope it's her.
not_available I'm sure it is.
not_available It's gotta be, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How many kids can they find in one day? Open up! 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Pulse ox is down to 89.
not_available Abby, is that her? 
not_available It's her.
not_available I need a core temperature, put the monitors on and get a 24
not_available gauge angiocath.
not_available Where'd they find her? Is she okay? 
not_available El station.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available Whoever stole her panicked and dumped her.
not_available Let the doctors work.
not_available I want to stay here.
not_available May! 
not_available Okay, Abby.
not_available I got it.
not_available I've gotta start an IV.

not_available That's good.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're okay, May.
not_available You're safe now.
not_available You're gonna be okay.

not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available This is pathetic.
not_available Not a single trauma in the bunch.
not_available Hello.
not_available That's mine.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Go home, Dave.
not_available I'm on till 8:00.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available In fact, you're not on for the rest of the week.
not_available Wait.
not_available Says who? 
not_available Says me.
not_available Does Weaver know about this? 
not_available She will.
not_available Is this because I defended myself? 
not_available Mark.
not_available Goodbye, Dave.
not_available I just heard you were attacked.
not_available Why didn't you call? No big deal.
not_available I just ran into an elbow.
not_available Well, did you get a CT? I'm fine.
not_available Really.
not_available I'm just glad I didn't opt for the surgical Velcro when they put my skull back together.
not_available How are you doing? Well, Romano's trying to replace me.
not_available He wouldn't let me do surgery.
not_available So I spent the day doing wedding stuff.
not_available I'm not wearing a kilt.
not_available You'd look handsome.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano's looking for you.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available This came for you today.
not_available I'm gonna be in Romano's office.
not_available These are my competency results.
not_available You waited until the end of the shift? I'm sorry.
not_available I forgot.
not_available I've been busy.
not_available You forgot? How could you forget? You wanna open them? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh, Mark.
not_available I passed.
not_available Don't look so surprised.
not_available Stop it! 
not_available You had your doubts, didn't you? You had your moments.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Dr.
not_available Corday, good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey, where you going, Georgia? 
not_available Home.
not_available I guess you're not dying today after all then, huh? John.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing down here? 
not_available Looking for you.
not_available I'm off.
not_available You almost finished? 
not_available I got two hours of charts to finish.
not_available Can you do it over garlic noodles? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll get take
not_available out, a bottle of wine, you can do your charts.
not_available I don't drink.
not_available And it's illegal for you to purchase alcohol.
not_available The age thing again.
not_available I like you a lot, Rena.
not_available You wish I was older.
not_available I guess I should enjoy this while it lasts.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to No, please, forget it.
not_available I'm young.
not_available We heal fast.
not_available I'll see you around.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are Dr.
not_available Romano and Dr.
not_available Anspaugh still here? They're waiting for you in the conference room.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Better late than never.
not_available Let's cut to the chase, so we can all get out of here and go home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi recently, for whatever reasons, had what I hope was a momentary lapse in judgment.
not_available I take offense to that.
not_available I take offense to you having come out to your patient, which was inappropriate
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi is a valuable asset to the Psychiatry Department as well as this hospital as a whole.
not_available I think that her instincts were correct and her intentions very honorable considering the situation.
not_available Honorable, perhaps.
not_available Stupid, definitely.
not_available Come on, Robert.
not_available Patients with psychological problems falsely accuse their doctors of all sorts of things.
not_available I had a guy today blame me for hypnotizing him in order to drink his blood.
not_available We'll have to look into that another day, Donald.
not_available But the fact is, to the best of my knowledge, you are not a vampire.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi, however, is a lesbian.
not_available Am I right? I've never hidden that fact from this administration or my colleagues.
not_available Or from patients, wherein lies the problem.
not_available There's a difference between being gay and being a child molester.
not_available Okay.
not_available My recommendation is administrative leave pending the criminal hearing.
not_available I think that's premature.
not_available No.
not_available It's preemptive.
not_available If we get lucky, there won't be any charges you can come back to work having learned a lesson, albeit the hard way.
not_available You have anything to add, Dr.
not_available Weaver, considering you are one of them? Them? A female physician dealing 
not_available with female patients.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available I think that Dr.
not_available Legaspi is a wonderful doctor.
not_available And I don't think that she did any of the things that she's accused of doing.
not_available Well, that's well
not_available spoken, Kerry.
not_available That's very convincing.
not_available Remind me never to ask you to testify on my behalf.
not_available Okay.
not_available Meeting is adjourned.
not_available I have dinner plans.
not_available Pay no attention to him.
not_available This, too, will pass.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm Kim.
not_available Kim, please don't.
not_available Kim, please.
not_available Please, please stop.
not_available I'm so I'm so sorry.
not_available Let's just get out of here and talk about this.
not_available There's really nothing to talk about.
not_available What did you expect me to say? I am so sorry, Kim.
not_available Me too.
not_available Go back to your life, Kerry.
not_available No, don't.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available We have something good.
not_available What? What do we have? A relationship that you're ashamed to acknowledge? You're right.
not_available I wish I could be like you.
not_available I wish I could be as confident and secure with this as you are.
not_available But I am not you.
not_available I have been on the outside my whole life fighting for acceptance and respect.
not_available And now you're asking me to do it all over again? I'm not asking you for anything.
not_available Don't, please.
not_available I just I need more time.
not_available I can't do this right now.
not_available Please, Kim.
not_available Kim.
not_available I missed you.
not_available Hi.
not_available She's smiling.
not_available All her tests came back normal.
not_available She wasn't hurt.
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available But I would like to keep her overnight for observation.
not_available Is that necessary? You said she was gonna be okay.
not_available Just a precaution.
not_available I got her a private room.
not_available I'm having them set up a bed for you too.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is there anything else you need? No.
not_available She's all I need.
