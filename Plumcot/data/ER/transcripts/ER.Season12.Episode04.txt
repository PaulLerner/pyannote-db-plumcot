not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Kovac, I'm Eve Peyton.
not_available Our new nurse manager.
not_available It's Kovac.
not_available Then maybe you can educate the nurses about inferior alveolar dental blocks.
not_available What? Is there some sort of history between you and Dr.
not_available Kovac? I don't think it's appropriate for you two to work together.
not_available That's two less than I'm doing, which I can't afford, and I'll never see my kid.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 12x04 "BLAME IT ON THE RAIN" One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand What are you doing? Five
not_available I'm counting.
not_available Yes.
not_available That part, I get.
not_available The time between the lightning and the thunder tells you how far away the storm is.
not_available Getting closer.
not_available That's great.
not_available You're going outside? Yep, I drew the short straw for the coffee run.
not_available Where you going? We're getting slammed here.
not_available I'm not on for six minutes.
not_available I'm going out for coffee.
not_available Then be a Flower Drum Song and grab me a bear claw.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Morris, chief resident.
not_available What brings you here today? Some guy rear
not_available ended me.
not_available Ew.
not_available Ouch.
not_available I hope you were driving.
not_available We're getting a little backed up here.
not_available We can clear some of these necks clinically.
not_available We? Okay, I think it's best if we left that decision to the doctors.
not_available If patients meet all of the NEXUS criteria
not_available What do you know about NEXUS? As research coordinator at Emory, I enrolled 2000 patients in the initial study.
not_available That's really interesting.
not_available Maybe you can bring it up at your next Nazi nurse rally.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, my knowledge of the human anatomy is so extensive, I could kill you with this finger.
not_available Somehow I find that hard to
not_available Ow! I saved your life.
not_available Been telling them to keep these floors mopped.
not_available Maybe it's time I fired a janitorial staff.
not_available It's time you cleared some patients.
not_available Glad you're back in the trenches with us.
not_available Makes one of us.
not_available What's the problem here? We've had like Every ED in the city is closed to saturation, which means we're all open.
not_available Fender
not_available benders are clogging the hallways.
not_available I'm not sure they all need a C
not_available spine film.
not_available Of course not.
not_available Get with it, Morris.
not_available Half these patients don't need x
not_available rays.
not_available Start clearing necks.
not_available All right, so they've What the hell's your problem? You can't wait for a little break in
not_available ? Hey! It's a crosswalk, you asshole! Diverticulitis grandma is being admitted to Medicine.
not_available My mandible fracture's going to the OR with OMF and Mr.
not_available McKay goes home with rest and ibuprofen.
not_available On that note, I'm out of here with no pass
not_available ons, thank you.
not_available Thought you'd help Neela clear necks.
not_available I did.
not_available Doc Rock will help you.
not_available I'm not working here today.
not_available I start my Toxicology elective.

not_available alongs.
not_available You never did them as an intern and you've 24 hours in the field.
not_available Been meaning to do that.
not_available Come see me when you do.
not_available Then we'll discuss your elective options.
not_available Where'd you go for coffee, Milwaukee? The donuts are soggy.
not_available God forbid you don't get your morning ration of deep fried fat, Frank.
not_available Maybe I can dry them in the microwave.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nothing a week in the Bahamas wouldn't cure.
not_available What about you? Eve stuck me on nights.
not_available Now I get less sleep, less money and I barely see Alex.
not_available I have to have a babysitter spend the night.
not_available What is it about rain that turns residents of this city into idiots? 
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Haleh, what are you doing here? 
not_available Connie asked me to cover for her.
not_available I warned you about your overtime.
not_available I'm just trying to help her out.
not_available You should've told her to call someone else.
not_available You want me to go back home? Unless you want another letter in your file.
not_available Have a great day.
not_available Sam, can you cover for me until I find someone else? Sam.
not_available Why not? It's not like I'm gonna be home in time to see my kid off to school anyway.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available Blaire Collins, 29.
not_available Sent in from Lakeshore Gardens for infection around her G

not_available Six years.
not_available No, come on.
not_available No way.
not_available No way, guys.
not_available We don't have room.
not_available She doesn't need to be here.

not_available I just told you, take her back.
not_available We don't get paid for round trips.

not_available What else is new? Come on.
not_available I think Trauma Two is open.
not_available Check the lobby.
not_available We could use a nurse in Triage.
not_available You've gotta be kidding me.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available No, this is ridiculous.
not_available Hey, Kerry? You gonna do something? 
not_available About what? The way she's managing the staff.
not_available If it's a nursing issue, it's Eve's rice bowl.
not_available You two work it out.
not_available Morning rounds are at 10 a.
not_available m.
not_available Ten.
not_available Ten is good.
not_available We discuss our toxicology consultations from the entire county.
not_available You will carry the pager every third day and research conference is Thursday afternoons.
not_available Check it out.
not_available Is it poisonous? Venomous? Yes.
not_available I'm studying neurotoxic factors in crotalid venom.
not_available How cool.
not_available Cool.
not_available Please, but
not_available Don't do that.
not_available Your main focus will be our Poison Control Center.
not_available Calls come in from both the public and other health care facilities.

not_available It hurts when I breathe.
not_available Driver with chest pain, good vitals.
not_available Any victims in the second vehicle? 
not_available Only one car.
not_available They forced me off the road.
not_available Who? 
not_available They were driving like maniacs.
not_available They hurt my daughter.
not_available Baby's with Rescue 73.
not_available I'll take this one so you can take the baby.
not_available Sure.
not_available Nice work.
not_available Is that custom? 
not_available Yeah, Spanish Revival.
not_available Ancef's onboard.
not_available Watch it, this thing's attached.
not_available He missed the femur.
not_available He bagged the femoral artery, got a cold foot.
not_available Give him 50 of fentanyl and we'll take him upstairs.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is everything else okay? He should be back to work in a few weeks.
not_available Well, I meant with you, actually.
not_available Oh.
not_available I know this is none of my business but I was up in oncology last week with a patient and I had my annual PSA screening.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It came back 6.
not_available 5.
not_available It's a little high.
not_available Needle biopsy showed a moderately differentiated prostate cancer.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available No.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We caught it early, stage T

not_available Good prognosis with surgery.
not_available I gotta get your ischemic foot boy upstairs.
not_available Um, Lucien? If you want to talk with someone or have a coffee or something Yeah, all right, maybe.
not_available That would be nice.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi, Frank.
not_available Anything besides fender
not_available benders? Well, the guy in Number Four got scalded while driving by the hospital by some crazy broad who was throwing coffee.
not_available He thought she was a nurse.
not_available Probably someone from ICU.
not_available They're wacky up there.
not_available Abby! Chest pain.
not_available When did it start? 
not_available Ten, 15 minutes ago.
not_available We came right in.
not_available What does it feel like? Heavy, heavy

not_available Looks like she was ejected.
not_available Car seat wasn't anchored down? Looks that way.
not_available Heart rate in the 160s.
not_available Access? 
not_available Tried twice.
not_available IV blew.
not_available Are you good with tiny veins? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available I'll take that as a yes.
not_available C
not_available spine's clear.
not_available Get her off the board.
not_available Pulse ox 97 on two liters.
not_available When you say a truck, do you mean they were driving an SUV or a pickup? SUV.
not_available It was blue or black.
not_available It was definitely black.
not_available Okay, Judy, we're gonna sit you up a bit.
not_available Ow, my chest.
not_available Did you see the driver or the passengers? There were at least two of them.
not_available The driver was a young teenager.
not_available White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, what? 
not_available White.
not_available I'm not sure about the passenger.
not_available Lungs are clear.
not_available BP, 112 over 78.
not_available It hurts when I breathe.
not_available Stop! 
not_available I think you've broken your breastbone.
not_available Add a sternal view, troponin, CT of head, abdomen and pelvis.
not_available What can you tell us about their vehicle? 
not_available There is a bike rack on the roof.
not_available They tried to force me off the road.
not_available They wanted to steal my car.
not_available Am I bleeding? 
not_available You hit the window.
not_available It's not too bad.
not_available Will I need stitches? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Did either of them have a weapon, ma'am? I don't know.
not_available It happened so fast.
not_available I just wanted to get out of there.
not_available Enough for now.
not_available She's had a concussion.
not_available You need to let her rest before she goes into the CT.
not_available We're working here.
not_available Sorry, Luka.
not_available Got a trauma.
not_available We need the room.
not_available Hey, here we go.
not_available Gently.
not_available I've got the neck.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Here we go.
not_available We're out of the infant c
not_available collars.
not_available Luka, do you know if we have infant ccollars? 
not_available You can use towel rolls.
not_available I'm gonna ask Peyton.
not_available Can't hear breath sounds.
not_available Do we have a sat? 
not_available Won't pick up.
not_available Kid's pink, sat's fine.
not_available Twenty
not_available four gauge going in on the right.
not_available You want me to take this? I don't mind.
not_available Why, you think I'm rusty? Superficial lacs, no step offs, left frontal
not_available parietal hematoma.
not_available Call CT and let them know we need a head.
not_available Finally calming down.
not_available Or going apnic.
not_available Come on, baby, wake up.
not_available Wake up.
not_available All right.
not_available Inez, miller one and a four
not_available 0.
not_available She needs a tube.
not_available The kid's screaming.
not_available The airway's obviously fine.
not_available She's got a good mechanism for a head injury.
not_available She needs a CT.
not_available You'll subject her to the risks of intubation to make things easier for the radiology tech? 
not_available She'll settle down.
not_available She doesn't have time.
not_available Agitation could be an early sign of a head injury.
not_available Or an appropriate response to a stressful situation.
not_available Babies cry when they're scared.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available But this is my patient and her mental status is waxing and waning.
not_available She could go apnic in the scanner.
not_available Then you bag her through it.
not_available Point five of versed and vec.
not_available You lose your neuro exam if you sedate.
not_available Observe until Trauma gets here.
not_available And watch her bleed into her brain? No, thanks.
not_available Push the meds, Inez.
not_available Look at her.
not_available She's alert, pupils equal, good tone.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Point five versed, going in.
not_available Kerry, we've seen enough head trauma to develop gut feelings about these things.
not_available And my gut says intubate.
not_available She needs a tube.
not_available Giving the vec.
not_available Suction.
not_available The scope.
not_available Where are they taking my daughter? 
not_available She's going up to the CT.
not_available What are all those tubes? Why isn't she moving? The tube helps her breathe.
not_available It's just a precaution.
not_available Sometimes babies have to be sedated for CAT scans.
not_available It doesn't mean anything's wrong.
not_available Have the police found anything? 
not_available It's still early.
not_available They will.
not_available I should have waited until it stopped raining.
not_available No one can control the weather.
not_available The good news is that your brain and belly CT are normal.
not_available You've broken your breastbone and we'll need to monitor your heart 
not_available to make sure it wasn't bruised.
not_available But I didn't have to go out.
not_available I could have waited.
not_available Grace was fussy all night.
not_available Sometimes a car ride settles her down.
not_available I'm gonna numb up the cuts on your face before I suture.
not_available What am I gonna tell my husband? 
not_available You need a new car? You're gonna feel a little pinprick and then some burning before it kicks in.
not_available You have a bunch of phone messages.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Tell Kayson to stop bothering me.
not_available I'll call Anspaugh back when I get a chance.
not_available Oh, crap.
not_available Henry's got a birthday party tomorrow.
not_available Hey, Jerry.
not_available Could you go down to that toy store on Michigan Avenue for me? You want me to go outside? 
not_available Yeah, it's just a few blocks.
not_available I need a King Funshine.
not_available I'll write it down for you.
not_available In the storm? 
not_available What, you afraid you'll melt? What about the lightning? I'm a big target.
not_available Well, then I suggest you try running in a zigzag pattern.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? The results are back for that little girl ejected from the car.
not_available Is she awake yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available But I'll double check.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Baby's head CT is negative.
not_available Just some soft tissue swelling.
not_available Is she awake? 
not_available No, she is still sedated.
not_available Then you can't follow her neuro exam.
not_available She'll wake up and we'll extubate.
not_available This is Bradley Anderson.
not_available His wife and daughter were brought in.
not_available The police said there was an accident.
not_available Yeah, they're doing well.
not_available Come on, I'll take you to them.
not_available Aren't you two supposed to keep 50 feet apart or something? 
not_available Bite me, Frank.
not_available Ask me, you're better off.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Second EKG is unchanged and troponin is negative.
not_available He's pain
not_available free after nitro and metoprolol.
not_available So he's okay? Well, doesn't look like a heart attack, but I think he has unstable angina.
not_available One of the arteries may be closing down.
not_available You have to stay in the hospital for observation and more tests.
not_available For how long? 
not_available Could be just a day or two.
not_available You okay with that? 
not_available Like I got a choice? You hang in there.
not_available I'll stop by later if I can.
not_available Um, excuse me.
not_available Excuse me, hi.
not_available It might be better if you stayed.
not_available The cardiologist is gonna have questions and instructions for you and your husband.
not_available I'm not Lee's wife.
not_available I'm his therapist.
not_available Are you a doctor? I am his satisfaction facilitator.
not_available What is that exactly? I have a select group of clients like Lee who require something they're not getting at home.
not_available Something sexual? I provide the one thing that's missing.
not_available Allows them to live happily ever after with their wives.
not_available Really? 
not_available I help women too.
not_available You call me if he needs anything.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sixty cc's of gastrografin and check KUB.
not_available What's this? Nursing
not_available home dump.
not_available I'm changing G
not_available tubes on comatose patients now.
not_available How's your MI? 
not_available Unstable angina.
not_available Just out of curiosity, what type of guy hires a satisfaction facilitator? I believe that's the politically correct term for call girl these days.
not_available A smart one? We have a saying in 
Croatia You know, if it floats, flies or Fornicates? 
not_available Rent it.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello.
not_available I thought I might take you up on that offer for coffee.
not_available If you've got a minute.
not_available Sure.
not_available Page me if you need me.
not_available How many stitches? Let's see.
not_available There's seven on the forehead.
not_available Five on the cheek.
not_available That's 12 altogether.
not_available It's not so bad.
not_available Neela, this is Brad, Judy's husband.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available Honey, I'm so sorry.
not_available Come on, it wasn't your fault.
not_available The police told me what happened.
not_available The bastards should be shot.
not_available I tried to get away and I lost control.
not_available You did everything you could.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available The cops will get these guys.
not_available Have you seen Grace? 
not_available She looks good.
not_available They think she's gonna be okay.
not_available Really? We have to run a few tests.
not_available Everything looks good, but soon as I can I'll bring her down so you can be with her.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm gonna go back and stay with Grace until they're ready to bring her in here.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Your husband seems like a great guy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Everything's gonna be okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not usually like this.
not_available Okay, well, the Venus Fly Trap is non
not_available toxic so it's not a lethal if ingested.
not_available However, the larger ones are extremely dangerous and have been known to devour pets and small children.
not_available No, no, no, I made that last part up.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Ma'am, I
not_available You're absolutely right.
not_available This is not a venue for humor.
not_available I understand.
not_available I apologize.
not_available You too.
not_available Do you need any help with the snakes? 
not_available We could have gone to the cafeteria.
not_available This one.
not_available Their coffee sucks.
not_available You didn't mention seeing me upstairs to anyone else by any chance, did you? No.
not_available I mean, II wouldn't have said anything to you but I thought you might wanna talk to someone or something
not_available No, yeah.
not_available No, I appreciate the gesture.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, what are your treatment options? 
not_available Well I've opted for a radical prostatectomy.
not_available My urologist, Dr.
not_available Peter Singh.
not_available You know him? No.
not_available He does a bilateral nerve
not_available sparing procedure for patients with low volume disease.
not_available That's great.
not_available Even in the best of circumstances there's a 25 percent chance of loss of erectile function.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then you're looking at penile injection therapy intraurethral pharmacotherapy, vacuum erection devices or a penile prosthesis to achieve an adequate erection.
not_available Well, I
not_available Then the good news is that there's 75 percent chance of success.
not_available Well, the procedure also eliminates the ability to ejaculate.
not_available But the chance of urinary incontinence is low so I won't be wearing a diaper or need an artificial sphincter.
not_available Well, there you go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It isIt's just
not_available It's rather daunting, knowing that you may never have sex again.
not_available Well, it sounds like you're in good hands.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, I know this is rather unconventional and under different circumstances I certainly would have employed a more traditional approach with regards to courtship and romantic methodology and assuredly enjoyed all the ritual of that.
not_available But given the time constraints and obviously what I'm potentially faced withYou know, you might just wanna kind of take
not_available Look.
not_available If I'm going down, I wanna go down swinging and I'd like it to be with you.
not_available So you want me to sleep with you? Yeah.
not_available Well, that's something.
not_available That's I'm flattered, I think.
not_available But I 
not_available I can't do that.
not_available No, no.
not_available I understand.
not_available Nothing personal.
not_available No, I understand.
not_available I was asking purely from a scientific approach.
not_available What about after? After what? 
not_available The surgery.
not_available To see if anything still works.
not_available I'm gonna have to take a pass on that too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abby, you want this? GSW to the upper chest.
not_available I gotta
not_available I better go back.
not_available You wanna hop on? I mean, are you coming? To theFor the
not_available Place the chest tube, call me if the initial output is over 500 cc's.
not_available How's Grace? We moved her to one of our exam rooms, so we'll take you too.
not_available I've brought some mug books for you to look through.
not_available It all happened so fast, I'm not really sure what I remember seeing.
not_available Take a look, maybe a face will jog your memory.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why don't you give us a few minutes? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I don't wanna look at those books.
not_available You might identify the men who drove you off
not_available I can't.
not_available Why not? 
not_available It was pouring rain.
not_available I could barely see out the window.
not_available Car started to skid, and I don't know.
not_available I saw the wall coming, and I didn't stop.
not_available I just kept driving.
not_available I just
not_available What are you saying, Judy? What happened? I didn't know that Grace's seat wasn't clicked in.
not_available I would never do anything to hurt my child.
not_available Did you do this on purpose? Sometimes, I I can't help it.
not_available Sometimes
not_available It's like I don't know how to snap out of it.
not_available It's like everything's coming at me at once and I just want it all to go away.
not_available Judy, did you try to hurt yourself? 
not_available I just wanted it to stop.
not_available Do either of you have a moment? 
not_available Shoot.
not_available My MVC mom's suffering from severe postpartum depression.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Just one second.
not_available It's the baby, Grace Anderson.
not_available What about her? She's waking up.
not_available You might wanna extubate.
not_available Yeah, I'll be right there.
not_available What are her symptoms? She drove head
not_available on into a wall with her baby in the car.
not_available I think it was intentional.
not_available I'd like to put her on a psych hold.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra? 
not_available It's the husband.
not_available Get Psych down here.
not_available Can my wife go home now? Not yet.
not_available You moved Judy out of the trauma room.
not_available I thought that meant she was good to go.
not_available We needed to clear the room.
not_available We have to rule out a cardiac contusion.
not_available We need to monitor her heart to make sure it's not bruised.
not_available For how long? I'm not sure.
not_available It could be a while.
not_available Mr.
not_available Anderson Does Judy drink alcohol? No.
not_available I mean, she has a glass of wine now and then.
not_available Why? What about drugs? No.
not_available What's this all about? Just routine questions for her chart to avoid any drug interaction, that sort of thing.
not_available Have you noticed any change in her mood lately? Like what? She seem depressed? 
not_available No.
not_available Any loss of appetite or trouble sleeping? You're kidding, right? We have a threemonth
not_available old baby.
not_available When Gracey doesn't sleep, none of us do.
not_available The sooner I can get them both home, the sooner they can start getting better.
not_available I don't want to send her home until I'm sure there's no danger.
not_available No, of course.
not_available You're right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, could you help me clear some beds? 
not_available I thought I was.
not_available If we work together
not_available Look, what's going on in Exam Two? DUB needs an ultrasound to rule out fibroids.
not_available Good crits, vitals stable.
not_available How about an outpatient scan and GYN referral? 
not_available Well, if you can get her in this week.
not_available Done.
not_available Okay, next.
not_available Buster Freeman? Dirty puncture wound to the foot, waiting on IV Ancef.
not_available Can he sit in a chair for that? It frees up a bed.
not_available Crystal Marranachio? 
not_available Waiting on an ortho consult.
not_available She's been cleared.
not_available I called the attending.
not_available You what? It's new policy.
not_available When we call for a consult the resident has 60 minutes to respond to the page or we call the attending.
not_available All the department heads signed off on it except Psych.
not_available Crazy bastards.
not_available Blaire Collins has been here forever.
not_available I've called the nursing home twice.
not_available They were supposed to send a ride for her.
not_available Well, if they're not here in 10, I'm putting her in a cab.
not_available She's comatose.
not_available I was kidding, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Frank, call Blaire Collins' nursing home again and tell those idiots she's been ready to go home for the last four hours.
not_available Tell them yourself.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? I think I'm one of those idiots.
not_available Trish Gorham, assistant director from the nursing home 
not_available that's been caring for Blaire Collins.
not_available I didn't mean that.
not_available It's our policy to check on patients prior to transfer.
not_available I gather she's well enough to return.
not_available Yes, she's right over here.
not_available This way.
not_available To be honest with you, all she needs is a course of IV antibiotics.
not_available And the G
not_available tube could have been changed at your facility.
not_available We're not staffed well and the gastroenterologist doesn't come out.
not_available The earliest I could get anyone to see her was in two weeks.
not_available She have any family? 
not_available No.
not_available Her mother died from the crash that did this.
not_available There was a boyfriend, but he stopped coming around years ago.
not_available He didn't even try to stop.
not_available Somebody call my son.
not_available A 47year
not_available old, victim of auto vs.
not_available pedestrian.
not_available I just ran out to get the kids some pizza.
not_available He didn't even slow down.
not_available Systolic's only 80 after a liter.
not_available Pulse, 140.
not_available Pale and diaphoretic.
not_available Ecchymosis across the abdomen and pelvis.
not_available Four units of O
not_available neg and prime the rapid infuser.
not_available Am I dying? No, but you may have some internal bleeding.
not_available Resps are shallow.
not_available Let's set up for intubation.
not_available How often are you sad? 
not_available Not often.
not_available What makes you happy, Judy? 
not_available Being with my baby, my husband.
not_available Why are you asking me all this? We ask all patients these questions to assess mental status following a head injury.
not_available Well, my mental status is fine.
not_available Really.
not_available Any thoughts about wanting to hurt yourself? Not unless you count wanting to take a carving knife to my hips.
not_available Do you ever think about wanting to hurt your baby? Of course not.
not_available What did you tell him? Judy, you said you were upset and that you couldn't snap out of it.
not_available What are you talking about? You felt like everything was coming at you and that you wanted it all to stop.
not_available No, no, I said that I lost control of the car and I couldn't stop.
not_available You're putting words in my mouth.
not_available It's not uncommon for new moms to have depression.
not_available The first year with your baby can be stressful.
not_available I'm not stressed and I'm not depressed although I will be if I have to spend any more time here.
not_available So stop accusing me of being crazy and let me go.
not_available Nobody's accusing you of anything.
not_available We have to be extra careful whenever there's a child involved.
not_available Look, I don't know.
not_available I appreciate your concern, really.
not_available There's nothing wrong with me.
not_available I've had a rough day and I just wanna take my baby home and get some rest.
not_available Well, I hope you have a speedy recovery, Mrs.
not_available Anderson.
not_available So are we good to go? Not quite, but you can go back inside now.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available She's changed her story.
not_available There are no vegetative symptoms, no anhedonia.
not_available She doesn't have a depressed affect.
not_available She's in good spirits.
not_available Something's going on.
not_available She as much as confessed to crashing her car.
not_available But she's not saying that.
not_available She's lying.
not_available She's a prime candidate for severe
not_available I wanna be sure she doesn't have postpartum depression as much as you do.
not_available But it can be difficult to diagnose.
not_available If the patient is in complete denial or lying to me not only can I not tell, but I cannot hold her.
not_available I gave her every opportunity to let us know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You need a hand? 
not_available I need eight.
not_available God, it hurts.
not_available What's this? Driver of our auto versus pedestrian.
not_available The guy ran out in front of me.
not_available Please, give me something.
not_available No neck pain, no chest pain, good vitals, but complains of bilateral thumb pain.
not_available Look at this, I can't even make a fist.
not_available We're out of beds.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, Psych's refusing to admit Judy Anderson.
not_available Psych? 
not_available Her collision was a deliberate act.
not_available I know you suspect postpartum depression, but did she admit it? Practically.
not_available She drove head
not_available on into a wall.
not_available The baby's seat wasn't properly anchored.
not_available She's obviously overwhelmed at home.
not_available ER, please hold.
not_available Please hold.
not_available Please hold.
not_available Has anybody seen Jerry? I sent him out on an errand, but he should be back by now.
not_available You sent him out? 
not_available You don't send Jerry out in the rain.
not_available I've heard that too.
not_available Maybe I should get DCFS involved.
not_available Have you talked to the husband? Maybe he can convince her.
not_available A voluntary admission would be better.
not_available I'll try.
not_available Frank, where's Jerry? Dr.
not_available Weaver sent him on an errand.
not_available Oh, no, you didn't.
not_available What's the big deal? Big man does not do well in the wet weather.
not_available What the hell does that mean? Excuse me.
not_available Could you help us find our dad? Lawrence Digby? He was hit by a car.
not_available The doctors are treating him.
not_available He got hit while crossing the street.
not_available Yeah, he was
not_available Guy was talking on his cell phone went through the crosswalk.
not_available I'll take you back to him.
not_available You can go home.
not_available Got a float from the ICU.
not_available I'll stay and help with the kids.
not_available You're welcome to do so, but you're off the clock.
not_available Fine with me.
not_available Come on, you guys.
not_available Can I take her home now? We'd like to keep her overnight.
not_available Come on.
not_available Overnight? Why? 
not_available I think your wife needs some help.
not_available I've tried to talk her into getting a nanny but she doesn't want another woman raising her daughter.
not_available It makes her feel like she's less of a mother or something.
not_available I don't mean that kind of help.
not_available I think Judy needs some psychiatric help.
not_available What? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Anderson Brad, why don't we sit down? It's not uncommon for new moms to get overwhelmed with all the challenges of child care, especially in the first year.
not_available So why are you making a big deal out of this? Usually, it's short
not_available lived and goes away after the baby falls into a routine and the mom's hormones stabilize.
not_available But occasionally, it lasts longer, becomes more severe and develops into something called postpartum depression.
not_available Yeah, yeah, but that's not Judy.
not_available Judy's not depressed.
not_available Not like that.
not_available I mean, sure, she's anxious to get back to work and sometimes she's a little down about that, but that's normal.
not_available Purposely trying to hurt herself and your baby isn't.
not_available What are you talking about? She had an accident.
not_available Some creep tried to run her off the road.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Nosebleed on Coumadin in Two.
not_available Okay.

not_available Turn on the suction.
not_available It's on.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I have it on high.
not_available I'm not getting anything here.
not_available Inez, why don't you go next door and help Dr.
not_available Lockhart with the chest tube? I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now? Patient is paralyzed, can't see the cords.
not_available I need suction.
not_available Hold your horses.
not_available The suction container wasn't sealed properly.
not_available You're welcome.

not_available I found it.
not_available Two units on the infuser.
not_available Set up for a subclavian.

not_available Just go help Dr.
not_available Kovac with the rapid infuser.
not_available No problem.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available Central line, supraumbilical DPL.
not_available Rapid infuser and a TPOD.
not_available What's a TPOD? 
not_available Fine, I'll get it.
not_available Again.
not_available What do you want to do first? Prime the O
not_available neg.
not_available Everything okay in there? For the time being.
not_available Call for four units of type specific.
not_available As soon as I get this up.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available Hypotensive pelvic fracture.
not_available He needs the works.
not_available Those are his kids out there.
not_available Hey, Frank.

not_available I'll be right in.

not_available She's good.
not_available Thanks, Sam.
not_available We'll take it from here.
not_available I'll go check on his kids.
not_available She's really not sure what happened.
not_available She gave herself a good whack in the head.
not_available We can't do anything if she doesn't identify her assailants.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Like I said, she's not sure what she remembers.
not_available She's not even certain it was intentional now.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let me know if she changes her mind.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available Next is get your wife help.
not_available No, the next step is for me to take her home.
not_available My wife is not crazy.
not_available She had an accident.
not_available It happens.
not_available I'd rather she chose to stay than have Psychiatry put her on forced hold.
not_available She's gonna be with me.
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available Just leave us alone.
not_available I mean it.
not_available Pressure's up to 100 systolic, crit's 28.
not_available Send another four units to angio.
not_available Daddy? Your dad has a broken pelvis which are the ring of bones around his waist.
not_available Some of his blood vessels have also been damaged.
not_available He's bleeding inside.
not_available Can you fix it? We're gonna try, but he's lost a lot of blood already.
not_available It's very serious.
not_available It was supposed to be me.
not_available I was supposed to get the pizza, but I didn't wanna go out in the rain.
not_available It's not your fault and it's not your dad's fault.
not_available Hey, jerk
not_available off.
not_available Jason.
not_available I can't drive for a week.
not_available Not that I could anyway.
not_available My car's totaled.

not_available Hey, that's enough.
not_available Hey, get that guy away from me.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Jason, I know you're mad, but your father's condition is very serious.
not_available And your brother and sister need you right now, okay? Come on, Jason, I'll take you to the family room.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, one of your patients is getting agitated.
not_available Which one? 
not_available The girl from the nursing home.
not_available She's in a coma, Inez.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Blaire? Where
not_available ? I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Where's my mom? Okay, keep your hands up as if you're holding a tray.
not_available What's wrong with me? What's the last thing you remember? My mom and I were going to the mall and it was snowing.
not_available And Were we in an accident? Is she okay? I didn't treat her, but Let me see what I can find out.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available How is she? 
not_available She doesn't remember anything.
not_available What are you gonna tell her? I don't know.
not_available Your mother's dead and you've been in a coma for six years? How are those kids doing? 
not_available They're hanging in there.
not_available I got ahold of an aunt and uncle.
not_available They're with them now.
not_available Inez, walk with me.
not_available Do I have to? 
not_available You have fantastic potential.
not_available I better get into this.
not_available But in every spare moment, you've got to be honing your skills.
not_available Got a second? 
not_available Not really.
not_available If you're so concerned with efficiency allow those of us who work well together to continue to do so.
not_available If you want us to act like professionals, then you need to treat us as such.
not_available You saw me with Dr.
not_available Kovac and how well we worked together.
not_available If that doesn't prove we can work the same shift then you don't know your job as well as you think you do.
not_available Feel better? FYl, I already changed the schedule.
not_available You're back on your old shifts next week.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When I first started, I could barely hook up an IV.
not_available It's all muscle memory.
not_available You'll get it.
not_available I know you will.
not_available I felt like an idiot.
not_available I didn't even know what a T
not_available POD was.
not_available Everybody needs help with stuff.
not_available When you do, come find me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Page me when he's out of surgery.
not_available Will do.
not_available You're back.
not_available Had a cancellation.
not_available He's this way.
not_available I tried Lee's cell but he wasn't answering.
not_available Is everything okay? 
not_available He's doing great.
not_available We're just waiting for them to take him to the cath lab.
not_available That sounds ominous.
not_available They're going to do angioplasty, which is a procedure where we insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, thread it up to his coronary artery which inflates a balloon that will open up the blockage.
not_available Guess those cheese steaks caught up with me.
not_available I've been telling him to eat better for years.
not_available Lee? Hey, you.
not_available Hey.
not_available This is my wife, Viv.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available I've been treating your husband.
not_available Hi.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available I've got a little blockage, but they're gonna fix it.
not_available I didn't get your name.
not_available Shawna.
not_available Hi.
not_available And you are? Therapist.
not_available From cardiology.
not_available Really? Your husband has to undergo an angioplasty.
not_available We insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg and use it to inflate a balloon that will hopefully open the blockage.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Well.
not_available Good luck, Mr.
not_available Rappaport.
not_available I have to get back to my other patients.
not_available It was nice to meet you.
not_available Excuse me for just one second.
not_available That was close.
not_available Thanks, I really owe you one.
not_available Hey, listen.
not_available If you ever need a sex therapist? I think I'm good.
not_available But now that you mention it, do you ever do any pro bono work? I spoke to your resident.
not_available He felt a hold was unnecessary.
not_available I disagree and all I'm asking is for a second assessment from another attending.
not_available Watch it.
not_available No, Dr.
not_available Wakita, not you.
not_available Where have you been? I was worried about you.
not_available Everyone was acting as if I'd sent you out in a hurricane.
not_available Are you okay? What the hell happened to King Funshine? Did you get hit by lightning again? He didn't get hit by lightning.
not_available Here's your change.
not_available Okay, let's get you on a cardiac monitor.
not_available CBC, chem panel, EKG, CPK, troponin, UA and myoglobin I realize that, I'm sure he is.
not_available But this isn't about me or him, or you.
not_available It's about the welfare of a mother and her child.
not_available You will? Great.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Psych attending will assess Judy Anderson.
not_available If Dr.
not_available Wakita asks, you agree with my assessment, right? Yeah, you got it.
not_available Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Anderson, I have some good news.
not_available One of the attendings agreed to speak with you.
not_available I've seen enough doctors today.
not_available We're going home.
not_available He's on his way down.
not_available We've been here for hours.
not_available This will only take a few minutes.
not_available I'm tired.
not_available I just wanna go home and have a dinner and a bath and put Grace in her own crib.
not_available You want what's best for baby, so do I.
not_available Then leave us alone.
not_available Speak to someone.
not_available She just needs to rest.
not_available You don't wanna hurt yourself or Grace.
not_available You need professional help.
not_available Do you have children? 
not_available No.
not_available Then how do you know? 
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available But you're not a mother.
not_available Judy, listen to me.
not_available Please don't go.
not_available My wife has a touch of the baby blues and you wanna lock her up.
not_available No one's locking anyone up.
not_available Just want her to get the help she needs.
not_available By giving her drugs? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Ignoring it is not gonna make it go away.
not_available It needs to be treated the same as any other disease.
not_available Now, this could happen again.
not_available Only next time, it could be worse.
not_available Judy, Judy, please.
not_available You could die, Judy.
not_available Your baby could die.
