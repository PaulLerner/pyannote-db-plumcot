not_available I can't help it.
not_available I think it looks good.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Farrah was my favorite.
not_available Yeah, mine too.
not_available Same here.
not_available I used to love that poster.
not_available The one with the red bathing suit.
not_available Yeah, with the Mexican blanket
not_available thing background.
not_available We had that up at the precinct.

not_available This is totally creeping me out.
not_available You and me.
not_available I'll be in the ladies room.
not_available I'll walk with you.
not_available Hey, Frank, would you please get the lab results for Mr.
not_available Archibald? Hey, Pratt, can I talk to you a second? What's up, Gates? Don't you think you should have told me about your brother? I mean, I still would have sponsored him.
not_available But, been nice if you'd said something.
not_available What are you talking about now? 
not_available He's gay.
not_available Yeah, so what? Oh, you interested? 
not_available Come on, Greg.
not_available "Come on, Greg" what? What exactly was I supposed to say? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available "My brother's gay"? Okay, and then what would you have done? 
not_available Something.
not_available Gave him some advice.
not_available Really? Like what? I don't know, you know.
not_available But now his whole station's on to it, you know.
not_available I could have done something, made it easier on him.
not_available I'm just saying.
not_available Just say your way back up to the ICU and mind your own damn business.
not_available Lab results for Mr.
not_available Willy Archibald.
not_available Ah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Archibald, listen to me.
not_available I cannot help you unless you talk to me.
not_available Now, what is it? Percocet? Demerol? Heroin? 
not_available Hell, no.
not_available I don't mess with that stuff.
not_available It's vicodin.
not_available Where'd you get the prescription? My mom gets it for me.
not_available She's on Medicare.
not_available I can't afford that stuff on 7.50 an hour.
not_available Mr.
not_available Archibald 
not_available You don't know how I feel.

not_available Figured I could still drive, right? 
not_available Now I can barely do that.
not_available How long have you been on Vicodin? Years.
not_available I need three, four a day.
not_available It used to knock me out, but it doesn't do that anymore.
not_available Mr.
not_available Archibald, painkillers are very, very addictive.
not_available What the hell you want me to do, doc? Soon my mom is gonna be driving me around.
not_available She's 80, man.
not_available I can get you on the surgery list here.
not_available It's free of charge.
not_available I'm on the damn list.
not_available It's an 18
not_available month wait.
not_available A private hospital would take you tomorrow if you had the money.
not_available Are you saying that you have absolutely no assets? Just the house I bought my mom.
not_available And I'm not selling that.
not_available Well, I can't allow you to keep popping vicodin like it's candy.
not_available I'll see what I can do to get you bumped up on the County list.
not_available Here.
not_available It's worth a lot.
not_available It's real diamonds and gold.
not_available Maybe someone will take it as a payment for the surgery.
not_available Put it up on that eBay or something.
not_available Mr.
not_available Archibald, I cannot Please, doc.
not_available I can't live with this pain any longer.
not_available Please.
not_available Hello? Wait, wait, wait.

not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Dr.

not_available centimeter lac on the forehead.

not_available We got a few things to discuss before you leave.
not_available It's Johns Hopkins.
not_available Something went wrong.
not_available I didn't get in.
not_available I anticipated this.
not_available Just relax.
not_available I faxed your consent forms.
not_available I warned them about you, you little card shark.
not_available I gotta go over there just to win my money back.
not_available Texas hold'em isn't your game.
not_available I got some news.
not_available Good news, bad news.
not_available What do you want first? Bad.
not_available I like to end on an up.
not_available Well, the bad news is, you can't go home and pack for Baltimore.
not_available There's something you have to do.
not_available And the good news is a surprise.
not_available What is it? If I tell you, it will ruin the whole surprise element.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available You're gonna love it.
not_available You're in on this too? 
not_available Enough yakking.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on, we got stuff to do.
not_available Look out.
not_available Clear out.
not_available Too bad they don't take care of the old guys.
not_available If it wasn't for guys like Willy putting their bodies on the line there wouldn't be an NFL.
not_available It's a damn shame.
not_available It's a damn shame he didn't save some of that money.
not_available A guy was lucky to make Not like these multimillion
not_available dollar clowns today.
not_available Half of them crybabies and criminals.
not_available May I hold it? Wow.
not_available I heard Ditka himself auctioned off his NFC Championship ring to help out some of the old players.
not_available This is priceless.
not_available This is earned with sweat and blood in the trenches of the gridiron.
not_available You can't sell it.
not_available Chemo boy pulled his central line.
not_available He's bleeding all over Curtain 4.
not_available And there's a rig 10 minutes out.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, how's Joe? I could get somebody else to take that rig if you need me.
not_available Woke up crying, purposeful movements.
not_available Morris has got him.
not_available I brought two gowns in case he throws up again.

not_available 0 nylon.

not_available "He " Oh I know it hurts.
not_available Could you just call me as soon as you get this message? Bye.
not_available It's okay, Abby.
not_available He'll call you back.
not_available Could you hold his head still? 
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available What are you doing? Closing the lac.
not_available No, I'll do it.
not_available He's an intern.
not_available Yeah, who knows how to Dermabond a laceration.
not_available What if it gets infected or he gets a giant scar? You wanna be responsible for that? 
not_available Better me than you.
not_available Sure about that? 
not_available He's right, Abby.
not_available Call CT, let them know we're on our way.
not_available No CT.
not_available We agreed we'd just observe.
not_available Yeah, before he vomited.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, it's too much radiation.
not_available No one knows the long
not_available term effects.
not_available Morris, we over
not_available CT kids.
not_available We've had this discussion a thousand times.
not_available Yeah.
not_available LOC, vomiting.
not_available You know he needs a scan.
not_available His vitals are good, his mental status is fine, the LOC was transient.
not_available Observation is enough.
not_available It's not a head bleed.
not_available The mechanism isn't there.
not_available Lf this was your patient and not your son, what would you do? All right.
not_available No peeking.
not_available I'm not.
not_available You better not be.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available I was ready a half hour ago.
not_available All right, take your hands down.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Front row, third base line, right behind the on
not_available deck circle.
not_available You can't afford those tickets.
not_available It's not how much you make, my young friend, it's who you know.
not_available We'll get him in and out soon as we can.
not_available I'll give you an immediate read.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No IV? We didn't think we needed one.
not_available We should get one in.
not_available Usually, a little whiff of ketamine does the trick.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't wanna sedate him.
not_available It's only gonna take a few seconds, right? I've scanned a lot of toddlers.
not_available Trust me, you want the drugs.
not_available I can do it in one needle stick, Abby.
not_available I promise.
not_available Hypoventilation, drug allergies, it's just not worth the risk.
not_available We can't get a good look unless he holds completely still.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you pass me that? Shh.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I just wanna try something, okay? Shh, shh, shh.
not_available Here you go.
not_available If it doesn't work, you can sedate him.
not_available Just let me try, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And this one too.
not_available And what about this? Oh.
not_available Remember this book? Daddy Takes a Trip.
not_available Huh? Hah.
not_available "This is me when I was your age, Joe.
not_available " What do you think? Do you? Hah.
not_available What's that? "This is me and your Uncle Niko.
not_available We loved the beach.
not_available " Do you see them on the beach, right there? Right in here? Who's that? Who's that? "This is me, your dad, missing you, wishing you were here.
not_available " These seats are exceptional.
not_available We never sat this close before.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Man.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You Josh? Stand up.
not_available Yeah, this is Josh.
not_available I'm Tony Gates.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Josh Lipnicki.
not_available His mom, Serena.
not_available Hey, Josh.
not_available Derrek Lee.
not_available This is for you.
not_available Whole team signed it.
not_available Wow, thanks, Mr.
not_available Lee.
not_available Good luck in Baltimore.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lee.
not_available Yeah? I gotta tell you, your opponents have a statistical tendency to pitch you high and outside.
not_available And the wind's blowing out today, so lay off that stuff, you'll murder them.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll keep that in mind.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available That's a first.
not_available Pretty cool, huh? 
not_available Yes.
not_available This definitely qualifies as cool.
not_available Nice.
not_available No answer? Well, by the time you reach him, all you're gonna have is good news.
not_available You know, I thought the NICU was tough but at least both of us were there.
not_available And he was brand new.
not_available I didn't even know him yet.
not_available But now "he's now" he's Joe.
not_available Okay.
not_available So Abby What? There's no subdural, no epidural.
not_available The grey
not_available white junctions and sulci look sharp.
not_available And there's no evidence of diffuse axonal injury.
not_available Well, that's good, right? But? There's a subtle high
not_available density irregularity in the left parietal region.
not_available It's small and it could be nothing.
not_available Since it correlates with the location " of" his injury, I think we're obliged to check it out with an MRI.
not_available After all this, we have to sedate him anyway.
not_available We need him still for 45 minutes.
not_available I know.
not_available We'll take him to the ER.
not_available We'll have Chuny start the Iv.
not_available She's the best in town.
not_available I want LMX cream.
not_available Okay, I'll put it on now, give it time to work.
not_available He's got an 18 gauge in the right antecubital fossa.
not_available Got 40 of Lasix en route.
not_available All right, we got it.
not_available Make yourself useful and go refill the airway box, rookie.
not_available Hey, come hit me later.
not_available We gotta talk.
not_available BP, 194/126.
not_available So CHF exacerbation.
not_available We already got Lasix.

not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available You all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Jeez, I was just kidding around.
not_available Greg, can you get out of here? 
not_available What? Get out of here, man.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I always open up a second kit.
not_available That way I'll never need it, you know? Here's your flush.
not_available I hate this.
not_available I'll make it quick.
not_available Shh, shh.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, baby.
not_available It's okay.

not_available Come on.
not_available We'll be right next door.
not_available I'll sit with you, okay? Listen to me.
not_available Listen, baby, I love you.
not_available I remember when Alex was 3.
not_available I took him to one of those bounce houses at the carnival.
not_available And of course he's in there with 5and 6year
not_available old kids.
not_available So he gets knocked down, right? And every time he tries to get up he keeps getting knocked down again, and he's crying, "Mommy! Mommy!" The attendant won't let me in because he thinks I'm some stupid teenager.
not_available So, what'd you do? I stood there and I cheered him on.
not_available And every time he got knocked down, I told him, "I know you can get up.
not_available " But that's when it hit me.
not_available They fall.
not_available And all you can do is be there and hope they keep getting up.
not_available Just keep some ice on it.
not_available You should be fine.
not_available I was just breaking the kid's balls, you know? It was a joke.
not_available Jokes are supposed to be funny.
not_available Come back in a few days and I'll check your eye out again.
not_available Hey, I got empty chairs in there.
not_available Come on, who's up for some pampering? 
not_available It's not really my style.
not_available End of my shift, I am there, Ang.
not_available How about you, huh? I could wax those brows, make you look 10 years younger.
not_available You should do it.
not_available It's like you've got two caterpillars over your eyes.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Unlike you goodfornothings 
not_available " I'm" not vain about my appearance.

not_available He's green, big eyes, crazy hair.
not_available Well, no point tenderness.
not_available He's got full range of motion.
not_available I don't think it's broken.
not_available Why didn't you say it was a green bogeyman? I got something that will fix that right up.

not_available A switch flipped.
not_available Come on, man, you know what I'm saying.
not_available You're my family.
not_available I know you probably thought you were helping and I appreciate it but if my big brother the doctor, comes to the rescue " then" they're gonna respect you.
