not_available Do you mind if we discuss this with him?.

not_available Huh, wow.
not_available It's like Cirque du Soleil.
GlRL Good job! 
MAN Don't touch the web.
not_available Hey.
not_available What?.
not_available Well, if everyone goes through the web, it kind of builds a team.
not_available That's stupid.
not_available He doesn't have to if he doesn't want to.
not_available It would mean a lot to the kids if you'd join in.
not_available It wouldn't mean a lot to me.
not_available Why don't you do it for them?.
not_available You really want me to go to the other side?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I did it.
not_available Look at me, I'm on the other side.

not_available It was a thought experiment.
not_available Uh, the cat in the box was either alive or dead depending on a random event.
not_available Okay, I am completely confused.
not_available That makes two of us.
not_available Great news, it was just a sinus attack.
not_available When you ran, your pulse rate went up to 1 8O.
not_available That means she can go back?.
not_available Well, she got shocked six times.
not_available So I think we gotta keep you in the hospital.
not_available I'm not getting admitted.
not_available Not during camp.
not_available Honey, this thing zapped you at a heart rate of 1 6O.
not_available So if you exert yourself at all
not_available Why don't you set it higher?.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available We can do that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, no shocks until 2OO.
not_available But only till after the dance, all right?.
not_available Huh?.
not_available Two weeks later, she can walk in the door like nothing happened?.

not_available lt hurts when I take a breath.
not_available Could a clot have gone to her lung?.
not_available I would say, yes.
not_available There's new right axis deviation, and an S1, Q3.
not_available She's on heparin.
not_available It's not a perfect drug.
not_available What do we do now?.
not_available We could try TPA.
not_available It's a powerful clot
not_available busting medicine.
not_available If it works, she's back to normal with only a 1 percent risk.
not_available What about the baby?.
BANFlELD There are no good studies.
not_available TPA definitely carries a risk of miscarriage or fetal death.
not_available How big a risk?.
not_available T en percent, maybe more.
HEDDA Oh, God.
not_available What about a vena cava filter?.
not_available If we put a filter in your main vein here we could prevent future clots from traveling to your lung.
not_available But it takes time.
not_available We
not_available We don't want to hurt the baby.
not_available What would you do?.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I don't care if we have to stay here all day.
not_available No, me neither.
not_available They keep bugging me to play their stupid games.
not_available They don't get it.
not_available They don't understand.
not_available We could flush some tennis balls down the toilets.
not_available That would back them up for days.
not_available Or I know where there's spray paint.
not_available We could tag ""camp sucks"" all over the walls of the gym.
not_available Huh?.
not_available Or we can pull fire alarms and make them evacuate all the patients.
not_available Or we can
not_available We can just sit here and do nothing.
not_available You think I'm being a jerk.
not_available No.
not_available I think that you're not letting yourself have a good time.
not_available It's not a good time.
not_available Because Sean's not here.
not_available Sean?.
not_available I met him in September, we were in for heart caths.
not_available We both had truncus arteriosus.
not_available You know what that is?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Since we were babies, we had the same operations and were on the same meds.
not_available He had never been to camp.
not_available I kept telling him how great it was.
not_available We made plans, we talked and texted every day.
not_available He thought he could win the Kahuna's fart contest.
not_available We were gonna have so much fun.
not_available He had to go to surgery last week for a conduit replacement.
not_available Died on the table.
not_available Logan, I'm sorry.
not_available Hello.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I'llI'll
not_available I'll be there as soon as I can.
not_available Not a good week all around.
not_available What?.
not_available A good friend of mine is in the lCU.
not_available Uh.
not_available I tried really hard to get her a heart transplant but now she's back in rejection.
not_available It's pretty bad.
not_available What are you doing here?.
not_available Well, l
not_available I stopped by, but she's in a coma.
not_available I've been intubated like 1 0 times.
not_available When I'm deeply sedated, I can hear everything.
not_available I can even tell who's in the room.
not_available She'll know if you're there.
not_available Trached a month ago for myasthenia gravis.
not_available Bleeding this morning, opened up in Triage.
not_available Tracheo
not_available innominate fistula from pressure necrosis.
GATES Four units of O
not_available neg.
not_available Have Thoracic Surgery hold an OR.
GATES Pouring out faster than we can transfuse.
not_available Overinflate the trach cuff.
not_available That can tamponade the bleeder.
MARQUEZ You want the rapid infuser?.
GATES Absolutely.
not_available This isn't helping.
not_available More air and I'll burst the cuff.
not_available A number four Shiley.
not_available That's a pediatric size.
not_available Wait and see.
MARQUEZ HemoCue is only eightpoint
not_available two.
BANFlELD Now put your finger in the trach hole and compress against the posterior sternum.
not_available Like this?.
BANFlELD Well done.
not_available Now get your ass up to the OR.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We took her to Radiology for the filter, crashed before they started.
not_available BP 70 palp, tachy to 1 20.
not_available You may need to intubate her.
not_available Wait, what's going on?.
not_available Likely it's another blood clot.
not_available We need to think about TPA.
not_available We don't want it.
not_available Don't want to hurt the baby.
not_available Things have changed.
JASON No, honey, honey.
not_available Honey, honey, talk to me.
not_available Honey, I need your help here.
not_available Wait.
not_available What are you doing?.
not_available Wait, What
not_available ?.
not_available What
not_available ?.
not_available What are you doing?.
BANFlELD Baby looks great.
not_available Placenta is perfect.
not_available No sign of bleeding.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And the clot in your lung has completely dissolved.
not_available I thought I was gonna lose both of you.
not_available Well, we like it when things work out.
not_available Dr Banfield, you gave TPA without consent.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Well, what if there had been a bad outcome?.
not_available She's young and healthy and was about to die.
not_available Do I need consent to shock her heart if she has cardiac arrest?.
not_available I guess you got lucky.
not_available You saved that lady?.
not_available Yep.
not_available And her baby too.
not_available Uh, I'll get these to the lab.
not_available You're still here?.
not_available That guy with the bleeding neck?.
not_available He's okay after surgery.
not_available Is there some place we could talk?.
not_available In here.
not_available What's on your mind?.
not_available I've been thinking about it and I want him to be proud of me.
not_available Yes.
not_available To do that, though, I'd want to make something of myself.
not_available You know, be somebody who did something important.
not_available Like you.
not_available Like me?.
not_available Make a difference, you know?.
not_available That's a good goal.
not_available I don't know if I'd really be able to do that if I quit school right now.
not_available Having a kid's gonna be really hard.
not_available That's true.
not_available The nurses told me you were the custodian of the baby.
not_available Does that mean you wanted to adopt him?.
not_available My husband and l were thinking about it.
not_available I'm just scared I'll never see him again.
not_available That
not_available That doesn't have to happen.
not_available You can watch him grow up get to know him, be part of his life.
not_available It's called an open adoption.
not_available How do we do that?.
not_available Il
not_available If we all agree, we can work it out.
not_available What is taking so long?.
VERA Uh, give us two minutes.
not_available Yeah, I'm timing you.
not_available Tony, we're on next.
not_available We didn't do a sound check.
VERA Just start without us.

not_available You went from a night on the town to a night in a pup tent without a hitch.
not_available Ah.
not_available Life's too short to whine.
not_available It is.
not_available You know, you spend a day with these kids, you realize.
not_available This
not_available This is totally random but sometimes I imagine a night in the future.
not_available A night where I would take you out, spend money, make a deal about it.
not_available And it would end like this.
not_available When I ask you to marry me.
not_available What do you think?.
not_available I think I'd say yes.
VERA Dr.
