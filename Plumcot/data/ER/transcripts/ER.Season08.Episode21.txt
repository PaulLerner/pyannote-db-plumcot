not_available Some aren't.
not_available Hey, I'm looking for a long board for my daughter.

not_available How long were you thinking? 
not_available Nine, 9' 1 ".
not_available Maybe a Hamilton.
not_available What's she doing? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Does she even want a surfboard? 
not_available Watch this.
not_available I know.
not_available Who's he? 
not_available Don't stare.

not_available Well, does she know him? 
not_available He works here.
not_available His name's Kai.
not_available Kai? 
not_available Kai.
not_available It means "ocean." She's made up a new excuse why we had to come back the last three days.

not_available Maybe 17.
not_available I have some boards she might like.
not_available A Papa San and a Sunburnt.
not_available Good.
not_available Rachel, can you come and help me? Remember when I used to sing you to sleep? No.
not_available You made me do it for years.
not_available You watched The Wizard of Oz and The Little Mermaid over and over again.
not_available It'd drive me crazy.
not_available We had that apartment off of Division with the big iron gates out front and that funny
not_available looking mutt next door.
not_available Dudley? Dad.
not_available There was a playground across the street.
not_available Remember the big slide? I don't.
not_available I don't remember, okay? I don't remember any of that stuff! It's not important! And you just keep talking and talking about it! 
not_available It is important.
not_available No, it's not! Where you used to live, where we used to live and Grandmom's stupid garden, Granddad's cousin Dave, or whatever.
not_available Rachel, keep your voice down.
not_available The baby's sleeping.
not_available I'm trying to tell you about us, about our family, our history.
not_available It's stupid, boring, useless crap! It's not crap! Some dog named Dudley? 
not_available You loved that dog.
not_available I don't care about these things! I don't wanna hear this stuff! So just stop talking to me about it.
not_available I'll go.
not_available How long are you planning on keeping this up? He's not perfect.
not_available Far from it.
not_available But he's trying.
not_available You've got to grow up faster than you should have to.
not_available You don't get to be a child anymore.
not_available Your father's dying.
not_available I know that.
not_available He's going to die soon.
not_available Very soon.
not_available If you keep on like this, you're gonna miss what little time you have left with him.
not_available This is it, Rachel.
not_available This is your last chance.
not_available And if you blow it, you're gonna end up hating yourself for the rest of your life.
not_available Shit! I'm a bit worried about that cough.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We could go to the hospital and get a CBC and a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Mark, the Decadron's suppressing your immune system.
not_available No kidding.
not_available Did you up it again? Okay, well, if it turns to pneumonia, we can give IV antibiotics.
not_available Pneumonia, huh? That's not a bad way to go.
not_available Okay.
not_available There you go.
not_available Where's Rachel? 
not_available She's at Sunset with Kai.
not_available Nice offshore breeze.
not_available Waves should be great.
not_available They're spending a great deal of time together.
not_available He's a nice kid.
not_available So you're not worried? About what? About what they might be doing in all that time.
not_available No.
not_available I think it's great.
not_available I need you to do something for me.
not_available It might be kind of hard.
not_available I wanna write letters to Rachel and Ella.
not_available I tried to do it myself but I can't read my own writing now.
not_available I want them to open letters on special days.
not_available You know? High
not_available school graduation, college their wedding days.
not_available Think that's cruel? Reaching out from beyond the grave on days when they should be happy? I think they'll cherish every single word.
not_available Told you it might be hard.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Is he asleep? Yep.
not_available He sleeps a lot now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's in a lot of pain.
not_available It won't be long now.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I was just dreaming about you.
not_available You were? 
not_available When you used to love balloons.
not_available You remember how much you loved balloons? 
not_available No.
not_available I used to buy them for you.
not_available And right when I handed them to you you'd let them go.
not_available Drive your mother crazy.
not_available Sit with me.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit.
not_available I was trying to figure out what I should have already told you but I never have.
not_available Something important.
not_available Something every father should impart to his daughter.
not_available I finally got it.
not_available Generosity.
not_available Be generous with your time with your love with your life.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry, Rachel.
not_available I'm so tired.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Don't cry for me.
not_available I won't.
not_available Be generous always.
not_available I will.
not_available Daddy? I remember the lullaby.
not_available I remember you used to sing it to me every night.
not_available I remember.
not_available It's a sheep.
not_available the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord 
not_available though he were dead, yet shall he live.
not_available And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
not_available I know that my redeemer liveth and he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth.
not_available And though his body be destroyed Can I still come see Ella? Summers or at Christmas? Of course.
not_available She's your sister.
not_available Hey! Hey, hey, can you pull over, please? What? 
not_available Right here.
