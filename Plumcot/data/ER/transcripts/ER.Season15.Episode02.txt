not_available I'll make sure they have room.
not_available Four of us, dry martinis, straight up with a twist.
not_available You'll all be decontaminated and admitted for observation.
not_available I hope they've can decontaminate our insides because we've been breathing that crap for a long time.
not_available Ow! 
not_available Positive Murphy sign.
not_available Any fever?.
not_available Yeah, white count's 24 ultrasound showed acalculous cholecystitis.
not_available Looks like you're gonna need an operation to take out your gallbladder.
not_available Will I have to stay home from school?.
not_available For a few days.
not_available We'll be doing it laparoscopically.
not_available We'll only be making a tiny cut.
not_available If you make a bigger cut, could I stay home longer?.
not_available Don't like school, huh?.
not_available I just moved here and everyone already knows each other.
not_available Did you write a preop note?.
not_available Not yet.
not_available It's hard, I know.
not_available I just moved here too.
not_available The girls in my new school, well, they're all into being cool and making out.
not_available I miss Detroit.
not_available Listen, you don't wanna be cool in 7th grade.
not_available I don't?.
ANDREW No way.
not_available Seventh
not_available grade cool kids peak at 1 6.

not_available Am I right?.
not_available For sure.
not_available Got a trauma.
not_available They're asking for you.
not_available Make sure you get consent from mom.
not_available You know, the truth is every cool adult will tell you they were an unpopular kid.
not_available You're just saying that.
not_available No, it's like a rule of the universe.
not_available You'll see.
not_available I will?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The adventure is just beginning.
not_available Grab another cordis, this wire is kinked.
not_available Fluid in Morison's.
not_available He needs a repeat HemoCue.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Hey, hang in there.
not_available I know it's hard to watch.
HANNAH This is all my fault.
not_available I took him with me on the job.
not_available Ahem.
not_available I don't have anyone to watch him, stay with him after school.
not_available Believe me, I get that.
HANNAH I'm a locksmith.
not_available The banks have us running ragged, changing locks on foreclosed houses.
not_available Sounds depressing.
not_available Who knows why some people's lives work out and others don't?.
not_available It all seems so random.
not_available Yeah.
not_available A subclavian's in, get the blood bank to rush our packed cells.
HANNAH Devon thought that he saw a cat in the house and he went inside to see.
not_available And the next thing I know he was screaming through a hole in the floor.
not_available Your tube's in the right main stem.
MORRlS I know.
not_available Pull it back.
not_available I put it there to decrease the risk of pneumo during line placement.
not_available Then you should decrease tidal volume.
not_available Okay, you know what?.
not_available You need to stop micromanaging everyone.
not_available Do your job and I won't have to.
NEELA Have this out later.
not_available We need to get him to surgery now.

not_available You know, we don't have time for this.
not_available Two minutes.
not_available Listen, baby boy.
not_available I want you to be strong in there.
not_available Okay?.
not_available Because if anything happened to you the world would stop.
not_available You know that, right?.
MAN We'll get them in here.
GATES Felix made it to the OR.
not_available RY 
AN Baby, they do it every year.
not_available It's tradition.
not_available What about Jacob?.
not_available Tucked away in the PlCU.
not_available They keep us overnight the first day.
not_available It's a ritual.
not_available Should be fun.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Kiss the kids goodnight.
not_available Why are you lying to your wife?.
not_available She'd freak if she knew the truth.
not_available Give her a little credit.
not_available RY 
AN Thanks.
not_available Annie grew up in west Texas, in a town with like 4OOO people.
not_available Never meant to end up with a guy from Brooklyn.
not_available She was totally against moving to the city, but I fought for it.
not_available Can't practice emergency medicine out in the sticks.
not_available RY 
AN Exactly.
not_available I talked her into this.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available She was nervous about smog, traffic, purse snatchers.
not_available So I can't quite bring myself to tell her that on my first day I was the target of a weapon of mass destruction.
not_available Hey, you.
GATES Hi.
not_available You okay?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not coughing blood, the night is still young.

SAM Oh! Hey, we need a gurney here! 
not_available Keloid cowboy can go home.
not_available He has a follow

not_available Cholecystitis girl will have to hang here.
not_available She won't mind, she's crushing on Dr.
not_available Andrew here.
not_available Too bad I only have eyes for you.
not_available Dusty, that boy's going to the OR.
not_available I'm pretty sure it's a liver lac.
not_available Tell them to prep.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available You wanna grab a coffee?.
not_available You know, after this settles down?.
not_available Or maybe a stiff drink's more in order.
not_available It's been quite a day.
not_available Yeah, it has.
not_available I just thought we could talk about what happened.
not_available Don't mind her, she's in a foul mood.
not_available Today's her day off, she struck out with Anspaugh, got into this mess.
not_available Anspaugh?.
not_available She's on campaign to bring Lucien back.
not_available I told her it was a lost cause, but Neela's stubborn.
not_available Your uncle is worse.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Marisol, you work here.
not_available Elective
not_available surgery guys were asking how they could help.
not_available I suggested they take the pancreatitis case off your plate.
not_available That is, unless you wanted to do that one yourself.
not_available Are you for real?.
not_available Got blood pressure yet?.
not_available BP 85/51.
not_available It's too low to get access.
not_available Satting okay?.
not_available Go back to the tent.
not_available ls it the ricin?.
not_available You haven't been cleared yet.
not_available ls this what happens?.
not_available Let's let Dr.
not_available Banfield fix him.
not_available Come on.
not_available Do you think it's the ricin?.
not_available Seems early, but it's possible.
not_available Brachial artery's here.
not_available Slightly medial, you'll hit the vein.
SAM Got a flash.
not_available Welcome back.
RElDY Drug overdose in PEA.
not_available Found him with a syringe still connected to an lV.
not_available We're closed to trauma.
not_available He's wearing a County bracelet registered for today.
not_available Must've wandered off for a drug fix.
not_available My cellulitis guy.
not_available All right, move him upstairs, let's go.
MORRlS Resuming compressions.
not_available Narcan's in.
MORRlS It's the fourth dose.
SAM Are we sure it's opiates?.
not_available Some guy told the paramedics they shot heroin together an hour ago.
not_available He has track marks all over his ankles.
not_available It's called a headto
not_available toe exam for a reason.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Still PEA.
not_available Another epi.
not_available He was taking his high
not_available school equivalency.
not_available He was not the type of guy who was gonna shoot up.
not_available You ask about lV drug use before you sent him out with a portal into a vessel?.
not_available Not specifically, no.
not_available You cannot judge people based on what they' re reading.
not_available I expect you to know that.
not_available Just heard from the CDC.
not_available The ricin powder was too coarse to vaporize.
not_available No chance a toxic dose could've got into the lungs.
not_available That's good news, Frank.
FRANK Exam 2 needs to stay sealed pending environmental detail.
not_available That's a precaution.
not_available Otherwise, we're clear.
BANFlELD Thanks, Frank.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available No change.
not_available That's it, we're done.
not_available What?.
not_available Four rounds of cardiac meds and still he's in agonal rhythm.
not_available Core temp's dropping, this guy's dead.
CRENSHAW What's our EBL?.
ANDREW 4OO cc's.
CRENSHAW Not bad.
not_available Sponge.
NEELA How's it going?.
CRENSHAW Liver lac, grade three, just like you thought.
not_available Repair's going well, vitals are solid.
not_available I think Andrew here is a good
not_available luck charm.
not_available Irrigate right here.
not_available I'll let the ER know.
not_available Is it cool if I go, then?.
CRENSHAW Yeah, check out the sitin outside Anspaugh's office 
not_available on your way out.
NEELA What?.
CRENSHAW Brenner organized some kind of protest.
not_available Everyone's talking about it.
MAN Dr.
not_available Dubenko has been an.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available We want Dubenko back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner says his uncle responds to the whole strengthin
not_available numbers concept.
not_available Sit down, join us.
not_available No.
not_available I've, uh, got some loose ends downstairs.
MAN 
not_available be released.
not_available Not under these circumstances.
not_available When can I see Devon?.
not_available As soon as he's in recovery, they'll let us know.
not_available While you were asleep, the police came by.
not_available They investigated the house.
not_available It seems the prior owner intentionally broke a water pipe.
not_available Flooded the whole first floor.
not_available A ""screw you"" to the bank for repossessing.
not_available We see that.
not_available With the heat and humidity, the floor boards rotted and just gave way.
not_available Doesn't change the fact that I've been dragging my son all over the South Side changing locks.
not_available He's only 8 years old.
not_available He deserves to be protected from the world.
not_available You know, this idea that we can protect our children you believe it because you have to but it's an illusion.
not_available So, what?.
not_available It's all just luck?.
not_available All you can do is hope for the best?.
not_available You love him, you spend time with him that's all any kid wants.
SAM One second she's a raging bitch and the next she's Mother Teresa.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available Well, she's pretty good at faking compassion.
not_available Hey, I know you know this but what she said about the OD, that was crap.
not_available It wasn't your fault.
not_available Thanks, Archie.
FRANK Hello?.
not_available Hello?.
not_available Disconnected every damn phone.
not_available Pain assessment forms?.
not_available File them next to the H &amp; P sheets.
not_available Okay.
not_available Patient satisfaction surveys?.
not_available These are all filled out.
not_available I'll take those.
not_available And this looks like an old handout on renal failure by Greg Pratt.
not_available Should I toss it?.
not_available It's from
not_available No, you should not toss that.
not_available That's his work.
not_available That's his legacy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Mind if I give you feedback?.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Control your emotions.
not_available Can we not do this?.
not_available Act like a leader.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available All the criticism, the bullying.
not_available That's how you get people to respect you?.
not_available You have been storming around, sulking all day.
not_available You are an Attending physician, not a toddler.
not_available Did you think that I was finished?.
not_available You know what, lady?.
not_available Shut up.
not_available We have been through hell here the last few weeks.
not_available But somehow we're getting through it.
not_available And you know how?.
not_available By showing up here every day and dedicating ourselves to this work! You don't know us.
not_available You don't know this place.
not_available And the last thing we need is for some stranger to come in and tell us how it's done.
not_available I know that you lost a friend and I'm sorry about that.
not_available But we will never have a conversation like this again.
not_available Understand?.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can l, uh, talk to you?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm all ears.
not_available Thank you for what you did.
not_available I mean, the thing for Lucien.
not_available I don't know if it will work, but I appreciate it.
not_available I really do.
not_available No big deal.
not_available And, um, you know, maybe I'm being presumptuous here but, um, if this was in any way some kind of gesture intended for, well me, I guess I just wanna be clear.
not_available Clear?.
not_available We're work colleagues, and that's all.
not_available I don't wanna go for coffee or drinks with you.
not_available Not now, not ever.
not_available Okay?.
not_available So let me get this straight.
not_available Me going to bat for Lucien is actually some sort of, uh, romantic overture to impress you?.
not_available You've lost me there.
not_available But, um, don't worry about the drinks.
not_available That's, uh, message received.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner, your favorite waterskier's asking for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I've got the old records on your thalassemia guy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I called the pneumonia kid's insurance company 
not_available told them we're not transferring.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Uh, listen.
not_available I know things have been a bit rough with you and Dr.
not_available Morris today.
not_available And I hope you don't mind my saying, he's not himself.
not_available He took Dr.
not_available Pratt's death harder than any of us.
not_available But he's a good guy, he's a good doctor and
not_available I don't have a problem with Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available You don't?.
not_available Nope.
not_available He cares about his patients, has an opinion, takes a stand.
not_available And works his ass off, which is more than I can say about you.
not_available Excuse me?.
not_available You better get things in order, Frank.
not_available It's a mess around here.
not_available I can't believe they made me throw away my shoes.
not_available Louboutins.
not_available You know how much those cost?.
not_available No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
not_available That was quite the first day, huh?.
TRACY You could say that.
not_available I got to perform a liver lac on an 8year
not_available old boy.
not_available That is so cool.
not_available Wait, so they're not admitting you?.
not_available No.
not_available You all heard the ricin isn't dangerous, right?.
DARlA What?.
not_available So, what happened?.
not_available I mean, why'd you faint?.
not_available I was reading about psychosomatic responses to perceived toxic threats.
not_available Apparently, it's pretty common.
not_available Oh, so you're a hypochondriac?.
not_available I said psychosomatic.
not_available It's different.
not_available Either way, you'll live to see another day of scut.
not_available Welcome to internship, the dream starts now.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Hi.
GATES Hey.
not_available Health Department said you're cool to go.

not_available See you, kids.
DARlA Bye.
ANDREW Bye.
SAM Cute couple.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So when are you going to class?.
not_available Forget it.
not_available It's a bad idea.
not_available What?.
not_available Why?.
not_available I'm missing work, I'm barely there for Alex.
not_available The last thing I need is to complicate my life.
not_available I don't know what happened, but you're a kick
not_available ass nurse and a good mother and this is something you should do.
not_available You'd be great at it.
not_available Really?.
not_available Yes.
not_available Besides, I wanna spend time with Sarah and Alex anyway.
not_available All right.
not_available I mean, I guess I can make it 
not_available if I really hurry.
not_available Of course you can.
not_available Go.
not_available I'm just gonna get some beer, we're gonna play quarters spark up the bong.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm glad you didn't die today.
NEELA The whole department was there.
not_available Doctors, nurses, techs, clerks.
not_available They were all sat outside Anspaugh's office demanding your return.
not_available Can we talk about this later?.
not_available I' m about to go out.
not_available What's there to talk about?.
not_available These things happen for a reason.
not_available Maybe it really is time to move on.
not_available Time for a new chapter.
not_available You belong at County.
not_available You know it and I know it.
not_available Don't make me beg.
not_available It's healthy to change things up, you know?.
not_available I was stagnating there.
not_available Oh, that's bollocks.
not_available That's what my yogi says, and I'm telling you, he's always right.
not_available Lucien don't be an idiot.
not_available Come back to work.
