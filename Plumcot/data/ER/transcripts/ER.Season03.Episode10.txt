
not_available Previously on ER Charlie, right? 
not_available Yes, you gave me condoms.
not_available We have an HIV
not_available positive worker.
not_available Say no more.
not_available If I get more experience, I'll be better prepared for the future.
not_available That's not how you should be looking at it.
not_available The best thing you can do for me is to leave me alone.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I gotta work late.
not_available Well, there's late and there's later.
not_available Hating me may feel good, but it won't change anything.
not_available It doesn't feel good, Al.
not_available Nothing about this feels good.
not_available "Homeless For The Holidays" I was starting to think you weren't coming.
not_available Dr.
not_available Angelo's office was packed up.
not_available What did she say? 
not_available The tests don't detect a viral load.
not_available I guess the drug cocktail is working.
not_available That's great news.
not_available Maybe I don't have to get a lawyer now.
not_available The hospital might let it go.
not_available I know.
not_available It's still transmittable.
not_available It's not a reason to make you shuffle paper for the rest of your career.
not_available If I still have a career.
not_available I have a meeting with Dr.
not_available Greene and Dr.
not_available Anspaugh in 10 minutes.
not_available And I think you're too valuable to rubber
not_available stamp admits all day long.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is on me.
not_available No matter what happens in there, this is great news.
not_available Sled to work, Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Christmas present for my daughter.
not_available That's it? You remember sliding in those snow
not_available covered bluffs with the cold wind blowing through your hair.
not_available We didn't have too many snow
not_available covered bluffs in Atlanta.
not_available We did.
not_available I coasted right through rush
not_available hour traffic, got hit by a car.
not_available Didn't they have one of those dolls that wet itself? Every toy in the store had a tie
not_available in to a movie I was too busy to see.
not_available I don't know what Duke Nukem was, but he looked pretty nasty.
not_available You made a good choice with the sled.
not_available You look awful.
not_available When did you start? 
not_available Yesterday morning.
not_available Mark, you ready? 
not_available Good morning.
not_available I just gotta change.
not_available For you, Dennis.
not_available Somebody's trying to touch me? It's a lady.
not_available Hey, Monique.
not_available You're at the airport? Was it canceled? Come on, I thought we've been through this already.
not_available You want the two of us to decide? None of us here would want any of our team endangering patients.
not_available As Attendings, you're closest to the everyday workings of the ER.
not_available So there is no hospital
not_available wide policy.
not_available Legal advises we handle it department by department.
not_available So if we get sued, it's the individual attending's butt that's on the line? If the public learned that we had an HIVpositive health
not_available care worker and started filing suits, all of our butts would be on the line.
not_available So these workers can be fired because the hospital doesn't want to be sued.
not_available In Illinois you can't fire employees because they're HIV
not_available positive.
not_available But people have been forced to quit.
not_available Nobody is forcing anybody to quit.
not_available What about restricting duties so they no longer fit the job description? I wouldn't presume to tell you two how to run your department, but to give you an idea about the current thinking, these are the CDC findings IIlinois state law and pending legal cases and various NIH and journal reports.
not_available I know you two have had your differences in the past.
not_available Do you think you can work together and solve this? Absolutely.
not_available Sure.
not_available Can you put on the card "Merry Christmas, Mom.
not_available Love, Doug"? And can you make that a rush order? Dennis, what is up with that shower? I froze my ass off this morning.
not_available Did you hear the opera? 
not_available L/ Figaro? Mrs.
not_available Needlebaum.
not_available 45 minutes of sing
not_available along with Pavarotti and she uses up all the hot water.
not_available Did you get any sleep last night? 
not_available No, I had 15 admits.
not_available Fifteen? Wow! Only 10 more hours and then Yuletide cheer with the Carter family.
not_available I feel bad subjecting you and your girlfriend to my family.
not_available It's not going to happen.
not_available Monique isn't coming.
not_available Not at all? 
not_available She said she had work.
not_available Oh, damn.
not_available I thought you guys were going to work it out too.
not_available It's her loss.
not_available I'll be a little late with all these new patients.
not_available No worry.
not_available Things don't get interesting until Uncle Branch starts drinking.
not_available You got your picks for the Bowl pool? 
not_available Here.
not_available How much is it? Five bucks? 
not_available Twenty.
not_available Twenty, that's highway robbery.
not_available How much is in the pot? 
not_available 400.
not_available I'm with you for Rose and Fiesta, but Cotton and Liberty are a waste.
not_available Why is everyone standing around when I'm drowning with patients? 
not_available I'm on hold with the florist.
not_available Not anymore you're not.
not_available And merry Christmas Eve to you.
not_available Please don't talk to me about it.
not_available At 5:00 this morning my mother decided she had to start the varenyky.
not_available Aren't those little dumplings? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She also picked the pre
not_available dawn hour to harass me about the party.
not_available So you're wearing that sexy Ukrainian shepherdess outfit? It was either that or endure hours of nagging.
not_available Okay, snowmobile foot lac in the Suture Room.
not_available Toddler eating mistletoe in 1.
not_available Slipand
not_available fall in 3.
not_available Watch out for Carol.
not_available It's Christmas in the Ukraine.
not_available Is her mom making little dumplings? 
not_available Don't ask.
not_available I heard Anspaugh is having some kind of secret meeting.
not_available Anything we should know about? We have to hammer out a policy on HIVpositive health
not_available care workers.
not_available Anybody we know? Really? He is trying to kill me.
not_available He ain't getting this goose, I stuffed it trussed it, called my 83year
not_available old grandma to get her marinade recipe.
not_available Oh, yeah, this gentleman 
not_available Female illusionist.
not_available got into an argument with his boyfriend.
not_available It got heated, and he 
not_available she started getting chest pain.
not_available It was like an elephant sitting on my chest with attitude.
not_available She was diaphoretic.
not_available I never said that! 
not_available That means sweaty.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It nearly ruined my gown.
not_available Pressure's 130 over 95, resp is 25, slightly tachy at 120.
not_available Tacky? This is a Bob Mackie original.
not_available Get ready.
not_available One, two, three I need a chest x
not_available ray, cardiac enzymes and an EKG.
not_available Okay, Miss? 
not_available Understood.
not_available Of "Miss Understood and the Mighty Morphin Gender Changers." We are at Club Cabaret every Friday and Saturday.
not_available Give me the goose now so we can attach an EKG to your chest.
not_available You want me to give you my Christmas dinner? No! 
not_available Give me the damn bird.
not_available Where are you going to put it? With the rest of your personal belongings.
not_available It'd better be.
not_available I don't want to wake up and see you picking your teeth.
not_available Are you on any medication? 
not_available Not besides the hormones.
not_available Have you had chest pain before? 
not_available When I get emotional or on that time of the month.
not_available It's someone in this department.
not_available Who? I don't know.
not_available It's just the word on the street.
not_available Tech on third floor heard it from a night guy, and now a secret meeting.
not_available See, that's how rumors get started.
not_available A rumor? Am I missing a good one? Attendings got pulled into a meeting, but they won't say what it's about.
not_available About someone with HIV, but you didn't hear it from me.
not_available Randi, do something with these personal effects.
not_available They're perishable.
not_available Jeanie, head lac in Exam 2.
not_available Conni, if you're not too busy Some folks are getting too fond of the "manager" part of nurse manager.
not_available No kidding.
not_available Carol? Sorry, but Mark assigned me to Triage today.
not_available Come on, guys! Why do I have to push all the time? I'm not your mother.
not_available Excuse me, I need a doctor.
not_available Fill these out in the waiting room.
not_available No, I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available For a medical problem? You still need to fill out this form.
not_available The waiting room is that way.
not_available Does it hurt here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We're going to need a facial and a mandibular series, 75 mg of Demerol and Phenergan, I.M.
not_available Try and rustle up an oral surgeon too.
not_available Good luck with that.
not_available And get me a gram of Ancef, I.M.
not_available You got it.
not_available Are you allergic to any meds? Okay, I think that your jaw is broken.
not_available The antibiotics will keep bacteria from getting into your bloodstream.
not_available But looking at your chart here, I guess you know the drill, huh? Humerus fracture, 1993.
not_available Nasal fracture, 1993.
not_available Multiple visits for suture, 1994.
not_available And your first broken jaw, December '95.
not_available I guess hubby thought he'd go out with a bang this year too.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Your face got in the way of his fist.
not_available What if we change the disclosure to include that people might be treated by an HIVpositive worker? And start a witch hunt? 
not_available We have to inform patients by law.
not_available I take it you haven't read this.
not_available Americans with Disabilities Act.
not_available What is it? Proposals, addenda? 
not_available Here.
not_available It says that you can't disclose one risk without disclosing equal risks.
not_available Meaning? 
not_available The patient doesn't have a choice whether they're treated by someone with a flu or with a hangover a doc who had a fight.
not_available An intern who's been on for two days someone with HIV.
not_available Illinois law says we can't prevent people from knowing they've been put at risk.
not_available We have to tell them.
not_available You'd rather follow the Illinois law than the federal statute? Because I'm concerned doesn't mean I'm some kind of bigot.
not_available Your concern can't be extended to prevent Jeanie from earning a living.
not_available Nobody is talking about firing her.
not_available But we do have a responsibility to our patients.
not_available What about our responsibility towards her? She uses universal precautions.
not_available Are you frightened? Is that it? 
not_available I'm trying to avoid lawsuits.
not_available You think I want to get sued? But exposing her private tragedy ensures lawsuits and mass hysteria.
not_available We break the law? 
not_available Lf we have to, yes.
not_available I care about Jeanie but there's a larger issue than your personal loyalty to a friend.
not_available Sorry to interrupt, but we're swamped.
not_available Whenever your done.
not_available We're done now.
not_available Mark, we haven't even made a dent.
not_available Would you rather jeopardize patient care by ignoring a jam in Triage? Who's next? Santa Claus? No, that's who's next.
not_available Three hookers.
not_available One with downstairs discharge, and two with frostbite.
not_available I turn around, next thing I know, the ribbon's hanging from his mouth.
not_available All I could get was the leaves.
not_available How many berries were on the stalk? Maybe four.
not_available And he wasn't vomiting? 
not_available No.
not_available This mistletoe is good stuff, but we gotta get it out.
not_available He asked for juice.
not_available I didn't want to give him any till you approved.
not_available Lily, make a bottle half juice, half activated charcoal.
not_available Coming right up.
not_available We're going to give him a bottle to absorb some of the toxins.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available There you are.
not_available I've been looking for you at the shelter.
not_available Come here.
not_available How is he? 
not_available There was blood in his diaper.
not_available In the stool or the urine? 
not_available I'm pretty sure it was in the pee.
not_available I gotta get him home before his mom gets back.
not_available If not, she'll kick me out.
not_available You need to get his mother here now.
not_available Can't you just hook him up with pills or something? No, I can't just hook him up with some pills.
not_available Get his mother here.
not_available What happened to him? 
not_available The guy's name is John Collins.
not_available He was drunk and sleeping in the park.
not_available Some kids thought it would be fun to pour lighter fluid on him and play yule log.
not_available He wouldn't let us put oxygen on him.
not_available He kept screaming about Nick.
not_available He's got extensive third
not_available degree burns to the chest.
not_available It's the guy's dog.
not_available Barked at a mounted cop until he checked it out.
not_available Randi, can you take care of this dog? You take care of my Nick now.
not_available You take care of my Nicky.
not_available Take it easy, Mr.
not_available Collins.
not_available He'll be in a kennel.
not_available No! No kennel, he's all I've got.
not_available Extremities are toast.
not_available No IV, no BP.
not_available He needs massive fluids.
not_available You gotta promise me, doc.
not_available Promise me now.
not_available We'll look after it, just be quiet.
not_available On my count, everyone.
not_available I'm going to need a cutdown tray.
not_available Get me blood gas with CO level, CBC, Chem
not_available 20, a portable chest for openers.
not_available Is he okay? He's got a mass in his abdomen.
not_available Once I get inside I'll know how bad it is.
not_available Is it bad? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The ultrasound is ready.
not_available Did you get hold of the mother? 
not_available She isn't home.
not_available Any adult relatives? There aren't any.
not_available I take care of him when Gloria's not around.
not_available Hang on.
not_available There it is.
not_available He's hemorrhaging into his kidney.
not_available Get lytes, a CBC, a CT of the abdomen.
not_available Haleh, page the O.R.
not_available Too.
not_available What does it say? Ahmed's got something called a Wilms' tumor.
not_available You see that area there? That fluid? 
not_available The light gray? Yes, that's blood.
not_available The tumor's invading his kidney.
not_available That's why you see all that blood in his diaper.
not_available I should've brought him here before.
not_available I gotta get him to the O.R.
not_available I knew he was sick.
not_available Is he gonna die? You did a good thing, Charlie.
not_available Now dissect the right colon off the anterior surface of the tumor.
not_available Shall I retract the tumor laterally? 
not_available Yes, very gently.
not_available That's it.
not_available You say that the babysitter brought the child in? Yes, the mother was nowhere to be found.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross knows the girl.
not_available Now retract the tumor laterally.
not_available Tie off the renal vein and artery and ureter and transect it.
not_available Slowly, now.
not_available Avoid the left renal vessels.
not_available Now free up the kidney, and we'll take it out.
not_available All the pretty, twinkly lights.
not_available That's why you danced with the elves.
not_available I'd like some sherry now.
not_available What's your name, ma'am? 
not_available I'm Blitzen.
not_available The most overlooked of all reindeer.
not_available Blitzen.
not_available It's your lucky day, Beth.
not_available You only have a fractured cheekbone.
not_available It means you can go home.
not_available Unless you don't want to.
not_available There is a shelter called Hope House for women and kids in trouble.
not_available I don't have kids.
not_available It's okay, you can go there alone.
not_available They have security.
not_available He'll find me.
not_available They have reciprocal agreements with shelters all over the country.
not_available You could go anywhere you want.
not_available Sweetheart, are you okay? I knew I should have fixed that top step, but I've been so busy.
not_available Do you forgive me? Can you forgive me, honey? I love you.
not_available That's my girl.
not_available Is she going to be all right? 
not_available We're actually not done, Mr.
not_available Lang.
not_available We still need to do a head CT, facial tomograms, put her on IV antibiotics.
not_available Is that going to take long? 
not_available We do our best with the holidays.
not_available Family isn't allowed in the exam area.
not_available Malik, show him the chairs.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll be right outside, honey.
not_available So you want to hear some more about those shelters? No good? 
not_available I've tried cookies, fruitcake.
not_available Nobody likes fruitcake.
not_available I thought dogs ate everything.
not_available Why not take him to the morgue and let him beg for table scraps? That's Mr.
not_available Collins.
not_available Maybe he knows what you like to eat.
not_available I think he likes you.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available While moving him to the burn unit he had shortness of breath.
not_available BP's 80 palp, tachycardic at 140.
not_available All right, get me a 40
not_available mg IV bolus of Lasix.
not_available We need to intubate, 7.5.
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Rate's 40, no pulse.
not_available Damn it! Get me a mg of atropine.
not_available Start CPR.
not_available Asystole.
not_available All right, let's give him an amp of epi.
not_available Come on Mr.
not_available Collins.
not_available Come on.
not_available I don't care if Psych is backed up.
not_available She thinks she's a reindeer.
not_available Well, dangerous? You know, she bruised an elf.
not_available Excuse me, miss.
not_available Who parked in the ambulance bay? The car's mine, actually my employer's.
not_available I'm looking for a missing person.
not_available Take a number, sir.
not_available The line starts in the waiting room.
not_available It's a woma"n with a hand puppet.
not_available Did you say puppet? 
not_available You found him something to munch on.
not_available He found it himself.
not_available Are dogs meant to eat chicken bones? 
not_available Is that chicken? Charlie, Ahmed is out of surgery.
not_available He's going to be okay.
not_available I can take him home now? 
not_available No, he'll need time to recover.
not_available Gloria is going to be pissed.
not_available I'm going to have to call DCFS.
not_available You're going to narc her out? 
not_available I'm not narcing on anybody.
not_available The boy's been sick.
not_available The mother should have seen that weeks ago.
not_available Gloria didn't know.
not_available She just found out.
not_available She sounds really worried.
not_available Come on, she'll throw me out.
not_available So you live with her.
not_available So you lied to me about the shelter.
not_available Come on, please.
not_available All right, I'll give her a chance.
not_available But I'm not promising you anything.
not_available Eating hospital food? That desperate? Come on, let's get some lunch.
not_available You scared me.
not_available The surgery went really well.
not_available Yeah, it did.
not_available My 3:00 hernia was canceled.
not_available So I am free tonight.
not_available So I figured, if you hadn't made any plans I could make my traditional phone call to Pizza Ring.
not_available I got a family thing.
not_available I already asked a friend of mine to go with me.
not_available I understand.
not_available It was last minute anyway.
not_available Christmas Eve.
not_available I'll rent a movie, it's what I do.
not_available Let me talk to my buddy.
not_available He was tired earlier.
not_available He may prefer to go home.
not_available So Let's do something later.
not_available Pizza sounds great.
not_available Gingerbread.
not_available It always reminds me of Christmas at home.
not_available You ever do that? In a civilized society, people acknowledge each other's speech.
not_available You want to talk about Christmas at my home? Home is where my mom got bombed out of her mind and brought a drunk home.
not_available Then she'd pass out, giving him the idea he'd rather sleep with me.
not_available All right, we know why you left.
not_available How far did you run? 
not_available From Cleveland.
not_available Did you call her lately? She probably moved on by now.
not_available She never stays anywhere for very long.
not_available Both of these, plus the three Danish, the two packets of cocoa and the two dinner rolls in her pocket.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available I have now changed every drain and lanced every boil in this hospital.
not_available that Jell
not_available O thing your cook makes.
not_available Aspic.
not_available That's what I want to talk to you about.
not_available Say no more.
not_available I have an aunt who makes chitterlings.
not_available You don't even want to know what that's all about.
not_available Okay.
not_available There is a chance that I may not be able to make the party.
not_available Are you working? 
not_available No.
not_available There's this girl.
not_available That's cool, I understand.
not_available You're sure? Who wants to hang with his homies when he can be with a honey? You gonna be? 
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available It's a chance to go home and sleep.
not_available Don't hang over me.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Let's do something tomorrow night.
not_available Go out, get a couple of beers.
not_available I'm on tomorrow night.
not_available I know what universal precautions are.
not_available Does it refer to double gloves here? 
not_available You're exaggerating with guidelines.
not_available And participating in bloody trauma? 
not_available Nothing wrong with that.
not_available Bloody trauma.
not_available Maybe that's the deal with Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available I don't think Susan's HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Susan is fine.
not_available That's what I said.
not_available Lydia's been sick a lot lately.
not_available Shut your mouth.
not_available I expect more from you than gossiping about a coworker's HIV status.
not_available Kerry and I have been hammering out a policy.
not_available There's no secret there.
not_available This shouldn't be a grist for the rumor mill.
not_available Why should we have HIV
not_available positive employees in ER at all? According to the current law, Employee X cannot be fired because of their HIV status.
not_available But they can deal with bloody trauma? Why not, if they're gloved? Was it from a needle stick? What difference does it make? Should Employee X be restricted to noninvasive procedures? Or continue with their duties? Won't universal precautions be safe? That's what we're told when we're working on HIV
not_available positive patients.
not_available The real question here is whether our patients have the right to know.
not_available This has no reflection upon my opinion of Employee X's work.
not_available Is there an actual Employee X? 
not_available It's a policy.
not_available It could be any of us.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Would everyone stop calling me Employee X? I am HIV
not_available positive.
not_available We talked about this.
not_available The risks of her bleeding into an open wound while suturing are remote.
not_available I'm not saying she can't work, but I'm trying to set the boundaries.
not_available You set the boundaries at Triage and answering phones.
not_available That's not her job.
not_available I have no troubles if she performs her duties within limits.
not_available Dispensing medication, that's fine.
not_available But some things aren't.
not_available For 
example It says here, "Deep
not_available penetrating, poorly visualized cavities." That's from the CDC.
not_available I think that should be off
not_available limits.
not_available I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.
not_available Okay.
not_available See, progress.
not_available You know, Mark.
not_available Since I found out, I have been a lot more careful.
not_available You think I would harm a patient? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available But the administration has left it up to Kerry and I to create a policy that the government can't seem to agree on.
not_available I've agonized over this.
not_available I've considered quitting, but my life can still have value.
not_available I can still help people.
not_available What else are you worried about? Dementia.
not_available You're fine now, but what if you decline? Dementia may be the first sign of full
not_available blown AIDS.
not_available I've heard that there's some hospitals that instituted a physician monitor.
not_available Someone to help keep tabs on the person's health.
not_available I could do that.
not_available Okay.
not_available So that's one thing.
not_available What else? So was it a needle stick? 
not_available I guess so.
not_available You don't think she? 
not_available Hi, Jeanie.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Hey.
not_available I wish I'd known.
not_available Would it have made us friends? 
not_available Now, that's not fair.
not_available Nothing is.
not_available Well? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Lang.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is Beth okay? I've been sitting here for hours.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Your wife's fall is worse than we initially thought.
not_available She might have to stay overnight for observation.
not_available Anyway, the coroner is going to have my butt if we don't get him this guy.
not_available So why don't you just wait? Hey, buddy! This patient is going to the bus station.
not_available A stiff? 
not_available Miraculous recovery.
not_available Here you go.
not_available For your bus ticket and some burgers.
not_available I can't take this from you.
not_available Go on, you got a 3:15 to Abilene to catch.
not_available I don't even know where that is.
not_available Hopefully, neither does he.
not_available Bye.
not_available You won the pool.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available That was the football pool money? 
not_available Yeah, I thought she was a better bet.
not_available Alternators, amusement, ammunition 
not_available There's no animal shelters.
not_available Check humane societies.
not_available You can't give him away.
not_available You promised Mr.
not_available Collins.
not_available That's before I paid 50 bucks to a drag queen for a free
not_available range goose.
not_available You know what happens when they can't find homes for dogs? What am I gonna do with a dog? 
not_available Dogs are great.
not_available They're good company.
not_available They watch your stuff when you're gone.
not_available Your daughter will love him.
not_available Do you think? 
not_available Yeah, my dad got me a dog.
not_available Skippy, when I was 6.
not_available Best present I ever got.
not_available The two of us were like peanut butter and jelly.
not_available I can take you all in for kidnapping.
not_available He was sick.
not_available Don't tell me how to raise my son! 
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Can I help you?

not_available The dog saved his life.
not_available I told him that I'd watch out for him, and the next thing I know the guy up and dies on me.
not_available So you're the proud owner of Well, given the season, you should call him Saint Nick.
not_available Well, Rachel can call him whatever she wants.
not_available Rachel? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I thought I'd give her a puppy for Christmas.
not_available In case you hadn't noticed, that dog is, like, 8 years old.
not_available He's ready for a midlife crisis.
not_available He's ready for a fur replacement.
not_available With a wash, a bow around his neck, he won't look a day over 5.

not_available That's actually why I'm here.
not_available I'd like to do another Pediatric Surgery rotation.
not_available I won't be here next rotation.

not_available I was hoping for your recommendation for me with your replacement.
not_available You're a very good surgeon, Peter, but that's not enough for Pedes.
not_available You've got to live and breathe for children.
not_available You took this rotation to challenge yourself.
not_available I applaud that, but I can't give up a space that could be filled by a future pediatric surgeon.
not_available I'd be happy to talk to Dr.
not_available Anspaugh or Morgenstern.
not_available I hear that Don's doing some really interesting stuff in thoracics.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Thank you.

not_available I found my socket set, too.
