not_available How far along are you? Almost 15 weeks.
not_available Good.

not_available You thought about what I said? 
not_available What was that? About not wasting your life on this trauma fellowship.
not_available And miss out on cases like this? 
not_available You're avoiding the question.
not_available I don't have a lot of options.
not_available I'd consider you for cardiothoracic.
not_available I could sneak in a late application.
not_available I thought it belonged to Peter.
not_available Well, he didn't hesitate to throw his hat into your rice bowl, did he? This fragment's really embedded.
not_available Careful.
not_available Not a large margin of error here.
not_available You shouldn't be out of bed.
not_available He's gonna die, isn't he? It's too early to tell.
not_available I need you to sit down.
not_available I need to take a look at those dressings.
not_available So your x
not_available ray shows that you have a fractured rib, okay? It'll hurt for a few weeks but it'll heal on its own.
not_available It's a brave thing you did, going back in there for your friend.
not_available It won't matter.
not_available We're doing everything we can.
not_available They took my blood.
not_available They think it was because I was drunk.
not_available Your blood
not_available alcohol level was.09.
not_available I didn't mean for this to happen.
not_available Let me know if you're in pain.
not_available Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Justin! You all right? Will he be all right? 
not_available I'm okay, Mom.

not_available I went to change the CD.
not_available I totaled the car.
not_available Pulse ox is dropping.
not_available It's 93 on 15 liters of oxygen.
not_available Any burns to the airway? 
not_available Some singed nasal hair.

not_available And the Burn Unit? 
not_available They called a registry nurse.
not_available She'll be here in an hour.
not_available Tube him while you have an airway.
not_available I was waiting for the parents.
not_available They're on the road.
not_available The sister? 
not_available Still in surgery.
not_available Call the neighbors, see if they have a car phone.
not_available It's up to you, but don't crike him.
not_available Understood.
not_available What if we don't reach them? I tube him and he dies in the Burn Unit within the next week.
not_available They can say goodbye.
not_available I want to give him a chance to see them.
not_available How is she? Good.
not_available The pole nicked her liver.
not_available We repaired the defect with very little blood loss.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Family Services said they'll watch Bruce until someone can pick him up.
not_available How's he doing? He's asleep.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm sorry about what happened downstairs.
not_available You don't need to explain.
not_available I understand.
not_available It wasn't the HIV status.
not_available I was afraid of the CMV.
not_available Really, you don't need to explain.
not_available Is that yours? Yeah.
not_available Time for your medication? Do you have it here? They're at home.
not_available Well, I can get it for you here.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Missing a dose could make it harder to treat the HIV.
not_available I'm done with them.
not_available I'm sorry? I'm not going to take any more medicine.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available I can't function.
not_available Andrea, I know you're upset right now.
not_available But without your medication, the chances I know what it means.
not_available Bruce is 8.
not_available He needs a mother.
not_available It is more important that he have a well mother for now than a sick one for longer.
not_available Good work, Lizzie.
not_available What do you think? I give her a 50
not_available 50.
not_available Robert, you got a minute? Sure.
not_available You got her, Lizzie? Yeah.
not_available Look, I want to do this now.
not_available Where are you on the trauma fellowship? I don't see the need, but if I'm the minority, I vote for Georgetown guy.
not_available IKerry? 
not_available Benton's the strongest candidate.
not_available Mark? 
not_available Elizabeth brought us the idea.
not_available She has passion and certainly talent.
not_available I don't want to see either one wasted on this.
not_available They both applied, didn't they? Well, it looks like you're all of separate minds.
not_available It's late, I want to go home, so I'll make this quick.
not_available Peter Benton it is.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Pulse ox 92.
not_available Could you get Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Travis, are you awake? The doctor needs to put a tube down your throat to help you breathe now.
not_available Can you talk? I have your parents on the phone.
not_available They're in a car on their way here.
not_available I thought you'd want to talk to them.
not_available How long? They'll be here in 45 minutes but we can't wait.
not_available I mean, how long will the tube be in? At least a few days.
not_available Are you ready? Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mitchell? Okay, you can talk to him now.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available There you go.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available I know.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available Did the doctor tell you? It's pretty bad.
not_available I don't think I'm gonna I don't think I'm gonna make it to the lake this summer.
not_available I don't know.
not_available They took her into surgery.
not_available But I haven't heard anything yet.
not_available Hey, they have to put this tube in me.
not_available So, I'm not gonna be able to talk for a couple of days.
not_available Okay, I'll see you when you get here.
not_available Hey Mom.
not_available You gotta hang in there.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I mean, just a little I love you too.
not_available Pulse ox is 89.
not_available Draw up four of Versed, then insert with the angular tip.
not_available Number eight ET tube.
not_available Okay, Travis you're gonna feel a little sleepy.
not_available When you wake up, there will be a ventilator helping you breathe.
not_available Hey.
not_available That's not a very encouraging entrance.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You didn't get the trauma fellowship.
not_available Is it Peter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's that, then.
not_available I was looking forward to working with you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Same here.
not_available So now what? I guess I'm left to pick up scraps wherever I can find them.
not_available Doesn't mean he was a better candidate.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available How much more time do you have on your internship? Three weeks.
not_available You'll have your license.
not_available You can do anything you want.
not_available Except the trauma fellowship.
not_available Just about anything.
not_available How did the voting go? 
not_available I think you know.
not_available Yeah, Romano didn't want either, Anspaugh was keen on Benton.
not_available Don't tell me you were.
not_available No, I wanted you.
not_available But I'm not really objective.
not_available Really? You know what you need? 
not_available What? A milkshake.
not_available What time do you get off? 
not_available Midnight.
not_available Okay, I'll find you.
not_available Is this more of your bad
not_available day therapy? It's free of charge.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What about the place up the street? 
not_available Don't go there.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Who is that? Who? 
not_available Talking to Chuny.
not_available I don't know.
not_available She works in Urology.
not_available Really? Carter, are you on for a while? 
not_available Six hours.
not_available A social worker's coming from the HIV clinic to see a patient in the surgical ward.
not_available Sure.
not_available Randi, did you get that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available HIV clinic to Carter.
not_available ER? Yeah, she's right here.
not_available Carol? Doug.
not_available I'll get it in the lounge.
not_available Hey, Chuny.
not_available What? Is that the friend you talked about? 
not_available You're too late now.
not_available There was a time limit? 
not_available You're so shallow.
not_available I'm reconsidering your proposal.
not_available You snooze, you lose.
not_available "You snooze, you lose." Is this 10th grade? 
not_available I set her up with an intern.
not_available Intern! I tell you what.
not_available If you're nice, I'll try to get her to reconsider.
not_available Adi Ãs.
not_available Lucy, your prescription's ready.
not_available You sick? 
not_available No.
not_available What is it then? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Why are you on medication? Why are you nosy? Who prescribed it? 
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available This morning I saw you, you were exhausted.
not_available You popped a pill and you were fine.
not_available Now you're dragging.
not_available I'm not on speed, if you're asking.
not_available So, what is it? 
not_available Ritalin, okay? I'm on Ritalin.
not_available Ritalin? Since when? 
not_available Fifth grade.
not_available What? I tried to get off it, but my grades dropped, so I kept on.
not_available You've been on it since? 
not_available Never been a good time to stop.
not_available Now would be a good time to stop.
not_available I'm not an addict.
not_available You shouldn't still be taking it.
not_available It's a stimulant.
not_available I don't take it to get high.
not_available I take it to function.
not_available You got A.D.D.? It wasn't a problem until I was working so many nights.
not_available Ritalin is for hyperactive children.
not_available You're 24.
not_available My doctor prescribes it, so nothing's wrong.
not_available You gonna take it forever? 
not_available I'll stop when things are less hectic.
not_available Things are never less hectic.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available But this really is my business.
not_available And I hope you'll respect that.
not_available The signer's head leans to the right and rests on the upturned palm Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I suppose congratulations are in order.
not_available Look, Elizabeth.
not_available You don't have to say that.
not_available I'm just trying to be gracious.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Peter.
not_available Elizabeth, would you excuse us, please? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I always considered you a man of your word.
not_available I never said I'd take it.
not_available You wanted cardiothoracic.
not_available I said I was interested.
not_available Missed your calling.
not_available You should've been a lawyer.
not_available I couldn't count on it.
not_available I told you I'd push for you.
not_available I have.
not_available Thank you, but I'm taking the trauma fellowship.
not_available Fine.
not_available Whatever, Peter.
not_available I'm done looking out for you.
not_available Throwing your life away is up to you.
not_available It is.
not_available Just don't come to me when you realize you made a mistake.
not_available Were you serious? 
not_available What? The offer you made today.
not_available Were you serious? Dr.
not_available Greene? Someone left this off for you.
not_available What is it? Do I read your mail? "Thanks for patching up Amber." Who's Amber? 
not_available She's a stripper.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Must've liked you a lot.
not_available How much is there? 
not_available Looks like about two grand.
not_available Party! Randi, get out the phone book and look up "FBI." Have them come pick this up.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm Greg Mitchell.
not_available Our son and daughter were in an accident.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I saw both of them here in the Emergency Department.
not_available Where are they? Shannon underwent surgery.
not_available There was a broken vertebra in her back that was impinging on her spinal cord.
not_available But she'll be okay? It's possible she'll lose function below her waist.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Travis suffered third
not_available degree burns over the majority of his body.
not_available Third
not_available degree? He's up in the Burn Unit.
not_available They're doing everything to make him as comfortable as possible.
not_available But I have to tell you that with burns of this magnitude the survival rate is very low.
not_available He's gonna die? He has a 20 percent chance of survival.
not_available Oh, God! No! You're up.
not_available Where am I? The O.R.
not_available Recovery Room.
not_available We operated on your back.
not_available You were in a car accident.
not_available Do you remember? I thought it was a dream.
not_available Can I do a quick test? Tell me when you feel something, all right? Shannon, are you with me? Yeah.
not_available There! What does that mean? It's no better.
not_available It's no worse.
not_available Let's see how your big toe's doing, shall we? I want you to wiggle it like before.
not_available All right? Again.
not_available Is it moving? Let's just wait and see.
not_available The swelling has to come down first.
not_available Lily, I took Mr.
not_available And Mrs.
not_available Mitchell to the Burn Unit.
not_available Show one of them to Surgical Recovery.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mark, I wouldn't go in there.
not_available Why? We're giving Carol some space.
not_available Doug called.
not_available Carol? 
not_available Go away, Mark.
not_available Did you tell him? He's not coming.
not_available Did you ask him not to come? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was very strong and clear.
not_available So he's respecting your wishes? That would be a first time, wouldn't it? You wanted him to come.
not_available No.
not_available I've had hundreds of conversations with him in my head, you know? What I would say, what I would do if he showed up.
not_available I wouldn't let him charm his way back in.
not_available Not now.
not_available Not because of the baby.
not_available I would never feel secure knowing that that's why he came back.
not_available Maybe he feels the same way.
not_available I still expected him to come.
not_available I've gotta go home.
not_available You know what you need? What? What? You need a milkshake.
not_available Elizabeth and I are going to get a milkshake.
not_available Why don't you come? No.
not_available I'm tired and I'm gonna go home.
not_available No, no.
not_available Just one little milkshake, okay? It was a date, wasn't it? Look, no.
not_available It wasn't a date.
not_available We were just gonna drown our sorrows in ice cream.
not_available Come on.
not_available I don't want to be a third wheel.
not_available How many times have I been a third wheel? That's true.
not_available You do owe me.
not_available That's the spirit.
not_available Are you paying? 
not_available Of course I'm paying.
not_available Because I'm eating for two.
