not_available Centered, right above the backs of the chairs and at museum level.
not_available Oh, museum level.
not_available Always hated the impressionists.
not_available Look, it's a lateral move, Robert.
not_available All that sugarcoating of the truth.
not_available Believe me, it wasn't my idea.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh thought it might be a good interim step.
not_available That's strange, because this power play smacks of a certain estrogenbased 
not_available malice I've grown all too familiar with.
not_available You know I wish you'd try to appreciate the fact that we're trying to do you a favor here.
not_available What you're doing is bending me over and driving it up the chocolate highway.
not_available Let's be honest.
not_available You're a one
not_available handed surgeon, Robert.
not_available Not to mention a Human Resources nightmare and a lousy administrator who's burned more bridges than you've ever built.

not_available What happened? 
not_available Corday's nanny ran over his foot.

not_available Residents time study.
not_available QA of our portable
not_available ultrasound training.
not_available I'd be really grateful if you'd see them through.
not_available Sure.
not_available Excellent.
not_available So how long is Romano gonna be down here? You think it's not permanent? 
not_available Because whoever runs the department needs communication and clinical skills.
not_available He is He's an experienced physician.
not_available His background is entirely surgical.
not_available John you have to be associate professor before being department head.
not_available I don't want his job, Kerry, I just don't wanna have to do two of them.
not_available All right.
not_available Which one of you smartasses stole my crutch? You have any plans for tonight? Oh, me and this guy named TiVo, we're gonna curl up in front of the TV.
not_available You? Everything okay? Woman I went to med school with has a patient who's very sick.
not_available Young boy.
not_available Is he terminal? Post
not_available shunt tetrology with pulmonary atresia.
not_available He's outgrowing the shunts.
not_available He needs unifoc and complete repair.
not_available That's a pretty specialized procedure.
not_available Yup.
not_available So special it can't be done there.
not_available Nicky Broomer, fell while running.
not_available Shoulder dislocation and rib fractures.
not_available Vitals normal except for pulse of 120.
not_available This guy's a runner? 
not_available He's a junkie.
not_available He gets chased by the cops regularly.
not_available He fell on the sidewalk.
not_available It was wet.
not_available Are you high now, Nicky? 
not_available No.
not_available And he's staying that way.
not_available Mint condition, the entire lot.
not_available The sky's the limit, as far as markup.
not_available It's yours for only 30 bucks.
not_available Hey, I thought you said you couldn't walk, your foot hurt so bad.
not_available I hopped.
not_available I'm on the phone here.

not_available Hey, it's at 3:00.
not_available What? 
not_available Cake for Chen.
not_available Oh, right, right.
not_available What do you think? Flowers or candy? 
not_available It's gotta be something she can wear.
not_available Let's see who's losing the dispo race.
not_available Why, that would be Dr.
not_available Pratt, who will now be punished for his indolent ways.
not_available Lower
not_available back pain in 2 and an unknown intestinal disturbance in 4.
not_available Chop
not_available chop.
not_available In secondto
not_available last place we have Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available That's to be expected from one who ovulates.
not_available She gets the maggot infestation in 2.
not_available Of course, we have Mr.
not_available Gallant, who's doing Cadillac workups on Yugo patients.
not_available How are you, hon? Don't tell me.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available It says right here, " My blood pressure is high.
not_available " Well, hell, so is mine.
not_available But rather than go to a busy ER, I stay home and take my medication.
not_available Have you tried that? 
not_available She's diabetic.
not_available Her EKG is
not_available Is unnecessary.
not_available Give her a sublingual nifedipine and send her to clinic.
not_available Yeah, but that's not aYou filling a special
not_available needs quota here? Do you need me to say it slowly in your people's language? Sublingual nifedipine.
not_available When you're done with her, pick up six more.
not_available She's your patient, not mother.
not_available They letting anyone with a check into med school these days? 
not_available Gallant is one of our best students.
not_available Doesn't bode well for future medicine.
not_available Maybe when he gets his license, we'll be dead.
not_available Typically, as Chief Resident, I assign the med students their cases.
not_available When? Every other Tuesday? Any patient here over six hours is your failure, not mine.
not_available Treat, turf or dispo.
not_available You don't have a background in emergency medicine.
not_available It isn't that simple.
not_available Feast or famine.
not_available Hey, you're back.
not_available Another chopper beat us.
not_available Susan around? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Your screaming isn't making our job any easier.
not_available This is hard for him.
not_available Settle down, okay? 
not_available It hurts like a son of a bitch.
not_available It's going to continue to hurt unless we pull your arm out.
not_available Please help me.
not_available Radial pulse is strong.
not_available We should just give him more Versed or fent.
not_available Yes, yes! 
not_available We already did.
not_available Should be unconscious.
not_available Why is he still screaming? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available His ribs are broken.
not_available That, and he's going through withdrawal.
not_available I can't take it, baby.
not_available Hey, Susan.
not_available What? 
not_available I got a guy here says he's your husband.
not_available What's he look like? Tall, dark hair, flight nurse.
not_available Yeah, that's him.
not_available You were in Vegas for, like, two days.
not_available And three nights.
not_available We met on the plane on the way over, hung out all weekend.
not_available Were you sober at any point? Sunday night, we wanted burgers.
not_available So we took a cab to this drive
not_available through.
not_available Turns out to be a mini
not_available chapel.
not_available So you figured, "What the hell.
not_available Let's get married.
not_available " I know.
not_available It was impulsive.
not_available Impulsive? 
not_available Okay, it was really, really stupid.
not_available Susan.
not_available I'm getting it annulled, anyway.
not_available Haven't seen him since the wedding night.
not_available My flight left the next morning.
not_available He stayed a week.
not_available He could have married six other women.
not_available Do you remember his name, at least? Chuck Martin, I think.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Hey, stranger.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look, nifedipine is contraindicated.
not_available I'm not bottoming out her pressure and stroking her out.
not_available I know.
not_available He's the one that needs to be educated about this.
not_available And he wants to hear that from a med student.
not_available Obviously, he needs to prove
not_available Go talk to him.
not_available If there's a problem, I'll take care of it.
not_available Got a lot of people scared.
not_available Not you? 
not_available I still need to pay my rent.
not_available Romano's bark is worse than his bite.
not_available Easy for you to say.
not_available You can walk away if you want to.
not_available I can't stand it.
not_available So Susan got married? 
not_available Can't call her indecisive.
not_available Can call her crazy.
not_available When are you people gonna do something? 
not_available So I spoke to an attorney.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available He said annulling it should be fairly easy.
not_available That's what my guy said.
not_available I have to admit, I was a little worried.
not_available Why? Well, you know 
not_available it was consummated.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available A few times, as I remember.
not_available More than a few times.
not_available The cabana? 
not_available Right, right.
not_available Right.
not_available But since we never lived together, I figured it shouldn't be a problem.
not_available Did you tell anyone? Like who, my mom? She'd kick my ass 
not_available if I deprived her of a wedding.
not_available Same with mine.
not_available I figured it wasn't anyone's business.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And pretty tough to explain too.
not_available Please, who are you telling? 
not_available You kind of had to have been there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It made sense at the time.
not_available Guess you have to get back to work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So play hooky.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Morales, you don't write, you don't call
not_available No time to radio.
not_available Twentyfouryear
not_available old female passed out.
not_available No trauma, no seizure.
not_available What? You were shopping? 
not_available We were registering.
not_available She's pregnant.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available You were gonna say that.
not_available BP's 100/60.
not_available Sats are good.
not_available Do you remember falling, Debra? I remember feeling weak.
not_available I haven't been eating.
not_available Okay.
not_available Start a second line and put up another liter.
not_available Morning sickness? 
not_available Oh, bad.
not_available My first wife had three kids, she never even burped.
not_available Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
not_available What have we got? 
not_available Debra Strickland.
not_available Pregnant, syncope.
not_available Eighteen weeks.
not_available Hi, Debra.
not_available Any cramping or spotting? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's spin a crit, check her glucose and dip a urine to start.
not_available That hurts? And my belly.
not_available It never did before.
not_available How about when I do this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abby, can you see if Linda Woo is here? 
not_available I'll check.
not_available Finally get a surgical candidate? 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I need an operation? 
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available Stripe in Morrison's.
not_available Yup.
not_available Probably blood, judging from her hypotension.
not_available Probe over the kidney.
not_available It is.
not_available Doesn't look like it.
not_available It's not.
not_available Surgery's here.
not_available What do you have for me? An 18
not_available week IUP with hypotension, intraperitoneal fluid and renal mass.
not_available Obvious ex
not_available lap for tissue diagnosis and staging.
not_available Who are you? Dr.
not_available Robert Romano, head of surgery a week ago.
not_available Who the hell are you? This is Dr.
not_available Woo.
not_available She started yesterday.
not_available Do you have any medical problems or allergies? Are you deaf? 
not_available Let me page Corday.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available BP is dropping, 86/62.
not_available Any moron can see she needs surgical intervention for hemostasis.
not_available I'm sorry, what's your position here? Your practical and intellectual superior with 20 years of surgical experience versus the two years of ass
not_available wiping you call residency.
not_available Take her up.
not_available Done.
not_available He was diagnosed at birth.
not_available But access to any kind of care has been limited at best.
not_available He's been revised? 
not_available Twice.
not_available The last time, five years ago.
not_available And the surgical team that performed it in Croatia has disbanded since then.
not_available And there's nothing else in Europe? Nothing they can afford.
not_available County's pediatric thoracic group does unifocalization, free of charge.
not_available Yes.
not_available But he's not a citizen.
not_available Neither are we.
not_available But we are here.
not_available Even if you get a surgical team to donate services, who's gonna pick up the tab? With some PR, charitable contributions could cover it.
not_available But Kerry would still have to sign off on it.
not_available Are you on good terms with her? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Well, neither am I.
not_available Leave it with me.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Woo? 
not_available She left.
not_available You need to teach them to have thicker skin.
not_available She cried a little.
not_available Pratt's consoling her.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available Right.
not_available Intraperitoneal fluid and a mass.
not_available Pregnant with profound hypotension.
not_available My guess, renal
not_available cell CA.
not_available Necrotic mass obscuring and deforming the capsule of the kidney.
not_available Bleeding across the peritoneum, more likely metastases.
not_available She'll need surgery.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'd like a CT of the abdomen if I can.
not_available And have OB involved as well.
not_available She's stable now.
not_available Why don't we get a third consult.
not_available Maybe ask the janitor what he thinks.
not_available I'm down here less than a day, already I'm starting to hate surgeons.
not_available Is something wrong with the baby? No.
not_available The baby's quite healthy, actually.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, you have a minute? 
not_available Less than.
not_available It's about my highblood
not_available pressure patient.
not_available I should've pointed it out to you.
not_available Use of sublingual nifedipine is no longer indicated because of case fatalities.
not_available I never said nifedipine.
not_available I said metropolol.
not_available Works fine for hypertension.
not_available You said nifedipine.
not_available You said it more th
not_available Listen.
not_available I'm the doctor.
not_available You're not.
not_available Seems that if it is your intention to runMy intention is to serve my time without having affirmative
not_available action imbeciles like you make me regret ever having gone into medicine.
not_available Minute's up.
not_available Hey, where are my bullet points? 
not_available Right.
not_available Well, you can't fire medical students.
not_available But failing them is bad because they have to repeat the rotation.
not_available I'd suggest a marginal pass.
not_available What else? 
not_available You can, however, fire care partners.
not_available The hell's a care partner? It's like a non
not_available union orderly.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Jim.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You pay union dues, Jim? 
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available You're fired.
not_available I need something.
not_available That is putting me on edge.
not_available Was worse when his girlfriend was here.
not_available Tell Lewis to gag, sedate or kill him.
not_available She's on break.
not_available Is there a prerequisite for working here? You have to be a knownothing drag
not_available ass who doesn't wear a watch? I suspected Weaver would kill her mother to get out of here.
not_available Now I know why.
not_available Only the chief of emergency medicine is concerned with clearing the board.
not_available You gotta help me.
not_available Hands off, lowlife.
not_available All right, you.
not_available Where are your parents? I don't have any.
not_available They died in a car crash last year.
not_available Bummer.

not_available I need it bad.
not_available I need something real bad.
not_available Let me guess Could you move him to Exam 4? 
not_available My pleasure.
not_available Come on.
not_available Jerry.
not_available Wait.
not_available Just one more paragraph in the lab
not_available tech union manual.
not_available Make sure that I see all Romano's patients before anyone gets dispo'd? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Doesn't mean you don't work with him.
not_available Okay, where were we? I reached for the soap, down I went, landed right on my rump.
not_available Well, that's not good.
not_available Any loss of consciousness? No.
not_available Just loss of dignity.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available I'm late, I'm late.
not_available I had to move Nicky.
not_available He was driving everybody crazy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I sent up labs on your hyperemesis patient.
not_available Dispo'd your nolonger
not_available itchy rash guy.
not_available Was I gone that long? You take Sandra, we'll call it even.
not_available I gotta check on a patient.
not_available Done.
not_available Slip and fall in the shower.
not_available Possible wrist fracture.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available On what? 
not_available Your newlywed status.
not_available Lucky.
not_available Excuse me? I've been looking for Mr.
not_available Right for The last time it happened, they kept me.
not_available You done? I think so.
not_available What happened to your arm? Are you incapable of keeping your mouth shut? Were you born that way or something? 
not_available None of your beeswax.
not_available Breathe deep.
not_available Hey, what do you do for soft asthma? A couple of nebs and some prednisone? You're asking a nurse? Yeah, what you said.
not_available Only, I take an adult dose now.
not_available What he said, I said.
not_available Then discharge with follow
not_available up.
not_available Okay that took all of eight minutes.
not_available See, people? It can be done.
not_available What can be done? Oh, BS'ing your way through a shift, I suppose.
not_available Listen, I didn't mean to be nosy before.
not_available I was just making little talk.
not_available Small talk.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, exposure guy is coming to.
not_available Any word on his wife? 
not_available They're still trying to get ahold of her.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rushing? Mr.
not_available Rushing, can you understand me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you know what happened to you? Car 
not_available crashed.
not_available Your car? Where are they? Who? My kids.
not_available We were driving walked to get help.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Go get the police.
not_available His kids are still out there somewhere.
not_available So how long have you been married? 
not_available Two years.
not_available Some people think the age difference is a problem, but I can't keep up with him.
not_available We're gonna minimize the exposure to protect the baby.
not_available Our little accident, Bill likes to call him.
not_available Oh, you're having a boy? Just a guess.
not_available Will you be able to tell? 
not_available No, not with this.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available I wanna be surprised.
not_available You have to lie very still.
not_available And there's an intercom in case you wanna talk.
not_available CT abdopelvis with 
not_available and without.
not_available Fine cuts right through the kidney.
not_available When we shoot the rest of the dye in, you may continue 
not_available to feel a warm, tingling sensation.
not_available Okay.
not_available There it is.
not_available Smaller masses in the abdominal cavity too.
not_available Hey, I'm just the tech.
not_available Hematoma and fluid from where the main tumor bled.
not_available She's gonna need a nephrectomy.
not_available Yeah, like now.
not_available I guess Romano was right about one thing today.
not_available Is it almost over? What are their names? Sally and Tim.
not_available Do you know how badly they were hurt? It was dark.
not_available I just remember crying.
not_available BP's stable, 128/80.
not_available Pulse is 106.
not_available They were so scared.
not_available Luka? 
not_available Another liter of warm saline.
not_available Do you recall where it happened? Do you recall when it happened? 
not_available No.
not_available They're dead, aren't they? 
not_available We're trying to find them.
not_available I'm gonna start calling some of this in.
not_available He's near the six
not_available hour mark.
not_available Stable? 
not_available Just finishing up a Heimlich.
not_available Which is the cheesy ER way of dealing with a pneumothorax.
not_available I did it so he could stay here in case his family is found.
not_available Turf him to Medicine, let them hold hands and sing there.
not_available His kids could be seriously hurt.
not_available But he's not, get him out of the room.
not_available Look
not_available Mandatory therapy making you soft? Do us both a favor.
not_available Stop seeing your shrink.
not_available I mean, I don't believe in it.
not_available And frankly, if you're that screwed up, quit.
not_available Where the hell have you been? Get back to work.
not_available Hey, welcome back.
not_available Right.
not_available X
not_available ray's backed up and she's complaining of a headache.
not_available Get her to Curtain 3 and give her Tylenol.
not_available You could use a lunch tray by now.
not_available What I could use is a husband.
not_available Does yours have a brother? Damn.
not_available Hey, Kippy, my man.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Foot still hurts.
not_available I should sue you clowns.
not_available I'm in a rush.
not_available What you got for ladies? Stuffed animals.
not_available No, man.
not_available I need something that a lady can wear.
not_available Got some handmade jewelry, some perfume, tiedyed T
not_available shirt.
not_available Wait, I got some new items in.
not_available How much? What's this doing here? 
not_available We have cake when there's a birthday.
not_available A woman pops a kid out, what difference does the day make? No more official or unofficial birthday recognitions.
not_available Oh, you can't be serious.
not_available Singing, blowing out candles, eating.
not_available By the time it's done 
not_available everybody's had a break with pay.
not_available It fosters community.
not_available And lethargy, by the looks of it.
not_available Sandra Haycox.
not_available What about her? 
not_available Broken wrist.
not_available Cast her and cast her off.
not_available She's complaining of a headache now.
not_available Have her take a number and get back in line.
not_available One complaint per visit.
not_available Hey, who ate my cake? Nana, Nana! What happened? Eightyearold, frontseat passenger in single
not_available car MVA.
not_available Airbag deployed.
not_available Pretty hard, from the looks of it.
not_available May have a ruptured globe.
not_available Why was she sitting in the front seat? 
not_available Ask Grandma.
not_available The tumor outgrew its blood supply.
not_available Then part of it died, ruptured and bled.
not_available That's why you passed out.
not_available It could rupture again at any moment.
not_available So it's important that we remove it and the kidney as soon as possible.
not_available What kind of a tumor is it? We don't know.
not_available And we won't know until we get a pathology report.
not_available Do you think it's cancer? Let's take this one step at a time.
not_available My mother died of cancer.
not_available And if that's what this is, I should know.
not_available Debra
not_available I should know.
not_available It appears likely to be renal
not_available cell carcinoma, yes.
not_available And if it's as aggressive as it seems, it's possible that you would require chemo and radiation therapy following surgery.
not_available Unfortunately, chemotherapy is unadvisable while pregnant.
not_available You said it was aggressive.
not_available Yes, but
not_available Take it out.
not_available Take everything.
not_available Are you saying you wish to terminate as well? Just
not_available Just do it all at once.
not_available Typically, those procedures would be done separately.
not_available If you had surgery and waited until the baby was born
not_available I want the chemo.
not_available Honey
not_available I want it now.
not_available We're gonna leave you alone to talk.
not_available I guess she figures she can try again if she beats the cancer.
not_available Three weeks, the fetus is viable outside the womb.
not_available She could fight it then.
not_available She doesn't wanna take that chance.
not_available She's young.
not_available She's scared.
not_available Yeah.
not_available PH is still over nine.
not_available Pilar, how many fingers do I have? Think the blindness is temporary? I've seen alkali keratitis go both ways, but this doesn't look good.
not_available How's Grandma? 
not_available She needs an immobilizer for her knee.
not_available Otherwise, she's fine.
not_available What a difference height makes, huh? Why would anyone put their kid in the front seat? She begged me to.
not_available She's my only grandchild.
not_available I just wanted to make her happy.
not_available Could you grab a couple of Morgan Lenses from the eyeexam room? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Okay, this isn't going down 
not_available as one of my better days.
not_available I think that applies to all of us.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Why is it quiet all of a sudden? 
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available It was too hard to watch.
not_available So you went out and scored? 
not_available You weren't doing anything.
not_available I had to.
not_available You want Narcan? Put him on a monitor.
not_available At least someone's happy.
not_available Of course, it would be pro bono.
not_available You looked at our budget? Every time we open our doors we're pro bono.
not_available We're in a deep deficit, Elizabeth.
not_available I could contact surgeons and specialists, ask them to donate their services.
not_available Which would account for 25 percent of the total cost.
not_available Forget about Medicaid.
not_available The boy's not even a citizen.
not_available That might interest the media.
not_available Look at the separation of the Guatemalan conjoined twins.
not_available I don't think a Croatian kid needing a tet repair is gonna get the same draw.
not_available Kerry, he's 9 years old.
not_available He'll die without it.
not_available And we're just not able to help right now.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Kerry, can I ask you something? Are you as concerned about Robert as I am? More precisely, his mental health.
not_available He seems broken by this assignment.
not_available He's a cockroach.
not_available He'll refuse to evolve and yet survive us all.
not_available Talk to me about Residents.
not_available You need documentation.
not_available But you have a more powerful weapon in scheduling.
not_available They don't pull 16 shifts a month or work more than three nights in a row you can book them for every weekend, holiday or playoff night you want.
not_available Good stuff.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How come the delinquent hasn't been dispo'd yet? That was on my list of things to do.
not_available You didn't give Eddie enough prednisone with his albuterol.
not_available Let me get something straight.
not_available You overrode my orders? Yeah.
not_available Before he can leave, he needs to be able to walk and hold normal sats, which he can't.
not_available You screwed up.
not_available No, I did not.
not_available Maybe you haven't been listening.
not_available There's basic medical treatments There's people here who can help
not_available You don't question my judgment.
not_available And you sure as hell don't get too comfortable here, Dr.
not_available Carter! This is my ER now! That stands for one 
thing Everyone's replaceable! Even you.
not_available I need to know what to tell the guy.
not_available All right.
not_available That better be a local call.
not_available It's a police matter.
not_available They haven't found the car? We checked every road, bridge, river 
not_available within five miles.
not_available Why not 10 or 15? 
not_available He can't have walked that far.
not_available He was getting help for his children.
not_available He could have walked 100 miles.
not_available What can I say 
not_available we already covered a lot of territory.
not_available Search teams? It's 40 degrees there.
not_available Look, we're doing all we can.
not_available Luka, where's Dr.
not_available Romano? 
not_available I don't know and I don't care.
not_available Hey, Chuny.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Don't even.
not_available John.
not_available I thought you were long gone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just wanted to check and see how Robert was doing.
not_available As expected.
not_available He was abysmal.
not_available He has no patient rapport, stunted interpersonal skills and he's hostile.
not_available Qualities consistent with surgeons.
not_available He doesn't know what he's doing.
not_available He almost killed a patient by prescribing antiquated treatment.
not_available But obviously you stopped him from doing so.
not_available I can't stay on top of the guy 24/7.
not_available We're shifting him to administrative.
not_available You gonna chain him to his desk? 
not_available The ER may not be the best fit for him but it's all the man has.
not_available Just make it work.
not_available Or better yet, work around him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm Diana Rushing.
not_available I got a message saying my husband's here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available He treated your husband.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's Rushing's wife.
not_available I'll take you to him.
not_available Is he okay? I've been worried sick.
not_available I'm from Indiana.
not_available He's stable, but he's obviously very upset.
not_available When did you see them last? He left home four days ago.
not_available Who's "them "? Your husband and your children.
not_available What children? He said he was with them in the car when he crashed.
not_available We don't have children.
not_available Her caretaker says she's complained of white discharge.
not_available She have her period yet? 
not_available She says she's a real woman.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Good.
not_available We're gonna do a test on your private parts, okay? Set up for a pelvic.
not_available It's probably a simple yeast infection.
not_available Sandra how's your headache? Did the acetaminophen help? Sandra? Sandra? I need a crash cart.
not_available She came in with a broken wrist.
not_available She did.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Pulseless and apneic.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Charging to 200.
not_available And clear.
not_available Unit number six going up.
not_available Tumor mass has invaded the renal artery wall and sections of the vena cava.
not_available You want me to call? 
not_available Won't tell me anything I don't know.
not_available Stage IVB, by the size and the spread of it.
not_available Take the kidney.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, call on line one.
not_available If it's Path, put it on speaker.
not_available Pedicle clamp in place.
not_available Metz to divide the vessels.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? Yes, Dr.
not_available Meechum.
not_available What are your findings? Fuhrman grade IV with a sarcomatoid pattern and a high mitotic picture.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Done.
not_available Steel bowl.
not_available It's bad, I take it.
not_available Irresectable.
not_available We'd be doing her a favor if she bled to death.
not_available Her chance of survival is less than Get her husband up here.
not_available I want to speak to him.
not_available Charge again to 360 and clear.
not_available Asystole.
not_available It's been 20 minutes.
not_available Try another amp of epi.
not_available And clear.
not_available No pressure, no pulse.
not_available A headache, a fall, possibly jogged an aneurysm she already had.
not_available No way you could have known about it.
not_available No way she could have known about it.
not_available Yeah, I'm sure she wasn't planning on dying today.
not_available He's depressed.
not_available That, combined with aspects of dissociative disorder allowed him to create this weird negative amnesia.
not_available Was it a psychotic break? Not per se.
not_available But he definitely needs inpatient psych care.
not_available When he talked about them, he made them sound so real.
not_available To him, they are.
not_available Right now, anyway.
not_available But they won't always be.
not_available With the right meds, it'll all fade away.
not_available Cervical motion tenderness.
not_available PID? Yup.
not_available Mindy, do you have a boyfriend? You're pretty young to be having sex much less unprotected sex.
not_available You need to tell him to use condoms.
not_available What are those? That's not a good sign.
not_available Can you tell me his name so we can make sure he gets checked? He cleans floors.
not_available He says he loves me.
not_available Four hundred of cefixime and a gram of azithro.
not_available We're just gonna help you get dressed, okay? Oh, man.
not_available You want me to call the facility? Call the police first.
not_available This has been one of the worst days of my life.
not_available Careful, don't jinx yourself.
not_available Goodnight, everyone.
not_available Happy birthday, Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available Hey, my gloves.
not_available What? Camel
not_available colored with lambskin.
not_available Are those mine? 
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available Greg just gave them to me.
not_available They were in my locker this morning.
not_available So? I bought those out on the street.
not_available You bought these on the street? 
not_available Yeah, from Kippy.
not_available But it's a long story.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry.
not_available I mean, what do you
not_available ? I can't believe you bought my birthday present on the street.
not_available It was a good deal.
not_available They're genuine leather.
not_available If I were you, I'd put them under a Wood's lamp.
not_available Nice.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available We're not supposed to see each other but I figured if your day was as bad as mine, you could use some company.
not_available Well, 8year
not_available old blinded by an air bag, woman keels over of an aneurysm junkie shooting up in the ER and a Down's syndrome girl with the clap.
not_available Family of four trapped in a burning vehicle, one kid survived.
not_available 18 months old.
not_available You win.
not_available What'd you get? Oh, the burger and fries we never got.
not_available Knit one, purl two.
not_available If you take much longer, you're gonna be sewing scabs.
not_available If I go faster, the edges don't evert well.
not_available I love watching med students suture.
not_available It reminds me how good I am.
not_available Was.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available He said, "Was.
not_available " Loose stools in Exam 4.
not_available Knock yourself out.
not_available Almost there.
not_available Skin stapler will be next.
not_available Cut, please.
not_available Pressure's steady at 110/68.
not_available He's here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Strickland I'm afraid we've discovered a highly malignant and inoperable cancer.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Stapler ready.
not_available Your wife's chance of survival even with the most aggressive form of chemotherapy, is extremely poor.
not_available But not impossible? The one sure thing is that she will survive long enough to deliver your baby if she doesn't seek treatment.
not_available But for that to happen, you'd have to reverse her decision.
not_available OB's here.
not_available How close are we? Almost closed.
not_available Mr.
not_available Strickland if you wish to overrule her decision, you need to do it quickly.
not_available The GYN team here is standing by to perform an abortion.
not_available I want her to live.
not_available Your wife is going to die.
not_available She's gonna fight this.
not_available Do you understand this baby has a chance? 
not_available I can't, I just can't.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Strickland? Let's get her draped.
not_available Start with the sterile spec.
not_available Another? Yeah.
not_available And stop skimping on the peanuts.
not_available Hey, how about putting something on for those of us in the room without hairy knuckles.
not_available Something wrong with this show? Yeah.
not_available It only appeals to adults making less than 20 grand a year.
not_available Thirty grand.
not_available Oh, car wash gave you a raise.
not_available Good for you.
not_available I'm a copier tech.
not_available Well, that explains the dirty fingernails but not why you enjoy watching half
not_available naked chunky trunks pull tractors with their teeth.
not_available Must be a sort of homoerotic thing for you.
