not_available Abby.
not_available Just a second.
not_available Crap.
not_available Med Staff office says you can't work tonight.
not_available Right.
not_available See you.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Banned until you deal with your charts.
not_available Excuse me, Frank.
not_available Told them I was gonna sling you over my shoulder and carry you myself.
not_available Sling me over your shoulder? You're backed up six months.
not_available Good.
not_available You're here.
not_available Bringing in a guy out of his head, combative.
not_available We could use the extra set of hands.
not_available Ativan? They gave him 10 migs already, hasn't touched him.
not_available Abby, don't go out there.
not_available I think Frank has a crush on me.
not_available And go see the Med Staff.
not_available They're bugging me about your charts.
not_available Nemo Lynch, 32.
not_available There's a snake! Ran through the water tower, jumped through a plate
not_available glass window.
not_available Sounds like PCP.
not_available Twenty of ziprasidone, I.M.
not_available Got it! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Hey, you need some help here? Moretti's got me triaging.
not_available Don't worry about that, worry about keeping patients out of the door.
not_available Vitals are stable, abdomen's non
not_available tender, wounds look superficial.
not_available Why is the ER calling for a surgeon? You're a great mentor.
not_available That was a question.
not_available Why does this guy need an ex
not_available lap? Can't trust the exam if the patient's high.
not_available You even listening to a word I'm saying? Can I ask a question? It's a little embarrassing.
not_available It's better to ask rather than fake it.
not_available I appreciate your attitude towards that, I really do.
not_available It's reassuring to know that 
not_available Harold, sometime today.
not_available My girlfriend, Lacey.
not_available Her homecoming dance is coming.
not_available Homecoming dance? She's in the court.
not_available Out of my league looks
not_available wise.
not_available But there's cachet in dating a doctor when you're still in high school.
not_available Your girlfriend's in high school? 
not_available A senior at Woodland.
not_available Anyway, there are certain skills, expectations.
not_available Certain rites of passage that a certain homecoming princess is gonna be counting on, you know? No, I'm not sure I do.
not_available I've never been to the dance.
not_available I don't know how to do the mambo or pin the corsage.
not_available Do you have any idea? 
not_available I didn't grow up in this country.
not_available I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask.
not_available Neela, help me.
not_available I'm a virgin.
MORETTl You guys all right in here? Get away, you freak! You wrote the map of the skin! 
not_available We're doing just fine.
not_available I will not be the conduit.
not_available Sedation's kicking in.
not_available Interns, your first
not_available quarter evaluations are in your boxes.
not_available Find me if you want to discuss.
not_available Not a good time.
not_available Nobody told us we were tested.
not_available Every patient is a test.
not_available Of your intellect, of your wit, of your organizational skills.
not_available Get the snake! 
not_available Shut up! Hold still.
not_available We're gonna get the snake.
not_available Hear that? Every patient's a test.
not_available And Sam just got an A this time.
not_available Guess I spoke too soon.
not_available I stole this from the G YN clinic.
not_available What? 
not_available I didn't "steal" steal it.
not_available I'll take it back just as 
not_available I'm not touching that.
not_available Just go over the relevant anatomy.
not_available Oh, come on, man.
not_available Put that thing away.
not_available No air under the diaphragm.
not_available He's just so smug all the time.
not_available Have you ever met anybody so smug? Let me guess.
not_available Moretti? Every time, you guys are talking about the same thing.
not_available Well, he's an ass, but I can't deny he's a smart guy.
not_available C
not_available spine is fine.
not_available Should I take off his collar? 
not_available No.
not_available Upstairs.
not_available This one's fun.
not_available Get him up before sedation wears off.
not_available Here's everything you need to know.
not_available We're good.
not_available Go.
not_available He can't hear anything? He's had enough sedation to down an elephant.
not_available Okay, so where exactly is the G
not_available spot? Put that thing away.
not_available Hey.
not_available I hope you're on top of your game.
not_available Boards tomorrow.
not_available You're taking the hard cases.
not_available Why are you working before boards? 
not_available It's Morris', he's taking them too.
not_available Couldn't find anybody? 
not_available Nope.
not_available And he swore that he would fail if I didn't bail him out.
not_available But I'll do fine.
not_available I test well.
not_available You hear from Luka? 
not_available Taking longer than he expected.
not_available He has to retrofit his dad's house for a wheelchair.
not_available This is completely unfair.
not_available Guy's clearly on a power trip.
not_available Abby, check this out.
not_available Four pages of 
categories Procedures, patient relations, intellectual curiosity.
not_available Each rated one to five.
not_available He gave us ones across the board.
not_available Is that good or bad? 
not_available Bad.
not_available No comments, no feedback.
not_available Just ones.
not_available So uncool.
not_available I'm never gonna get a toxicology fellowship.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Are we supposed to learn from this? You have to talk to him.
not_available Yeah, would you? Please? Frank, what's up with the lab? I've been waiting three hours for a CBC.
not_available Something about a flow cytometer.
not_available It'll be a while.
not_available Oh, your kid's school called twice.
not_available Alex biting off lizard heads again? Shut up.
not_available He's not a sociopath.
not_available That's right, ignore the problem.
not_available It'll go away.
not_available Well, it's too late, I have to call them tomorrow morning.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available You're supposed to be covering Triage right now.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nurses rotate every two hours.
not_available You're up.
not_available Come on.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Slamming the interns without giving any concrete suggestions isn't helping.
not_available These numeric evaluations are useless.
not_available Don't worry, Abby.
not_available I gave you solid threes.
not_available Listen, they're freaking out about the bad evaluations instead of focusing on how to improve.
not_available lllustrating my point.
not_available Which is what, exactly? Are they concerned about giving patients sub
not_available optimal care? No.
not_available They're worried about how it's gonna look They need mentors, constructive feedback, guidance.
not_available They're just kids.
not_available Arrogance and inexperience are a lethal combination.
not_available There's gotta be a more effective way 
not_available Abby, look, I understand " it's" your natural instinct to listen, to wanna be supportive.
not_available But in the end, with Forget it.
not_available Can't.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ma'am, why are you here? He got a cough.
not_available Oh, yeah? Let me see.
not_available Hey, let me see.
not_available Well, his breathing's okay.
not_available I'll try to get you back as soon as I can.
not_available Hello.
not_available Sir, let me see your hand.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Come over here.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Yes? I've been here.
not_available This guy just walked in.
not_available Well, this guy's bleeding.
not_available Okay, well, my head is exploding.
not_available You look comfortable to me.
not_available Well, don't tell me what I'm feeling.
not_available You get headaches a lot? Never like this.
not_available All right, here.
not_available Grab that.
not_available I'll get back to you in a second.
not_available Follow me.
not_available This place is gross.
not_available Well, you get used to it.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Heather.
not_available Heather, I'm Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available This is Sam.
not_available Sam, Heather here says she has an exploding headache.
not_available Hm.
not_available Let's get you checked out.
not_available Moretti have you working in Waiting? 
not_available All day.
not_available He's doing that to all the Residents.
not_available Well, I better get back.
not_available Take a seat over here.
not_available On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your headache? It's a 10.
not_available You're pretty calm for a 10.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So you think I'm lying? 
not_available I have a high tolerance for pain.
not_available Where are your parents? I don't know.
not_available Out.
not_available Give me their numbers.
not_available We need permission for any treatment.
not_available Sam, you seen Pratt? He's in Exam 3 reducing a shoulder.
not_available Are you on tonight? You mean "on" as in lively and invigorated, or "on" as in working? What? 
not_available Morris.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm looking for you.
not_available Why aren't you studying? 
not_available I got too much nervous energy.
not_available There's no way I'm gonna sleep.
not_available I came in so we could study.
not_available I took over your shift so that you could stay home.
not_available Come on.
not_available We can help each other get psyched, get focused.
not_available Listen, if you're here, I'm out.
not_available Dude, you need to work on your game face.
not_available What? 
not_available Game face, Greg.
not_available What's wrong with you? Shrug your shoulders.
not_available Can I open my eyes now? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Okay, the good news is your neuro exam is totally normal.
not_available But you have trigger points.
not_available Which means? It's tension.
not_available You'll feel better with ibuprofen.
not_available Aren't you gonna do a CAT scan? You don't need one.
not_available Well, do one anyway.
not_available We don't do tests just because patients want them.
not_available Why not? It's a waste of resources.
not_available Okay, well, make my dad pay, he's rich.
not_available That's not really the issue.
not_available You just said it was about resources, so Is this your home phone number? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So when I call it, why do I get a video rental store? Video rental? I didn't even know those still existed.
not_available That isn't funny.
not_available My mom is dead, my dad is in New York.
not_available And he doesn't need you guys bothering him, so Not that big a deal.
not_available Six hundred of ibuprofen.
not_available Get consent.
not_available And give us his real number.
not_available No more games.
not_available That was so cool, defending us to Moretti.
not_available Well, we were just discussing different teaching philosophies.
not_available Yours is better.
not_available There's no way I'm gonna present to him.
not_available You got a minute? 
not_available You can't boycott an Attending.
not_available I can't? Come on, just for today.
not_available Hanging out in Waiting is inefficient.
not_available Just get back out there.
not_available I should be here clearing beds.
not_available A woman arrested in an ER waiting room because nobody was paying attention Brian? 
not_available Hey.
MORETTl What are you doing here? Thirteenyear
not_available old in respiratory distress.
not_available Tony.
not_available It's really bad this time.
not_available I know this kid.
not_available Got a neuromuscular disorder.
not_available I know him from ICU.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, buddy, how you doing? 
not_available Pretty good.
not_available Yeah? Did you see D.
not_available Lee hit for the cycle last night? No, I missed it.
not_available Have to give me the playby
not_available play.
not_available Pulse ox is only 78.
not_available Let's go.
not_available He needs oxygen.
not_available Sam, you're with me.
not_available Where we going? Trauma 1.
not_available Brian, wait right here.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available All right, let's set up a non
not_available rebreather and let's get an ABG going.
not_available Find someone else to cover Triage.
not_available I'm staying with this kid.
MORETTl He left? What do you mean, he left? He was here and then he was gone.
not_available Is that clear enough for you? 
not_available Did he say where he was going? Frank, where's the Crohn's fistula? Ask me again in English.
not_available Never mind, I found her.
not_available Do women need additional lubrication? Harold, get a consult form.
not_available If you're willing to put in the time to sufficiently stimulate the area Isn't there anyone in your life that would be more appropriate for this? Like a brother, uncle, anyone? No, just Grandpa.
not_available And he thinks I still believe in the stork.
not_available Is there anything special I should know about the Crohn's lady? She's narcissistic, she's addicted to "morphine " " and" if she says that she's allergic to NSAIDs, she's lying.
not_available Thanks for the warning.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Moretti, I'm Skye Wexler, new Attending.
not_available We spoke on the phone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I didn't realize you were starting.
not_available Yeah, tonight's the night.
not_available All right.
not_available Follow me.
not_available When you Write your initials in this column when you pick up a patient.
not_available And chart any progress in this column over here, okay? Frank.
not_available Sorry, this is Dr.
not_available Wexler.
not_available She's gonna be taking some shifts over the next month or so.
not_available And this is one of our lifers, Haleh.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available You new to Chicago? Doing locums to make some extra cash.
not_available Locums? Yeah, it's like moonlighting.
not_available Mostly nights.
not_available Ah.
not_available That's when I work too.
not_available Oh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Much better than being stuck in a hospital all day when it's beautiful outside.
not_available I hear you.
not_available I'm a big hiker myself.
not_available You bump your head? Hang in there, Josh.
not_available I'm almost done.
not_available ABG's back, 7.
not_available 18.
not_available CO2, 66.
not_available Yeah, he's retaining.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available It means he's tiring out.
not_available You try breathing 50 times a minute.
not_available You're gonna have washboard abs after this.
not_available Art line's in.
not_available So we can check your blood gases without needles.
not_available See this shadow? 
not_available Yeah, is that fluid? Yeah, most likely aspiration pneumonia.
not_available His muscles are weak.
not_available It's not protecting his 
not_available Airway.
not_available Right.
not_available I never should've let you go to that Kelly Clarkson concert.
not_available That's not why I have pneumonia.
not_available Did she just say Kelly Clarkson? Problem? 
not_available Good thing you're sick.
not_available I'd be giving you so much crap.
not_available Kelly Clarkson? Hey, Sam.
not_available Gram of ceftriaxone, liter of NS.
not_available Which one of you is Pratt? 
not_available That would be him.
not_available Hey, Skye Wexler, new Attending.
not_available I'm doing overnights.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Call Hopkins.
not_available We're supposed to report ER visits to the study coordinator.
not_available Boards tomorrow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll hang here so you can study.
not_available Really.
not_available Go.
not_available Gates, you good with this? Yeah.
not_available All right, buddy.
not_available We'll get you feeling better soon, okay? Looks like you're stuck with me, Josh.
not_available Let me take a look at the film.
not_available Here.
not_available Your feet must be tired.
not_available This hospital bites.
not_available Been here hours, nobody's done anything.
not_available We get busy.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Trying to find someone who gives a crap.
not_available Yeah, well, those computers are for staff only.
not_available Go back to your bed.
not_available Okay, did you hear me? I have chest pain.
not_available And it's really, really bad.
not_available I'll get someone to check you out.
MORETTl How's the boy doing? 
not_available Struggling, headed for a tube.
not_available So, what are you doing out here? The new Attending came and said 
not_available Wait, wait, wait.
not_available You left a patient in respiratory failure with an untested Attending you've never met? Oh, well, I 
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available I sent her in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, doctor.
not_available Check me out.
not_available Hey.
not_available What happened? There you are.
not_available You show up out of nowhere and then suddenly you disappear.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available You seemed busy.
not_available I didn't wanna get in your way.
not_available Is everything all right? You look like hell.
not_available No, I drove all night, so 
not_available Oh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, I'm sorry, this is Brian, my son.
not_available Oh, really? Hey.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Aren't you in college on the East Coast? 
MORETTl Yes, he is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And now this is the part where you tell me why you're not in "school " " and" you're here visiting me at work.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Happy birthday.
not_available You drove all night to give me a book? No, it's not just a book, not just a book.
not_available It's like a new way of thinking.
not_available Really? All right, well Remember in college you got so excited about everything that you learned? Come, let's get out of here.
not_available You look like you haven't eaten in a week.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Skye has my sign
not_available out.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's the natural course of Fazio
not_available Londe disease.
not_available The respiratory muscles aren't strong enough to clear secretions.
not_available So there are no other options.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Bazzano from Pediatric Neurology.
not_available Hi, Joshua.
not_available You're his mom? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Acidosis is worse.
not_available So listen up, buddy.
not_available Your muscles that help you breathe are starting to get tired.
not_available Tell me something I don't know.
not_available So we're gonna have to put a tube down and that will breathe for you.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available The ventilator's temporary.
not_available His muscles rest so the antibiotics do their thing.
not_available And after the pneumonia's treated, we can take the tube out? Well, that's the hope.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available We talked about this possibility.
not_available I have to run upstairs.
not_available I'll see you guys up in the ICU.
not_available Thanks, doctor.
not_available Do you understand everything? Yeah.
not_available Mom.
not_available Yeah, honey? The situation demands a Slushee.
not_available Josh, sorry, but you gotta be NPO.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's give the kid a Slushee, huh? You can live with that, huh? Sweet.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where do I? The Jumbo Mart.
not_available My kid loves them too.
not_available It's across the street.
not_available Come on, I'll take you.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Good catch.
not_available You're not tubing me.
not_available Headache's gone.
not_available Now it's chest pain.
not_available EKG was fine, exam was normal.
not_available Did you do a Beta HCG? Could explain this whole thing.
not_available Keep her on oxygen, call if she has sustained decels.
not_available Abby.
not_available HCG? Oh, yeah.
not_available It was negative.
not_available I have to check on a sick asthmatic.
not_available Oh, that's cool.
not_available I got this.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Wexler.
not_available I'm in charge tonight.
not_available Lucky you.
not_available Deep breath.
not_available I can't.
not_available You can try.
not_available Again.
not_available Well, your heart and lungs sound good.
not_available Oxygen level's perfect.
not_available Better keep looking, then.
not_available Your pain can't be that "bad " " if" you're able to text your friends all through my exam.
not_available I'm not texting.
not_available I'm trying to get online.
not_available Reception in here sucks.
not_available Is there a computer in here I can use? Do you know where Pratt is? I can't find him anywhere.
not_available Try the break room.
not_available He's studying.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You were saying? Just forget it.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Of course we have the grand old dame of cramming, caffeine.
not_available Grand old dame? Three hundred milligrams, baby.
not_available Keep our engines nice and revved.
not_available Oh, and this.
not_available Okay? This.
not_available This is the silver bullet.
not_available If you get stuck on the test, squeeze this, the answer will come.
not_available Hey, I don't need any good
not_available luck charms.
not_available You can't reject a good
not_available luck charm.
not_available That's like the opposite of good luck, as in bad luck.
not_available Don't believe in luck.
not_available I believe in preparation.
not_available And I'm prepared.
not_available Whoa, what's all this? We got boards tomorrow.
not_available Yeah, and how exactly does this fit in? Something to perk us up when our stamina flags.
not_available Do you guys mind if Harold hangs for a while? He could benefit from your tutelage.
not_available No, we have too much ground to cover.
not_available If you don't know it, this isn't gonna help.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Studies have shown that cramming can improve short
not_available term performance.
not_available See? Have a seat, Harold.
not_available Oh, excellent.
not_available Great guys.
not_available Smart, experienced.
not_available So, what topics do you wanna cover? Just some basic fundamentals.
not_available No appetite? Dairy is pumped full of hormones, and wheat is genetically modified.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay, I'll try to find you some organic Jell
not_available O.
not_available Urine aminolevulinic acid is elevated.
not_available Suggests a problem with porphryin metabolism.
not_available She does seem to have a serious fear of food.
not_available Acute porphyria can be brought on by caloric restriction.
not_available Well, see, it fits.
not_available Hematology said to order an erythrocyte enzyme assay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Cool case, Grady.
not_available But make sure I keep moving other patients through.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Hey.
not_available How is everything? It's better.
not_available Much better.
not_available You been going to meetings? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Okay, because I haven't seen you.
not_available Well, the last couple of times, I worked late.
not_available So I couldn't make it to St.
not_available Mark's.
not_available Oh, I see.
not_available And I kind of wanted to go somewhere where nobody knew me.
not_available Hm.
not_available Why is that? I don't know.
not_available Look, the church on Franklin's got meetings all hours, day and night.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That's good to know.
not_available When your infection clears, capacity will improve " and" they'll take the tube out.
not_available Be real.
not_available I'll never get off the vent.
not_available Don't say that, Josh.
not_available I've been thinking about this moment continuously since I got my diagnosis.
not_available No tube.
not_available So that's it? You're just gonna give up now? And I need to make it look like it's your decision.
not_available What? It would kill my mom if she knew this was my idea.
not_available I promised her I'd fight.
not_available So fight.
not_available They're doing research on neuromuscular diseases all over the world.
not_available It's not gonna help me.
not_available They could come up with a breakthrough.
not_available They're years away from a cure.
not_available Whether we like it or not, this is happening.
not_available My mom can start getting over it now " or" a year from now when she's given up everything to be by my bed while I wither away on a ventilator.
not_available Josh.
not_available Tony, you get me.
not_available I know you understand.
not_available He's a bright kid.
not_available He knows what's in store.
not_available Intellectual understanding isn't the same as emotional maturity.
not_available No, I know him.
not_available He understands what he's doing.
not_available You're absolutely sure about this? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do me a favor and run it by Ethics.
not_available You can tell them your Attending's on board.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available It is Sam, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Could you give our asthmatic in 2 I already did.
not_available Part of Moretti's new protocol.
not_available You don't need orders if the patient meets criteria.
not_available Efficient.
not_available I like it.
not_available Could I take a look? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, Frank, do you have the asthma flowchart? Hey, kid.
not_available This is a hospital, not an Internet cafÃ©.
not_available What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? I called your dad.
not_available Somebody's on their way to get you.
not_available You shouldn't have.
not_available He didn't wanna be bothered.
not_available Of course he does.
not_available How can you say that? You don't know him, you don't know me.
not_available I'm a parent, I understand a parent's 
not_available Oh, shut up, you phony bitch.
not_available It's "like " It's already after 3 and I think it's about time we go to bed.
not_available No.
not_available I think it's time we opened another bottle of champagne.
not_available Here.
not_available Really? Did I tell you I'm taking a course on the history of wine? 
not_available No.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available It sounds like major slacker territory, huh? But it's actually this awesome survey of Western civilization.
not_available There's the Last "Supper " Spanish Inquisition, Yalta Conference.
not_available You name it, somehow wine was involved.
not_available Yeah, well, wine is 
not_available Oh, I switched my major.
