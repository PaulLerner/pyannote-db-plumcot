not_available Lake had a flail chest.
not_available We moved him.
not_available Pickman's in back with an open tib
not_available fib.
not_available She conscious? Yeah, but her patient might be hemorrhaging.
not_available Listen to his lungs on the way in.
not_available You might need to needle him.
not_available Okay, got it! You okay, Doris? I messed up my leg bad.
not_available It's open, but I got a pulse in the foot.
not_available I had to move it myself.
not_available I need you to stand back! 
not_available I'm an emergency physician at County.

not_available Coming.
not_available Come on, breathe! That was stupid.
not_available That was really stupid.
not_available You could have both been electrocuted.
not_available Stop.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It was instinct.
not_available I told you not to touch him.
not_available You're okay if your feet don't touch the ground.
not_available Guess what? It's raining.
not_available Water conducts electricity.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available You were lucky.
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Got it.
not_available It's charging to 200.
not_available She's okay.
not_available Clear.
not_available The tires are insulating the rig.

not_available A hundred of lido down the ET until you get a line.
not_available That's two milligrams a minute.
not_available Please help me.
not_available I'm bleeding.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available We're gonna get you out of there.
not_available Vicki, it's Dr.
not_available Weaver again.
not_available Did you feel a shock? 
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available Is he breathing? We got him back for now.
not_available Vicki, tell me if you're bleeding from your vagina.
not_available The baby's not moving.
not_available I need you to feel down there and tell me if you're bleeding.
not_available Hold on! I'm coming in.
not_available No, no.
not_available I can't let you do that.
not_available Her baby's probably in distress.
not_available First rule of an accident site, don't create more casualties.
not_available Casualties? We need an engineer out here.
not_available They're not showing fault in the power grid.
not_available It looks like a fault to me.
not_available That's what they're telling me.
not_available Hey, I told you not to do that! 
not_available Just turn the damn power off! Did you hit your head, lose consciousness? I don't know.
not_available I remember walking in the street, seeing Gordon lying in the rain.
not_available Gordon? 
not_available Her dog.
not_available BP's 100/40.
not_available He kept scratching at the door.
not_available I had to take him for a walk.
not_available Breath sounds equal.
not_available No hemotympanum.
not_available But I wanna get a head CT.
not_available Is this the hitandrun? He didn't stop? 
not_available Pulse ox is 94 on 4 liters.
not_available Miss can you describe the car that hit you? 
not_available It was silver, I think.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available No.
not_available Does that hurt? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Did you take my dog to the vet? 
not_available I'm afraid your dog died.
not_available Full trauma panel, C
not_available spine, chest, AP pelvis, Foley, give her 10 of morphine.
not_available HemoCue's 9.8.
not_available Let's get an ultrasound before a CT.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene is using it.
not_available Go see if he's done.
not_available What kind of dog was he? 
not_available He was a terrier mix.
not_available Those are the best kind.
not_available You know, he probably went really fast.
not_available Don't hear a dorsalis pedis pulse.
not_available Go get me a Doppler.
not_available Check an ICON before she goes to Radiology.
not_available Little fluid in Morrison's pouch.
not_available Can we have that when you're done? 
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Page Pedes Surgery.
not_available Another crit in 20 minutes.
not_available You want to cath urine? 
not_available On a CPK and another portable chest.
not_available Daniel, you're doing much better.
not_available We need to keep an eye on you for the next couple hours just in case you need any surgery.
not_available He's dead, isn't he? 
not_available What? Joey.
not_available He drowned.
not_available I don't know.
not_available They're looking for him.
not_available He didn't want to go.
not_available Where? 
not_available To the river.
not_available He was scared, but I called him a baby.
not_available You didn't know this would happen.
not_available He's only 6.
not_available Parents are on their way.
not_available They're gonna hate me now.
not_available They're gonna be happy you're safe.
not_available It should have been me.
not_available Watch the monitor.
not_available His heart's irritable.
not_available Looks like regular sinus rhythm.
not_available Okay, let's go! Shut the door.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, stay clear of that rig! 
not_available Hey, hold on.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available Hypertonic contractions.
not_available BP's dropping, 68/40.
not_available That's way too low, right? What?! 
not_available Nothing, Vicki.
not_available I need you to be quiet.
not_available I just need to listen.
not_available What was that? It's the power line! 
not_available Fetal heart tones are 70.
not_available Is that bad? Maybe the transformer will blow out and kill the line! Dr.
not_available Weaver! I need your help.
not_available Can you get in here safely? 
not_available Yeah, I'd have to jump.
not_available Okay, then jump.
not_available Got it.
not_available Search through the cabinets.
not_available Find me an amp of cardiac lidocaine.
not_available Lidocaine? 
not_available Just do it.
not_available Vicki, your placenta is detaching.
not_available It's bleeding into your uterus.
not_available Oh, God! Hey! I told you to stay away from the damn vehicle! She's bleeding out! Why is the power still on? There's a crew on the way! The only way to stop the bleeding is to deliver your baby surgically.
not_available It's too early.
not_available it's not.
not_available Thirtysix weeks is full
not_available term.
not_available Take me to the hospital! Honey, I want to.
not_available I want to, but I can't right now, all right? Shut it off from the plant! It's supposed to burn through on its own.
not_available They need to authorize the shutdown.
not_available Vicki.
not_available Vicki, I need you to listen to me.
not_available I'm an emergency physician.
not_available I'm trained to perform a C
not_available section only after the mother has died.
not_available And in about 15 minutes, that's what's gonna happen.
not_available Meanwhile, your baby is in danger.
not_available But I might be able to save you both if we take the baby now and stop your internal bleeding.
not_available Are you willing to take that risk with me? 
not_available I think so.
not_available You sure? You've observed a Csection? 
not_available I haven't done OB before.
not_available Well, you'll be ahead of the curve.
not_available Lidocaine.
not_available Know how to take a blood pressure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, take one.
not_available I need it every couple of minutes.
not_available Squeeze that saline bag and find me every 4by
not_available 4 and bandage we have.
not_available Okay, Vicki.
not_available Vicki, hang in there.
not_available I'm gonna give you a shot in your spine that will numb your belly and legs.
not_available All right, find me a 10 blade.
not_available That's a scalpel.
not_available When's the last time you've done this? 
not_available Peter, the DNA test was inevitable.
not_available There has to be a precedent.
not_available Not in a custody battle between two men without genetic ties to a child they raised.
not_available It's stepfather versus stepfather.
not_available I'm not his stepfather.
not_available I'm his father.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Father.
not_available Until Carla died, Roger never questioned that Peter was Reece's dad.
not_available Irrelevant.
not_available She put my name on the birth certificate.
not_available If she were alive, Carla couldn't contest the paternity.
not_available But Roger can? 
not_available Ironically, yes.
not_available Peter, you are going to have to allow Roger to resume partial visitation.
not_available No.
not_available No way.
not_available As we speak Roger's attorney is drafting a pre
not_available trial motion for visitation until this is resolved.
not_available You don't stipulate now, you'll lose that hearing and be painted as the heavy.
not_available I'm the heavy? He's trying to take my son from me and I'm the heavy? You need to be seen by the judge as someone who's interested in Reece's well
not_available being.
not_available I am.
not_available Good.
not_available Then you need to listen to me.
not_available You have to stay focused on the endgame.
not_available And not let anger or fear impede that goal.
not_available Vicki, stay awake.
not_available I need you to stay awake.
not_available BP's dropping.
not_available 50.
not_available Spike another liter.
not_available "Spike"? 
not_available Take the pointy end of the bag and hang it up.
not_available Hey, you! Firefighter! Lopez! 
not_available Lopez, I need more light! Scotty! Scotty, turn up the brights! I need you over here.
not_available Get out.
not_available You're doing a vertical incision? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Be ready with that hemostat.
not_available We're gonna clamp the big bleeders and pack up everything else with gauze.
not_available All right, here we go.
not_available I need you to put your hands there and pull back.
not_available Where? 
not_available Just do what I do from the other side.
not_available Vicki, you feel that? 
not_available Just some pulling.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, fascia's exposed.
not_available Okay, separate the rectus, down to the fascia.
not_available All right, more retraction.
not_available Okay.
not_available Pull back.
not_available My baby.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Hang on, Vicki.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm into the peritoneal cavity.
not_available Here's the uterus.
not_available Give me the scalpel.
not_available You want me to let go? 
not_available Scanner 1 will be ready in 10.
not_available Do a sound on the chest.
not_available They're gonna take you upstairs and scan your whole body for other injuries.
not_available I want you to tell the nurse if you need any more pain medication, okay? I'm sorry about your dog.
not_available What? 
not_available "He probably went really fast.
not_available " 
not_available She was upset.
not_available She could have solid
not_available organ rupture.
not_available The dog's the least of her concerns.
not_available It can be traumatic to lose a pet, especially if you saw it happen.
not_available What was his name? 
not_available Who? Your dog.
not_available Happy.
not_available He was a Lhasa apso, and he got run over by a car when I was 11.
not_available Oh, did he go really fast? No.
not_available Crushed his pelvis.
not_available In the river earlier today Someone drowned? 
not_available Brother of the boy in Trauma 2.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Did they find him? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available You can't leave anything around here.
not_available What? 
not_available Some derelict stole my PalmPilot.
not_available Maybe you misplaced it.
not_available I had it two minutes ago.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Alger.
