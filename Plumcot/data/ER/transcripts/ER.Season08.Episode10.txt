not_available What am I paying you for? He denied the motion, Peter.
not_available It's not irreparable.
not_available The hell it isn't.
not_available He's asking my son to decide which of us loves him more? It won't be that specific.
not_available Will he ask who makes better macaroni and cheese? Judge Alter has a feeling that interviewing Reece will provide relevant insight.
not_available Reece knows what's going on.
not_available He can sense it.
not_available How much more damage do you want to inflict on him? Hey, I agreed to represent you.
not_available You're the one who's choosing to fight.
not_available You can preempt this.
not_available His attorney approached me yesterday.
not_available No.
not_available They'll make a revised visitation request.
not_available I said, no.
not_available And I need to be honest.
not_available We don't have the edge here.
not_available On paper, Roger comes across as the better father.
not_available If I were his attorney, I would advise him to give you no more deals.

not_available Besides, this Stan character sounds rough.
not_available Bet he's got a record.
not_available I wouldn't be surprised.
not_available And no family to speak of.
not_available No place to spend the holidays.
not_available You know, if he was smart he'd clean himself up, get himself a suit at the Goodwill
not_available And go to the airport.
not_available You mind if I stay a while? It's kind of Christmassy here.
not_available The alderman thinks you're such a brilliant surgeon, then you operate.
not_available Where are they? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Waiting for Roger and his lawyer.
not_available I thought we were seeing the judge.
not_available We're hoping that won't be necessary.
not_available Peter, what's going on? 
not_available They wanna talk about some kind of deal.
not_available Sorry we're late.
not_available We ran into traffic.
not_available We don't have a lot of time.
not_available What have you got? Visitation every other weekend, plus two weeks during the summer.
not_available One week during the summer.
not_available No.
not_available We're only asking for 38 days a year.
not_available 31 days.
not_available I said, no.
not_available Peter, it's only 31 days.
not_available I'm not doing this.
not_available Peter, listen to me.
not_available No.
not_available You listen to me, all of you.
not_available I'm not negotiating over my son.
not_available Rather take your chances with the judge? A martini in first class works just as well and takes less time.
not_available Like you, I enjoy the occasional drive.
not_available Gives you time to clear your head.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available John.
not_available Did you know your father's been here since last night? Late last night.
not_available He went straight to the hotel.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Am I dying? 
not_available Rigor mortis hasn't set in just yet.
not_available Why else would my son deign to spend Christmas with us? Mom's coming too.
not_available I knew there was a catch.
not_available Eleanor will be here later this week.
not_available You'll stay at the house until then? Sure, why not.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Here's Helga to turn me like a pancake.
not_available We'll give you some privacy.
not_available I'd settle for a little dignity.
not_available Believe it or not, she's thrilled.
not_available This means the world to her.
not_available This year more than most.
not_available Well, I suppose.
not_available Means a lot to me too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It should be fun, huh? Reece, I have to make a decision.
not_available I need you to help me by answering some questions.
not_available Can you do that? Who's that? Daddy.
not_available And who's that? My other daddy.
not_available You love both your daddies very much, right? He says he doesn't know.
not_available When you are sick, who makes you feel better? Mommy.
not_available Which daddy gives you the best care when you get a booboo? He has Band
not_available Aids with cartoons.
not_available Right now, I'd say he needs consistency.
not_available Reece, Carla and I.
not_available The three of us were a family.
not_available That's how we planned our lives.
not_available That's how we approached every day, every week.
not_available I've been with Reece through earaches flus, almost every scrape he's ever gotten.
not_available If you count the hours that I've spent with my stepson it far exceeds the time Dr.
not_available Benton has spent with the child he believed to be his.
not_available Reece and Carla were my life.
not_available And now Reece is my life.
not_available He comes first.
not_available Ahead of my personal needs, ahead of my job.
not_available And I think that's in his best interest.
not_available Oh, John.
not_available Diverse selection.
not_available Burgers are good.
not_available You already know what you want? I'm still working on what to drink.
not_available This is nice.
not_available Haven't done this for a while.
not_available Had lunch together? Or Christmas? Both.
not_available So What kind of business keeps Mom in Costa Rica in December? How's the chopped salad? She broke her hip, Dad.
not_available Mom can't spend five minutes with her? Is she gonna avoid her for the whole month? Your mother's not coming.
not_available John, we're getting divorced.
not_available What? Divorced? 
not_available It's amicable.
not_available After 30 years? What happened? This probably isn't the bestIs there somebody else? 
not_available Neither of us is running off with anyone.
not_available What is it, she's not happy? She's bored? Wants to stay in Europe? I'm the one who's leaving, John.
not_available This can't surprise you.
not_available You saw it before I did.
not_available Can I take your order? 
not_available I was suffocating.
not_available I think we're ready.
not_available Chopped salad, please.
not_available Burger medium
not_available rare, please.
not_available I agree with Mr.
not_available McGrath that consistency is the best thing for Reece right now.
not_available See, I I let Carla take on a lot of the parenting while I pursued my career.
not_available But I did that because it felt right to leave Reece in his mother's care.
not_available But all that's changed now.
not_available And my responsibilities have changed too.
not_available Because of that I've made arrangements to work fewer hours so I can become Reece's full
not_available time caretaker.
not_available At County General? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What sort of hour reduction are we talking about? weekends off.
not_available You can provide proof of this new schedule? Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available Have it in my office by day's end.
not_available Unless there is anything else, court's adjourned.
not_available I need to talk to him now.
not_available Well, pull him out.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let him know I'm on my way.
not_available Going back to work? 
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Got another shift? 
not_available Roger, get out of my way! Where's Reece? Let me 
guess Jackie.
not_available No, Cleo.
not_available A nanny? You want me to hit your car? 
not_available You lied, man.
not_available On top of everything else, you're a liar.
not_available And a perjurer.
not_available You know what? You need to back off.
not_available Whatever it takes, is that it? He's not a trophy, man! You can't win at any cost to give your sister a son! You gotta raise him! You know
not_available Go ahead, get in my face.
not_available Come on.
not_available Roger, you need to shut your mouth.
not_available Think, Peter.
not_available You can't change who you are.
not_available I'm sure it was on this block.
not_available It's called Nazim.
not_available It's got a blue awning.
not_available Well, I don't see it.
not_available We must have missed it.
not_available I don't like Indian food anyway.
not_available Why didn't you say something? 
not_available I just did.
not_available Why don't we go to that Italian place 
not_available across the street.
not_available Great risotto.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available That'd be great if it weren't closed.
not_available You're a pain in the ass, you know that? 
not_available Well, some say.
not_available I'm starting to regret this whole thing.
not_available Too bad.
not_available I'm starving.
not_available Forget about looking for a decent place.
not_available Why don't we go home and order in.
not_available I like a take
not_available charge kind of girl.
not_available My apartment? 
not_available Lead the way.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available You hear something? 
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available That's a doctor who breaks promises then hangs up on the guy he breaks the promises with.
not_available I need to talk to you now.
not_available Talk is cheap, Peter.
not_available I need to scale back my hours and I need it in writing.
not_available "To whom it may 
concern No way." 
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Is this about your kid? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What do you need? Every other Saturday? No nights.
not_available No weekends.
not_available Good one.
not_available I like the one about the rabbi and the goldfish.
not_available I need to spend more time at home.
not_available Never needed to before.
not_available His mother died.
not_available His stepfather is still alive.
not_available Split custody, keep doing what you do best.
not_available I'm not asking for your advice.
not_available News flash! This is an urban trauma center.
not_available Until people plan their MVAs and GSWs better, you won't punch a time clock.
not_available That's not me being a hard
not_available ass, that's the job.
not_available You are a surgeon.
not_available Are you gonna do this for me or not? 
not_available Not.
not_available Work when I need you or not at all.
not_available Then consider this my resignation.
not_available All right, all right, all right.
not_available Don't go getting dramatic.
not_available Weekends off.
not_available And what about weekdays? It's my best offer, Peter.
not_available Take it or leave it.

not_available How far along was she? 
not_available Eight weeks.
not_available No complications.
not_available She's in Recovery for a few more hours.

not_available I'm not sure she's here.
not_available Let me check.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I need to meet the Surgicenter director.
not_available You gave him my CV, right? Yeah, but
not_available I quit County.
not_available Romano wouldn't give you the hours? You said there's a position here.
not_available I want it.
not_available I'll introduce you tomorrow.
not_available I gotta show proof of employment now.

not_available I don't understand.
not_available You don't need to.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available No, you were right.
not_available He did everything he could.
not_available I thought his kindness was love.

not_available After that? 
not_available After that, he sees patients until 5.
not_available How about Thursday? 
not_available Thursday might work, actually.
not_available Judge Alter! Judge Alter! I got that employment letter for you.
not_available I wanted this yesterday.
not_available I know.
not_available It came in after
not_available hours.
not_available This is not your hospital.
not_available No.
not_available Schaumburg Surgicenter? 
not_available I worked out a better situation there than if I had stayed at County.
not_available All in the last 12 hours? 
not_available It was always a possibility.
not_available It just needed to be ironed out.
not_available You didn't mention it yesterday.
not_available I know.
not_available I said I'd cut back my hours and I did.
not_available True.
not_available I'm now working 8 to 5, no weekends.
not_available This letter confirms it.
not_available That may be so.
not_available But you told a different story yesterday.
not_available And I don't like being lied to.

not_available Before you go? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available End of the week, I'm out of here.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah, I had to quit.
not_available You're not serious.
not_available I need to change my life.
not_available Romano won't cut me any slack.
not_available Yeah, but I'm sure he'll make some accommodation.
not_available No.
not_available I asked.
not_available He won't.
not_available You'd really leave County? I gotta go.

not_available That's not necessary.
not_available Someone'll match.
not_available We don't transplant spleens.

not_available I mean, I didn't forget.
not_available It's at home, yours.
not_available I don't know where my head is at, though.
not_available Do you wanna open it anyway? Can we wait? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Is something wrong? 
not_available I'm having family problems.
not_available Your grandma? No, no.
not_available It's my mother.
not_available She's not coming home for the holidays.
not_available She and my father are splitting up.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I don't think it's sunk in yet.
not_available Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
not_available How do you figure? Did you ever meet my parents? 
not_available I met Cookie.
not_available Right.
not_available She and Henry aren't divorced, and they should be.
not_available Still, I'm sorry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm so self
not_available centered.
not_available I thought it was something to do with me.
not_available No.
not_available You're about the only thing going right in my life.
not_available You shouldn't let this happen.
not_available Didn't want to be defensive.

not_available There you are.
not_available Thank you for all rushing over.
not_available Be seated.
not_available We are in a unique situation.
not_available In a traditional custody case, win or lose the parents maintain the title given to them by their biology.
not_available They're still Mommy and Daddy.
not_available Here I'm asked to declare that one of these two men is not, in fact, Daddy.
not_available But they both love Reece and have made sacrifices to be with him though I will say Dr.
not_available Benton's effort was late in the game.
not_available And I am uncomfortable about the way he handled it.
not_available Not convinced he was exactly forthright with the court.
not_available But the fact is that I do believe Reece would thrive in either of your households.
not_available And that makes my decision even harder.
not_available But based on the evidence provided by Dr.
not_available Benton that he will be more available as a parent in the future and the fact that Reece has always believed him to be his father the court grants custody to Peter Benton.
not_available Mr.
not_available McGrath will be given visitation with Reece every other Saturday.
not_available The court calls a 20
not_available minute recess.
not_available We might have to go get one.

not_available This whole thing has made me focus.
not_available It's like all my life I've been chasing something.
not_available That time when I can make it into the end zone and spike the ball.
not_available It took almost losing my son to realize the end zone's not out there.
not_available It's right here.
not_available You're good raw material.
