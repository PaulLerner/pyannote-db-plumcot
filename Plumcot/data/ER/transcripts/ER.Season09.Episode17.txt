
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I've scheduled a meeting with Dr.
not_available Meyers.
not_available It's mandatory.
not_available That was my great
not_available grandmother's.
not_available Youre going to propose? That's it? You bought out this whole place just for that? I found a sore on his penis.
not_available I think it's syphilis.
not_available Any way we can keep it out of my medical record? No! That is not the point! You might save 2.4 up front but you're gonna lose 20,000 primary care visits a year
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available For a potential loss of over $10 million.
not_available We have to make tough choices.
not_available You're shortsighted now! Is there a motion to vote? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm not finished.
not_available I think we understand the issue.
not_available Lack of primary care leaves thousands
not_available And your argument.
not_available These are human beings, not statistics.
not_available And we are abandoning an entire community
not_available We get it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now is there a motion to vote in open session? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Chairman
not_available Motion.
not_available Second.
not_available All right.
not_available All those in favor of closing the Erie Street Clinic.
not_available Those opposed to the closing.
not_available The nays have it.
not_available Fifteen
not_available minute recess.
not_available Nice work, Kerry.
not_available Is it always this close? 
not_available You have the gift of persuasion.
not_available Well, pugnacity is more like it.
not_available And an understanding of what motivates people.
not_available That's the secret to a good politician.
not_available I'm out of my league there.
not_available Nonsense.
not_available It wouldn't surprise me if you were Surgeon General someday.
not_available Kristy.
not_available Meet the future Surgeon General and savior of the Erie Street Clinic.
not_available Hello, doctor.
not_available He's kidding.
not_available He never kids.
not_available Kerry, you have another minute? Sure.
not_available Parks and Recs has been pushed to 11:00.
not_available And Bamberger called about the gay
not_available marriage amendment.
not_available Tell him I'm sympathetic but it will never pass, and I'm not gonna torpedo the bill.
not_available Maybe we should get you on that one.
not_available Might actually stand a chance.
not_available What do you mean? Youre a problem
not_available solver, Kerry.
not_available A pragmatist.
not_available I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's why I hate to implore you for another personal favor.
not_available But, well I frankly don't know what else to do.
not_available You were very considerate in treating my offthe
not_available record condition.
not_available Did the lesion not heal? No, it did.
not_available But I'm in a relationship with someone, someone that works for me.
not_available I'm single.
not_available Were in love.
not_available But workplace affairs are Well, I don't need the attention.
not_available And she's symptomatic.
not_available I was hoping you could provide treatment with the same level of discretion.
not_available Send her to any free clinic.
not_available Theyre all confidential.
not_available It's a simple shot of penicillin, right? Treatment without generating a medical record is malpractice.
not_available But you've done it before.
not_available And I shouldn't have.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I think I understand.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I mean, you know, I could lose my license.
not_available Don't be sorry.
not_available Youre a woman of principle.
not_available How can I not respect that? Forget I asked.
not_available And congratulations again.
not_available You did some real good today, Kerry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Of course, there are no guarantees for next year's budget at your hospital.
not_available What? There's an afternoon vote on eliminating emergency services.
not_available At County General? You mean closing the ER.
not_available I need you, Kerry.
not_available Is your jalopy still in the shop? 
not_available It's a Jeep.
not_available Oh, a Jeep.
not_available Jalopy.
not_available You hardly touched your breakfast.
not_available I don't like to eat much before a shift.
not_available All that blood and guts, you know? Don't remind me.
not_available I had a feeling there was some agenda this morning, you've been very mysterious.
not_available I just wanted to check in, see how you were.
not_available And I wanted to give this back to you for the time being.
not_available She said no? 
not_available I didn't ask.
not_available Did something happen? 
not_available No.
not_available It just felt kind of rushed.
not_available What did she do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Doesn't even know.
not_available I don't think she knows.
not_available Maybe she knows.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm sorry, John.
not_available I thought you'd be relieved.
not_available That youre unhappy? I got the impression that you never really cared for her.
not_available I've spent so many years trying to get you to do what I think is best for you.
not_available Youre passed having me badger you about your choices.
not_available This is yours.
not_available Give it, or don't, to whomever you choose.
not_available Why? 
not_available Well, I'm thinking emergency medicine.
not_available Here? 
not_available Better than Iraq.
not_available Hey, that is not it.
not_available Don't you still owe four years? I can roll the time to after my residency.
not_available Afraid to fight, all right.
not_available Hey, any time, any place, old man.
not_available I can smell fear a mile away.
not_available Answer the phone, Frank.
not_available The holiday's called "St.
not_available Patrick's Day, not "St.
not_available Patrick's Week. You got something against the Irish? The giant shamrock in Triage started drinking 72 hours ago.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Frank.
not_available She'll be back in a few minutes.
not_available Have a seat over there.
not_available They always ask me.
not_available Do I look like customer service? 
not_available He's cute.
not_available He's a zygote.
not_available Anymore blind dates? 
not_available Never again.
not_available But were going to Las Vegas tonight.
not_available Who's we? 
not_available Me and Chen.
not_available And 50 other County employees.
not_available So how's it going with you? I have a rule
not_available out MI waiting on his second troponin.
not_available No, I meant in general.
not_available Any news? 
not_available No.
not_available Did you need that? Oh, I thought it was a different patient.
not_available So how are you and Carter? 
not_available Good, I guess.
not_available Kind of.
not_available He's been acting a little weird.
not_available It's been rough for both of you lately.
not_available I think were getting back to normal.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, he's seizing again.
not_available Another four of lorazepam, and load a gram of Dilantin.
not_available Abby, clear a CT on this one.
not_available Blown pupil? 
not_available Subconj hemorrhage.
not_available No ID? 
not_available Too young for a license.
not_available No purse.
not_available This the assault? 
not_available LOC in Union Station.
not_available Probably a street kid.
not_available With those boots? 
not_available Expensive jacket too.
not_available Maybe she shoplifts.
not_available She come in with that girl? 
not_available No.
not_available Different run.
not_available Chest is clear.
not_available Belly's soft.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Isolated head and facial trauma.
not_available What happened? Let's get a C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? You got this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Trauma panel, urine ICON, dip a UA.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Three times.
not_available Three missed appointments.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have a bad memory.
not_available Your department required psychotherapy.
not_available I don't wanna be a heavy.
not_available I wanna help.
not_available Prepare for disappointment.
not_available I have extended hours tonight.
not_available I'm free from 7 to 8.
not_available Can you make that? 
not_available I really don't see the point.
not_available You don't have to see it.
not_available Just show up.
not_available Just show up.
not_available That's all I've been doing.
not_available Showing up.
not_available Time goes by faster at work.
not_available Shift work.
not_available Treat and street a few lost souls.
not_available Youre with them when they are most vulnerable.
not_available Is that bile? That's 17 Jell
not_available O shots.
not_available When they're naked, weak, hurt you touch them look at their bodies see them more closely than their families, their lovers.
not_available But it's mechanical, you know, temporary.
not_available You fix them up, or you watch them die.
not_available Either way, it ends, and you move on.
not_available No next time, no strings.
not_available No real connection.
not_available Maybe that's why I stay.
not_available You waiting on an incoming? What? Did you sign out for an incoming? 
not_available Coffee.
not_available Cigarette break? You want some? What? 
not_available Coffee? No, thanks.
not_available Not turning into a health nut on me.
not_available No.
not_available Waiting for an old lady that fell off her treadmill.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you remember what happened? Can I call your parents? I don't live at home.
not_available Where do you live? Molly, I can't help you unless you talk to me.
not_available They call it a boot camp for kids who can't get along with their parents.
not_available So they discipline you? Does this look like discipline? A camp counselor did this to you? Yeah.
not_available I heard they raped a girl.
not_available Okay.
not_available Haleh, perhaps Molly should be speaking with a police officer.
not_available I'm sure your mother would like to know that you' re safe.
not_available Who do you think sent me there in the first place? Any family? 
not_available She said she has a husband, Charles.
not_available What else did I say about him? 
not_available That he's useless.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Forget him.
not_available It's a stolen card.
not_available How am I supposed to know her mother's maiden name? Why are you boarding four ICU players and eight med
not_available surg admissions? Susan's driving.
not_available Talk to her.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? Keith Mitchell.
not_available I have an appointment.
not_available We don't make appointments in the ER.
not_available Report your complaint to the Triage nurse.
not_available I believe special arrangements were made by Alderman Bright? Jonathan has nothing but wonderful things to say about you.
not_available How long have you been in his office? I started junior year, spring quarter, so about two years.
not_available Now I get gradschool credit and onthe
not_available job training.
not_available He's a great mentor.
not_available Very generous with his time.
not_available This goes in the buttocks.
not_available I'm surprised that you waited so long to be treated.
not_available I didn't notice the sore.
not_available Jonathan did.
not_available When? 
not_available Two nights ago.
not_available I was so embarrassed.
not_available I just hoped I didn't give it to him.
not_available He didn't have it? 
not_available No.
not_available I was pretty crazy in my college days.
not_available We' re monogamous now.
not_available I have to say, he was really cool about it.
not_available Most people wouldn't be so understanding.
not_available All done.
not_available We all have our past, right? I told you not to work out so much.
not_available So I can sit and watch the soaps all day? Any other symptoms, Mrs.
not_available Sanbery? Yes.
not_available My hair's falling out.
not_available But I blame that on him.
not_available She's just kidding.
not_available The hell I am! Did you check the fingernails? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm getting to that.
not_available What? 
not_available These marks, these lines.
not_available What marks? 
not_available These are Mees' lines.
not_available What kind of work did you do? Supervisor at a wood
not_available processing plant.
not_available Did they use arsenic? 
not_available Tested us for it all the time.
not_available Can't be it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get Mrs.
not_available Sanbery's blood and urine reports from OSHA.
not_available I will be right back.
not_available Take him with you.
not_available Ruthie, just relax, please.
not_available Wonders of marital bliss.
not_available Who's worse? Her for being such a pain, or him for being so pathetic.
not_available It cuts both ways, I guess.
not_available My bike
not_available girl trauma may have a diminished foot pulse.
not_available Check Doppler.
not_available I'll be there in a minute.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Banks.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I'm the surgeon treating your daughter.
not_available She'll need surgery? 
not_available No, no.
not_available I'm surprised the camp actually called you.
not_available Why wouldn't they? Well, they assaulted your daughter.
not_available Is that what she told you? She ran off on the second day.
not_available They didn't touch her.
not_available Somebody did.
not_available With Molly there's all kinds of explanations.
not_available What makes you certain it's not the camp? 
not_available Because she says it is.
not_available Trashing my house with a baseball bat.
not_available Shoplifting, drinking, drug use, unwanted pregnancy.
not_available Do I need to go on? I need to call my office.
not_available Maybe you can talk to her when you' re finished.
not_available I haven't been able to talk to her in three years.
not_available They actually threw you across the room? In a bar fight, not a tossing.
not_available Big difference.
not_available Congratulations, Kerry.
not_available Whatever you' re doing down at City Hall seems to be working.
not_available Well, it was a close vote.
not_available But without a single cut.
not_available What? 
not_available The hospital budget.
not_available We were vulnerable to a 20
not_available percent cut, it sailed through less than an hour ago.
not_available They say he drove out the snakes.
not_available Who? 
not_available St.
not_available Patrick.
not_available Well, I'd like to see you and Robert in my office at 5.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available Just a little administrative housekeeping.
not_available We should burn through it quickly.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, Dr.
not_available Lewis needs you.
not_available What kid? 
not_available That kid.
not_available He was looking for you, waiting in Chairs.
not_available Paramedic brought him in.
not_available Stand by with an epi drip.
not_available Hey, Kerry.
not_available Do you know this kid? 
not_available What happened? Passed out across the street.
not_available Tight wheezes and hives.
not_available Barely any breath sounds.
not_available You don't happen to know if he has any food allergies, do you? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available He was looking for you.
not_available Sats are dropping, 93.
not_available Pulse, 120.
not_available Cords are too edematous.
not_available Prep a crike tray.
not_available Fiberoptic with a 7
not_available 0 tube.
not_available Okay, one more look.
not_available Wasting time.
not_available You need to let the drugs work.
not_available He needs intubation.
not_available You do know him? 
not_available He could be allergic to anything an insect bite, or have a carcinoid.
not_available He's got an ID from City Hall.
not_available Okay, do a jaw thrust and keep a good seal when you bag him.
not_available You know, I did get some papers from Health and Human Services this morning.
not_available Maybe he dropped them off.
not_available Okay, suction and light source on high.
not_available Let's go.
not_available This is an emergency.
not_available You tell him that one of his staffers is in the ER with a severe allergic reaction.
not_available Tell him to call me as soon as he can.
not_available You were right.
not_available He does work at City Hall.
not_available Alderman Bright's office? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How did you know? Well, there's no insect bite, but there's a chancre on his penis.
not_available Kerry? 
not_available That's a bit of a leap, don't you think? The alderman left here with untreated syphilis.
not_available We don't know that it was untreated.
not_available Now one of his staffers comes in
not_available We don't know if the alderman is in the habit of sexual harassment, much less gay.
not_available The kid is in anaphylactic shock.
not_available Either it's a food allergy or a drug.
not_available My guess is penicillin.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available It could be idiopathic histamine release or vasculitis.
not_available He's triggering the vent.
not_available Any spontaneous eye opening? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Call Immunology for skin testing.
not_available Have them include penicillin.
not_available Get me as soon as he wakes up.
not_available What's his FlO2? 
not_available Fifty percent.
not_available Sounds like upper
not_available airway secretions.
not_available I think he's just a little wheezy.
not_available Why don't you get a suction catheter.
not_available He may have a mucous plug we need to clear out.
not_available He's satting at 98 percent
not_available I wanna optimize his oxygenation.
not_available Get it.
not_available Keith? Keith? Can you hear me? Keith? Keith, there's a tube in your throat to help you breathe.
not_available You had a severe allergic reaction, probably to the penicillin.
not_available But everything is okay now, all right? We'll take out the tube soon.
not_available You'll be able to speak.
not_available And the other doctors will have some questions for you.
not_available They've examined you.
not_available So they know you have syphilis.
not_available And they'll be able to determine an allergy to penicillin.
not_available But Jonathan cannot have sent you here to me.
not_available You know what that means.
not_available We have to protect him.
not_available We can't give anyone reason to speculate or they might even target Jonathan as the source of the infection.
not_available Listen carefully, Keith.
not_available People have been known to borrow prescriptions from friends without ever seeing a doctor.
not_available They think they know what they have and how to treat it so they take care of it on their own.
not_available Do you understand? Good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, dealership called.
not_available You need brake pads.
not_available It'll be ready at 5.
not_available Can you get rabies from fish? 
not_available No.
not_available You' re sure? 
not_available I'm pretty sure.
not_available What do you make of this? Pike bit me when I was getting it off the line.
not_available Looks infected.
not_available That's it? Call me if you start growing gills.
not_available Doctor, OSHA results.
not_available The arsenic levels in Mrs.
not_available Sanbery's urine for the past three years have been undetectable.
not_available And today's results? 
not_available Over 200 mics per liter.
not_available Maybe she got down about being home.
not_available Suicide attempt? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Happens to some retirees.
not_available Either that or her husband's trying to kill her.
not_available Well, find out if she's been depressed.
not_available Take it from there.
not_available What's that? 
not_available What? On your back.
not_available It's the patch.
not_available For birth control? No, for smoking.
not_available You quit smoking? 
not_available Four days ago, yes.
not_available Thanks for noticing.
not_available Thanks for sharing.
not_available Last week, I had to bring a throat
not_available cancer patient outside so she could smoke through her trach hole.
not_available And I decided this has gotta stop.
not_available Really? There's some bronchospasm.
not_available Add a unit dose of Atrovent to his next treatment.
not_available I think he's waking up.
not_available Should I call Lewis? 
not_available He's her patient.
not_available Get her out! Get her out of here! 
not_available Lie back! You'll hurt yourself.
not_available I don't wanna see her! I told you not to call her! Get out! 
not_available You need to talk to her.
not_available About locking me up again? About getting me raped? How about Haldol? She never listens to me! She doesn't care about me! You said we were going camping, you lying slut! 
not_available Okay.
not_available Two of Ativan.
not_available Make it four.
not_available I could use a good buzz! Now, you listen to me! I want you to settle down right now! 
not_available Get her out of here.
not_available I'll ask your mother to leave if you stop struggling.
not_available I put you in that program because I care about you.
not_available Liar! 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, hard restraints! Oh, God Liar! Where's the Ativan? 
not_available Liar! Liar! From the time she was 2, she's been acting like this.
not_available I thought she would get over it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come in here.
not_available And keep pressure on that.
not_available I know.
not_available They shocked four times for V
not_available fib.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Asystole.
not_available Hate crime.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Gray matter and brainstem failure.
not_available Call it.
not_available Time of 
death 1343.
not_available Some jerk shot him because he wouldn't get off the bus.
not_available Said it was only for Americans.
not_available Morales is en route with the shooter.
not_available Okay, Keith, we have a breathing treatment for you to work on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Deep breaths in and out.
not_available Pulse 
ox 99.
not_available Good.
not_available You had an allergic reaction to something.
not_available Is there anything you've eaten that you know you' re allergic to? Any new medications? 
not_available Penicillin.
not_available Why are you taking penicillin? Syphilis.
not_available My ex
not_available girlfriend told me she had an outbreak and I'd better take care of it.
not_available Did you know you' re allergic to it? 
not_available No.
not_available Did the doctor who gave it to you ask? I didn't see the doctor.
not_available My ex told me they gave it to her.
not_available I had a friend who had some leftover from a strep throat.
not_available We' re still waiting for a Russian translator.
not_available When they cry, the eardrum turns red, and you can't rule out an infection.
not_available Kovac, Eye Trauma Girl's losing visual acuity.
not_available She may need decompression.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, I was wondering if you'd write a letter of recommendation for my file.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available What? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Did you give him the message? Luka, wait.
not_available Corday needs some help.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Tell him that I really need to talk to him.
not_available It's important.
not_available Well, you have him call me back.
not_available You' re blowing off your therapy? 
not_available No.
not_available We had an agreement.
not_available I never agreed to it.
not_available Well, you came back here, didn't you? I told you it was mandatory, didn't I? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Luka, I

not_available She hates me.
not_available That's not what I saw.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I hate her too.
not_available What I saw was a scared little girl crying for her mother.

not_available I'm good at what I do.
not_available I have certain skills, certain abilities.
not_available They came naturally to me.
not_available Perfect fit.
not_available Can you see anything? It's not about seeing.
not_available Others would struggle to get through the day, and I wanted more.
not_available I might have something.
not_available More urgency, more purpose.
not_available Sats are coming up.
not_available Medicine was exciting, powerful alive.
not_available Today, we saved a teenager's sight.

not_available Was he stopping at the ER? 
not_available They said he was coming straight up.

not_available I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
not_available For what? I got tied up with a parathyroidectomy.
not_available Is Robert here?

not_available Right.
not_available Just give me a minute.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Been trying to reach you.
not_available I was stuck at an EPA site.
not_available I've been calling and paging.
not_available Calm down.
not_available This is why we have records and notes.
not_available This is why we take a history before we administer drugs.
not_available Privately, please.
not_available You know that he died? Keith died.
not_available Went into anaphylactic shock, and his airway closed.
not_available Alderman, what brings you here? I'm checking on a staff member.
not_available Congratulations on the budget.
not_available First year they haven't tried to close us.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver did an excellent job of articulating your needs.
not_available She's our own little articulator.
not_available Where are you going? Don't we have this meeting? 
not_available Give me a second.
not_available You okay? 
not_available More trouble with the arm? Not worse than getting it severed in the first place.
not_available I'm glad to hear it.
not_available Stay well.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You too.
not_available His airway closed, but they had to bag him anyway which caused his stomach to over
not_available inflate and tear.
not_available In here.
not_available But they intubated him anyway, and that over
not_available inflated his stomach.
not_available Slow down.
not_available Slow down.
not_available I thought he was getting a shot of penicillin.
not_available He got one! That's what caused the anaphylaxis! 
not_available Things like this happen in medicine.
not_available My God! What did I do? I didn't ask him if he was allergic.
not_available We always ask.
not_available We always have a chart.
not_available The chart reminds us we' re treating the patient correctly.
not_available Yes, you could've asked.
not_available It wouldn't have prevented it.
not_available I could've given him something else, or better yet, nothing.
not_available I told him it would be a shot of penicillin even before I approached you.
not_available He didn't tell me he was allergic.
not_available He didn't know.
not_available This would've happened, anyway, however he got treated.
not_available They' re waiting for you in the conference.
not_available Anspaugh needs to scrub in.
not_available Have them start without me.
not_available All right.
not_available There's already no record of the shot.
not_available It's too late for that.
not_available We can tell the truth.
not_available No one else knows? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Keith didn't say anything about me? 
not_available For God's sake.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available He's dead.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available He's dead.
not_available It hurts me more than you know.
not_available That's crap.
not_available You let that poor kid believe he gave you the syphilis.
not_available Don't tell me I don't care! I care.
not_available I care.
not_available But I do need to know what people know.
not_available Self
not_available servingly, yes, I have to protect myself.
not_available But I also have to protect you and this hospital and other county programs
not_available What about protecting your staff? What about protecting your lover? Kerry, this is not your fault.
not_available You understand? It's not your fault.
not_available But if you confess to something like it was people will treat you like it was.
not_available And then everybody loses.
not_available Did he say anything about me? Don't worry.
not_available He lied for you.
not_available He loved you.
not_available They' re starting.
not_available And I killed him trying to hide that for you.
not_available You won't wanna be late for that meeting.
not_available But I will need you later for a press conference.
not_available He was one of my staff.
not_available Goodbye, Jonathan.
not_available Congratulations, Kerry.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I never let rehab compromise my work schedule.
not_available We both know administration is not your strong suit.
not_available Should I come back later? 
not_available No, Kerry.
not_available This involves you.
not_available How long you been planning this? I've asked Robert to consider sharing the chief of staff position with you.
not_available I'd rather cut off my good arm.
not_available I'm sorry you feel that way.
not_available I thought this solution served everyone.
not_available Well, you were wrong.
not_available It's a gift, Robert.
not_available I suggest you take it.
not_available Take it right up the ass.
not_available Fine.
not_available Congratulations, Kerry.
not_available You've just become chief of staff.
not_available Good cap refill.
not_available No disruption of the vasculature.
not_available No.
not_available There wouldn't be with a mechanism of injury.
not_available What's next? I could cut it while slicing a bagel and not realize it till I pass out from blood loss.
not_available Robert.
not_available Maybe I could set the damn thing on fire.
not_available You need to be patient.
not_available Yes.
not_available So everyone keeps telling me.
not_available Although none of us actually believe I'm even going to partially recover.
not_available Do we? You believe in the laws of karma, Elizabeth? Eastern philosophy, the influence of past actions on your future life.
not_available I know what it is.
not_available So I can be a jerk.
not_available So what? I've always been honest.
not_available Brutally honest.
not_available Bruised some egos, hurt some feelings.
not_available Maybe provoked a few tears.
not_available But honesty's a hell of a lot more than most people can claim.
not_available I don't deserve this.
not_available Hey, what time's your thing? She's probably waiting for me right now.
not_available Did you get your car fixed? Yeah.
not_available One of these days, I'm gonna get one that works.
not_available So You know, right? Know what? 
not_available That night at the restaurant I had a ring.
not_available You knew that, right? I figured if you wanted to talk about it, you would've.
not_available I didn't go through with it because in that moment it just felt It didn't feel right.
not_available And I don't know why.
not_available And I wish I did know why.
not_available I think the fact that I didn't do it means that maybe something isn't working.
not_available I get it.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available You get it? That's good.
not_available Maybe you can explain it to me because I don't get it.
not_available I know I show up for work, and you act like a completely changed person.
not_available And I think that's great if that's real.
not_available The patch, the sponsorReal? 
not_available For real, for you.
not_available Or is this gonna get thrown out next time something happens? If you' re trying to prove something toWhat? 
not_available Like some kind of quick fix.
not_available I didn't do it for you! I woke up sick of myself, okay.
not_available And if you' re sick of me and just all of it, I don't blame you.
not_available I'm not sick of you.
not_available How do you hear that? All I do is disappoint you.
not_available I feel like all I'll ever do is disappoint you.
not_available I've said this before.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop! Stop with this fatalistic, blackcloud, nothinggoodisevergonna
not_available happen routine.
not_available It's not a routine.
not_available Hey! What do I have to say? What do I have to do to get through to you? 
not_available She needs a stable environment.
not_available She's the one that's unstable! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wonder why.
not_available Luka.
not_available She's your daughter.
not_available I've got this now.
not_available Do you even give a damn? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Does he think that this is the first time I've ever had to make this kind of decision with Molly? I wish to God it was, but it's not.
not_available What if she wants to come home? Now she's scared.
not_available She got hurt.
not_available But what happens when we get there, and it starts all over again? 
not_available You'll try harder.
not_available I have! A thousand times.
not_available Maybe I am a bad mother, but I can't do it anymore.
not_available Enjoy her when she's this age.
not_available She's not old enough to hate you.
not_available I was
not_available I was trying to calm the baby.
not_available You know, with the glove, the balloon.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Yeah, but he could've died.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But he didn't.
not_available You're one of the best medical students that's come through here in a long time.
not_available The place will be lucky to have you.
not_available A letter from me wouldn't mean much.
not_available They only tolerate me know I can burn through a shift.
not_available Tomorrow, I'll get up and do it again.
not_available Have you thought about taking time off? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe moving home.
not_available I don't know.
not_available There's a cartoon I once saw in a magazine.
not_available A little man is sitting in a room with two doors.
not_available One door says, " Do not enter.
not_available " And the other door says, " Do not exit.
not_available " So he just sits there holding his hat.
not_available We only have 15 minutes left.
not_available Did you wanna keep talking? Or do you wanna get to it? One dispo, two admits, and I am out of here.
not_available Are you ready? Yeah.
not_available But I wasn't gonna change.
not_available Hey, this way I go straight to the casino.
not_available You can sing backup for Tony Orlando.
not_available Who? 
not_available Never mind.
not_available I'll meet you outside.
not_available Okay, I'll get a cab.
not_available Excuse me, miss.
not_available Can you tell me how to get to the cafeteria? I'm sorry.
not_available I don't work here.
not_available All of us at City Hall are saddened by the loss of Keith Mitchell.
not_available He was a bright and vibrant young man who had a promising future in public service.
not_available He devoted himself to bring dignity and opportunity to the underserved members of our community.
not_available Even though his death was sudden, unexpected and heartbreaking his spirit will live on through his contributions to social programs and through the thousands of lives he touched.
not_available Our thoughts and prayers go out to Keith's family to his many friends and to all those affected by this unavoidable tragedy.
