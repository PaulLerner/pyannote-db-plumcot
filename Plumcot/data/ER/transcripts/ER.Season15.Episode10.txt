not_available Oh, welcome back.
not_available How's Alex doing?.
not_available He's still sedated, you know.
not_available We tried to extubate him this morning, but.
not_available He'll be off the vent soon.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available I thought he would be talking by now but he was hypotensive for so long, you know what if he has brain damage?.
not_available Or what if he just never gets off the vent?.
not_available It's.
not_available Look, Sam, if you need to take a little more time.
not_available No, no.
not_available I really should keep busy.
not_available You know, I can't keep sitting there staring at Alex's monitors.
not_available Thank you for the offer.
not_available Come on, let's get some coffee first.
NEELA Chest is clear.
not_available How are you feeling, Gloria?.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you reach my husband?.
not_available He's on his way.
not_available He doesn't have to come.
not_available I can call him later.
not_available Cap refill's good.
not_available You know, he's probably worried about you.
not_available How long have you two been together?.
not_available We met at the aquarium.
not_available I was 1 5.
NEELA Wow.
not_available I can't imagine being married to my high
not_available school boyfriend.
not_available We were both new to America.
not_available How's the crit?.
not_available Stable at 39.
not_available So everyone going to the Christmas party?.
not_available Not a chance.
not_available Yeah, but Surgery's hosting it this year, you have to go.
not_available Belly's benign.
not_available Archie pinched my butt last year 
not_available and Frank nearly threw up on me.
not_available That sounds like fun.
not_available Can't imagine why anyone would wanna miss that.
not_available Fetal heart rate's at 1 45.
not_available You're not into the party?.
not_available A work party?.
not_available At work?.
not_available Y eah, no thanks.

not_available Okay, they're three minutes apart now.
not_available Breathe, Gloria, breathe.
not_available Okay?.
NEELA She's on mag?.
not_available Yeah, but it's not doing much.
not_available OB can take it from here.
not_available She's clear surgically.
not_available All right, Coburn's on her way.
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available Ortiz' husband.
not_available ls the baby okay?.
not_available We're just checking to make sure.
not_available Do you know if it's a girl or a boy, Mrs.
not_available Ortiz?.
not_available At my last ultrasound, it was too soon to tell.
not_available What are we looking at?.
not_available Something wrong?.
not_available ls that a twin, maybe?.
not_available I'm not sure.
GATES Getting back to work will probably be good for you.
not_available A little distraction.
SAM Y eah, I could use the money.
not_available Oh, excuse me.
not_available Hey, excuse me, sir?.
not_available Your kids need to be buckled up.
not_available Sorry, what?.
not_available Your kids need to be wearing seat belts.
not_available Okay, lady, whatever you say.
not_available Just saying it's better if the kids had their seat belts on.
not_available It's the law, it's common sense.
not_available Who the hell asked you?.
not_available She's saying it'd be better 
not_available if the kids were buckled up.
not_available Screw off.
not_available Hey, watch it, all right?.
not_available How are you gonna feel, huh?.
not_available If one of your kids comes through that windshield and ends up in ER with brains coming out of his skull.
not_available You're an idiot.

not_available Get out of the way.
not_available that keep our hospital from shutting down, so thank your very much.

not_available How long do I have to wait for my refills?.
MORRlS Uh, check with Dr.
not_available Sanchez.
not_available I did.
not_available He said something about spiders and wandered away.
not_available lf I see him, I will send him your way.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Did you have that necklace on earlier?.
not_available I got it from that big man outside.
not_available He wouldn't know a Hattie Carnegie piece if it bit him in the ass.
not_available I know, because I was a buyer from Marshall Field for 4O years.
not_available Well, you wear it well.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, and you should know, the original owner of that necklace?.
not_available Mm
not_available hm?.
not_available She was a saint.
MORRlS Frank, have you seen 
not_available the evaluation forms?.
not_available Hello?.

not_available Yeah, no, that was me.
not_available ""Archie Morris.

not_available Listen, um, that was my friend, lda.
not_available l
not_available I need to find Dr.
not_available Sanchez.
not_available Okay, if I see him 
not_available you will be the first to know.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available No, this is really important.
not_available What do we have?.
not_available Renee Webber
not_available Stewart, 39.
not_available She passed out at the mall.
not_available All right, let's take her to Exam 3.
not_available We were waiting for Santa.
not_available She has a 6month
not_available old, Lola.
not_available Mom broke her fall, but check on the baby too.
not_available Belly's distended, systolic's only 84 after a liter.
not_available My wife, Nicole.
not_available We'll call her for you, ma'am.
not_available I have the number.
not_available Could be vagal 
not_available but she's pretty out of it.
not_available Have Social Services watch the baby 
not_available until we can get a family member here.
not_available That's okay, I'll look after her.
not_available Huh.
not_available Hi, you little reindeer.
not_available It's okay.

not_available I'll call again.
not_available Hey, I'm saving that for later.
not_available Okay, you still have one left.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available We're from lmmigration.
not_available We're looking for a patient, Gloria Ortiz.
not_available Mom's five centimeters dilated and maxed out on terb and mag.
not_available Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?.
not_available It's a boy.
not_available Ah, we're having a boy.
TRACY Second lV is in.
not_available We're having a boy.
not_available Did you hear that?.
GLORlA A boy.
not_available That's great.
NEELA This is what we were looking at.
not_available Thought it might be a multiple gestation.
not_available There's only one heartbeat.
not_available No, it's not a twin.
not_available Are you sure?.
not_available What's wrong?.
COBURN All right.
not_available Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Ortiz.
not_available The ultrasounds shows your baby has a large mass involving the lower face and neck.
not_available A mass?.
not_available What does that mean?.
not_available Does my baby have cancer?.
not_available The ultrasound doesn't tell us if it's cancerous.
not_available The most pressing issue is the medications 
not_available aren't stopping your contractions.
not_available What are you saying?.
not_available We're gonna do everything we can for your baby.
not_available There are two lmmigration agents at the desk who wanna talk to your patient.
not_available Well, we're kind of busy here, Frank.
not_available They don't want to wait around.
NEELA They're gonna have to.
not_available What do we do now?.
COBURN All right, your baby needs to be delivered.
not_available Is this Gloria Ortiz?.
not_available We're doing an exam.
not_available What do you need?.
not_available T o take Mrs.
not_available Ortiz into custody.
not_available What for?.
not_available She's a fugitive alien.
not_available She's being deported.
not_available This yarn is so soft.
not_available Y eah, my mom spent the 7Os obsessed with macrame.
not_available Wall hangings, tea cozies, vests.
not_available Vests?.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available My first
not_available grade class picture?.
not_available Rocking a blue macrame vest.
not_available It's like no matter where it is, it's staring at me.
TRACY Hey, come to the O.R.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner's letting us watch an EXlT procedure.
not_available What?.
not_available It's when they section the mom to get an airway on the baby before the delivery.
not_available I mean, can you imagine?.
not_available Hey, did you hear me?.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Airways.
not_available Airways, baby.
not_available Here.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Listen, have either of you seen Dr.
not_available Sanchez?.
not_available Oh, he's over there.
not_available Oh, oh, that's not one of my brownies, is it?.
not_available Why, is it bad?.
not_available I ate two.
not_available How are you feeling, dear?.
not_available Hey, that's my Jell
not_available O.
not_available You shouldn't be eating my food.
not_available It's okay, I'm a doctor.
not_available Dr.
not_available Sanchez.
not_available What are you doing?.
not_available Wiggling and jiggling.
not_available Put that back.
not_available Oh, doctor.
not_available Doctor, he's high as a kite.
not_available The brownies have cannabis in them.
not_available You gave pot brownies to my staff?.
not_available Do you know how dangerous that is?.
not_available They could have mistreated a patient.
not_available I know, it was a mistake.
not_available You see, my friend, lda, had cancer and I made special brownies for her.
not_available Now she's in remission, thank the Lord, but she still likes them.
not_available And I mixed up the batches.
not_available You two are done for the day.
not_available Drink some water, take a nap.
not_available Whatever you do, do not drive home until you're clean and sober.
not_available Pick any three eight
not_available track tapes for the price of two.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ortiz?.
not_available How's Gloria?.
not_available Is she okay?.
not_available She's fine, but we're worried the tumor on your son's neck could prevent him from breathing normally.
not_available So fix it.
not_available Can you fix it?.
not_available We're gonna do a Cesarean section so we can insert a breathing tube while he's attached to the placenta.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Well, that way, Gloria's body can supply him with oxygen 
not_available until he can breathe on his own.
not_available Wait, she's having the baby today?.
not_available We're prepping her for surgery.
not_available No.
not_available I can't.
not_available No, not like this.
not_available Well, we have to.
not_available Are they still there?.
not_available Did you know lmmigration was after her?.
not_available We're undocumented.
not_available Two years ago, they scheduled her for deportation, but she didn't show up.
not_available I couldn't let her go.
not_available Our life is here.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I have to get back.
not_available I'll call you when we're out of surgery.
not_available We're not bad people.
not_available We never harmed anyone.
not_available We only want to be happy.
not_available Frank gave this to me.
not_available Oh, that was my mom's.
not_available That's your story, huh?.
not_available You want it back?.
not_available No, I'd break it.
not_available When I was 9, I juggled the holy
not_available family set.
not_available Oh, yeah?.
not_available Not sure what upset my mom more that I broke her Hummels or I tossed around the baby Jesus.
not_available The only time she raised her voice at me.
not_available Well, I don't juggle, so I think this one's safe.
not_available Dr.
not_available Banfield, this is Nicole, Renee's partner.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is she okay?.
not_available She's doing better.
not_available Can I see her?.
not_available This way.
not_available Where's Lola?.
not_available One of our nurses is babysitting.
not_available I'll go get her.
not_available Now, she's still a little sedated from the CAT scan.
not_available What's wrong?.
not_available We're not sure yet.
not_available But we noticed the surgical scar on her abdomen.
not_available Do you know what it's from?.
not_available She had cancer of the small bowel but she's been in remission for three years.
not_available What does this have to do with her passing out?.
not_available Her belly's distended and we're concerned.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Is that what you think?.
not_available That the cancer's back?.
not_available We'll know more when we get the CT results.
SAM This one's mine.
not_available I got this when Alex and l lived in Albuquerque.
not_available He was just a baby then.
not_available And this one's Haleh's.
not_available It was a gift from her grandma.
not_available And look, look.
not_available There's Frank.
not_available That one's his, obviously.
not_available It's pretty silly, huh?.
not_available Sam?.
not_available We can take Lola back to her mom now.
not_available Bye
not_available bye, little reindeer.
not_available Bye.
not_available You okay?.
not_available Nope, not even a little bit.
not_available I remember this one Christmas, Alex begged me for a skateboard.
not_available And I gave it to him, he was so excited.
not_available And then I made him wear a helmet.
not_available You were looking out for him.
not_available You do everything you can to keep them safe and then 
not_available he ends up on a ventilator.
not_available Sam.
not_available He's been tubed for almost a week.
not_available What's next?.
not_available He's gonna be on a trake his whole life?.
not_available Let's not jump the gun.
not_available They're gonna extubate tomorrow.
not_available Yeah, I asked Dubenko if they could try again tonight but he said they only do it before noon.
not_available Well, he's just following the rules.
not_available Why do you do that?.
not_available What?.
not_available Why do you always take the other side?.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available Y eah, well, then take my side.
not_available All right, well, then let's tell Dubenko that his rules are stupid, and maybe he'll make an exception?.
not_available You never know.
PERRY Cefazolin onboard.
COBURN Uterine stapler.
TRACY Where did you get that?.

not_available Run the scan by Dr.
not_available Dubenko.
not_available lt was in the lymph nodes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We knew a recurrence was likely.
not_available I convinced myself that I was gonna be lucky.
not_available That I could dodge the bullet.
not_available Well, that's a great attitude to have.
not_available She doesn't understand the concept of ""The glass is half empty.
not_available "" I finally met someone that I couldn't live without and that's no time to give up.
not_available A week before the surgery, we flew to Boston and got married.
not_available And we ran off like a couple of teenagers.
not_available That's quite a leap of faith.
not_available It's not hard when you have someone to hang onto.
MARlSOL What's gonna happen once she's out of surgery?.
DUBENKO She'll be detained till they deport her.
NEELA What about her recovery?.
not_available Let's try a Miller one.

not_available Suction.
not_available Can't we keep her until the baby's DC'd?.
DUBENKO We can't.
not_available Baby needs to be in a NlCU for three weeks.
NEELA If people knew.
MARlSOL Fetal heart rate's 1 38.
COBURN And by ""people,"" you mean the 1 O:OO news?.
NEELA Couldn't hurt.
DUBENKO You put a magnifying glass on our hospital like that public perception will be, ""Go to County, get deported.
not_available "" 
NEELA The sat?.
MARlSOL 52.
NEELA Nothing we can do?.
COBURN We're doing it.
NEELA It's too distorted.
not_available Suction.
COBURN We got some uterine bleeding.
DUBENKO Switch with me, Neela.
not_available Rigid bronch.
NEELA I can't get it.
DUBENKO You're taking too long.
PERRY Systolic's 84.
COBURN Time's up.
not_available We gotta clamp, whether you get the airway in or not.
DUBENKO Hold on.
PERRY 78.
COBURN If we don't handle this Mom is gonna bleed out and we'll lose the baby too.
DUBENKO Damn it.
NEELA Okay, type specific and O.25 methergine, now.
COBURN I have to cut the cord.
DUBENKO Not without an airway.
COBURN No choice.
NEELA The baby's not getting oxygen
COBURN We bail out now or we lose them both.
NEELA How about a tracheotomy?.
DUBENKO Not yet.
GATES Dr.

NEELA Okay, 1 5 blade and a 3
not_available O Shiley.
not_available Nicole?.
not_available What's the word from the surgeon?.
not_available Uh, none yet.
not_available How are you doing?.
not_available I was thinking, uh, what if?.
not_available What if this is it?.
not_available Lola won't remember her.
not_available You will.
not_available And you'll make sure your baby does too.
not_available I feel like I might forget.
not_available Just the little things.
not_available Just the little things.
not_available How she burns the roof of her mouth on pizza every time.
not_available Or how she slaps my arm when she laughs.
not_available You won't forget those things.
not_available You won't.
not_available Jerry couldn't get rid of this stuff?.
not_available What do you want to do with it?.
not_available Hey, thanks for the crock pot.
not_available No problem.
not_available Uh, if it's the one with the blue flowers on the side, it has a short.
not_available Almost burnt the house down.
not_available Son of a bitch.

not_available Yeah.
not_available My teacher, Ms.
not_available Durbin, said that wherever we are if we set this out, Santa would find us.
not_available That's sweet.
not_available My dad didn't think so.
not_available Yeah, he said Santa wasn't stupid, he'd know it wasn't real.
not_available That was my dad.
not_available Yeah, but he kept it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes, he did.
NEELA Anatomy's so distorted.
not_available I can't feel the tracheal rings.
DUBENKO Focus.
PERRY Crit's down to 26.
COBURN I'm pulling the plug.
NEELA Wait.
not_available Uh, guide wire?.
MARlSOL Systolic's only 68.
COBURN Either you have it or you don't.
NEELA I'm in.
DUBENKO Throw me the bag.
COBURN Twenty units of oxytocin and start the drip.
NEELA Okay, we've got chest rise.
not_available You can clamp.
COBURN Done.
not_available Scissors.
not_available Get the carboprost onboard.
not_available Don't ever worry that you don't do enough for your patients.
NEELA Right.
not_available Lucien, can you stay?.
not_available I need the hands.
DUBENKO Yeah.
not_available Uterine tone seems better.
PERRY BP's coming up.
MARlSOL Nice and clean.
NEELA Umbilical
not_available line tray.
MARlSOL Heart rate's over.
not_available Wow.
not_available Good luck, Mr.
not_available Mosely.
not_available Ha, ha.
not_available It's a little late for that, isn't it?.
not_available Sorry they couldn't extubate Alex today.
not_available Hopefully soon.
not_available I'll keep my fingers crossed.
not_available Copy, uh, the discharge summary, will you?.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hey, Max?.
not_available Hey, Max.
not_available Hey.
not_available I've been looking for you, man.
not_available You all right?.
not_available Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available Jake has a hard time when it's cold, though.
not_available Well, come inside, warm up a bit.
not_available Jake can come too.
not_available Let's start with a cup of coffee.
not_available You want some coffee?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, coffee's good.
not_available This wasn't your average C
not_available section.
VlCKERY As long as she's stable 
not_available we have to take her into custody.
not_available She hasn't even seen her baby yet.
not_available I mean, give her a few days
not_available Look, we don't like this either separating a mom from her kid.
not_available But we can't make an exception here.
not_available Well, why not?.
not_available She should be able to spend
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We'll see you tomorrow.
not_available I'll show you out.
not_available You got them to leave?.
not_available They're coming back tomorrow.
not_available They're gonna transfer you to a detention facility.
not_available How's my baby?.
not_available He's doing very well.
not_available He's still on a ventilator, but mostly breathing on his own.
not_available I should call my husband.
not_available I told him the surgery went well.
not_available And that he'll be able to take your baby home in a few weeks.
not_available Immigration won't get involved in custody.
not_available A mother is supposed to protect her child, keep him safe.
not_available He's in good hands.
not_available We're taking care of him.
not_available I need to see him.
not_available I need to see my baby.
SAM Dr.
not_available Dubenko?.
not_available Uh, really swamped right now, Sam.
not_available Yeah, I need you to try to extubate Alex again.
not_available We will.
not_available Tomorrow.
not_available No, today.
not_available Please?.
not_available We already talked about this.
not_available First thing in the morning, I promise.
not_available I've been studying to become a nurse anesthetist.
not_available There are some tricks we can use.
not_available Tricks?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We can give an anxiolytic before shutting off the propofol, right?.
not_available That may cut the agitation we see during emergence.
not_available Two Versed would be calming and not too sedating.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, then we sit him up and we give him something familiar to focus on.
not_available It's the Blackhawks game from last night.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, what if it doesn't work?.
not_available No, it'll work.
not_available I'll talk him through it, I'll stay there all night.
not_available I will make sure he uses the incentive spirometer.
not_available Whatever it takes.
not_available He's so little.
not_available We'll, uh, do an MRl to figure out exactly what we need to do to remove the tumor.
not_available Had you two picked names out?.
not_available For a boy we liked Pablo.
not_available After my grandfather.
not_available He was a strong man.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available How long will he be here?.
not_available Well, if all goes well, only a few weeks.
not_available We're pretty sure he won't need chemotherapy or radiation.
not_available All alone.
not_available I'll come back.
not_available They took a risk staying here.
not_available So what?.
not_available It's still inhumane to separate them.
not_available Yeah, but there is nothing that we can do, is there?.
not_available Not right now.
not_available It's not a good time to rock the boat.
not_available Why?.
not_available Because you're at the center of a malpractice suit?.
not_available Something like that, yeah.
not_available I could have sworn that Neela Rasgotra was a boat
not_available rocker.
not_available Like, a championgrade, professional one at that but I guess, I don't know, I was
not_available I was wrong.
not_available No, you're not wrong, but.
not_available What?.
not_available I just don't wanna take any unnecessary chances with my career.
not_available Ah! Good things happen when you take a chance.
not_available You ready?.
not_available Okay, kiddo, we're gonna take that tube out now, okay?.
not_available I know you can do this.
not_available Try, try again, remember?.
not_available Like when we took the training wheels off your bike.
not_available The first time you fell off, then you got right back on and you rode like the wind.
not_available Remember that?.
not_available Okay.
not_available Balloon's down.
not_available Just relax and take some deep breaths, okay?.
not_available Second time's the charm.
not_available You wanna do the honors?.
not_available Me?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know what you're doing.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Are you ready?.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Yankauer.
not_available Give it a moment.
not_available Alex?.
not_available Hey, Alex.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available How you feeling?.
not_available Did l?.
not_available Did I miss Christmas?.
not_available No.
not_available Hey.
not_available Jake's in the break room eating pot roast courtesy of our clerk, Frank's, wife.
not_available I'm not sure who's happier, Jake or Frank.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available After I got back, nothing went right.
not_available Those people who used to care were gone, or I scared them off.
not_available The ones I thought I could rely on from the Army said I wasn't their problem.
not_available Then you came along, and I figured you were more of the same.
not_available But these, uh, past few days, I heard you were looking for me.
not_available I saw the fliers.
not_available I was worried about you.
not_available That means something, you know.
not_available That makes a difference.
not_available I don't
not_available I don't wanna die on the streets.
not_available Oncology says if we do nothing, she has a couple of months, tops.
not_available The best thing we can do is urge her to spend the time well.
not_available She's has a 6month
not_available old child.
not_available All the more reason for her to enjoy the time she has left.
not_available Look, if I take her to the O.R there's a good chance I'll cut into that thing and she'll bleed to death.
not_available There's also a chance 
not_available you could debulk it and give her time.
not_available Slim chance.
not_available Her and her partner have had three years.
not_available It that all the time they get?.
not_available You could give Renee time to create memories with her daughter.
not_available Christmas really brings out the tenacity in you ER people, doesn't it?.
not_available Doesn't it?.
not_available Fine.
not_available Make her NPO after midnight.
not_available I'll try to get her on the schedule for the morning.
not_available Hey, I heard the good news.
not_available How you feeling?.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available You don't have to talk.
not_available I brought you some entertainment.
not_available There's enough movies on here to tide you over until you go home.
not_available Thanks.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm gonna run out and get you that ice cream you've been craving.
not_available Rocky road?.
not_available Cookie dough.
not_available Ice cream for dinner, huh, big shot?.
not_available Not bad.
not_available Sarah wanted to be here, but she's, uh, at her grandparents.
not_available Although she did send this tiny little card.
not_available How is she?.
not_available She's good.
not_available She said her arm itches from the cast.
not_available I thought I was doing the right thing.
not_available I didn't
not_available Oh, Alex, this wasn't your fault.
not_available I should have never let you and Sarah go out that night.
not_available No, you were being cool.
not_available Well, yeah that was the problem.
not_available Here's your half.
not_available Three dollars and a Canadian quarter?.
not_available Most of my customers were patients.
not_available I mean, come on, I'm not gonna charge some kid with the chickenpox for his first
not_available ever pair of rollerblades.
not_available There were rollerblades in there?.
not_available Don't worry, I saved the best for last.
not_available You know what that is, don't you?.
not_available A really old motorcycle?.
not_available It's a 1 966 Triumph.
not_available Marlon Brando rode a Triumph in The Wild One.
not_available Never saw it, don't care.
not_available Ah! It's only the greatest rebel movie ever with the awesomest bike.
not_available You know what?.
not_available If you love it so much, keep it.
not_available What?.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I can't take this.
not_available Fix it up, sell it, whatever.
not_available I don't get you.
not_available All the great stuff in there, there was nothing in there you wanted?.
not_available No, it's just
not_available It's just stuff.
not_available Anyway, thanks for taking care of this.
not_available I'm sure you had something better to do.
not_available Actually, I didn't.
not_available Since I moved back, work's been tough to come by.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry, man.
not_available Anything I can do?.
not_available How can I get my old job back?.
not_available He fell asleep five minutes ago.
not_available The extubation must have worn him out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll put this in the freezer.
not_available All right.
not_available He seems like his old self again.
not_available He wanted to remind you that he wants a PS3 for Christmas.
not_available Lucien said he could be out in a week.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We should have a party for him when he comes home.
not_available I forgot to tell you the other news.
not_available Max showed up, can you believe that?.
not_available Oh, yeah?.
not_available Y eah, I got him admitted and don't get mad, but I said we could watch his dog 
not_available while he was in the hospital.
not_available Tony.
not_available But you know what?.
not_available Alex always wanted a dog and I thought it'd be cool, when he gets out a dog will be there at the house
not_available Tony, listen.
not_available Um.
not_available I'm gonna stay at Chuny's for a while until, uh, I can find a new place for me and Alex.
not_available You're moving out?.
not_available It's just
not_available It's just not working.
not_available Sam, I know this has been rough, but it'll get better.
not_available We were doing fine before.
not_available What, you just think things can go back to normal?.
not_available I
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I shouldn't have let him go out.
not_available You keep saying that but it doesn't make me feel better.
not_available Well, I don't know what else to tell you, Sam.
not_available We can work past this.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available So you're just gonna run away?.
not_available I'm not running away.
not_available I'm just telling you it's over.
not_available How's it look?.
not_available Looks like locusts got to this.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available How was the hot date?.
not_available Oh, he was a douche.
not_available You know, who lies about their age?.
not_available First he was 34, then he was 37, now he's 42.
not_available Maybe he was afraid you wouldn't date a 42year
not_available old.
not_available Well, of course I wouldn't.
not_available Besides, he was a stock broker, so it's been a bad year for him anyway.
not_available Bummer.
not_available Well, this has been fun.
not_available I'm gonna get a drink.
not_available I'm gonna get more food.
not_available She hired you on the spot?.
not_available Yeah, she wanted a Santa that wasn't stoned.
not_available Wow, you think you know someone.
not_available Ho, ho, ho, Dr.
not_available Banfield.
not_available And who might this young fellow be?.
not_available Russell Banfield, the husband.
not_available Ho, ho, ho.
not_available This is Jerry.
not_available He's filling in for Frank.
not_available You can call me Kringle.
not_available Kris Kringle.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kringle.
not_available And this is Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available So you must be the guy that slept with my wife?.
not_available What?.
not_available Uh, no, no, no
RUSSELL I'm just kidding.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Jerry
not_available ?.
not_available Uh, Santa?.
not_available Yes?.
not_available Yes?.
not_available Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
not_available All right, now
not_available Don't worry, it's a virgin.
not_available I'll be ready for Renee's surgery in the morning.
not_available Hey.
NEELA Hey.
not_available We got news on the Bertha Mendenhall malpractice suit.
not_available What is it?.
not_available Well, I don't know if I should tell you.
not_available Why, is it bad?.
not_available It's bad.
not_available Depends on whose side you were on.
not_available Just spill it.
not_available Motion for summary judgment.
not_available The judge threw the case out.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Merry Christmas, Neela.
not_available Gloria left?.
not_available Uh, yeah, looks that way.
not_available And you're not upset?.
not_available People do crazy things when they're desperate.
not_available Eggnog?.
not_available Well, wait, uh, you're not even the slightest bit worried?.
not_available She'll be okay.
not_available I'm starving.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available Nothing.
not_available It's nothing.
not_available Wait, your patient leaves hours after surgery and you're not concerned?.
not_available She needs to be under a doctor's care.
not_available It is possible that someone put her in a cab to another hospital.
not_available Good luck with everything.
not_available So she's just gonna show up and
not_available ?.
not_available And ask for a bed?.
not_available And it's also possible that someone wrote down a few instructions.
not_available Neela Rasgotra, rocking the boat.
not_available Archie?.
not_available Can you just hold this?.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hey, where are you going?.
not_available Archie Morris never leaves a party early.
not_available In fact, more often than not, he's the last man standing.
not_available There's a first time for everything, right?.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Who's gonna pinch my butt later?.
not_available Frank?.
not_available He's far too stoned.
not_available I'm not in the party mood, I guess.
not_available Well, we can change that.
not_available You're like Happy Holly over here.
not_available I should be asking if you're okay.
not_available I'm just saying, there are always things to celebrate.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Pretty amazing, huh?.
not_available Some days our job really does matter.
not_available T oday I did paperwork and saw my childhood parade around the ER.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Jerry gave me the Burl Ives Christmas Favorites on reelto
not_available reel.
not_available I kept acting like I didn't care.
not_available But, you know, I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that hoped Jerry might find something that would I don't know, help me understand my dad.
not_available Something more than crock pots and cheese hats.
not_available You know, I was thinking about us having a family.
not_available Starting again.
not_available That's a pretty big leap of faith.
not_available Not so hard when you got someone to hold onto.
