not_available You're scaring me, doc.
not_available But being a doctor isn't about your personal feelings.

not_available But we must offer to do everything we can to keep them alive.

not_available You can't be serious.
not_available Why not? Barbecue in January?

not_available This family needs your help.
not_available He's cold
not_available blooded.
not_available I don't think he'll tell me.
not_available I'll ask.

not_available So everything isn't okay.
not_available I'm actually surprised to see you.
not_available I thought you dropped out afterI almost killed that patient? 
not_available Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available But it's okay.
not_available Let's face it, it was a low point.
not_available But it did force me to face the truth.
not_available I was way too competitive, trying to outdo everyone.
not_available And I'd left the patient out of the picture.
not_available Your wrestling partner's tired.
not_available I'm Yosh Takata.
not_available Hi.

not_available I do.
not_available Either OCD or a body dysmorphic disorder.
not_available But did you see these? What? 
not_available Burrows, papules.
not_available I think there's a chance it's lindane toxicity.
not_available She's got body lice.
not_available Classic symptoms.
not_available Applied lindane for the lice, scratched.
not_available Lindane entered her bloodstream, causing her altered mental state.
not_available But we should wait for Dr.
not_available Myers.
not_available I'll call him.
not_available Right.
not_available Taxi will be here in five minutes.
not_available Sorry about no barbecue.
not_available I'm worried about your father.

not_available I already told them that, but thanks.
not_available Won't that hurt? 
not_available It'll be fine.
not_available The needle will enter the joint and aspirate the blood which should relieve the pain immediately.
not_available Here we go.
not_available That is gross.

not_available Between syphilis and HIV, they have their hands full.
not_available What if Sumpter doesn't tell her? Then he doesn't.
not_available Good morning.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available You turned my life into pain.
not_available I didn't lie.
not_available Sorry for how you're feeling.
not_available You fractured your pelvis.

not_available I don't believe it.
not_available And I want you out of here.
not_available Get her out of here! You're fired.

not_available Hey, Dave.
not_available Stealing Weaver's car? Just taking a look.
not_available She couldn't get it started.
not_available Carter, did you know the new resident, Jing

not_available That'll impress her.
not_available She was a student here? 
not_available She was.
not_available Yes, I knew her.
not_available And? 
not_available And? Nothing.

not_available And he knows better.
not_available Don't you, Jake? You can talk now.
not_available I'm not mad no more.
not_available He hates it when he thinks he did something wrong.
not_available Where are your parents? They don't ask about us, we don't ask about them.
not_available Can't remember Pop.
not_available Mom's on the streets.
not_available We see her sometimes.
not_available We move around a lot.
not_available Must be hard for Social Services to find you.
not_available They got enough to do.
not_available Maybe they could help.

not_available My parents weren't very clever.

not_available You're just a fountain of information, aren't you? Dr.
not_available Chen, you have a call at the desk.
not_available Could you take a message? 
not_available It's the lab, about the little boy.
not_available Which little boy? 
not_available They said it was urgent.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Don't run away.
not_available Very funny.
not_available Haleh, I don't
not_available Wallet.

not_available School pretty tough? 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Feeling depressed? 
not_available You would if you had a C in chemistry.

not_available You paged me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Detective Cruson could not persuade Rollins to talk.
not_available Didn't think he could.
not_available Maybe you can.
not_available He wants another doctor.
not_available Maybe you can talk him out of it.
not_available I don't want to talk to him again.
not_available The Cordovas.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Cordova's other daughter, Jenny, was only 19 years old.
not_available This is not fair of you, Robert.
not_available We both know I'm capable of a low blow.
not_available However, I rarely use it to such purity of purpose.

not_available How's the boy who broke the light box? 
not_available He's okay.
not_available He lives with his older brother, right? There's no parents? Have you called DCFS? I think the older boy just needs a job.
not_available Well, are they in school? 
not_available They've been moving around a lot.
not_available We see a lot of kids like this.

not_available Great! 
not_available Can we take your picture? Thanks, man! Your fingerprints were on her car.
not_available They want to know where the body is.
not_available You know, sometimes I feel everyone wants a little piece of me.
not_available Will you tell them? I don't recall this girl.
not_available You're already charged with murder.
not_available Why cause more needless grief? Needless grief is what I do best.
not_available Oh, fine, then! Wait.
not_available Wait! Look, I don't knowIf I talk, will you be my doctor? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then I will.
not_available But only to the sister.

not_available Why don't you just tell me?

not_available Let me help.
not_available You can't, okay? 
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available You can't! 
not_available Sit down.
not_available Fine.

not_available You are safe here.
not_available Who tricked you? Your parents? Yes, they To get me into this treatment center.
not_available I ran away.
not_available Treatment center.
not_available For drugs or alcohol? No.
not_available For gender identity.
not_available What? My parents think I'm sick and confused.
not_available I keep telling them, "Mom, Dad, get over it.
not_available All I am is gay." Ultimately, it's your own decision.
not_available Mom, I can do it.
not_available I don't want you near him.
not_available I'll be just outside.
not_available Rollins is in restraints.
not_available He's no longer able to get out of bed.
not_available He can't hurt anyone.
not_available He killed my daughter.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Cordova.
not_available I don't understand this man, and I don't care to.
not_available But you have nothing to lose.
not_available If Lindsey asks, I think he'll tell where your daughter is.
not_available And if he doesn't? 
not_available We may never find her.
not_available Please.
not_available Mom, I have to know.
not_available I'll be in there with her.
not_available Dave? 
not_available What a mess.
not_available What? 
not_available Weaver's car.
not_available These spark plugs are ridiculous.
not_available I shouldn't have opened my mouth.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Hold on.
not_available It's the 11year
not_available old.
not_available How did you get the x
not_available ray? Radiology flagged it.
not_available What is that? 
not_available Mediastinal mass.
not_available Around the heart? 
not_available Looks like lymphoma.
not_available That's why EKG showed low voltage.
not_available It infiltrates through both lung fields.
not_available It's inoperable.
not_available This boy's dead.
not_available They think they can cure her.
not_available Parents sent her to be deprogrammed? 
not_available The center has custody.
not_available Have her leave before they come.
not_available I didn't tell her I called.
not_available She needs help.
not_available Call Social Services.
not_available What can they do? 
not_available I assume the place is legal.
not_available Shouldn't be.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen? We have a situation here.
not_available Get off me! I'm not going back! Calm down.
not_available Haleh, call Security! 
not_available You got it.
not_available I'm her guardian.
not_available You called my parents?! Dr.

not_available Second Turn? 
not_available Her parents asked me to pick her up.
not_available You can't.
not_available I have custody.
not_available She can't leave yet.
not_available Why? 
not_available We need to do more tests.
not_available Why? She's pregnant.
not_available Pregnant? 
not_available Lab work confirms it.
not_available I bet.
not_available Unfortunately for you, this means Alyssa is now an emancipated minor.
not_available She can go where she wants.
not_available This is a load of bunk and frankly an obstruction of parental rights.
not_available Well, Alyssa, do you want to stay here or go with Mr.
not_available Ramsey? I want to stay here.
not_available We all know she can't be pregnant.
not_available She's a healthy young woman 
not_available of childbearing age.
not_available I want to see proof.
not_available Medical records are confidential.
not_available You just told me.
not_available I shouldn't have.

not_available I'll pray for you, Alyssa.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rollins, this is Lindsey Cordova.
not_available Hi, Lindsey.
not_available I'd shake hands, but Can I help you? 
not_available I want to bury my sister.
not_available Please tell me where she is.
not_available Were you close to her, Lindsey? Yes, I was.
not_available I didn't have brothers or sisters.
not_available I've never known what that was like.
not_available You know, to be part of a family.
not_available I've done terrible things, Lindsey.
not_available I've done evil things.
not_available I know.
not_available But I am paying for them now.
not_available We don't want you to suffer.
not_available We just want to know where Jenny is.
not_available You're a good person.
not_available More forgiving than most people.
not_available Do you know that if I had met you Jenny would still be alive? 
not_available What do you mean? If only I'd met you, Lindsey.
not_available I know it now.
not_available You're warm.
not_available You're loving.
not_available If only I met you, I could've had you instead.
not_available What? Jenny screamed all the time.
not_available I was glad to get rid of her.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available You bastard! Hey, what's her problem? He had lymphoma two years ago.
not_available Chemo put it in remission.
not_available The mother didn't mention it? Said she must have blocked it out of her mind.
not_available Are you doing thoracentesis? As soon as the mom tells him.
not_available She says she can't.
not_available Then you should.
not_available I paged Oncology.
not_available No.
not_available You tell him.
not_available Don't you think Oncology would be better at that? No, no.
not_available You're his doctor.
not_available Dillon? 
not_available Keep walking.
not_available Wait! 
not_available He's coming.
not_available I know.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Not your problem.
not_available Jake needs a tetanus shot.
not_available Sure.
not_available What's wrong? What's wrong? 
not_available He gave us up.
not_available Gave you up?! Gave us up? 
not_available You called a social worker.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Right.
not_available She visits all the retards.
not_available I'm not a retard! 
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available I swear I didn't call.
not_available It was a mistake.
not_available But you guys need help.
not_available I've taken care of him for years.
not_available We do fine.
not_available You have no money.
not_available God knows where you live.
not_available You've got it all under control.
not_available We get by.
not_available Yeah, but sometimes not very well.
not_available You're burned, Jake is cut.
not_available Just please let me figure something out, huh? 
not_available He'll get a court order.
not_available Parents called? 
not_available No.
not_available And she's not pregnant.
not_available And you didn't write it on her chart? 
not_available No.
not_available Did you? 
not_available No.
not_available Call the Gay and Lesbian Center.
not_available Get her over there.
not_available Let her parents know she's okay.
not_available Right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We don't lie about our patients' medical conditions.
not_available Her first day.
not_available I'll get back to work.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Are you a doctor? Can I take your picture? Who's cleaning auto parts in Trauma? I know it's not sterile, but come on! Can I take your picture? I'm on a scavenger hunt
not_available Go away.
not_available Her wrist's all right? 
not_available Just a little sore.
not_available But can she play? Why'd another doctor put a cast on? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available She says it's a fracture that's hard to see.
not_available Yes, it can be hard to see.
not_available Radiology couldn't rule it out.
not_available I thought you looked at the x
not_available ray.
not_available I did.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll be right back, Tamara.
not_available It feels okay, right? You think you can play? 
not_available She has to play.
not_available She has to stay healthy.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Casting her.
not_available I told her parents she's fine.
not_available Radiology isn't certain.
not_available You know the chances are negligible.
not_available I'd rather be safe.
not_available She can push too far, hurt herself.
not_available Then tell her not to.
not_available She has too much pressure to perform.
not_available Did she ask you for a cast? 
not_available She's completely exhausted.
not_available She can decide not to play.
not_available She doesn't make decisions.
not_available Her life's about pleasing her coach, parents and teammates.
not_available I'm giving her time to rest.
not_available Did she ask you? 
not_available You don't understand.
not_available You're controlling
not_available I'm protecting her.
not_available Her parents think they are too.
not_available That's why my chest hurts? It's spread throughout your lungs.
not_available So more chemo? 
not_available It's an option.
not_available We can try that.
not_available But 
not_available But what? The cancer surrounds your heart.
not_available Am I gonna be okay? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Dr.
not_available Malucci? 
not_available Not right now.
not_available Did you leave
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, I'm busy.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Dad? Dad, you there? Dad
not_available Oh, it's you.
not_available Did you change the locks? 
not_available Why are you here? I'm worried.
not_available You didn't answer the phone.
not_available Realtor keeps calling.
not_available I told her the house is off the market.
not_available Can I come in? 
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Want to search me first? Why did you hire me? I'm an experienced physician.
not_available You must trust my judgment.
not_available Is this about that boy? 
not_available You called DCFS.
not_available We said you would.
not_available You should've told me you didn't want to.
not_available Your social worker scared them away.
not_available They're gone? I convinced the older brother to come back.
not_available Please, just let me handle it.
not_available See that you do.
not_available Who's the social worker? 
not_available Adele Neuman.
not_available Your parents left? 
not_available They went to get the car.
not_available My coach makes you sit on the bench if you can't play.
not_available You can play if you really want to.
not_available It's not broken? We can't be absolutely sure.
not_available Probably not.
not_available So I don't need this? I hoped it would slow you down a bit.
not_available But it's your choice.
not_available I can't slow down now.
not_available It'll get better after this season.
not_available You don't want to start resenting your talent.
not_available Don't.
not_available Play for you.
not_available It's not that simple.
not_available I know.
not_available Promise you'll try? Yeah, he'll be there.
not_available Did you want to talk to Dr.
not_available Kovac? Thanks.
not_available Bye.
not_available My landlord said yes.
not_available Good.
not_available His buildings always need supers.
not_available He'll see Dillon tomorrow.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available No problem.
not_available What's a "super"? 
not_available Collects rent, keeps the place clean.
not_available It gives them somewhere to live, some cash.
not_available If Dillon is supporting Jake, he can apply for guardianship.
not_available Dillon! Dillon! 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hold still.
not_available Don't touch him! Where are you taking him? Stop! You're scaring him! 
not_available Adele Neuman, DCFS.
not_available He's going to an emergency center.
not_available Don't take him! 
not_available I won't release him.
not_available He's been neglected.
not_available I'm obligated to protect him.
not_available I never neglected my brother.
not_available I found him a job.
not_available They'll be fine.
not_available Let him go! 
not_available I don't want to arrest you.
not_available He must have protective care.
not_available Just let me go with him! 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't leave me 
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available Those two only have each other.
not_available I know that.
not_available But I have to do it.
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available I'm gonna find you.
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available I promise I'll find you! Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! Don't be scared! Don't be scared, Jake! Don't worry.
not_available We'll get him back.
not_available You wanted to see me? I'm sick.
not_available No more games.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available The games.
not_available They're no fun anymore.
not_available Not even that last one.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday That day on the road you should've let me die.
not_available That's what I want.
not_available Shannon Murphy, 26.
not_available Slipped into a polar
not_available bear pit.
not_available Polar bear? 
not_available At the zoo.
not_available He was gentle.
not_available Licked my face.
not_available They got a picture of the polar bear.
not_available I got one with the polar bear.
not_available This that stupid scavenger hunt? 
not_available Stupid? I won $1000.
not_available You broke both your ankles.
not_available Forearm fracture.
not_available We started an IV.
not_available Morphine.
not_available Want this one? 
not_available I've done enough casting for one day.
not_available The lady who burned her butt's screaming for a doctor.
not_available You're not a doctor? 
not_available I won't tell if you won't.
not_available Oh, my God! Where's my camera? Somebody give me a camera! It's worth $1000! Make her split it with us.
not_available I heard what happened.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't apologize.
not_available It might not make sense to us.
not_available In a difficult family situation, we use DCFS's expertise.
not_available We defer to their judgment.
not_available You don't break up families.
not_available Sometimes we do.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available My wife and kids were taken.
not_available In the war? Yeah.
not_available And then killed.
not_available You don't break up families.
not_available So much for the retirement community.
not_available I gave it a try.
not_available You were only there a week.
not_available Longest week of my life.
not_available What will you do now? 
not_available I'll get by.
not_available Don't trouble yourself.
not_available It's no trouble.
not_available Yeah, like hell! You move in with that girl yet? Elizabeth? Not yet.
not_available I've been thinking
not_available We never talked about it Maybe you should live with me in Chicago.
not_available For a while.
not_available Why would I do that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available The weather could be better.
not_available It's a great city.
not_available You'd be closer to Rachel and to me.
not_available For a while? 
not_available As long as you like.
not_available I won't sell this house.
not_available How could you? Answering the door in underwear scares off buyers.
not_available I suppose so.
not_available Chicago, huh? You need tune
not_available ups on a timely basis.
not_available Did you get it started? It won't break down? 
not_available I can at least fix cars.
not_available What? 
not_available You're good to go, boss.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Malucci.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available Was your first day all right? 
not_available Feels like I never left.
not_available You guys want to go eat? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You working tomorrow? 
not_available Me? Yeah.
not_available What a coincidence! So am I.
not_available See you, Carter.
not_available Do I have to warn you about him? 
not_available Please! How was your first day? Well, I wish I could have done more for Alyssa.
not_available At least you did something.
not_available I guess so.
not_available Why did you come back? 
not_available My program in New York closed.
not_available No, no.
not_available I mean, to medicine.
not_available Four months after I quit, I was on a subway.
not_available A guy in his forties went into cardiac arrest.
not_available He was dying.
not_available Everyone just stared at him.
not_available I suddenly realized, "I know what to do! " Jumped in, saved his life.
not_available It's a great feeling.
not_available It can be.
not_available Then I figured I'm pretty good at this.
not_available Why waste it? 
not_available Deb, you haven't changed a bit.
not_available It's Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available Good night, Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available Good night.
not_available Oh, and Deb? Welcome back.
not_available Morphine.
not_available You'll simply drift away.
not_available Won't even hurt.
not_available Is that an offer? If you tell me where the body is.
not_available Why do you care so much? 
not_available Were you serious or not? Won't you get into trouble? The Hippocratic Oath and all? You're worried about me? But I know you.
not_available As soon as you get what you want, you'll just stop.
not_available I won't.
not_available But how do I know? Are you gonna promise me, Dr.
not_available Corday? Believe me.
not_available You'll know.
not_available You'll feel yourself going.
not_available I hope you have breath enough to tell me.
not_available What if I don't? I'll crack open your chest and bring you back to life.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you? I'm glad it's you, Elizabeth.
not_available Where is she, Dean?
