motto Change is not good.
not_available Well, we're getting more Residents.
not_available We'll work twice as hard.
not_available What? 
not_available They're from Southside.
not_available Their program is less than discriminating.
not_available We'll spend half our time trying to keep them from killing the patients.
not_available Okay, I'm coming! Good morning, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I saw your car in the garage.
not_available I didn't want you to oversleep again.

not_available Would you take a look at it? 
not_available Ears really aren't my specialty.
not_available But there is a family practitioner who lives on the second floor.

not_available I'm sorry? DOAs, train wrecks who croak on the way in.
not_available Do we get points for them? Yes, you do.

not_available Let's get you in a gown first.
not_available Do you eat a lot of ice cream? Yes, actually.
not_available Drink tea? 
not_available Almost every day.

not_available What? Benton will try for an elective with her.
not_available No way.
not_available He signed up for Thoracic with the new chief.
not_available Then why did I see him reading Essentials of Pediatric Surgery? Benton and kids? It's the most difficult specialty.
not_available It is impossible to get into.
not_available It is exactly what he'd go for.
not_available I don't buy it.

not_available Tough old geezer, ain't he? So she asked you to come to Hawaii? 
not_available But I don't know what she meant.
not_available It seems unambiguous.
not_available If she meant it as a friend, that means separate hotel rooms, right? 
not_available Or you could be sharing a bed.
not_available Right.
not_available Get adjoining rooms with a broken lock and see what happens.
not_available You're not helping.
not_available What do you think she meant? Something a little more than friendship.
not_available How do you feel about that? Are you interested? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Get on a plane, Humphrey.
not_available What if that's not what she meant? Three hours divided by seven patients is 2.33.

not_available The mystery marsupia/ was sighted hopping along the Kennedy Expressway.
not_available The Department of Anima/ Contro/ is warning that kangaroos can be dangerous and can attack when threatened.
not_available Soup? So you asked him to go with you? It just popped out.
not_available Have you guys ever? No! But you asked him to go to Hawaii.
not_available That's pretty bold.
not_available It's stupid.
not_available I mean, Mark and I are friends.
not_available We work together.
not_available And I basically invited him into my bed! What did he say? He was appalled.
not_available He couldn't wait to get away from me.
not_available I'm such a fool.
not_available How long is Anspaugh gonna be? One never knows.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? What are you doing here? I admitted a woman with a lipoma.
not_available She needs surgery.
not_available A fat tumor? It can wait.

not_available Yes.
not_available Very, very happy to have her.
not_available Yes, I know.

not_available Do I sense a wind shift, Doctor? Benton.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton is one of the finest pediatric surgeons.
not_available An opportunity to work with her 
not_available She may not have a slot for you.
not_available Well, I'd like to see.
not_available I'll give you until 6:00.
not_available If I don't get the Pedes, I'm still on for Thoracic? If I don't hear from you by 6:00, you get neither.
not_available Jane, I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Doyle.
not_available I understand you've been having pain when you urinate? I think it's a bladder infection.
not_available I had one before.
not_available When was that? 
not_available Last year.
not_available Any soreness or tenderness? Just when I go to the bathroom.
not_available Are you sexually active? Have you ever had intercourse? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available We'll do some tests.
not_available When we get those back, we'll talk some more.
not_available All right.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Either an STD, or she's pregnant.
not_available Based on? 
not_available Her sweater.
not_available Cashmere, probably Neiman Marcus.
not_available A rich girl at a county ER? She doesn't want her family to know.
not_available So what do you do? Dip a urine and do a pregnancy test.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available Sorry, the O.R.
not_available S are booked.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton sends his apologies 
not_available He can send flowers for all I care.
not_available You've got a breast reconstruction and a thyroidectomy ahead of you.
not_available This is important.
not_available What is it? It's a pheochromocytoma.
not_available A pheo.
not_available Her BP is through the roof.
not_available If we don't go in soon, she'll stroke out.
not_available Tell Dr.
not_available Benton he has his O.R.
not_available And tell him I like tulips.
not_available If you have an explanation, I'm listening.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I haven't been feeling well.
not_available I got nauseous.
not_available If it interferes with your work, you should let me know.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available Everything else okay? Yeah.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available How's Al? He's holding his own.
not_available It's difficult.
not_available I'm sure it is.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available I need to see Dr.
not_available Keaton.
not_available You're too late.
not_available The patient's still conscious.
not_available Come back in three hours.
not_available I need to talk to her.
not_available You don't know Dr.
not_available Keaton very well.
not_available Just by reputation.
not_available Why? If you go in there now, the only words she'll have for you are, "Get out." If I write a note, will you see she gets it? I am not a secretary.
not_available Leave it in her box.
not_available Mr.
not_available Johnson, your father was found unconscious this morning.
not_available He has what we call multisystem failure.
not_available Heart, lungs, kidneys.
not_available And he may have suffered a stroke as well.
not_available That's like Alzheimer's.
not_available No.
not_available But it's very serious.
not_available Did you ever talk with your father about whether he wanted to use machines to keep him alive if his body were failing? Not a lot, no.
not_available Were you and he close? About a hundred miles.
not_available I live in Boone County.
not_available I smoke hams.
not_available Your father is very ill.
not_available In all likelihood he may never regain consciousness.
not_available Now, we can use a machine to keep his body alive or we can give him medication to take care of his pain and let nature take its course.
not_available As next of kin, it's your decision.
not_available What do you think? If it were my father I would try to make him comfortable in his final moments.
not_available Okay.
not_available So I'll get somebody to bring you the papers? You'll help him, right? I'm sorry? 
not_available You'll make him better.
not_available I'm not sure that we can.
not_available Just don't let him die, okay? Make the incision below the costal margin.
not_available Straight across, 6 cm.
not_available Now, just like carpentry, measure twice, cut once.
not_available Right.
not_available Benton, you should've told me you were doing a pheo.
not_available Trying to keep all the exotic ones to yourself? What? I'm doing a lipoma removal.
not_available It's on the board.
not_available "Pheochromocytoma" in big red letters.
not_available Who the hell put it up there? That one.
not_available Hey, Carter! Simon's letting me do an appy.
not_available I'm going in! No.
not_available It's called gonorrhea.
not_available It's sexually transmitted.
not_available It is treatable.
not_available But we have to do it right away.
not_available Are you gonna tell my parents? Whether you tell your parents or not is up to you.
not_available I would tell the boy, or boys, that you've had sex with.
not_available I only did it once.
not_available Well, you need to tell him.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why is that? Because he won't talk to me.
not_available When I see him in the halls, he won't even look at me.
not_available I feel really disgusting.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That's all right.
not_available I wanted it to be special.
not_available And it was like I wasn't even there.
not_available He didn't even drive me home.
not_available Guys who are interested in having sex with you aren't necessarily interested in you, you know? If you want it to be special, you'll have to wait for the right guy.
not_available I would suggest waiting a long time.
not_available Like until you can vote.
not_available So Mr.
not_available Johnson's in V
not_available tach.
not_available Paddles? Why not? Charge? You pick.
not_available Two hundred? Two hundred, it is.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Next contestant.
not_available Do I hear 300? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Three hundred from the woman in the floral scrubs.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available I'll see your 300 and raise you 360.
not_available What a joke.
not_available 360.
not_available Clear! And he's back.
not_available What a trouper! Congratulations! You are the lucky winner of a brandnew ventilator at a cost of $5000 a day and as a bonus, your very own chest x
not_available ray perfect for decorating the small, sterile hospital room where you'll spend the rest of your brief, unconscious life.
not_available She's still in there? It's 4:00.
not_available She went back in.
not_available She's got a 4year
not_available old with a Wilms' tumor.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm just seeing if she got my note.
not_available Look, when Dr.
not_available Keaton comes out, please please make sure that she gets this.
not_available I'm Peter Benton.
not_available I'm interested in a Pediatric Surgery elective.
not_available I need to talk to her by 6:00.
not_available My pager is 
not_available 3376.
not_available I can read! Look, just make sure she gets it, okay? You always vomit when you screw up? Only when I get written up by the chief of staff.
not_available Ten mgs of Compazine should get your stomach back on its feet.
not_available You missed a great appendectomy.
not_available I could lose my Residency.
not_available Retracted the internal oblique, clamped that sucker.
not_available My career is over.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You assisted on a surgery behind my back? 
not_available Simon needed an intern.
not_available I'm your Resident.
not_available You don't blink without asking me.
not_available You're on bedsore duty.
not_available If there's a boil, you lance it.
not_available If there's a weeping decubitus, you d Ábride it.
not_available And if Anspaugh's leading chief rounds in 20 minutes.
not_available Don't be late.
not_available Especially you, Carter.
not_available He asked for you by name.
not_available I can't believe I spent four years in med school to take orders from a guy who smokes hams.
not_available Other than that, how's your day? 
not_available Just got worse.
not_available Who does this belong to? 
not_available That's mine.
not_available Wear it.
not_available We lose 20 or 30 a year.
not_available Who invented the stethoscope? I have no idea.
not_available Ren Á La Çnnec, 1819.
not_available You can see I taught her well.
not_available Keep hustling, boys.
not_available You don't wanna end up with the Turtle Wax.
not_available I haven't seen you much today.
not_available It's been a pretty busy one.
not_available So you've been busy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pretty much.
not_available So about Hawaii.
not_available How much are the hotel rooms? Rooms? Or a room.
not_available For me.
not_available I'll have to check on that.
not_available You let me know.
not_available Sure.
not_available Here! Turn on Channel 5 quickly.
not_available They spotted him again.
not_available He was at the rail yard an hour ago.
not_available I hope he made it through.
not_available That kangaroo watch continues.
not_available The kangaroo that mysteriously appeared on Chicago streets entered this abandoned building at the corner of Kensey and Maplewood.
not_available That's six blocks from my house! Armed Fish and Wildlife officers have surrounded the building in an attempt to apprehend him.
not_available They won't shoot him? I hope so.
not_available That thing looks like a giant rat.
not_available You paged me? Where's the patient? There is no patient.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available About what? 
not_available About my working here.
not_available Are you planning to tell anyone that I'm positive? No, I'm not.
not_available I don't agree with what you're doing but how you handle your patients, that's your responsibility.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But stay away from my patients.
not_available And I don't wanna be in a trauma room with you.
not_available That girl had her ceftriaxone.
not_available Should I write a scrip? Ten days of doxycycline.
not_available And tell her to stay away from insincere suitors.
