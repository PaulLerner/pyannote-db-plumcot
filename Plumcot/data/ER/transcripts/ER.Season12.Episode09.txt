not_available I think you're agreeable.

not_available Active duty servicemen can get married the same day.
not_available Bingo.
not_available Watch where you're headed.

not_available So the rumors are true? Yes.
not_available I'd like you to be my bridesmaid.
not_available Maid of honor, whatever they call it.
not_available Well, normally I'd say no, because of the taffeta dress and matching peau de soie shoes but because you've had a complete brain lapse Look, we love each other.
not_available We wanna be together.
not_available But today? We thought it'd be kind of crazy, something good we can tell our Anyway, his tour's over.
not_available What if he gets stationed in, like, Romania? He's hoping to finish his training in stateside Army hospital.
not_available I'm not saying he's not a great guy.
not_available He is, but do you know him? Of course, I do.
not_available He's incredibly kind, generousMy dry
not_available cleaning guy is kind and generous.
not_available Where's the prednisone? Left bottom shelf.
not_available I know him.
not_available I do.
not_available Does he fold the newspaper inside out when he reads it and then forgets to put it back when he is done? Clips his toenails in bed? Drips when the toilet seat's down? 
not_available Abby.
not_available Likes jam on his grilled cheese? 
not_available I can learn during the marriage.
not_available Yes, but I don't think that's
not_available I love Michael and I could use a little support here.
not_available I am very happy for you, I really am.
not_available And, of course, I'll stand up for you.
not_available I wouldn't miss it.
not_available Great.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, you got a moment? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Walk with me? All right.
not_available This young man, K.J.
not_available Thibeaux? You've been sponsoring him as a Volunteen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He got in the surgical floor storeroom, stole a digital video camera.
not_available What? Get out of here.
not_available I don't wanna make a big issue as long as he's willing to admit it, give it back, it doesn't go any further.
not_available Who told you it was K.J.? 
not_available The chief of security.
not_available One of his guards reported it.
not_available He's sure about this? Surveillance cameras.
not_available Everything's on tape.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All right, I'll talk to him.
not_available He's just a teenager
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Jack Gitts, 38, high
not_available speed MVC, no medical history.

not_available Did he say, Jerry? 
not_available I thought you knew.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Cantaloupe allergy is waiting for the Benadryl to kick in.
not_available Infected nose piercing is home on Keflex.
not_available She did it herself with a thumbtack.
not_available That's sexy.
not_available Is she single? And platelets are back on my drunk head lac.
not_available A little low, 98, and INR is 1.4.
not_available Yeah, borderline.
not_available Still, I'd like to give platelets and FFP.
not_available Yeah, go ahead.
not_available Even a tiny bleed can become serious if she can't clot.
not_available It's possibly a good idea, Dr.
not_available Kovac but you do realize that blood products carry the risk of infection and transfusion reaction, don't you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, was the CT negative? There's no bleed that we could see.
not_available Do you wanna expose your patient to those risks because her platelets are low? Scan was four hours ago.
not_available She might have a delayed bleed.
not_available I'd worry more if she had mental status changes or a focal neuro exam.
not_available He's got a point.
not_available She's drunk so that's hard to assess.
not_available Drunk people get sober.
not_available And careful observation is still better than any lab.
not_available That's right.
not_available I'd have to agree.
not_available What just happened? They've been pulling that on me all morning.
not_available I don't know, some sort of competitive agreeing contest? 
not_available I wouldn't steal any stupid camera.
not_available Did you hear what I said? 
not_available They got you on tape.
not_available Couldn't have been me.
not_available You were up there long enough.
not_available They had to look for that infuser thing.
not_available Don't give me that crap, K.J.
not_available Okay.
not_available There's this girl, one of the volunteers she's fine as hell
not_available I went out on a limb for you.
not_available I thought having you here was gonna teach you something.
not_available Then you go and do this.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available You know what? Your father's on his way here.
not_available So for now, go sit in the waiting room.
not_available But, Dr.
not_available Pratt
not_available Waiting room.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Got a second line? 
not_available Vein keeps blowing.
not_available Run first unit of O
not_available neg.
not_available Hold four more units ready to go.
not_available So where's the reception gonna be? He needs central access.
not_available They haven't decided yet.
not_available I'd go to Baby Joon's.
not_available La Chiquita Roja is more romantic.
not_available Neela, place a subclavian.
not_available Cordis and sterile sixes.
not_available What was the other place? 
not_available The Mandarin Club.
not_available No way.
not_available That's a bad idea.
not_available Turn his head to the left.
not_available Systolic's 84.
not_available I like The Mandarin.
not_available Got a flash.
not_available Should definitely do Chiquita Roja.
not_available Candles, white table cloths, you know.

not_available Very good.
not_available So where are you registered? What?

not_available Could someone get SonoSite? My ex
not_available wife didn't, we ended up with clocks.
not_available With my sister, salad bowls.
not_available Seven of them.
not_available Does anybody mind if we just focus on the patient? Okay, then.
not_available Can we have that SonoSite, please? Neela.
not_available Can you get away? 
not_available We need to go get a license.
not_available We don't know where to get married.
not_available We do.
not_available Hospital chapel.
not_available When did we decide that? You were busy, I thought youAnd Jerry's gonna marry us? Yeah, he has some kind of minister's license, so I
not_available Is that really who we want? What's Frank gonna be, the ring bearer? We don't have a lot of time.
not_available I had to make some choices.
not_available Are you gonna choose the flowers too? 
not_available No, no.
not_available But you like lilies, right? 
not_available Michael, we have to talk.
not_available About what? I think this is getting a little
not_available Dr.
not_available Gallant.
not_available The groom isn't supposed to see the bride on the wedding day.
not_available Well, we have a few details to work out.
not_available Nothing that can't wait, I hope.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra's scrubbing in on this.
not_available I am? Yeah.
not_available You did that open lap in the street.
not_available I think I can trust you in a sterile operating room.
not_available You're not getting cold feet, are you? We'll talk later.
not_available Are his vaccinations upto
not_available date? His pediatrician and I don't believe in them.
not_available Immunizations are probably one of the most successful public health interventions ever developed.
not_available Thank you, but it's a personal decision.
not_available Did you know the air has He's studying the atmosphere in school.
not_available Well, that's very cool.
not_available He's sitting at 94, which is low, but nothing dangerous.
not_available It probably has to do with the fluid I heard in his lungs.
not_available I'd like to get a chest x
not_available ray, which is nothing scary.
not_available It's just a special kind of photograph and it doesn't hurt at all.
not_available My uncle Deaver had one of those and we got to see all his bones.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available I don't want x
not_available rays, if possible.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Kenig, I'm pretty sure Stewy has pneumonia.
not_available Well, can't you just treat it then, and we can avoid the radiation? Well, it's a small amount.
not_available It just helps us have a look at what we're dealing with.
not_available Glenda's waking up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Wouldn't you go with antibiotics anyway? Okay.
not_available He needs extra oxygen, he's gonna have to spend the night.
not_available Okay, that will be fine.
not_available Then, we'll hold off on the film for now, but if he gets any worse He gets x
not_available rayed.
not_available He says he didn't do it.
not_available D, I don't like this any better than you do, man.
not_available He wouldn't lie.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Did he lie about the tagging? Or the weed they found in his pocket? Look, K.J.'s a good kid, but right now, his judgment basically sucks.
not_available I wanna talk to this Doctor 
not_available Dubenko.
not_available Yeah, the security guard too.
not_available D, they don't wanna press charges, man.
not_available But they're accusing my kid, I just wanna talk to them.
not_available Banana bag is finished and she took a few ice chips.
not_available Who are you? I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available You're at County General.
not_available Let's see if you can sit up on your own, okay? She should be sobering up by now.
not_available Glenda, can you squeeze my hand? Let's see.
not_available Try and squeeze my hand.
not_available Squeeze my hand.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you open your eyes? Glenda, come on.
not_available Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Over here, right over here.
not_available And do you know who I am? Who are you? Must have cleared 30 patients and no one's brawling yet.
not_available See? It's not that hard, is it? Like the man 
said "Can't we just all get along?" Sam, weren't we sending the cracked Broviac up to IR? Don't you want a CBC first? 
not_available Yes, you're right.
not_available Sam, the labs done on Mrs.
not_available Garvey? 
not_available Just checked, be another half hour.
not_available Dr.

not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Dr.

not_available Hey, that sounds like a movie, like, Something Not Right About Glenda.
not_available A body snatchers thing, shaky camera.
not_available Morris.
not_available I wanna re
not_available scan her.
not_available Really? Why? Because she's altered.
not_available But she's a drunk, how can you tell? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente, why don't you
not_available ? Why don't we let Dr.
not_available Lockhart present the case? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available She's disoriented.
not_available She's repeating questions.
not_available I just wanna get another CT.
not_available How long here? 
not_available About six hours.
not_available Luka, your malrotation in Exam 4 is puking blood.
not_available I'll check back.
not_available Yeah, well
not_available Is she responding to commands? Yes.
not_available Hand squeeze and eye opening.
not_available Rule of thumb, if the patient's exam is non
not_available focal and responding to commands, just observe and wait.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente, Ortho on line 2.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay? Yeah, I'm gonna re
not_available scan her.
not_available Call CT, let them know we're on the way.
not_available Have the blood bank send a unit of FFP and six pack of platelets.
not_available You sure about that? 
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available What's this, your bachelor party? There's not gonna be one of those.
not_available Well, you didn't give me much time to plan it, having your wedding today.
not_available I don't think there's gonna be one of those either.
not_available What? So I don't get to be your best man? I mean, you were gonna ask me, right? I don't know, man.
not_available I
not_available You know, maybe this was just all too fast.
not_available You know, man, I think she's scared.
not_available Well, it is kind of a strong move to the hoop, man.
not_available Yeah, but I was gonna ask her before.
not_available But I
not_available You know, over in Iraq, guys got married the week they shipped out.
not_available I know, because I worked on them.
not_available Arms missing, legs gone.
not_available Faces half blown off.
not_available But they were in the most pain about pain they're gonna cause somebody else.
not_available So I told myself, if I ever made it through this
not_available And you did.
not_available So you asked her now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, II mean, kind of, I
not_available Kind of? Is this French rap? Supa Crew.

not_available I can't understand any of them.
not_available You want contrast with this? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh, ugly.
not_available Glenda? Glenda?

not_available While you were jerking off, she was bleeding in her head.
not_available BP's 170 over 110.
not_available What did you tell her to do? Same thing you would have, observation but she was responding to commands at the time.
not_available Go order the platelets.
not_available I already did.
not_available If I'd waited for you to sign off on this, she'd be dead.
not_available Neurosurgeon is ready for her.
not_available Can we agree she needs to go to O.
not_available R.? Good.
not_available Throwing PVCs.
not_available Can't see well enough to find it.

not_available Gallant? Go ahead.
not_available You know, when I was away thinking about you gave me some other place to be.
not_available Someplace peaceful, where I could belong.
not_available Now, maybe all of this has been too fast and I know that's scary and maybe I didn't ask you the right way.
not_available But I just want us to be together.
not_available So I'm asking you now, Neela.
not_available Will you marry me? Will you marry me today? Harry Royman, 70, fell through ice playing hockey on a pond.
not_available Doing what? 
not_available I know, it sounds stupid.
not_available Not only does it sound stupid

not_available You are coming, right? Yeah, went home at lunch, got my best suit.
not_available Wish us luck.

not_available Crackles, might have aspirated water.
not_available Sats only 88.
not_available He needs an airway.
not_available I got it.
not_available Dr.

not_available Tube.
not_available Prep for bilateral chest tubes for pleural irrigation.
not_available Um, with all due respect, Dr.
not_available Weaver, peritoneal dialysis is better.
not_available Greater capacity for heat exchange, warms the solid organs faster.
not_available It's an interesting approach.
not_available That's what the Navy SEALs do.
not_available Really.
not_available Proceed, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, Betadine and a DPL tray.
not_available So you never actually saw him? Told you, I see him all the time.

not_available Sorry, they've been at this for a couple of days.
not_available How many people have keys to the storeroom?

not_available Then let us see the tape.
not_available Gotta get the chief's approval.

not_available Weaver.
not_available I think we should use bretylium instead.
not_available What? They took that out of the ACLS guideline years ago.
not_available But there was a study in the '80s.
not_available That's your reference? Something from the '80s? Yes, it is.
not_available It clearly showed bretylium to be the anti
not_available arrhythmic of choice in hypothermia.
not_available Core temp's up to 89.

not_available No tapes at all? 
not_available No.
not_available K.J.
not_available did nothing wrong.
not_available Camera's missing and this fat
not_available ass figures it must have been the black kid.
not_available There was absolutely no excuse for it, it was an unconscionable thing to do.
not_available Where's McCauley working tomorrow? 
not_available Not here.
not_available Listen, Mr.
not_available Thibeaux, from what everybody's been saying it sounds like K.J.

not_available Why don't you go tell that to K.J.? Yeah.
not_available Sure you don't want anything?

not_available All right? Where is everybody? Hi, I'm Maureen, can I help you? Who are you?

not_available Well, like you said, I'm not good at being agreeable.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available You implied it.
not_available I said, it was a lot to ask, and it turns out I was right.
not_available Not that I'm happy about it.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available I'm gonna be really late.

not_available Auto
not_available induced hypothermia will protect the brain.
not_available All right, everybody, way to go.
not_available Is he okay? Your friend's gonna spend the night in ICU.
not_available But he's stable and he has a good chance for recovery.
not_available Thank you all so much.
not_available Mr.
not_available Spevacek, you are absolutely welcome.
not_available Okay, take out the DPL catheters and get him a unit bed.
not_available Hey, it was a good job, man.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Suction.
not_available Heart rate's dropping.
not_available Give me cricoid.
not_available Abby's pneumonia patient? Is she gone? Honey 
not_available Let's worry about the airway.
not_available Respiratory distress, not moving air.
not_available Send the blood gas.
not_available Tell me what's going on.
not_available Pulse is 47, pull out.
not_available No, I got it.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Color change.
not_available His oxygen level was dangerously low.
not_available We had to take over his breathing.
not_available X
not_available ray's up.
not_available No, it doesn't look good.
not_available No wonder he's hypoxic.
not_available Hey, Kovac.
not_available Took me a while to get the mom to agree.
not_available She didn't want radiation.
not_available Not Stewy's biggest problem, but interstitial infiltrates.
not_available Look here.
not_available Maybe staph aureus? Could be MRSA.
not_available We should add vanco.
not_available Check out the white count.
not_available 0.4? 
not_available It should be through the roof.
not_available Unless he hasn't any left.
not_available Then this is PCP pneumonia.
not_available Any reason for this kid to be immunosuppressed? Chemo? Steroids? Nothing in the history.
not_available All right, who's gonna ask the mom? Mrs.
not_available Kenig, the type of lung infection your son has We ran a number of tests
not_available I didn't say you could do that.
not_available He was about to stop breathing.
not_available We needed to know why.
not_available The tests showed your son has pneumocystis pneumonia.
not_available It's a type of infection we only see when the immune system is not working.
not_available We'd like to test your son for HIV.
not_available And if he does have the virus, we can recommend medications
not_available Here we go with the viral theory of AIDS.
not_available Invented so biotech companies could charge people 50 bucks a pop for some bogus test when they're actually dying from real problems.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Real problems? Pollution, drug addiction, toxins, but nobody wants to deal with those.
not_available It's better to call it a virus and sell a vaccine.
not_available The easy fix.
not_available I have talked to 50 doctors since I've been diagnosed and it's always the same thing.
not_available HIV causes AIDS
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available You're infected? I'm not infected with anything.
not_available I carry the HIV virus as do millions of other healthy people.
not_available You don't believe HIV causes AIDS? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Oh, lady, you're nuts.
not_available I was diagnosed 14 years ago.
not_available I haven't been sick a day in my life.
not_available So you didn't take AZT while you were pregnant? Why? 
not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available Prevent your child from getting AIDS, which is what Stewy might have.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available Are you so sure AZT doesn't cause AIDS? Everyone knows it suppresses the immune system.
not_available Lady, you are out there, okay? I'm a conspiracy freak too, don't get me wrong.
not_available Drug companies are trying to screw us.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Your child has a life
not_available threatening disease and you jeopardize his life to prove your theories you're just as bad as they are.
not_available If he dies, will you be happy? Dr.
not_available Clemente, I'll take care of this, okay? She knew she was infected with HIV, she did nothing to protect her child.
not_available It's the most moronic, selfish So you're saying you never even had Stewy tested? No.
not_available What about Patricia? 
not_available There you are.
not_available They're waiting.
not_available What's going on? Scheduling conflict.
not_available You could have put a note.
not_available And you, on time.
not_available Take one.
not_available We're stealing their flowers? Just take one.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available Come on.
not_available Child Life took Patricia up to play some video games.
not_available I asked about their father.
not_available He's not in the picture.
not_available She will let us treat the pneumonia, but won't consent to an HIV test and doesn't even wanna discuss medication.
not_available If we don't get this boy on a cocktail How do people get like this? When my son Alex was 5 the doctor thought he might have meningitis.
not_available Wanted to do a spinal tap on him.
not_available I'm a nurse, and I didn't want him to do it.
not_available I was worried and scared.
not_available I didn't want anything hurting my kid.
not_available I don't want anything hurting Stewy.
not_available Stewy is already hurting, Mrs.
not_available Kenig.
not_available Everyone is entitled to their beliefs.
not_available But the truth here, in this room, right now, is that if you let this go on there's not gonna be a doctor that can help him.
not_available He only has you.
not_available Why do we have to go through the kitchen? Because Michael and Neela are waiting by the front door.
not_available It's not a surprise party.
not_available Oh, Abby.
not_available Oh, man, this isn't every bride's dream come true.
not_available Come on.
not_available That's a nice tie.
not_available Thanks, and a lovely outfit as well.
not_available Better without the lab coat.
not_available What are we waiting for? 
not_available I've no idea.
not_available Where have you been? Take that and that.
not_available Hey.
not_available What happened to the chapel? 
not_available Scheduling conflict.
not_available Yes, I know that.
not_available No, but 
not_available Shh.
not_available She still won't change her mind about Patricia? Says she's a healthy young girl.
not_available She doesn't need any testing.
not_available Gonna have to get a court order.
not_available Well, at least she's gonna let us help Stewy.
not_available One out of two, that's something.
not_available I'm going up with them to the PICU.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Hey, so the wacko finally gave in, huh? 
not_available No thanks to you.
not_available Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just had to yell at her.
not_available I just Listen, I hope there won't be any hard feelings but Kerry let me know I'm gonna be the new ER chief.
not_available That's awesome.
not_available That's awesome.
not_available You know, when I withdrew my name, I was hoping they'd pick you.
not_available You withdrew your name? 
not_available Yeah, I just have a lot of stuff going on.
not_available Long story, man.
not_available You're the best guy for the job.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Going to the wedding reception? 
not_available I'd love to, I really would but Maureen here, way in over her head.
not_available Doesn't know where the forks and knives go.
not_available I'm gonna supervise her a little bit.
not_available If you know what I mean.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Do we have to call you "chief" now? 
not_available Very funny.
not_available If you're interviewed, do they 
say "We're here at County talking to Chief Kovac.
not_available " They don't do it that way.
not_available I'm just saying I think it's cute if it's a guy.
not_available And if the chief is a woman? I don't think women should be put in positions of leadership.
not_available Do you? Peanut? Young love.
not_available They just have to show it off to everybody.
not_available Here's to discretion.
not_available Propriety.
not_available Maturity.
not_available Well 
not_available No, no, not that.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available That will be me someday.
not_available Yup, that's gonna be me.
not_available I should have said something earlier.
not_available Excuse me? I should have said something earlier.
not_available But I want you to know that I have a lot of respect for how you handled that trauma today.
not_available And there was some truth in what you said about me being up in administration.
not_available I'm a little out of practice.
not_available But I want you to know that I'm gonna start spending more time down in the ER.
not_available Morris! Yeah! Now, we really want to thank everybody.
not_available Well, you said that already.
not_available When we get settled, I want all of you to come over and visit us.
not_available And you can all come and visit me tomorrow morning at work, 7 a.
not_available m.
not_available Really, we love you all, thank you.
not_available Yeah, and we're leaving now.
not_available Good night.
not_available Where they going on their honeymoon? 
not_available My apartment.
not_available I don't remember Okay, well, thanks for the ride.
not_available That bad, huh? 
not_available No.
not_available I would just keep your day job.
not_available What? You never sing in the car? You know, when you're alone? Sometimes I do, yeah, but you're not alone in the car.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I'm just kidding.
not_available Would you like to? 
not_available Come on, we can make it.
not_available You try running with a sari on.
not_available What a day! What a night! We're actually married.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you really think we should be doing this? I do.
