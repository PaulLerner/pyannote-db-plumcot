not_available Alone.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available So you guys wanna watch some TV? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available All right.
not_available Pizza will be in the fridge.
not_available Kind of sad, huh? What's that? 
not_available The guy was a teacher.
not_available And he killed his daughter.
not_available Because of alcohol.
not_available It happens.
not_available Doesn't have to.
not_available What are you trying to say? I just think it's sad.
not_available Tell me what you' re trying to say.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available You want me to talk to you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wanna help you.
not_available But not because I'm a nice guy or because I'm worried about you.
not_available But because I wanna be with you.
not_available You wanna fix me.
not_available Help you.
not_available Fix me so I'm good enough.
not_available No, I want it to work.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm not broken.
not_available Ms.
not_available Corday.
not_available I see you ordered that CT on Mr.
not_available McKay.
not_available Yes.
not_available After 20 minutes of chatting, I came to the same conclusion.
not_available CT confirmed dissection.
not_available So you' re carrying on all right then, are you? Carrying on? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Well, I suppose you can still grieve on the inside.
not_available While I'm sure that's some kind of criticism I'm afraid I haven't got time to decipher it.
not_available You' re not in black dress.
not_available Matter of fact, you' re not in a dress at all.
not_available Perhaps America has confused you in more ways than one.
not_available Interesting.
not_available Yes.
not_available I thought I might suggest you reconsider that tie as it makes you look like a boorish, virulent ponce.
not_available But now I realize that's simply your general disposition so it would be out of place for me to comment.
not_available Out of place indeed.
not_available Tragic, really.
not_available A woman out of place on two continents.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available They sold your house.
not_available Ten thousand more than the asking.
not_available If you sign it, I'll fax it back for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I would like to read it myself, thank you.
not_available DAY 13 What's wrong with your lunch today, Dr.
not_available Romano? Your body needs nourishment to heal itself.
not_available That's brilliant.
not_available They teach you that in nursing school? If you don't eat, I'm gonna tell Dr.
not_available Gunn.
not_available Oh, go ahead, tell Gunn.
not_available I've seen his work.
not_available You might as well have your prosthetics department come fit me for a hook.
not_available I'll see if I can find you something else.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Kerry, I was wondering when you were gonna come and visit me.
not_available I was here yesterday and the day before.
not_available You were a little out of it.
not_available Re
not_available carpeting my office? How are you feeling? I've been better.
not_available The surgery went well.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So they say.
not_available But you know how surgeons lie.
not_available You were lucky.
not_available Lucky? Look, your people rallied around to save you in a deserted hospital.
not_available If it wasn't for Dr.
not_available Kovac
not_available I'd still have my arm.
not_available You do have your arm.
not_available Do I? Yes.
not_available It was a clean cut aboveI signed the third
not_available quarter income projections.
not_available We should evacuate the hospital once a year for the money we' re saving.
not_available Robert
not_available Going to sleep now.
not_available Apparently, I need my rest.
not_available Identified the terminal ileum.
not_available Bovie.
not_available We call it electrocautery, Elizabeth.
not_available Can I help you? A solo hemicolectomy? Not by design.
not_available Your Professor Whitehead decided to be tardy.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available He's apparently saving a motorist on the M1.
not_available Asked me if I'd fill in.
not_available But it seems you've already started.
not_available Transverse incision.
not_available Splendid.
not_available Allows for a more localized approach.
not_available Yes, and a bloody one.
not_available Suction.
not_available The field is clear.
not_available Let's just take a look, shall we? Elizabeth? 
not_available Be my guest.
not_available Well, good separation around the taut.
not_available The areolar tissue could use better division, couldn't it? Metzenbaum.
not_available May I continue now, please? 
not_available The more I see, the better he'll do.
not_available If you merely wish to peer around this gentleman's anatomy why don't you crack open his skull too? No, I'm interested in completely excising this gentleman's cancer, thank you.
not_available Vascular clips.
not_available Okay, then, he's all yours.
not_available Retract the cecum medially.
not_available Retraction.
not_available Well, you heard him.
not_available Retraction.
not_available Watch the pericolic gutter.
not_available He's had some adhesions from an appendectomy.
not_available DAY 14 
not_available Morning, Frank.
not_available Welcome back, Dr.
not_available Weaver.

not_available Disease Control clear you? 
not_available One hundred percent.
not_available Probed every which way.
not_available I don't need to hear details.
not_available Did we get all our monitors back? IMEDs, pro
not_available packs and portable vents.
not_available Crash carts are stocked and ready.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available We' re closed for two weeks and they make us come back at 6 a.m.? It could have been midnight.
not_available I'll catch you quacks later.
not_available I see you' re better.
not_available I was never that bad.
not_available I told you guys not to sweat it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, Dr.
not_available Gallant called in sick.
not_available I need you to cover for him until 3.
not_available What? 
not_available Well, you just said you felt good.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available But, come on, man
not_available Kidding, Pratt.
not_available See you next week.
not_available Can you sign this? 
not_available What is it? My timecard.
not_available Two straight weeks of overtime.
not_available Do you think I'm kidding? Dermatologically clear.
not_available Afebrile.
not_available Okay, you' re free to go.
not_available What, no psych consult? We try not to inflict any long
not_available term damage.
not_available She's borderline.
not_available Thank you for your understanding 
not_available and cooperation.
not_available Hey, can you tell us? What? 
not_available If the virus was engineered or natural? The system worked.
not_available Everyone did their jobs, especially at the local level.
not_available You' re not gonna tell us.
not_available See you, Deb.
not_available Yeah, it was fun, Carter.
not_available Let's get these beds made up so we' re not setting up as we go.
not_available Chuny, you triage? 
not_available Yes.
not_available On my way.
not_available Hey, you survived.
not_available Hi.
not_available You look tan.
not_available I went to Barbados.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Barbados! I had two weeks.
not_available What else was I supposed to do? 
not_available Frank, what time is it? Okay.
not_available We' re open.
not_available ER.
not_available They just get out, themselves? He has to leave the trach in for a few days, but he's off the vent.
not_available They look better, the parents.
not_available Well, maybe they stopped blaming each other.
not_available Weird.
not_available What? Stuck here two weeks, I don't wanna go home.
not_available Wanna get some breakfast? 
not_available No.
not_available You' re not thinking of jumping? No.
not_available Not quite that desperate.
not_available Can I join you? 
not_available It's your hospital.
not_available Yes, it is, isn't it? So, what's wrong with the surgical lounge? Habit, I suppose.
not_available At County, we often go up on the roof when the place gets too much for us.
not_available I'm glad everything there isn't perfect.
not_available I was beginning to develop an inferiority complex.
not_available Far from it.
not_available Homesick then? Yes, you do.
not_available What? Have a home.
not_available Can't bring yourself to sell it, I understand.
not_available I assume Mr.
not_available Cummins survived his hemicolectomy without further incident.
not_available We do seem to manage here from time to time.
not_available You hadn't developed vertigo yet as a teen.
not_available Reminds me of your tree
not_available climbing days.
not_available The headmistress couldn't get you out of that sycamore.
not_available I had to drive all the way down to Tunbridge Wells.
not_available A counselor was brought in, suggested some kind of rebellion, separation anxiety cry for attention, what have you.
not_available Turned out you just liked climbing trees.
not_available I knew that.
not_available You were an unbridled spirit from the womb.
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available I know, darling.
not_available I know.
not_available Here, let me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is the right train for Heathrow? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You off on holiday? No, we're going home.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Stand clear of the doors, please.
not_available The train is about to depart.
not_available What have you got there? What have you got there? 
not_available The 
7 59 train from Ealing Broadway and Reading West is now departing for Heathrow.
not_available Chaos theory? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available A virus mutates in the Congo, we evacuate an ER in Chicago 
not_available Romano gets his arm cut off.
not_available You lost me.
not_available Seemingly random events, all part of a larger equation.
not_available I'm hot.
not_available You know, a butterfly flaps its wings in China and creates a tornado halfway around the world.
not_available Are you hot? 
not_available I'm just saying that there's an unpredictability about everything.
not_available Evolution, life, love, relationships So, what am I? The butterfly or tornado? 
not_available No, you' re chaos in general.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No, I'm just saying you' re chaos to me.
not_available The unknown.
not_available I'm chaos to you.
not_available You are hardly chaos, Carter.
not_available I'm saying that there's a risk in anything you do.
not_available But don't you wanna stack the odds in your favor? I mean, I'm drawn to you.
not_available It's kind of that simple.
not_available I've been drawn to you for two years.
not_available But chaos always seems to rule.
not_available And I don't want it to rule.
not_available I wanna know where it's taking me.
not_available Know what I mean? 
not_available Nope.
not_available The tornado.
not_available Definitely the tornado.
not_available Are you coming in?
