not_available BUN's 45.
not_available Creatinine, 2.
not_available BP's 180/110.
not_available Suggesting what? 
not_available Heart failure, renal insufficiency.
not_available None of this attributable to our lifesaving, aortic
not_available aneurysm surgery.
not_available I'm worried about her paraplegia.
not_available It's too soon to say if it's not temporary.
not_available Course of action? Increase cardiac output so we can send her to a long
not_available term care facility.
not_available Get her off our service.
not_available Exactly.
not_available How? Given her condition, I'd suggest dobutamine IV.
not_available They wouldn't accept her in a nursing home with an IV.
not_available Anybody else? Mr.
not_available Carter, a thought? On dobutamine, she'll be better for a few days but she'll decompensate and come back here.
not_available Maybe an ACE inhibitor? 
not_available We could do that.
not_available Worsens her renal problem.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Nitrates.
not_available Decreases her preload.
not_available Digoxin? 
not_available Kidneys can't clear it.
not_available Diuretics? 
not_available Decreases her cardiac output.
not_available Quite the conundrum.
not_available There's a solution.
not_available A pinch of this, a touch of that.
not_available We have to use our clinical judgment.
not_available How many are you carrying? 
not_available Five, but I can handle another one.
not_available Show us what you can do without resorting to Dr.

not_available And I'm gonna go see how your brother Trey's doing, okay? Where's Doug? 
not_available Trauma 1.

not_available Sounds like a press release for welfare reform.
not_available That's all we need.
not_available Less money trickling down to keep these kids from starving to death.
not_available When the kids are cleaned up, I'll take them to Columbus/Maryville.
not_available They're malnourished, dehydrated, electrolytes are screwed up and they've got infections.

not_available What does what mean? "These people.
not_available " 
not_available Come on.
not_available Partner, catch.
not_available Why can't these black folks take care of their kids, right? 
not_available He didn't say that.
not_available That's what he meant.
not_available Then I would have said it.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available David Duke's enlightening us.
not_available Oh, Malik, that's not fair.
not_available Think those kids deserve to live like that? What about personal responsibility? You think it's equal? 
not_available He's the surgeon.
not_available I'm the fireman.
not_available You would find it that simple.
not_available The system works the same for all.
not_available It works pretty well for you.
not_available You don't know a damn thing about what works for me.
not_available Peter, I've been paging you.

not_available Where were you? 
not_available On rounds, which you pulled me off.
not_available I thought you were assigned to the ER.
not_available No, I'm assigned to the surgical service.
not_available I cover the ER.
not_available And when I'm paged, someone should be waiting for me.
not_available We've been a little busy today.
not_available Almost over, Michael.
not_available Almost.
not_available He doesn't have a hernia.
not_available Check him again.
not_available You're wasting my time.

not_available It's not there! Check him again.
not_available Still reducible.
not_available I'll put him on a surgical schedule.
not_available I'll operate tomorrow.
not_available Draw pre

not_available You're poking around like you're stuffing a turkey.
not_available Telling him he needs surgery.
not_available He's never seen a doctor.

not_available Good skills, but may not be suited to work in the Emergency Department.
not_available " Is that from Peter Benton? Who? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Peter Benton, surgical Resident.
not_available No.
not_available Residents don't evaluate physician
not_available assistant students.
not_available This is from Carol Hathaway, RN, M.S.
not_available I didn't realize the nurses evaluated us.
not_available Look, I realize that putting P.A.s into settings where nurses had a monopoly can cause problems.
not_available But liked or disliked, we have to do a better job.
not_available So I need to know, can you cut it? If you can't, I can't afford to have you fail down there.
not_available I can cut it.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available Jennifer filed for divorce? 
not_available Word travels fast.

not_available Doctor? I'm not ready to let her go yet.
not_available Carol? Can I talk to you? 
not_available Sure, what's up? I just had my student evaluation with my program coordinator.
not_available You've been unhappy with my work.
not_available I think you're competent, but timid.
not_available You need to be more aggressive.
not_available I've been trying.
not_available The ER isn't for everybody.
not_available Don't feel bad if you're not comfortable down here.
not_available Have I done something to offend you in some way? This isn't personal.
not_available It's just You wait for people to tell you what to do.
not_available Like this conversation.
not_available I tell you to be more aggressive and you want to discuss it.
not_available I can't hold people's hands.
not_available Just do it.
not_available So it's not a P.A.
not_available thing? 
not_available No, it's not.
not_available But I've got nurses who've been here for 20 years.
not_available P.A.s go to school for a couple of months and tell us what to do? Two years of training.
not_available Two years of internship.
not_available I went nights while working full

not_available Don't be disappointed.
not_available It was an emergency situation.
not_available What was our other choice? Death? Besides, the woman was a bad risk.
not_available Pulmonary disease.
not_available Hypertension.
not_available I'm concerned it's my fault.
not_available I performed the procedure.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Don't be so melodramatic.
not_available Your technique was perfect.
not_available We have to exclude her from the study.
not_available She was never an appropriate candidate.
not_available It's time we made Dr.
not_available Benton an official member of the team.
not_available Don't you think, Claire? Research associate.
not_available Yes.
not_available Claire will make sure you have everything you need.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available "Thank you" will suffice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mills? 
not_available Howard.
not_available Please.
not_available Howard.
not_available We suspect that your father had a right

not_available Another heart attack? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We're sending him to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
not_available They'll place a Swan
not_available Ganz catheter to monitor pressure in his heart and lungs.
not_available They'll do an echo to confirm the diagnosis.
not_available Doesn't look good.
not_available I think he wants to go.
