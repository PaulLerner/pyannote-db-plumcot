not_available Um.
not_available She's got a profound gap acidosis, but her oxygen level is normal.
not_available Did she ingest anything?.
not_available Uh, yeah.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's probably it.
not_available Cyanide.
not_available Mix two grams of hydroxo

not_available Give me that.
MALlK You're supposed to run this in over 30 minutes.
not_available Abby.
not_available ls that safe?.
not_available It's okay to push it faster if the heart's in trouble.
not_available This binds with the cyanide to form a vitamin.
MALlK Normal sinus.
ABBY See?.
not_available She's coming around.
not_available V
not_available fib.
MORRlS Damn it.

not_available It's Pratt.
not_available They're doing CPR.
MORRlS Lines are primed.
NEELA Clear of bubbles.
not_available Ready to go.
not_available We can stop bagging and compressions because the bypass
not_available It does all the work of the heart and the lungs.
not_available Pulse ox is coming up.
not_available That's good.
not_available He's in an agonal rhythm.
not_available But we don't treat it now.
not_available We wait for the bypass to work.
not_available ls it a compound fracture?.
not_available No, it's spiral.

not_available Did you hear about how this happened?.
not_available Several times.
not_available Swelling, but no bleed on Head CT.

not_available So his brain's not working?.
not_available Not right now.
not_available He wasn't down for that long.
not_available We started CPR right away.
not_available He never had prolonged hypoxia.
MORRlS Guys, guys.
not_available lt could have been an air embolus.
not_available That would do it.
not_available A blast injury puts air into the circulation.
not_available And the air goes up into the brain.
not_available And that's it?.
DOCTOR Well, the brain can still recover.
not_available We'll wait four hours.
not_available Then we'll check Auditory Evoked Responses and an Apnea Test before making any decisions.
not_available I'll come back.
ABBY We should get Bettina.
SAM I left a message on her cell.
NEELA Keep trying.
not_available Listen, I don't think we all need to be in here.
not_available There's nothing more we can do for now.
not_available We'll take shifts.
not_available There's a lot of patients.

not_available That's what he'd say.

not_available 90 over 60.
not_available 500 of saline, check a crit.
not_available KAY 
A Is she bleeding in her pelvis?.
not_available Wasn't that impressive on the CT.
not_available Maybe we got behind on her fluids.
not_available I wanna push Vitamin K.
not_available What for?.
not_available She's probably on Coumadin.
not_available We never got a history.
not_available She's in A fib.
not_available ST segments are consistent with digoxin use.
not_available She's probably on a blood thinner too.
not_available Makes sense.
not_available I suppose Vitamin K couldn't hurt.
not_available Let's get her to trauma.
not_available Call the blood bank for FFP.
not_available Pretty smart for a med student.
not_available Book smart, she's got a ways to go.
not_available Whoa, wait up, guys.
not_available I was crutch training.

not_available KAY 
A We could try preperitoneal packing.
not_available Excuse me?.
not_available Suprapubic incision, leave the peritoneum intact.
not_available Lap pads on either side of bladder.
not_available We had good success in Nicaragua.
not_available ln Nicaragua?.
not_available I volunteer summers in a rural hospital.
not_available High trauma, low tech.
NEELA I thought ortho was admitting.

not_available You're lucky to have such an experienced med student.
not_available Okay, let's go.
MORRlS EEG remained isoelectric.

not_available I'm so sorry, Chaz.
not_available What are you doing?.
not_available Chaz, there are no vital signs to monitor.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Can you please just keep this thing going a couple more hours?.

not_available I've been doing it all day.
not_available Shaking hands, getting hugs.
not_available They say, ""Are you okay?.
not_available "" And I smile and I nod.
not_available I can't do it anymore.
not_available I've lost a lot of people in my life, but not like this.
not_available Not a brother.
not_available But I think you're gonna miss out on something if you don't go.
not_available Tonight's about remembering him.
not_available You all get to do that.
not_available He worked here for eight years.
not_available I only knew him for a couple.
not_available I was trying to catch up on the 1 8 that I missed out on.
not_available I was just starting to know him.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Have a good time at your party.
not_available I looked on a medical website.
not_available It was probably a virus.
not_available I didn't even think about under my cast.
not_available Not a good idea to scratch your skin with a wire coat hanger.
not_available The itching was driving me nuts.
not_available Hey, let me ask you something.
not_available Is this an unusual case?.
not_available Do you think you could write this up for the journals?.
not_available I think you need rest.
not_available And so do l.
BRENNER Hello there.
not_available Someone wanted to see you.
not_available Oh, my God.

not_available Norman, easy.
not_available Oh, it's so good to see you.
not_available Thank you.

NORMAN You look fantastic.
not_available We'll let the two of you catch up.
not_available So are you going to lke's?.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Should I wait for you?.
not_available No.
not_available He's taking a leak and he finds Morris hiding in a stall on his cell phone getting advice about a case.
not_available And he storms back to the desk and tells 
me ""That kid couldn't find his ass with both hands.
not_available "" 
not_available And Pratt was always right.
not_available Y eah, very funny.
not_available Very funny.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me, everybody.
not_available Um, tonight's not about speeches or anything but I was gonna say something, I was wondering if anybody elself
not_available Hold on.
not_available Sorry.
not_available This is from the church.
not_available I thought it should be here.
not_available Who, uh
not_available ?.
not_available Who wants to start?.
not_available A couple of years ago, after Michael died Greg helped me through the hardest time of my life and I don't think I ever thanked him enough for that.
not_available Chaz.
not_available Before I met Greg, I was, uh, pretty clueless.
not_available He taught me that anything is possible.
not_available He taught me not to be scared.
not_available And helped me to realize who I was and the kind of person I wanted to be.
not_available I got this from UNOS.
not_available A 1 5year
not_available old girl in Nebraska a father of three in Maryland, and a college student in T exas all got organs from Greg.
not_available He saved three lives that day.
not_available You know, uh, sometimes after a really gnarly shift Greg would drag me over here.
not_available He'd buy me a beer and we would, uhWe would share an order of his alltime favorite deep
not_available fried mozzarella sticks.
not_available He'd say that the clams might be frozen, the mushrooms might be bad.
not_available But you can't go wrong with mozzarella.
not_available So.
not_available Uh.
not_available I invite all of you to dip deep into the marinara and, uh, raise your cheese as we embrace the memory of our colleague our mentor, our chief and our dear friend.
not_available God, we miss you.
not_available To Greg.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Pratt.
