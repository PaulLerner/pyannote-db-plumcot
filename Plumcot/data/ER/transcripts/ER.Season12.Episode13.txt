not_available 12x13 "BODY AND SOUL" You can't be out here.
not_available Sir? Sir, it's not safe, sir.
not_available Sir, you can't be here.
not_available Sir? They found some guy wandering and disoriented.
not_available Just what we need, another lost soul.
not_available You can never have enough.
not_available Nate Lennox, 54, medic alert bracelet says he has ALS.
not_available Paralyzed and unresponsive.
not_available He rolled out on to the ice at Prospect Rink.
not_available Was somebody with him? I called the number on the bracelet, left a message.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lennox, can you hear me? How'd he get out of the house? 
not_available Good question.
not_available Do you think he was abandoned? Somebody's taking care of him.
not_available He's got clean clothes, had a shave this morning.
not_available Pulse ox is only 89.
not_available Let's get him on five liters by a mask.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna need some lifting help.
not_available Let's leave him in the chair for now.
not_available If we lay him down, it might compress his lungs, might make things worse.
not_available Okay, crackles bilaterally.
not_available CBC, chem panel and a portable chest.
not_available Let's call for his old medical records.
not_available Whoa, hey, hey.
not_available Hey, did you hit the joystick? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay, sats are up to 92.
not_available Have RT induce a sputum for a Gram's stain and culture.
not_available Whoa, hey.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available I didn't touch it.
not_available Is there a short or something? I think the computer has an eye sensor that's controlling the chair.
not_available I think he wants to get out of here.
not_available Probably altered from too low oxygen.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm gonna disconnect the battery.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Need a hand? ALS with pneumonia.
not_available Could use a Hep
not_available Lock.
not_available What's his name? Nate Lennox.
not_available I've seen him before, a while back.
not_available No help.
not_available Don't.
not_available He did that with his eyes? Looks like a speech
not_available synthesizer program.
not_available It's okay now, sir.
not_available We're gonna take care of you.
not_available Want out.
not_available Please, let me out.
not_available Please, let me out.
not_available Okay, sir, we're gonna sit you forward now.
not_available Sats are still borderline.
not_available I'm not sure how aggressive we need to be with this guy.
not_available Is he a DNR? If I were like that, I sure as hell would be.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lennox, your oxygen levels are falling.
not_available Do you understand? We need to know your wishes about resuscitation.
not_available Okay.
not_available Home.
not_available Does that mean you don't want heroic measures? 
not_available Home.
not_available If you stop breathing, do you want us to use a machine, a ventilator? Hungry.
not_available Food.
not_available Do you have a living will? An advanced directive? 
not_available Drugstore.
not_available I don't think we're getting through.
not_available Do you know where you are? I have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
not_available Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
not_available It is a progressive degenerative neurologic disorder that has weakened my muscles.
not_available All of my senses are intact.
not_available My mind is clear.
not_available Not today, it isn't.
not_available Got his old records.
not_available We need the name of his neurologist.
not_available Maybe he'll know what to do with this.
not_available You want me to up his oxygen? I'm gonna say let's go with BiPAP.
not_available It'll buy us time without having to intubate.
not_available I knew he looked familiar.
not_available What? 
not_available He should already be on BiPAP.
not_available Neela and I treated him a year ago.
not_available He came in for shortness of breath.
not_available Every time you have a thought every time you take a breath every time you move a muscle every time you take a crap you should thank your ATP.
not_available AT
not_available ATP.
not_available Oxidative phosphorylation The bedpan may distort things a little.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available The kids at school are gonna make fun of me.
not_available It's too tight? 
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available It's like an oven in here.
not_available I'm sorry, they're working on the a.
not_available c.
not_available So hot.
not_available The BiPAP increases your tidal volume.
not_available Your neurologist says it'll give you more energy and a longer survival.
not_available That's great news.
not_available Sam, labs were hemolyzed on your heat
not_available stroke guy.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I'll wait here.
not_available Ha.
not_available I should have another listen.
not_available Where did you go to med school? Uh, right here.
not_available I was a biochemistry major at Yale, so I placed out of your class.
not_available Yale? Oh.
not_available I worked in Sandra Hamilton's lab 
not_available senior year.
not_available Yeah, I know it.
not_available We were in awe of your work on anti
not_available sense RNA.
not_available I cited your studies in my paper on gene inactivation in Trypanosoma brucei.
not_available You published as an undergraduate? Second author.
not_available Impressive.
not_available So, what are you doing here in this cesspool? Are you just here for the big bucks? What is it gonna be? Orthopedics? Plastic surgery? Neither.
not_available I can't stand surgeons.
not_available They're arrogant workaholics who can't relate to people unless they're asleep.
not_available Sorry, Nate, the car overheated and I had to take the el.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available He had some shortness of breath.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Oh, Fran Bevens.
not_available Did you reach Dr.
not_available Ames? 
not_available He's already been down.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's consulting a speech pathologist.
not_available Good.
not_available Not good.
not_available I don't need it.
not_available It's getting hard to understand what you're saying.
not_available Maybe they should start listening better.
not_available Hello, Fran.
not_available Jared, it's good to see you.
not_available Ready to start? 
not_available I'm trying to contain my enthusiasm.
not_available How long are you guys gonna be? 
not_available Half an hour.
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available We'll be back with your aftercare instructions.
not_available You think about what you're doing.
not_available You may realize you don't belong here.
not_available Where does he think you belong? 
not_available At Jumbo Mart.
not_available He misses my slushies.
not_available Please be kind.
not_available Hey, severe sunburn.
not_available Dispo if the pain is down with Toradol and aloe.
not_available Not too bad.
not_available Soft rule out going to tele.
not_available Excellent.
not_available And this guy's with his PMD.
not_available So there's nothing for you to do.
not_available Lennox? Is that Nate Lennox? The biochemistry professor.
not_available No, wait, I've got one more.
not_available Yeah, I'll figure it out.
not_available Nate.
not_available You like my new look? Well, not a lot of people could pull that off.
not_available Good to see you, Abby.
not_available Hi, Fran.
not_available What you doing? Playing "Medal of Honor.
not_available " I just killed a couple of Nazis.
not_available His facial muscles are weakening.
not_available He needs to practice with assisted speech.
not_available Hey, I've got a great idea.
not_available Well, we can wait on speech therapy for the time being.
not_available But I gotta tell you, Nate, you're just putting off the inevitable.
not_available You need to start wearing this.
not_available Why? Because it has your diagnosis on it, and your name and your phone number.
not_available We're lucky you were in class today.
not_available Otherwise, who knows what might have happened.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available How about this thing? Do I have to wear it all the time? Well, we'll start with bedtime use.
not_available You'll get the benefits of eight hours a night while you're asleep.
not_available I keep waking up and something else is gone.
not_available Thank God for the bracelet.
not_available Is that comfortable? Nate.
not_available Nate.
not_available He was speaking with the computer when he first came in.
not_available We can't get an IV in him.
not_available He always needs a central line.
not_available He was at an ice rink? Yeah, any idea why? I don't know.
not_available It was like any other day.
not_available I got up, I shaved him, bathed him.
not_available Fed him breakfast and then transferred him to the chair.
not_available He was watching television, so I went to take a quick nap.
not_available How did he get outside? Well, he can open the front door with his computer.
not_available Ray, ready to present? Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Fran Bevens.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello, sir.
not_available You saw him a few years ago.
not_available Right, middle and lower lobe infiltrates.
not_available He's altered, borderline oxygenation, even with BiPAP.
not_available Can we have a word? Yes, of course.
not_available We need to make a decision about intubating and ventilation.
not_available You think he can get over the pneumonia? He could, or he could be intubated in the ICU, going downhill for four weeks.
not_available He hasn't got a lot of reserve.
not_available There's no guarantee he'll get better.
not_available This may be the natural endpoint of his disease.
not_available So maybe it's time to focus on keeping him comfortable.
not_available Fran, I just heard you were here.
not_available Thank you for coming by.
not_available I've taken care of him before.
not_available He decided to go out by himself.
not_available Why did you do that, Nate? 
not_available In motion.
not_available What's in motion? Free.
not_available Pulse ox is down to 82.
not_available Yeah, what are you doing? His lungs are full of junk, his sats down, he needs to be intubated.
not_available We've been just discussing about how best to proceed.
not_available Well, helping him breathe would be a good way to start.
not_available I don't think that he'd want that, Abby.
not_available Abby 
not_available Yankauer.
not_available We haven't come to a consensus.
not_available I'm not comfortable with this.
not_available I'm not intubating.
not_available Large mucous plug at the cords.
not_available Okay, that should help.
not_available Temporarily.
not_available Sats are coming up.
not_available This will give us time to treat him with oxygen and antibiotics until he's alert enough to tell us what he wants.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lennox? Nate.
not_available Nate, talk to us.
not_available Around and into the subclavian.
not_available Fluoro off.
not_available Okay, that's as far as we go.
not_available Ceftriaxone's ready.
not_available How'd he do? 
not_available Well, we're starting the IV antibiotics.
not_available When did he last eat? 
not_available I fed him this morning.
not_available He needs some calories.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available You're in the hospital, Nate.
not_available Nate? You remember when we talked about putting in a trach if you had trouble breathing? You said you wanted to keep going until they found a stem
not_available cell cure.
not_available Why don't we just let him rest? Snowmobile versus tree.
not_available Morris needs some help.
not_available 500 of azithro after the Rocephin.
not_available Got it.
not_available Okay, we all need to agree on this.
not_available You told me you wanted a trach.
not_available That was a long time ago, Abby.
not_available His biggest fear now is that he'll end up on life
not_available support aware of everything, but with no way to communicate.
not_available He was communicating a half
not_available hour ago.
not_available That could have been random eye movements.
not_available Four hundred cc's of Jevity? 
not_available Yep.
not_available So if we do the trach?.
not_available He's out of here in a day.
not_available He can go home with a portable ventilator.
not_available You'd have to learn how to suction and troubleshoot the vent.
not_available But we can get you some help.
not_available I know you're tired.
not_available He's the one who's tired.
not_available Fran I'm with him every day, Abby.
not_available I know.
not_available Looks like we got a clogged G
not_available tube here.
not_available Do you flush it with water? 
not_available Yes, after every feeding.
not_available He needs nutritional support to fight off infection.
not_available It won't go.
not_available Do you know when the tube was put in? No, IG
not_available tube placed in May, 2002.
not_available He came in after a choking spell.
not_available Each May, the graduating medical students vote for teacher of the year
not_available I love the fresh flowers.
not_available They must think it'll make up for cutting back on my teaching.
not_available but rather a scientist, whose dynamism
not_available May I have a glass of wine? Thanks very much.
not_available made a strong impression and stayed with the students throughout their training.
not_available It gives me great pleasure to present Nate, what is it? the 2002 Teacher of the Year Award 
not_available Nate, Nate.
not_available to Dr.
not_available Nathan Lennox.
not_available Well, his chest x
not_available ray is negative for aspiration.
not_available You got lucky, Nate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.
not_available It's time for a feeding tube.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Well, your chewing and swallowing muscles are getting pretty weak.
not_available Fran will have to cut my meat smaller won't she? 
not_available Takes him an hour to eat a meal.
not_available He's lost 10 pounds.
not_available More like 5.
not_available The rest is water weight.
not_available Weight loss accelerates the progression of ALS.
not_available The extra calories from the tube feeding will mean increased strength more energy and longer survival.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available Romano around? In the O.R.
not_available with a pneumonectomy, but I'll see about getting you on the schedule.
not_available I said, I'll think about it.
not_available Well, we'll save you a spot.
not_available We can always cancel.
not_available Good night.
not_available I'll walk out with you, Donald.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Good night, been great.
not_available Tell them to send the trophy to my mom.
not_available Trophy? I won the potato
not_available sack race at the County retreat.
not_available Is Abby Lockhart around? 
not_available No, not tonight.
not_available It's pretty quiet around here.
not_available Well, sometimes it's slow.
not_available It's not just that.
not_available What, are you cutting back on staff or something? Well, one of our Attendings died.
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available A lot of people took off to go to his memorial.
not_available Chen wants you in Exam 3 with the belly
not_available pain guy.
not_available It's a slam
not_available dunk diverticulitis.
not_available I called Medicine.
not_available All she has to do is co
not_available sign my chart.
not_available I'll let you tell her that yourself.
not_available What year of residency are you in? 
not_available First.
not_available I'm an intern.
not_available Hoho! Pretty cocky for an intern, aren't you? Huh? 
not_available You're either real smart or really insecure.
not_available If I were you, I'd put my money 
not_available on the first one.
not_available Of course, all the great minds wanna work in the County ER.
not_available Actually, this is just temporary.
not_available I'm planning on moving over to Northwestern soon.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You got in, huh? 
not_available Well, not yet, but believe me, I will.
not_available Preop instructions for the G
not_available tube.
not_available Okay, cool.
not_available This is gonna show you everything you need to know about the procedure.
not_available Where to show up, what to eat the night before, what to wear Are you okay? Look, I know it's hard, but
not_available This isn't me.
not_available It's the disease.
not_available Okay.
not_available The nerve deterioration leads to pseudobulbar affect.
not_available His emotions can be very exaggerated.
not_available Yeah, I see.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's called emotional incontinence.
not_available It sucks.
not_available You get a little upset about something, and next thing, you're crying like a baby.
not_available There has to be some sort of medicine for that.
not_available He won't take them.
not_available Side effects are too much.
not_available And it's the BDNF.
not_available I've been injecting nerve growth factor twice a day for a year.
not_available The stuff turns ALS mice into Olympic athletes.
not_available But human trials, worthless.
not_available Results haven't panned out in humans.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available And now Fran has to pour 
not_available Ensure in my stomach tube all day.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Come on.
not_available Shh.
not_available Come on, calm down.
not_available I didn't wanna be a burden on anyone.
not_available Shh.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Should this be hurting him? 
not_available Maybe just a little.
not_available Okay, G
not_available tube is in.
not_available Balloon is up.
not_available Check the pump.
not_available I think he's waking up a little bit.
not_available Go ahead and set up for PFT's.
not_available Flow is looking good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available All right, we need to test his lung function.
not_available Nate, I'm gonna put this in your mouth and Sam's gonna pinch your nose.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Easy.
not_available All right.
not_available Easy, yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, deep breath in.
not_available And blow it out, blow it out, blow it out.
not_available Great.
not_available Forced vital capacity is 32 percent of normal.
not_available That's the amount of air he can move
not_available I know.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nate? Nate, your lung capacity has deteriorated.
not_available The best way to help your breathing is for us to put in a trach.
not_available You're gonna need assisted ventilation.
not_available Do you want us to do it? I'm not sure you'll recover without it.
not_available The trach is the best chance you have of clearing up your pneumonia.
not_available Nate.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Call Surgery, he consented.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Abby, I don't think that's what he meant.
not_available What? He said, "Okay.
not_available " He said, "I'm okay" after that, which could mean, leave him alone.
not_available It's not exactly informed consent.
not_available Nate.
not_available You want the trach, don't you? 
not_available You know, you all heard what he said.
not_available At a vital capacity of 30 percent some ALS patients enter into hospice care.
not_available It means they have six months to live.
not_available His FVC is low because of pneumonia.
not_available Clear that, lung function will be back.
not_available Best
not_available case scenario.
not_available He expressed his wishes in advance.
not_available Now he's too sick, can't give reliable consent.
not_available How's his PO2? 
not_available I wanna do a trach.
not_available We have a consent issue.
not_available I explained the procedure to the patient.
not_available I asked if he wanted it.
not_available He said, "Okay," on his computer.
not_available He did? 
not_available He also said, "I'm okay," after that.
not_available I don't think that he understood.
not_available He was alert and looking at me the entire time.
not_available He understood.
not_available I really don't think that this is what he wants.
not_available Fran has a durable power of attorney.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's your call.
not_available You know, with all due respect, I'm sorry, but Nate expressed his wishes and I think we have to go with that.
not_available Well, if there's a chance that he asked for the procedure I'm not sure that he did.
not_available I think we have to do it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac
not_available Ray, I need you next door to help me with a central line.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'd like to page Dr.
not_available Ames.
not_available I'll try to find him.
not_available And call Dubenko.
not_available Put in the trach and RT to set up a vent.
not_available Between first and second tracheal ring.
not_available Close your eyes if you're having any pain.
not_available Doesn't look like he's feeling anything.
not_available Aspirate air, confirm you're in.
not_available Guidewire.
not_available So you're in surgery now, Neela? I'm just doing an elective.
not_available Things change, right? Certainly do.
not_available Eleven French dilator.
not_available Balloon's good to go.
not_available I hope he's okay with this.
not_available Well, it doesn't wanna pass.
not_available A little more muscle.
not_available You doing all right, Nate? Okay, remove the dilator, slide the trach tube in.
not_available Mm.
not_available Bit of oozing here.
not_available Direct pressure should take care of that.
not_available A little bleeding can be normal.
not_available Tachy at 130.
not_available I'll open up his fluids.
not_available Is he okay? He could be sensitive to the blood loss.
not_available Let's take another look.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Pressure again, 10 blade.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Converting to an open procedure.
not_available We need deep hemostasis.
not_available Two units of packed cells.
not_available Blood transfusion? 
not_available Just a precaution.
not_available Call for type specific.
not_available Sam, see if his antibody screen's in the old chart.
not_available Abby, grab a Yankauer.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available A minor complication.
not_available Doesn't look minor.
not_available Suction on high.
not_available Shouldn't have let you do this.
not_available Mosquito clamp.
not_available Antibody screens negative.
not_available He's in pain.
not_available Give him medication.
not_available Four of morphine.
not_available No morphine.
not_available Had a bad reaction in 2001 
not_available when he came with a broken wrist.
not_available The transgene will be suppressed.
not_available Use two fluorescent reporters with different spectra.
not_available Why two? 
not_available One for our transfected cells.
not_available And one for translational fusion with the target gene.
not_available That's
not_available That's brilliant.
not_available Well, it's simple.
not_available I don't know if it's brill
not_available Four morphine.
not_available Get to work on the plasmid DNA vectors.
not_available Right now? I don't want Gregorio beating us to the Nobel Prize.
not_available Right.
not_available You're not supposed to take the stairs.
not_available They were servicing the elevators.
not_available Wait for the next one.
not_available All right.
not_available We were late.
not_available I've canceled your morning classes.
not_available Don't be ridiculous.
not_available Why'd you do that? I couldn't reach Baker.
not_available He's the only oneBaker doesn't decide
not_available What did he say? He thinks it's time to start using a wheelchair.
not_available You've got to be kidding.
not_available Weakness in your legs is progressing to the point that it's not safe.
not_available Next time, you could break your hip.
not_available They have power wheelchairs.
not_available Motorized scooters.
not_available You'll still be very independent.
not_available Until my battery goes dead.
not_available You won't be losing something.
not_available You'll be conserving energy so you can do more things.
not_available You're trying to turn me into an invalid.
not_available People with degenerative diseases do best when they haveWhat? Hope? Do you read the paper? Bush just banned federal funding for embryonic stem
not_available cell research.
not_available I am trying to hold on to hope, doctor.
not_available But nobody's cooperating these days.
not_available Well, Dr.
not_available Ames has some papers on mobility assist devices
not_available I don't want them.
not_available I'll go pick them up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Not for me.
not_available Not for me.
not_available So Fran drives you to all your doctor visits? Mostly, she just drives me crazy.
not_available Ow, ow.
not_available How long have you been together? We're not together.
not_available She works for me.
not_available Oh.
not_available For some time now? Fifteen years.
not_available She was right out of college.
not_available I needed an assistant who was on the ball.
not_available She was ridiculously overqualified.
not_available The thing that really surprised me was that she stayed after that first year.
not_available She could have gone to law school, to business school.
not_available But I have to say, she stuck with me.
not_available She knows you pretty well.
not_available And that's why I assumed you guys
not_available No, no, no.
not_available There was a point a million years ago when it almost happened.
not_available But then I came to my senses.
not_available You married? Then you understand.
not_available Who has time for family when you're devoted to your work? Well, some people try for a balance.
not_available Maybe if you're an ER doc.
not_available But if you're trying to push back the frontiers of science, it's 24/7.
not_available Right.
not_available It's not bad to be married to your career.
not_available My career's a good companion.
not_available Never nags me.
not_available Whoa.
not_available You okay? Side effect of the morphine.
not_available It's good to know.
not_available This will make you feel better.
not_available Two of Versed.
not_available That should settle him down.
not_available Sats, 89.
not_available Maybe we've done enough.
not_available If you can't? 
not_available We need to find the source.
not_available May have to open his chest, but we'll find it.
not_available Damn it.
not_available It's a detour, we can get back on track.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available If you'd like, I can take you to the family room.
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stay, hold his hand, talk with him.
not_available Vascular clamp and pickups.
not_available Frazier tip suction.
not_available Nate, I am so sorry.
not_available Careful, careful.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Right there.
not_available Deep to the manubrium.
not_available I think you've got it.
not_available My, oh, my.
not_available What? Poked through innominate vein.
not_available Never seen anything like that.
not_available Very unusual anatomy.
not_available Well, when they made Nate, they broke the mold.
not_available Sats are coming up.
not_available BP, 120/75.
not_available Okay, we're out of the woods.
not_available Good.
not_available Trach's in, vent tubing.
not_available You gave us a little scare there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me help.
not_available You're not gonna be needing this anymore.
not_available Nate.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lennox, open your eyes.
not_available Could just be because of the sedative.
not_available There might be some damage.
not_available The blood loss may have deprived the brain of oxygen.
not_available Pass the tubing all the way and cover the suction port with your thumb.
not_available Then pull out slowly.
not_available It's making him cough.
not_available That's good.
not_available It'll help clear the secretions.
not_available That's all there is to it.
not_available How often? Maybe two, three times a day.
not_available More, if he sounds junky.
not_available We're gonna get you some help at home.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You know how many caregivers he's made me get rid of? It's just easier if I do it myself.
not_available Sometimes you need a break.
not_available Well, I'm fine.
not_available I've cut back to 12 hours a day.
not_available We have night aides, you know.
not_available I mean, if there's a problem, they still come and wake me up.
not_available It's hard for me to see someone not giving him the best care, so Nate.
not_available Hey, Nate.
not_available Okay, you let us know when you're ready to talk.
not_available Can I take him home? 
not_available In a couple days.
not_available How about tonight? I think that after everything he's been through we should probably keep an eye on him.
not_available I know, but I promised him that I would keep him at home.
not_available It's what he wants.
not_available He'll do better in the hospital.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I promised him.
not_available How long have you been with him? 
not_available Oh, 21 years.
not_available It's hard for me to believe sometimes.
not_available It started out as just a job, you know.
not_available But after a while There was this one time I traveled with him to Boston.
not_available It was September of '99.
not_available It's beautiful there in the fall.
not_available He was giving a paper at a molecular
not_available biology symposium.
not_available I was still prepping his slides and his handouts five minutes before the talk.
not_available We worked so hard, he added a couple of days to the trip.
not_available We went up to Cape Cod.
not_available Hotel was right on the beach.
not_available He took me sailing.
not_available It was one of those times in life where you think everything is just falling into place.
not_available Well, a couple of weeks later 
not_available he got the diagnosis.
not_available I saw the neurologist today.
not_available Everything okay? Good.
not_available Blood tests are normal.
not_available No periventricular lesions on the MRI.
not_available So it's not MS.
not_available Great.
not_available Although, I was kind of hoping for MS.
not_available What? The EMG showed denervation of the muscles of the right hand.
not_available I have motor neuron disease, Fran.
not_available I have ALS.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Average life expectancy is 4 years, but 5 percent of patients progress, then plateau.
not_available There's some guy in his 60s who's still playing golf 40 years into the disease.
not_available They're starting me on a new drug called Riluzole.
not_available It's very promising at slowing the progression of the degeneration.
not_available There are going to be challenges, but I'm hopeful about the new research.
not_available And they' re setting me up with a multidisciplinary support team.
not_available Physical and occupational therapists, nutritionists, speech pathologists 
not_available respiratory therapists.
not_available I can help too.
not_available Well, I'm still gonna need an assistant obviously, of course.
not_available Now more than ever.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available I have to put all my energy into fighting this disease.
not_available He didn't wanna start something, only to have it taken away.
not_available He was afraid it would be too painful.
not_available For you or for him? 
not_available For both of us.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, good to see you're back.
not_available My neck.
not_available They did a trach.
not_available To treat your pneumonia.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yes, your oxygen levels are up.
not_available Your tidal volume's improved.
not_available You're more alert.
not_available I'll never wear a turtleneck again.
not_available You still want an ICU bed? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll get a tele bed.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We're admitting you for antibiotics and respiratory therapy.
not_available No trach.
not_available I thought you would have wanted this.
not_available Appreciate it.
not_available It saved your life, Nate.
not_available I understand.
not_available You know, you can live for a long time with this.
not_available My facial muscles are getting weaker.
not_available Once I lose my eye movements, I'll be locked in.
not_available I'll be seeing, hearing, and feeling my surroundings but I'll be unable to communicate my needs and wishes.
not_available I don't want to get to that point.
not_available This infection that you have is a temporary setback.
not_available Once you get rid of that, you're gonna be right back to where you were.
not_available I'm going downhill.
not_available Well, maybe more slowly with good oxygenation and ventilation.
not_available Had enough.
not_available No, in a couple of days, you're gonna have a lot more energy
not_available He's made up his mind.
not_available Take out trach.
not_available I can't.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then home.
not_available Poker.
not_available He wants me to invite some of his friends over for poker.
not_available His friends can visit him in the hospital.
not_available Beer.
not_available We've got beer.
not_available Well, you're in no condition to go home, Nate.
not_available I'm not comfortable with this.
not_available I am.
not_available Why don't we wait in the lobby? No.
not_available Outside.
not_available I'm not sure that the van is here yet.
not_available Fresh air.
not_available You know, it's cold out there.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I might catch pneumonia.
not_available Well, I'm sending a respiratory therapist home to assist you.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available You know, it's to help Fran.
not_available Tonight, we turn off the vent.
not_available Go to sleep.
not_available Won't wake up.
not_available Miss Bevens, I got those papers for you to sign.
not_available I'll be quick.
not_available I know the way out.
not_available Well, it's hospital policy.
not_available Somebody has to accompany you to the van.
not_available You forgot your coat.
not_available You have a treatable condition.
not_available I'm just asking for two days in the hospital.
not_available Two.
not_available Can't.
not_available Why not? I don't want to be a soul trapped in a corpse.
not_available Well, you're not there yet.
not_available Close.
not_available Wait.
not_available Just wait a minute.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available What happened to fighting this disease? 
not_available Too tired.
not_available Once we treat the pneumonia, you're gonna feel better.
not_available You can even plateau.
not_available Look at Stephen Hawking, he's had this disease for 40 years.
not_available I'm not Stephen Hawking.
not_available You're still advising students, writing books.
not_available You published the lead article in Cell two months ago.
not_available Just please, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available If you recover from this, you could hang on until there's a cure.
not_available If I don't recover? Then I'll be there.
not_available To make sure you're comfortable, take you off the vent, and let you go.
not_available I bet you 10 bucks you can get through this.
not_available Ten bucks? All you have to do is go back into the hospital.
not_available I'm impressed.
not_available You've become a pretty persuasive doctor.
not_available Well, I'm not so sure I'd be here if it weren't for you.
not_available The air you breathe, all the food you eat it all leads to the production of one incredible 
molecule ATP.
not_available Adenosine triphosphate.
not_available The end result of oxidative phosphorylation.
not_available This is the force of life.
not_available Seventy
not_available three hundred kilocalories per mole.
not_available Pure unadulterated energy.
not_available What are you doing right now? Taking notes, crossing your legs coughing, digesting your food listening to your voice mail while your professor is lecturing.
not_available Every action of the human body, every single thing it means to be alive is powered by ATP.
not_available How much do you weigh? One fifty
not_available five.
not_available Stand up.
not_available Stand up.
not_available Every day, the human body uses 180 pounds of ATP.
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available More than you weigh.
not_available And yet, and yet, this body only has half a pound of ATP.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available You recycle it? Yes.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bravo, thank you.
not_available A
not_available plus.
not_available You recycle it.
not_available Otherwise, you would burn off your ATP in five minutes.
not_available The human body recycles it If you were a car, you would get Now, electron transport jams protons into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria.
not_available ATP synthase is, in fact, a rotary engine.
not_available The flow of protons spins the shaft.
not_available That sucks in ADP and blows out fresh ATP filled with the energy it takes to fuel the human body, the human mind and, yes, yes, the human spirit.
not_available Okay, we're done.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Tomorrow
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tomorrow, chapter 19, Lehninger.
not_available Electron Transport in Detail.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lennox.
not_available Do you have a minute? Yeah? And you are? 
not_available Abby Lockhart.
not_available I'm a first year.
not_available I need your signature to drop this class.
not_available You wanna quit biochemistry? I failed the midterm, and I'm not feeling very optimistic about the final.
not_available It's a required course.
not_available Maybe I'll try again next year.
not_available Tough to do.
not_available Second
not_available year curriculum is pretty busy.
not_available I'm thinking about maybe taking a year off to reconsider my options.
not_available Wow, I'm surprised.
not_available So you don't wanna be a doctor? I dI want
not_available I'm trying.
not_available I just
not_available It's a lot.
not_available With biochemistry, and physiology, and microbiology, anatomy.
not_available It's just a lot, it's a lot to memorize.
not_available There's your problem.
not_available Rote memorization is the path to failure.
not_available Um, do you like sports? Do you ice skate? 
not_available Not, really.
not_available No.
not_available Do you dance? Everybody likes to dance.
not_available I took ballet when I was a kid, yes.
not_available Did you like it? Yes.
not_available I was the sugarplum fairy in The Nutcracker, third from the left.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Do you wanna learn? Stop memorizing and think conceptually.
not_available Biochemistry is the dance of life.
not_available Ballet is its central dogma.
not_available Adenine holds hands with thymine, cytosine with guanine.
not_available When they let go, a line of gypsy dancers breaks free to look for new partners, and messenger RNA is created.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not usually so clumsy.
not_available See? Um, yeah.
not_available Can you sign my form? My office hours begin at 1 p.
not_available m.
not_available on Tuesdays.
not_available Show up.
not_available You're gonna tutor me? Think of it as dance lessons.
not_available After three weeks, I guarantee that you'll pass with flying colors.
not_available In fact, I will bet you 10 bucks.
not_available That's is a very generous offer, I justI just
not_available I know that you can do this.
not_available I wish I had your confidence.
not_available You will.
not_available Don't give up.
not_available If nothing else, I will teach you how to fight.
not_available I'll see you Tuesday.
not_available Thank you.
