not_available This isn't the best time.
not_available Neela? I can't hear you, you're dead to me.
not_available Lucien, please make it stop.
not_available Oh, look at you, going to your Attending like a little penis, punk, sissy.
not_available Jessica, would you take care of this? It's getting very annoying.
not_available This is a complex anastomosis.
not_available Don't you think I should stay? We'll be all right without you.
not_available Please, go.
not_available Please.
not_available All right, dissect the mesentery.
not_available I heard she tried to kill him and he grabbed the gun away from her.
not_available Well, his wound is definitely self
not_available inflicted.
not_available He's a cagey little bastard.
not_available Think he shot her and covered it up? Oldest trick in the book.
not_available I heard they were having sex.
not_available All right.
not_available Come on, guys, we all have our own problems, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available You're right.
not_available Hey, I'll come get you when your boyfriend gets here.
not_available Where's Clemente now? 
not_available I sent him up to angio.
not_available In restraints? 
not_available We let him out once he shut up.
not_available What do you think happened? I think he's a complicated guy.
not_available Hey, Ray.
not_available Let's keep the chatter to a minimum until we find out what went down.
not_available Yeah, sure thing.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, I picked this up in Trauma 1.
not_available I think it belongs to one of your patients.
not_available Who? Jenkins? Yeah, you know, the old homeless guy who got beat up by some kids? Yeah, I got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's this, doctor? Expanding hematoma, lacerated vessels.
not_available That's an ER answer.
not_available I want a surgeon's answer.
not_available Which vessels? Systolic's only 92.
not_available Neela, which vessels? The renal artery splits into the anterior and
not_available Stop vamping, we don't have time.
not_available You either know it or you don't.
not_available Extravasating contrast, left kidney's been hit.
not_available We're aware of that, Victor.
not_available With a hilar injury like this, sacrificing the kidney is probably the way to go.
not_available Is the hilum completely avulsed? Because if not, you ought
not_available Please, don't tell me what I ought or ought not do.
not_available Yeah, well, she's a friend, okay? 
not_available You can watch from the Obs deck.
not_available A good friend
not_available Obs deck now.
not_available One peep and you're out.
not_available So think you can save the kidney? She's young.
not_available We should try.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available What's your plan? I don't know.
not_available I've never done this before.
not_available Look, it's just common sense.
not_available If I weren't here, what would you do? Lucien, I just wanna point out you are here and you are the Attending.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra? Clamp the hilum for a vascular exclusion.
not_available I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but if you clamp the hilum you're gonna starve the kidney of blood.
not_available Please continue.
not_available Find the bleeders and seal with fibrin.
not_available Repair the renal artery with an omental patch.
not_available How much time after clamping the hilum before the kidney starts to die? About 45 minutes.
not_available No, no, no, it's not about 45 minutes.
not_available That's 45 minutes tops.
not_available That's tops.
not_available Go for it, she's all yours.
not_available You're not gonna let an ER resident go and clamp the hilum.
not_available You will stop talking now.
not_available Or I'll remove you.
not_available She's not a surgeon.
not_available I'm working on that.
not_available You're gonna be working on that now.
not_available Lucien, look, this isn't a teaching case.
not_available I want you to do it, Lucien! I want you! Stop playing around, man! Her pressure's gonna bottom out! Hilum's clamped.
not_available All right, 45 minutes.
not_available The clock's ticking.
not_available Change the orders.
not_available This means war, you know.
not_available Change the damn orders.
not_available Nice work.
not_available She's been driving us crazy all day.
not_available Refuses to learn our names, calls us all nurse.
not_available She refuses to learn our names too.
not_available She's only interested in learning the male residents' names.
not_available I hate women like that.
not_available Why are you still here? My fridge at home's empty, I was hungry.
not_available Want a bite? Didn't I see you eating one 20 minutes ago? 
not_available This is my third.
not_available Third? What are you, pregnant? What? What are you talking about? 
not_available Oh, my God, you are.
not_available You're crazy.
not_available You are, aren't you? 
not_available No.
not_available You are totally pregnant.
not_available So what? You're in love with Albright.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Oh, Morris.
not_available Come on.
not_available You shut up.
not_available You shut up too.
not_available You shut up first.
not_available Shut up about what? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available This came back on our GSW.
not_available Want me to send it up to the O.R.? No, I got it.
not_available Ray, help Morris clear the board while I run upstairs.
not_available All right.
not_available Help me? What was that? I need help all of a sudden? No, it's not really all of a sudden.
not_available I'm taking Mrs.
not_available Irby in to see her father.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available You need help with that? 
not_available No.
not_available Exactly, that's my point.
not_available Your father's in here, ma'am.
not_available You been doing some snooping around, young blood? Well, I thought your daughter should know.
not_available Congratulations, princess.
not_available Sounded like a nice ceremony.
not_available We wanted you to be there.
not_available Didn't wanna show up for your special day looking like this.
not_available I would have paid for a suit.
not_available I don't want that.
not_available I don't want your money.
not_available This doctor told me what happened today.
not_available Stupid kids.
not_available He needs to have his sutures removed in a week.
not_available Come home until then, Daddy.
not_available Nat and me, we got a nice place over in Old Town.
not_available You can have your own room.
not_available That ain't me, Sarah.
not_available Ain't never gonna be.
not_available How's she doing? That was the 12th unit they've hung so far.
not_available I looked for you in angio.
not_available Well, you didn't miss much.
not_available The bullet missed the brachial.
not_available This came back on Jodie.
not_available She's positive for cannaboids and coke, Vic.
not_available Well, you know, this is irrelevant to her treatment.
not_available I don't know why you'd send this in.
not_available What are you, Big Brother? Come on, standard trauma labs, man.
not_available You know that.
not_available And you might have mentioned it before.
not_available Why? Would it have affected the resuscitation, changed your management? 
not_available Let's be real.
not_available Maybe you should know that she's a Scorpio and she's allergic to clams.
not_available Would that help? So this why you didn't want us evaluating you? You were worried what we'd find if we sent in your urine.
not_available You know, you're a really good guy, and I like you.
not_available But right now, it's time for you to shut the hell up.
not_available I just hope your story's good.
not_available Yeah? What story? 
not_available The one about how you didn't do this.
not_available Why, you think I did? It doesn't matter what I think, Vic.
not_available Only important thing is, is there anyone who can back you up? Yeah.
not_available She's down there.
not_available Hey, catch.
not_available Cool.
not_available Got it at the Boston game.
not_available They killed us.
not_available Oh, yeah, that kind of year.
not_available I haven't seen you around.
not_available My mom said I was too distracting.
not_available She wants you to study hard.
not_available Yeah, she said I was definitely going to college.
not_available That's good advice.
not_available Sounds boring.
not_available Besides, I wanna drive NASCAR.
not_available I'll tell her you're here.
not_available Thanks, Luka.
not_available Hey, Chuny, let's see if we can get a taxi voucher for Dexter Jenkins.
not_available Oh, already gone.
not_available He left AMA, didn't even sign his discharge.
not_available He did? Yep.
not_available What do you want me to do with the chart? Let's break it down, I guess.
not_available Oh, Pratt, I forgot, your date's out in chairs.
not_available He is? 
not_available Been here about half an hour.
not_available Oh, don't keep a young man waiting.
not_available And allow me to say, that's the prettiest transvestite I've ever laid eyes on.
not_available Transvestite? Where? Oh, that can't be him.
not_available I had you guys going, didn't I? Write post
not_available op orders, page me for evening rounds.
not_available How often we check renal function? BUN and creatinine BID.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available Just so you know.
not_available That wasn't cool.
not_available What? You deal with ER scut, I scrub in on traumas, got it? 
not_available You weren't answering your pages.
not_available That cutesy shtick with Dubenko? That isn't working either.
not_available I write your evaluation.
not_available I'm the one you've got to impress.
not_available I'm not trying to impress anyone, I'm trying to get

not_available again, there will be payback.
not_available This is crazy.

not_available It was Hamlet.
not_available You know the part where he says that man is this and man is that.
not_available Noble and intelligent, like the best thing on Earth.
not_available But then he says to his two buddies, he 
says Yet what is it to me, this This quintessence of dust? Like he's, you know lost.
not_available I heard they were able to salvage the kidney.
not_available Yeah, but with the loss of blood and the long anesthesia time You know how the brain is.
not_available The police are here.
not_available They went to your place.
not_available The ICU Attending wants to keep her intubated and sedated longer.
not_available They found marijuana, cocaine, some unprescribed medications
not_available We should keep her 02 consumption down.
not_available They think you did this, Vic.
not_available Did they find the gun? No.
not_available Am I fired? Not yet.
not_available Okay, why don't we start by you telling me why in the world your friend Henry would think he has to buy you dates? I had a bad break
not_available up a few months back.
not_available I think he got sick of listening to my single
not_available girl woes.
not_available Plus, he figured I could use a change of pace.
not_available You mean you never dated a doctor before? Something like that.
not_available Good night, Pratt.
not_available Good night, Ray.
not_available Figured you'd be long gone.
not_available Good place to pick up some change.
not_available I'm not gonna talk you into anything your daughter couldn't.
not_available She's upset.
not_available She'll be all right.
not_available She figures this is how it's gonna be.
not_available Every few years, she'll get a call from a hospital or cop get a quick "Hi", "Bye" from her old man.
not_available Until the last call comes in, and it's the morgue.
not_available Let me get you a sandwich, at least.
