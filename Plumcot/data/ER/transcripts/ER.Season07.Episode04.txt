not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available So what is my position here? You have no position here, Peter.
not_available You're firing me? 
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available You fired yourself.
not_available We're short on nurses.
not_available I'm an OB nurse.
not_available Are you planning on going back to med school? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Ok, then you might as well work as a nurse in the ER.
not_available You'll see more medicine down here than upstairs.
not_available Listen, if you need anything talk about a case or a patient or anything 
not_available just come find me.
not_available I will.
not_available You could be a great doctor.
not_available Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
not_available You're an excellent surgeon, Peter.
not_available And you're a good man, and we'll work it out.

not_available R.
not_available 7x04 "BENTON BACKWARDS" I could come in for another interview.
not_available As a matter of fact, I could come in this morning.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available But you said you were interested.
not_available Actually, you said you were very interested.
not_available Right.
not_available But if you could just
not_available Right, right, right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Want some breakfast? 
not_available No.
not_available Going over applications? 
not_available Yep.
not_available I thought you took the position at Loyola.
not_available Withdrawn.
not_available Why? I don't know, Cleo.
not_available Maybe because I took another job somewhere else.
not_available Have you tried Northwestern? 
not_available Fully staffed.
not_available U.
not_available of C.? 
not_available What do you think? Right now, I think you're being an ass.
not_available You barely say anything.
not_available And when you do, it's rude.
not_available I talk to you, Cleo.
not_available Not about this.
not_available Why don't you let me help, Peter? 
not_available I don't need your help.
not_available I need a job.
not_available I should have left County when I had a chance.
not_available Out for fresh air? 
not_available Man found down.
not_available ETA is any minute.
not_available They're letting you work on traumas.
not_available If I only handle two patients at a time.
not_available Really? 
not_available Weaver's rules.
not_available Play by them or die by them.
not_available Thanks.
not_available She didn't exactly ask me if I wanted to be assigned to the ER.
not_available What are you supposed to do while you wait for labs? 
not_available Catch up on medical journals.
not_available That sucks.
not_available Showtime.
not_available You with me on this one? 
not_available Male, 50, found in the park.
not_available Full arrest.
not_available That's one well
not_available fed bum.
not_available How'd you load him? 
not_available Paid a bunch of his buddies 5 bucks.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Large lac to the occipital scalp.
not_available Not sure if he was rolled or fell out of his tree.
not_available What's he doing in a tree? 
not_available Maybe he lived in it.
not_available Why didn't you intubate him? His neck's like a power pole.
not_available We couldn't find the cords.
not_available It was 40 degrees last night.
not_available He's hypothermic.
not_available We might still get him back.
not_available With what, a blowtorch? Active core rewarming.
not_available Set up for pleural and peritoneal lavage.
not_available All right, I'm in.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Who's got scissors? Good air bilaterally.
not_available So, Carter, you know anyone who plays hockey? 
not_available No.
not_available Get me some warm blankets.
not_available I need an extra guy for a game tonight.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available I was asking if you knew anyone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Looks like we're in fine V
not_available fib.
not_available Core temp is 86.
not_available So is his pulse ox.
not_available Charge the paddles to 360.
not_available Why? He's a frozen dinner.
not_available Put two chest tubes in on the right.
not_available Run warm saline through the rapid infuser.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available He's not dead until he's warm and dead.
not_available I'll prep the chest.
not_available 32 French okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, everybody clear.
not_available What the hell? 
not_available Where did all the pigeons come from? Give me an amp of epi.
not_available All right.
not_available Charge again.
not_available Clear.
not_available They must have been in his coat.
not_available They're attacking.
not_available Still in V
not_available fib.
not_available Damn it! Get over here and do CPR! Charging to 360.
not_available Do CPR? The guy's brain
not_available dead.
not_available Not until I say so.
not_available Clear.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available A bunch of beauty contestants were in the salon getting final touches.
not_available A worker mixed the wrong chemicals, and boom! Who's the worst? 
not_available That'd be Audrey Hoffman, Miss Skokie.
not_available Lacerations and partial
not_available thickness burns on her legs, and smoke inhalation.
not_available Hi, Audrey.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available My legs.
not_available Are they bad? I'm gonna check your breathing first.
not_available Can you lean forward? Any shortness of breath? 
not_available No.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Any chest pain? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Miss Tri
not_available State is tonight.
not_available Is it bad? Well, nothing that won't heal.
not_available Does this mean that I'm out? 
not_available We're gonna do everything we can.
not_available What's your talent? 
not_available Rhythmic dancing.
not_available With hoops and ribbons.
not_available Malik, how many times you gonna pass by with the same cart? 
not_available I got a spot on my hockey team.
not_available Do I look like I play hockey? What about your pal in Cards? Big East
not_available Indian dude.
not_available I can skate.
not_available I played in college, if you're in a pinch.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Cute guy, Curtain 3, daddy material.
not_available Just say thanks, okay? Malucci, waitChen! What? 
not_available Your mother's been holding 10 minutes.
not_available Not very pleasantly, I might add.
not_available Just tell her I'm with a patient.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Lying might be part of your job description.
not_available It's not part of mine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hello, Mommy.
not_available Well, I've been busy.
not_available Morning, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Frank, any messages? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Quite a few.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Power meeting today? I have a seminar that I do not have time for.
not_available Could you remind me to leave by 6, please? 
not_available Seemed like a good idea at the time.
not_available Super glue.
not_available I hope that's one of two.
not_available The bird man still dead? It's one of one.
not_available Are there any traumas coming in? No.
not_available But I've got a guy in Exam 3 who cut his hand on a tin can.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gottschalk, you have a minute? Unfortunately, I'm on my way to a conference and I'm very late.
not_available I'll make this quick.
not_available I'd like to discuss with you the faculty position here.
not_available I really have to go.
not_available I just need a minute.
not_available I apologize for bothering you like this, but
not_available After you turned us down, we offered it to someone else.
not_available Has it been accepted? 
not_available Well, not officially.
not_available Then you can withdraw it.
not_available Our candidate has excellent credentials.
not_available So do I.
not_available And he has positive recommendations.
not_available And I don't? I'm not at liberty to discuss your current standing.
not_available Which means Romano said something? 
not_available I can't get into this.
not_available What did he tell you? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton
not_available No.
not_available I need to know what that man said and who he said it to.
not_available You may have difficulty finding work locally.
not_available That's all I can say.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's 1100 hours.
not_available Excuse me? I need to ship out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sir, if you're waiting for a transfer to another facility why don't we have a nurse help you.
not_available We're taking Inchon! 
not_available Inchon? Korea.
not_available Huge battle, if memory serves.
not_available Sorry.
not_available He's a wanderer.
not_available What's his story? Nursing Home.
not_available Altered mental status.
not_available He became combative and got punched in the nose.
not_available History of dementia? No.
not_available The military talk started a few days ago.
not_available Anything on exam? 
not_available His nose isn't broken.
not_available But he has a low
not_available grade temp with no obvious signs of infection.
not_available CBC, Chem
not_available 7 and UA.
not_available If his pulse ox is low, get a chest film.
not_available Damn tab busted off.
not_available You ever think about using a can opener? Sure.
not_available But then what's the point of having a tab? I started digging around the edges there.
not_available It looks to me like you may need a few stitches.
not_available Of course, the tuna juice leaks out.
not_available And it gets greasy all over.
not_available And then, bam! The knife goes right into my hand.
not_available I'm going to do a regional block to numb the area around where I'm gonna be suturing.
not_available Are you sure you've done this before? Sorry.
not_available I need some I and D kits.
not_available You might feel a little burning.
not_available I'm going to the 8:00 tonight, Abby.
not_available How about you? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available The exact same thing happened when I tried to open a milk carton with a pair of scissors.
not_available The bruises sort of sprang up overnight.
not_available That's why I brought him in here.
not_available He has Niemann
not_available Pick's Type A.
not_available I have some material here, if you're not familiar.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available His liver and spleen are both enlarged.
not_available That's from the sphingomyelin deposits in both organs.
not_available Well, a big spleen chews up platelets.
not_available That's why he's bleeding.
not_available Is there anything we can do? 
not_available We can make him more comfortable.
not_available I'll start him on some morphine.
not_available Would that make him unconscious? Because I want him to be lucid for as long as he can be.
not_available It'll be a very small dose of medicine.
not_available What about the spleen? You said that's causing the problem.
not_available Well, if it's taken out, that might help stop the bleeding but you do know your son is end
not_available stage? Yes.
not_available We'll get an ultrasound of his abdomen, and I'll have a surgeon come take a look.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen? I usually wait for labs to come back before consulting Surgery.
not_available He's got splenomegaly.
not_available Pretty clear case of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
not_available I thought you said he was end
not_available stage.
not_available It doesn't mean he can't have surgery.
not_available I'd think about whether it's appropriate at this point.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I need to get Thanks.
not_available Abby? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You have a feather.
not_available I have a We had these Thank you.
not_available What? I was just thinking I was just wondering, if you wanted, maybe we could We could what? Go out sometime.
not_available Oh, you mean, like a date? Yeah.
not_available That's sort of what I was thinking.
not_available Tonight? Sure.
not_available Tonight works.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available See you then.
not_available Okay.
not_available Romano.
not_available Peter, back for a visit? How are you? 
not_available How the hell do you think I am? Well, judging by your demeanor, I'd say you were a tad dyspeptic.
not_available You've been trashing me all over town? Having trouble landing a job? 
not_available Thanks to you.
not_available I'm offended.
not_available You've made enemies all over this hospital.
not_available Why assume I'm the only one saying negative
not_available ? You're preventing me from earning a living.
not_available No, actually, I'm willing to help.
not_available What? 
not_available Your personality sucks but you don't have to prove that you're a great surgeon.
not_available Now, I am willing to offer you a per diem position.
not_available Per diem? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It has no benefits and even less stature, but it's yours for the asking.
not_available You can kiss my ass.
not_available I take it that's a "no"? You couldn't pay me enough to work for you again, you arrogant little prick.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available Just keep working on those people skills, Peter.
not_available Labs are back on Mr.
not_available Mellonston.
not_available Good.
not_available Great color.
not_available Thanks.
not_available UA's full of white cells.
not_available He's got a riproaring urinary
not_available tract infection.
not_available Sorry I called you prematurely.
not_available Always happens with nursing
not_available home patients.
not_available Give an old guy a bad UTI, next thing you know, he's General MacArthur.
not_available I called the home, and they've already given his bed away.
not_available Family members who can take him in? 
not_available He's at the mercy of Social Services.
not_available Hey, back to work! Get back to work! Come on.
not_available Show's over.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available He talks like a vet.
not_available If he is one, he could qualify for the VA.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That'll take days to process.
not_available I know a caseworker at North Chicago with pull.
not_available Maybe we can transfer today.
not_available Do you want me to call? 
not_available Sure, if you think it can be done.
not_available Anybody missing an old man looking for brass cleaner? He just walked into a pelvic exam.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mellonston! Mr.
not_available Mellonston? 
not_available Kerry.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Peter, I thought you'd left us.
not_available I could be talked into coming down to the ER.
not_available As an Attending? 
not_available As a liaison to Surgery.
not_available As a resident you went out of your way to take every procedure away from us.
not_available If you had a surgeon teaching residents, more procedures would stay here.
not_available How? 
not_available I could expedite cases to the O.
not_available R.
not_available We have surgical residents for that.
not_available Could you tell me if there's an elderly gentleman in there? Does 47 count? 
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available See, I could do scheduling and
not_available God knows we could use the help.
not_available Kerry, hire me.
not_available Look, I'd love to.
not_available Get Romano to pay for it, you got yourself a job.
not_available Trolling for work, Peter? Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available I'm interested to see what required the interruption of my lunch.
not_available As I explained on the phone, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.
not_available So you'll operate? 
not_available Well no.
not_available I would if he didn't have Niemann
not_available Pick's.
not_available Snow him and wait.
not_available We can't just let him slowly bleed to death.
not_available It's a terminal disease.
not_available Surgery will only slightly delay the inevitable.
not_available If the surgery were successful, then the family would have more time with him.
not_available And if wishes were horses, we'd all be knee
not_available deep in crap.
not_available I didn't become a surgeon to torture dying children.
not_available Let the boy die in peace.
not_available But the mother wants it.
not_available No surgery, Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available What the hell is this? 
not_available Explosion at a hair salon.
not_available Sad cultural commentary, isn't it? Pursuit of beauty at all costs.
not_available Nice legs, though.
not_available There you go.
not_available Oh, God! What am I going to do? 
not_available It probably won't scar.
not_available But they look hideous.
not_available I can't go on stage like this.
not_available Can you wear pants? 
not_available Not in the swimsuit competition.
not_available You know, you probably think this is so stupid.
not_available I'm just trying to win a scholarship.
not_available I'm premed.
not_available I can give you something for the pain if you'd like.
not_available It's okay.
not_available They look worse than they feel.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Can you get ahold of Miss Pruitt at Abbott and Sons? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Miss Pruitt.
not_available You mean that
not_available Don't ask.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Hey, Dave? Did you find anybody yet? For what? 
not_available For hockey tonight.
not_available Yeah.
not_available A friend of mine.
not_available He might sign on.
not_available Former pro, just looking for exercise.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available It's a rough game we play, actually
not_available So you don't think I can handle it.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available I used to play varsity, second line.
not_available Well, if he can't make it, I'll call you.
not_available Type and cross for four.
not_available Start two units of O
not_available neg on the rapid infuser.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Multiple GSWs, one to the chest.
not_available Looks like a hemopneumothorax.
not_available Five hundred cc's out.
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available We need to crack her chest.
not_available Right
not_available sided GSW's an indication for the sternal saw.
not_available Can I do it? Next time, Carter.
not_available 10 blade.
not_available Hold CPR.
not_available Sternal saw.
not_available She needs a central line.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mellonston? Mr.
not_available Mellonston? Mr.
not_available Mellonston.
not_available He said he lost his razor on Old Baldy, wanted to borrow mine.
not_available Gil didn't really need it though.
not_available All he had was peach fuzz.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available A mortar shell took his head off.
not_available Why don't we take you back to your bed so you can rest, okay? Here we go.
not_available You've seen war, haven't you? 
not_available Actually, no.
not_available I have not.
not_available But you've seen men die.
not_available Yes.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mellonston, I'm afraid I have some rather unfortunate news.
not_available You've lost your bed at the nursing home.
not_available But we've already called the VA to see if we can find a placement.
not_available They won't take me! 
not_available I'm sure that you qualify.
not_available I won't go there! Please tryI can't go there! I won't! 
not_available Calm down.
not_available We're only trying to help.
not_available I can't go there! I won't! Malik! Malik, come over
not_available ! No, please! Don't let them take me! Don't let them take me away.
not_available Please.
not_available His nose stopped bleeding.
not_available What'd you find out? Well, the surgeon feels that it's too great a risk to operate on Kenneth.
not_available But he's suffering.
not_available Can't you see that? Ms.
not_available Stein, Kenneth is barely conscious.
not_available That's not true! He squeezes my hand.
not_available He understands me.
not_available That means everything that can be done should be done.
not_available Yes.
not_available But there's a good chance that Kenneth won't survive the operation.
not_available I know what you're thinking.
not_available I'm selfish.
not_available I'm keeping my son alive for me, not him.
not_available Ms.
not_available Stein, I'm not thinking
not_available He's my child.
not_available I want every minute I can with him.
not_available Wait till you're a mother, then you'll know.
not_available Get him the surgery.
not_available Looks like a small
not_available caliber GSW to the right ventricle.
not_available Okay.
not_available That should do it.
not_available Heart's not filling.
not_available She's had five units.
not_available We need more volume.
not_available Prep the paddles.
not_available Can't shock an empty heart.
not_available You'll never get her back.
not_available Run in another two units.
not_available Give me some 0 silk.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available What are you doing, Carter? Beck's suture.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep traction on that.
not_available I'll check the back side of the heart.
not_available What do you see? Exit wound in the left ventricle.
not_available Give me 2
not_available 0 silk.
not_available I can repair it.
not_available Not from that side.
not_available I have a better angle here.
not_available I saw blood welling up behind the heart.
not_available I thought there might be another hole.
not_available Okay.
not_available Charge to 20.
not_available Okay, now cut it.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still V
not_available fib.
not_available Okay.
not_available Charge to 30.
not_available Clear.
not_available Got a rhythm.
not_available Sinus tach.
not_available Got a pulse.
not_available Nice job, Carter.
not_available Notify the O.R.
not_available She's got a septal defect they need to repair.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, Mrs.
not_available Danzer's having more chest pain, dropped her pressure to 90.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Are you gonna take her up? Sterile saline dressings and hang the FFP.
not_available Great save, Carter.
not_available Very slick.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Ativan? 
not_available Yeah, point 5.
not_available He's pretty subdued.
not_available Did you hear from the VA? 
not_available There's good news and bad news.
not_available I found Mr.
not_available Mellonston a bed.
not_available But it's in a brig.
not_available He's AWOL.
not_available AWOL? From where? Korean War.
not_available 1951, Army corporal.
not_available Deserted on leave.
not_available Unfortunately, my VA contact took it upon himself to notify the active military.
not_available Why would they care about someone who deserted 50 years ago? Who knows? They may want to slap him on the wrist.
not_available They may want to court
not_available martial him.
not_available For God's sake! He's 72 years old.
not_available I know.
not_available Is there anything we can do? 
not_available Legally? No.
not_available Peter, what are you doing here? Did you get any of my messages? Yes.
not_available And I meant to call you.
not_available I've just been incredibly busy.
not_available I just didn't know what to say.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it's okay.
not_available No.
not_available No, it's not okay.
not_available I've been avoiding you for days.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got that.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What Robert did was wrong.
not_available And I've told him as much.
not_available I just wish there was something I could do.
not_available Well, I didn't exactly expect you to resign in protest.
not_available That's a relief.
not_available There is something you can do.
not_available You can put the word out.
not_available I know you've got a lot of contacts at other hospitals.
not_available Of course.
not_available I'm surprised you haven't been snapped up already.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it seems that lately my reputation has taken a hit.
not_available He's a horrid little turd, isn't he? You know what? I spoke with a friend in Philadelphia who's looking for someone.
not_available I just wasn't sure you'd care to move.
not_available At this point, I'm open to anything.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, they need you in the ER.
not_available I no longer work at this hospital.
not_available Weaver called.
not_available Your sister Jackie is down there.
not_available What was the last BP? 
not_available 100/60.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available I'll grab the drug box.
not_available How is she? 
not_available Who are you? Her sister.
not_available She was shot in the chest.
not_available She's critical.
not_available She needs surgery.
not_available You can go wait in theOh, Lord! What happened? Call Security now! Oh, my God! Carter! Are you all right? 
not_available Heart stopped beating.
not_available I'll start compressions.
not_available Any rhythm? 
not_available Agonal at 34.
not_available Looks like P.E.A.
not_available Amp of atropine, amp of epi.
not_available Mix up the dopamine.
not_available That girl must've been a gangbanger.
not_available Chest is dry.
not_available Pupils are fixed and dilated.
not_available There's gray matter everywhere.
not_available You won't get her back.
not_available Blew her brains out.
not_available Hyperventilators, 70 of mannitol.
not_available Check cold
not_available water calorics, and we'll call it.
not_available Somebody call the police! What happened? 
not_available Jesse got into a fight.
not_available You don't know, all right? I was surprised when they said you were here.
not_available I had to take care of something.
not_available How is he? Superficial lac above the eyebrow, mild periorbital swelling but no bony deformity or tenderness.
not_available Nothing serious.
not_available Told you.
not_available He was bleeding pretty bad.
not_available Did you hit your head? Pass out? He slammed me into the locker once, all right? That's all.
not_available You get a CT? 
not_available No.
not_available You think he needs one? Maybe.
not_available There was no LOC, no focal neuro deficits.
not_available With head injuries, you can't be too careful.
not_available Jackie, he's fine.
not_available He's fine.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, Jackie.
not_available How about I buy you a cup of coffee? Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available They found the shooter.
not_available Good.
not_available Only 15 years old.
not_available Why don't you go home? I'll be all right.
not_available Go home.
not_available You've probably seen enough trauma for one day.
not_available I'll tell Kerry.
not_available He's a teenager.
not_available It's normal stuff.
not_available No, he's changed.

not_available You try talking to him? 
not_available We've tried everything.
not_available Grounding him is a joke.
not_available He goes out anyway.
not_available I can't have him locked up.
not_available The other day he shoved his father.
not_available Took everything Walter had not to

not_available You too.
not_available So, what did you have in mind? Dinner? Movie? I was thinking of something a little more physical.
not_available Not if you go in laparoscopically.
not_available Recovery time is reduced and he gains back weeks maybe even months of his life.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Are you saying it's too risky for you or for the patient? Yeah, whatever.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Problems? 
not_available Can't find a surgeon.

not_available Now you can't?

not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Think fast! I can't believe the VA is moving this quickly.

not_available We're looking at artwork tonight.
not_available I'm subbing in a hockey game.
not_available What? 
not_available Malucci.
not_available He asked me to play hockey.
not_available Malucci? Are you mad? What? You never said one word to me about hockey before.
not_available You never asked.
not_available Do you play well? 
not_available Well, why don't you come find out? You could wear your sweater, you could bring some pompoms.
not_available I'd be in uniform.
not_available I didn't know sports had this effect on you.
not_available Has something happened? No, why? 
not_available You're home early.
not_available Yep.
not_available You never leave the hospital early.
not_available Someone fax you my schedule? I know when you left this morning.

not_available Yep.
not_available What you expected? 
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available How about you? Have you eaten? I'll take you to Dominic's.
not_available John, to be honest, I hoped that you would feel so uncomfortable there that you wouldn't want to stay.
not_available I know.
not_available So I wouldn't have to ask you not to.
not_available Well, then don't.
not_available Just give me five minutes.
not_available I'll get changed.
not_available John.
not_available I know your heart is in the right place.
not_available I know you enjoy being a doctor.
not_available Start a practice.
not_available I'm not fighting you on that anymore.
not_available Can't we just agree to disagree on this? No.
not_available There are other ways to help people.
not_available You don't have to destroy yourself.
not_available Gamma
not_available That place nearly killed you, John.
not_available It killed your friend.
not_available It drove you to drugs.
not_available No.
not_available I did that on my own.
not_available You don't owe them anything.
not_available You don't have to prove anything.
not_available You have a beautiful spirit.
not_available I've seen them beat that spirit out of you.
not_available Gamma, I'm gonna be fine.
not_available I promise.
not_available I wish I could believe you.
not_available Gamma? Wait.
not_available Stop spinning.
not_available You're not supposed to spin.
not_available How am I supposed to keep you from? 
not_available It's all in the wrists, really.
not_available I think I pulled a muscle.
not_available Oh, maybe we should take a break.
not_available Good idea.

not_available You'll have to come see it.
not_available Your hotel room? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I mean
not_available I mean, no.
not_available I mean
not_available I'd never ask such a thing of a lady.

not_available Of course, that makes it two.
not_available Come on, rematch.
not_available We out of here, or not?

not_available I'm serious.
not_available I'm not stupid.

not_available That's all.
not_available Well, maybe they would if you treated them with respect.
not_available You mean do what they say.
not_available Look, sometimes you gotta do what you don't wanna do.
not_available That's part of being a man.
not_available Peter, do you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hold on a second, okay? Just do what your mother says.

not_available I didn't have much of a choice.
not_available I mean, I'm being blackballed here.
not_available When will I see you? 
not_available Well, it's only an hour by air.
not_available We'll work something out.
not_available I guess so.
not_available You coming home with us? 
not_available No, I gotta make a stop.
not_available Can you do me a favor and take him? 
not_available Of course.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available Okay.

not_available Hi.
not_available I thought you'd left.
not_available Briefly.
not_available You know, you don't need to finish your shift.
not_available I still got a couple hours left.
not_available Carter, I think that you'd be better served by taking it easy.
not_available I'll go to a meeting after my shift's over.
not_available If that's okay with you? I need to finish.

not_available Here, okay? Really busy tonight.
not_available Sure.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Pick it up.
not_available Table eight first.
not_available The hospital said Reece could stay until the end of the month.
not_available That gives us more time to find another daycare center.
not_available It'll be hard finding him a place he loves more.
not_available I know.
not_available Listen, I just got an Attending position at Hahnemann in Philadelphia.
not_available Really? Good for you.
not_available So we just need to work out Reece's visitation schedule.
not_available Maybe he could fly down every other weekend or something.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're not suggesting I put my son on a plane by himself, are you? 
not_available Carla, we have joint custody.
not_available In Chicago.
not_available I already took the job.
not_available Wish that had worked for me when I wanted to move.
not_available That was Germany, nine hours away.
not_available That's completely different.
not_available No.
not_available It is completely the same.
not_available What is this about? Payback? It's about our agreement.
not_available Now, either you stay local, or you give up custody.
not_available I can't find a decent position here.
not_available That's right.
not_available You have your career to think of.
not_available The rest of us just have jobs.
not_available Table six needs more bread.
not_available This is the only way for me to keep my momentum.
not_available Yes.
not_available And Germany was Roger's.

not_available Hang Dilantin.
not_available One gram per 1000 of saline.

not_available I'm okay.
not_available Someone should sew it up, Luka.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? Detective Stetler.
not_available Can I have a moment? Can you tell me exactly what happened? We were walking by the river.

not_available Come on.
not_available Haleh, I need that drill.
not_available Okay.
not_available Clear.
not_available I didn't see him coming.
not_available After he hit you from behind, what happened? I went down.
not_available Did he take your wallet? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you felt your life was in danger.
not_available Mine and hers.
not_available Did he threaten to hurt you? I'm not sure.
not_available Did he say, "Give me your money, or I'll kill you"? He had a pipe.
not_available He was going after Abby.
not_available And you can corroborate that? 
not_available Yeah.

not_available That'll induce a coma, you know.
not_available It's either that or watch him die.
not_available Abby told me about what happened.
not_available Can I take a look? It's superficial.
not_available Did you lose consciousness? 
not_available For a moment, yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's fix you up.
