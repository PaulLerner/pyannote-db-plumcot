NEELA The toughest thing about being a doctor isn 't the terrible hours.
not_available It isn 't the loneliness, the isolation, or the knowledge that one day we all lose out to the relentless decay of the human body.
not_available No, it's something else.
not_available Ray.
not_available It's 5 a.

not_available Don't you want to hear your fortune?.
not_available I'll be back soon, I promise.
not_available Lucien, are you sure about this?.
not_available No, but the conservative approach doesn't seem to be working out.
not_available She's bacteremic and if we go in now.
NEELA The toughest thing is making the right call when it counts.
not_available Forget it.
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available What?.
not_available You' re gonna be an attending soon, better assert yourself.
not_available No, you' re probably right
not_available You know, these decisions are the hardest part of our job.
not_available Consider the alternatives, follow through in your mind, make a choice.
not_available Can't control what happens after that.
not_available O.R.

not_available ln my dream.
not_available Uh, I'm a dream runner.
NEELA Dream runner?.
NlCK Most people are paralyzed during REM they don't do what they dream about.
not_available My brain chemistry's off, so that paralysis thing doesn't work right.
not_available So you act things out?.
NlCK Big
not_available wave surfing, car chases, dragon slaying.
not_available I've done it all.

NEELA Well, that's understandable.
GATES Tibfib displaced, 
not_available I'm gonna get a Stryker probe.
NEELA What?.
not_available Why?.
not_available Missed a compartment syndrome, doesn't wanna get burned.
not_available It's a good pedal pulse, no swelling.
not_available I doubt it's compartment syndrome.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Here.
not_available What's this?.
not_available Those Blackhawk tickets that we got.
not_available It's, uh, this week.
not_available You take them, Sam.
not_available Take Alex.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available It was your idea.
not_available You might wanna take someone else?.
not_available Gates, you have six patients on the board including a fresh trauma so cut the chatter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, four of your patients bounced back tonight.
not_available It would be okay if you did.
GATES If I did what?.
not_available Take someone else.
not_available Sam, will you stop it?.
not_available There's no one else I wanna take.
not_available Here.
not_available Gates, get plain films, then remove shards and then irrigate.
not_available We could use you too, poor guy's lV keeps blowing.
not_available No problem.
not_available Check crit q 30 and
not_available What was that?.
not_available What was what?.
not_available Banfield, man.
not_available One minute she's kind of loose and cool then snap, she's back to piranha queen.
not_available She was annoyed at me for being short.
not_available She made Frank take off his tie and throw it in the trash.
not_available Dr.

not_available Yeah, she was mortified, made them walk to the movies.

DUBENKO What?.
not_available Why?.
SHlRLEY First liter's up.
NEELA I'm post
not_available call and exhausted.
not_available I called in some favors to get you those interviews.
not_available You feel bad about me not having a job.
not_available Who told you that?.
not_available You've been acting like you'd never let me leave, but I get it, things change.
not_available Where's this coming from?.

not_available Oliver's your son?.
not_available Y eah.
not_available Just turned 1.
not_available Crit dropped another two points.
not_available Oh, dilutional, most likely.
not_available We'll check another hemacue in a half
not_available hour.
not_available What, and meanwhile we just let it keep dropping?.
not_available I thought you said it was dilutional.
not_available Recheck it now, Sam.
not_available I already signed out to Suri, I'll have her know.
not_available What?.
not_available You're leaving?.
not_available My shift's over.
not_available They're waiting for me.
not_available Shifts and breaks such a nursey concept, I've always hated them.
not_available Bye, Mr.
not_available Vasquez.
not_available Damn, I think I nicked the common bile duct.
DUBENKO You think you did or you did?.
not_available You did.
NEELA So much inflamed tissue, I couldn't see.
not_available You had no business cutting.

NEELA Don't take it personally.
SAM It's a teaching hospital.
NEELA I'm aware.
not_available Operating on her was dicey to begin with.
SAM That's your call.
NEELA We should have our A team.
SAM A team?.
not_available Why don't you focus on your job and let me do mine.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Aah! 
not_available I dialed the halothane down when her pressure got dicey.

not_available Great.
not_available Cordis in.
not_available That wasn't so bad.
not_available He's got a high tolerance for pain.
GATES Hang a unit of type specific.
not_available How's it going?.
not_available He's tachy and crit's down to 29.
not_available All right, let's pack him up, and get him to angio.
not_available Angio?.
not_available You mean CT, right?.
not_available No, I mean angio.
not_available He has a pelvic fracture.
GATES Fracture's non
not_available displaced, unlikely to bleed.
not_available The ultrasound was negative.
GATES Could be retroperitoneal.
BANFlELD If the angiogram is normal we'll explore that.
not_available Right now the pelvis is where the money is.

not_available You are always the girl.
not_available Nick?.

DUBENKO Five thousand units heparin.
not_available Protein C first?.
not_available Not standard, there have been good outcomes 
not_available for DlC or sepsis.
DUBENKO Go ahead.
not_available Thing is you have to give it before you give the heparin or it won't work.
not_available Something that came up in a class.
not_available Okay, protein C, and then the heparin.
not_available V
not_available tach.
NEELA I can't believe this.

not_available No change.
not_available Give the amiodarone.
not_available Sorry to belabor, but you don't drop crit 1 O points from non

not_available If you'd scanned him you might have seen what I'm seeing in time.
not_available Go find an O.R.
not_available The belly's full of blood.
not_available You know where it's coming from?.
not_available Go! 
SAM Fourth epi's in.
not_available Someone needs to update the mother.
NEELA I should have fought you.
DUBENKO You should have.
GATES Dream runner's bleeding out in angio.
DUBENKO Okay, go.

not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available This feels like a dream.
BANFlELD We can 's see the future.
not_available Sometimes we can, actually.
not_available With this handy new technology called the CT.
not_available You heard of it?.
not_available Fine.
not_available Do I wish I could do it over?.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available There was no way to know
not_available Gates was begging to get the scan.
not_available Gates is a resident.
not_available Don't make this about hierarchy.
not_available If any of us refuse to hear another opinion, the system breaks down.
not_available What system?.
not_available You guys don't have a system.
not_available All I see here is chaos and disorder.
MORRlS Maybe that's the problem.
not_available Maybe that's why after five months you still don't get it, still don't fit in.
not_available Fit in?.
not_available This isn't junior high.
not_available We are a team.
not_available We work together.
not_available But you think that you're so much better than all of us.
not_available So much smarter.
not_available You'll never let yourself be part of it.
not_available If you wanna be a queen go into private practice back to lndonesia, leave medicine altogether.
not_available But don't torture us here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Banfield.
not_available Jerry, turn this in to human resources.
NEELA What are you doing?.
not_available Going home.
NEELA This isn't your fault.
not_available lf I'd come down sooner l

not_available It's just been an unbelievably horrible day.
not_available You know what you need?.
not_available A didgeridoo.
not_available Banfield just quit and I just helped kill two patients.
not_available Oh.
not_available Uh, Neela, I'm sorry.
not_available Neela.
NEELA The care of every patient is a twisty maze that leads to an infinite number of potential outcomes.
not_available We hope that knowledge and experience guide us but sometimes it becomes obvious a wrong turn was made.
not_available Ray.
not_available It's 5 a.
not_available m.
not_available I know, but sometimes we do actually get to sleep on call.
not_available Pick a color and a number between one and 1 0.
not_available Blue and three.
not_available BLU
not_available E.
not_available One, two, three.
DUBENKO Hey, at this point removing the source of infection is our best option.
not_available You mean taking out my gall bladder.
DUBENKO Let's finally get you better.
not_available Hurry up, I'm getting sick of you people.
not_available I'm gonna go call your mom.
not_available Hang in there Ana, I'll check on you in a little while.
not_available Don't you wanna hear your fortune?.
not_available I'll be back soon, I promise.
NEELA If only it were possible to apply the wisdom of our mistakes go back to the fork in the road and this time be assertive.
not_available Choose the road we think we should take.
not_available Not the path of least resistance.
not_available Forget it.
not_available No, wait.
not_available Don't forget it.
not_available She could die on the table.
not_available She could die if we do nothing.
not_available These decisions are the hardest part of our job.
not_available Wait one more day.
not_available We'll move her to PlCU, I'll get lD to approve the synercid.
not_available There's no improvement, we'll take her to the O.R.
not_available tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay?.
not_available Yeah, you're almost an attending, I need to start listening to you.
not_available Meet me in the unit for rounds in 1 0.
not_available Yeah, that's totally gonna make the elevator come faster.
not_available What are you, like, in seventh grade?.
not_available I look young, I know.
not_available Of course I realize that pressing a button 1 O times is not gonna make it faster but sometimes when you're powerless in a situation, you gotta do something.
not_available That's why you're a surgeon, right?.
not_available You like to cut, fix, do.
not_available I suppose.
not_available Ah, but to choose inaction is in and of itself action, isn't it?.
not_available Who are you?.
not_available Ned Roth.
not_available Patient transport specialist.
not_available Buddhist.
not_available Omnivore.
not_available Neela Ras
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Have a nice day, doctor.
not_available What are you doing?.
not_available And don't say it's none of my business because it is.
not_available It is?.
not_available How's that?.
not_available lf you're doing drugs, we need to know.
not_available And if you wanted to keep it a secret you wouldn't be in the break room.
not_available It's 5:30 in the morning.
not_available I didn't think anyone would be in here.
not_available It's recombinant FSH hormone.
not_available We're trying to have a baby.
not_available Oh, wow.
not_available We're giving in vitro a try.
not_available Well, that's exciting.
not_available Well, we better all hope it works the first time.
not_available I tell you, these drugs and doctoring is a dangerous mix.
not_available Why do you say that?.
not_available I'm erratic, indecisive and I've been a real bitch to the staff.
not_available Really?.
not_available Even more than I usually am.
not_available Everyone and everything just seems to get on my nerves.
not_available I don't know, maybe I should quit.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available Neela?.
not_available This conversation?.
not_available lt never happened.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra, perfect timing.
not_available Page the intern, I'm not really here.
not_available A guy fell out of a second
not_available story window, they need a surgeon in Trauma 1.
not_available All right.
not_available Page Dubenko and let him know, okay?.
not_available I hear you're interviewing for attending positions at trauma conference today.
not_available You did?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Lucien's whining about losing you to another institution.
not_available He was?.
not_available Don't look shocked, you know he's grooming you for a faculty position.
NEELA He's the one who set up all the interviews.
BANFlELD That's the game.
NEELA What do you mean?.
not_available My brain chemistry's off, that paralysis thing doesn't work right.
not_available So you act things out?.
not_available Big
not_available wave surfing, car chases, dragon slaying.
not_available I've done it all.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vasquez, please meet our esteemed surgical colleague 
not_available Dr.
not_available Neela Rasgotra.
not_available Hello.
not_available Am I going to need surgery?.
not_available I hope not.
not_available Oh.
not_available These seem superficial, but let's get an x
not_available ray to be sure.
not_available Ultrasound?.
not_available Just called for the machine.
not_available Tib
not_available fib displaced, I'm gonna get a Stryker probe.
not_available Good pedal pulse, no swelling.
not_available He doesn't have compartment syndrome.
not_available Gates missed a compartment syndrome last week, he's got PTSD.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available Five minutes.
not_available Can't let a bad case derail your focus on the patient in front of you.
not_available Someone ate their Wheaties this morning.
not_available You guys looking for this?.
not_available Yeah.
NEELA Can we lower the table, please?.
not_available Hey.
not_available I haven't seen you all week.
not_available I know.
not_available It's weird.
not_available Yeah, really.
not_available Sam, we need a second line over here.
not_available I have something that I wanna give you later, okay?.
not_available I'm not getting a good look at the spleen, but the belly looks clear.
not_available No sign of internal injuries.
not_available I'll stay here, you run the board.
not_available I'm already in on this.
not_available I am in no mood to move the meat.
not_available I have the authority to do what I want.
not_available Drunks, drug seekers, hysterical parents.
not_available They're all yours.
not_available Shoo.
not_available Okay.
not_available I gotta run rounds in the PlCU.
not_available Hi.
not_available How's the new digs.
not_available Okay, except for no TV.
not_available Well, at least you have your own room up here, right?.
not_available Her, uh, oxygen level's still a bit low.
not_available So what now?.
not_available We wait.
not_available And hope her own immune system conquers the infection.
not_available She can do it.
not_available She's tough.
not_available I need you to get better so you can help me download Scrabble on my cell.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's she doing?.
not_available Twenty of dopamine, sats hanging around 9O, lactate's on the edge.
DUBENKO Well, next 24 hours will give us our answer.
not_available You off to interviews?.
not_available I was thinking of cancelling.
not_available Are you crazy?.
not_available I should see this through.
not_available No, go.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available I'll call you if anything changes.
not_available Trauma programs will be fighting over you.
not_available All right then.
not_available You know, um, I don't get it.
not_available Get what?.
not_available You seem to be dying to get rid of me you keep mumbling about the hiring freeze at County pushing me to do interviews all over.
not_available But then I keep hearing other things.
not_available What other things?.
not_available If you want me to stay, how come you never asked?.
not_available We can't have this discussion until you've seen what else is out there.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Just go.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Wow.
not_available Look at you.
not_available How's our dream walker guy doing?.
not_available Runner.
not_available Dream runner.
not_available He's stable, waiting for ortho.
not_available Good.
not_available I should be on the El right now, rushing to this interview thing but instead I'm here obsessing over cheese or ranch.
not_available You know what else I'm thinking about?.
not_available Twinkies?.
not_available Sam.
not_available I think I always sort of underestimated her.
not_available I feel bad about that.
not_available You know, you two should never have broken up.
not_available It's sort of complicated and I think it's best if I lay low right now.
not_available Well, inaction is in and of itself action.
not_available What?.
not_available Don't listen to me.
not_available I'm post
not_available call and you know how I get.
not_available Daria.
BRENNER Hey, stranger.
not_available Hey, when did you get back?.
not_available Last night.
not_available Sorry, l, uh, haven't eaten in, like, 24 hours.
not_available Do you wanna go and get a proper lunch?.
not_available Uh, no, I can't.
not_available I've got a bunch of attending interviews.
not_available Cool.
not_available ls it?.
not_available I'm not so sure.
not_available I'm supposed to know things, have goals, and
not_available How can I have gotten this far in my life, have no idea what I want from my life?.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm rambling.
not_available And self
not_available absorbed.
not_available How was your trip?.
not_available Don't have to know where you're going, you just gotta keep moving forward.
not_available That is the key to happiness, really.
not_available Well, you've got it all figured out, don't you?.
not_available See you later, Simon.
not_available Hello, I'm
not_available Neela Rasgotra.
not_available I'm so glad you're here.
not_available I thought you were in London all this time.
not_available It was great for a while but I'd been gone too long and England just didn't feel like my home anymore.
not_available Believe me, I know what you mean.
not_available And then I got the call from Duke.
not_available How's Ella doing?.
not_available Amazing.
not_available Eight, if you can believe it.
not_available Oh, wow.
not_available She's beautiful.
not_available Ha, ha.
not_available Durham's a great place to raise a kid.
not_available I thought I was gonna miss the city, but I don't.
not_available So, uh, when I left County you were still doing emergency medicine.
not_available Yeah, well, I saw the light.
not_available Are you looking mainly at academic positions or community hospitals?.
not_available Uh, l
not_available I don't know.
not_available Uh, both, I guess.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available And are you hoping to focus on trauma surgery or are you open to elective cases as well?.
not_available I'm open.
not_available And, uh, do you have any research areas?.
not_available I haven't really figured any of that out yet.
not_available Not really the sort of thing one says at a job interview.
not_available No, but I appreciate the honesty.
not_available So is Lucien helping you?.
not_available Helping me with what?.
not_available Figure things out.
not_available Uh, sort of.
not_available Not really.
not_available I don't think County's really in my future.
not_available County's an amazing place.
not_available What I learned there.
not_available It was a very intense period in my life.
not_available But it made me the doctor that I am now, the person that I am now.
not_available Did you ever consider coming back?.
not_available Yes, briefly.
not_available There is something to be said for getting away 
not_available from the place where you trained.
