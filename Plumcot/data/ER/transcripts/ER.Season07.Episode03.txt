not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, I felt I had to
not_available Not a word, Peter.
not_available Not a single word.
not_available I was hoping you'd give me the joy and honor of being your husband.
not_available All right, so we'll put you on the schedule for next week.

not_available Hey, Dave.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available You too.
not_available Yeah, you missed me? 
not_available What happened to your hair? I've got to hop.
not_available The chief's training me on the sternal saw today.
not_available Hope we get a GSW who needs his chest cracked.
not_available I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
not_available And this jerk just cut us off.
not_available And I rear
not_available ended him, and then the air bags went off.
not_available That's disgusting.
not_available Hi, Carter.
not_available Glad you're back.
not_available She drinks anything she can get her hands on.
not_available Probably psychogenic polydipsia.
not_available You want to check her lytes and then call for a Psych consult.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Hey, Lily.
not_available How are you? Chuny, Weaver needs somebody to make a blood run.
not_available Weaver needs to get a couple more nurses.
not_available Can you tell we're short nurses? 
not_available Congratulations.
not_available John, welcome back.
not_available Hey, Carter! I got a live one waiting in Exam 3.
not_available Freak tore off all her toenails with a pair of pliers.
not_available What about me? I need medical attention! 
not_available The only thing you need is a bath.
not_available I'll be there in a minute, Lydia.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Where do you think you're going? 
not_available I work here.
not_available No.
not_available That's an old ID.
not_available Well, I've been away.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, does this one belong to you? Yes, he does.
not_available He'll need to get a new ID from personnel.
not_available You can get it after your shift.
not_available Sorry, doc.
not_available Why not Christmas? 
not_available Next Christmas.
not_available No.
not_available This Christmas.
not_available Are you mad? It takes months to plan a wedding.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Carter.
not_available We got engaged.
not_available We bought a house.
not_available Wow.
not_available Congratulations on both accounts.
not_available Boy! I go away for a couple weeks you guys get engaged, Chen's pregnant Malucci's blond, Admin looks different, and I can't remember my locker combination.
not_available The state medical board made us clean it out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Where's my stuff? Listen, I'll look into getting your locker back.
not_available But you can use mine until then.
not_available Look, I better run.
not_available There's a surgical conference today.
not_available We're short
not_available staffed.
not_available Please don't let your Residents call for any unnecessary consults.
not_available Good luck, Carter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We'll talk dates later.
not_available You ready to rock 'n' roll? Yeah, I guess so.
not_available Listen, if you need anything talk about a case or a patient or anything 
not_available just come find me.
not_available I'll do that.
not_available I will.
not_available You got anything good? 
not_available Got a chest pain in 2 hooked up.
not_available I think Dr.
not_available Greene is free.
not_available Thanks, Lily.
not_available Sorry, Carter, but in order to facilitate your return 
not_available we need to implement a few rules.
not_available Such as? You're to do only minor medical, no trauma.
not_available No suturing.
not_available No needles.
not_available No narcotics.
not_available And absolutely no surgical procedures.
not_available That leaves me with? The chance to practice medicine again.
not_available Let me go! 
not_available Settle down, Mr.
not_available DiBattista! Let go of me! Hey! Give me some fourbyfours! 
not_available I think I know this guy.
not_available Stabilize his neck! Leave me alone, bitch! 
not_available All right, that's it! Once you get back in the swing of things you can resume a normal schedule and do procedures again.
not_available But until then, it's baby steps.
not_available Why don't you start with Mr.
not_available Griffis? Gluteal rash.
not_available Nothing worse than a chapped ass, or so I'm told.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, when did you get out? 
not_available A couple weeks ago.
not_available Well, I got a patient.
not_available Go forth and heal.
not_available So who's watching the drugstore cowboy? I'm head of the ER.
not_available That makes Carter my responsibility.
not_available But didn't he develop his drug addiction under your eye? 
not_available Something you need? Do I need a reason to say hello? But now that I'm here, perhaps you can tell me who replaced the candy in the vending machines with raisins and rice cakes? You're here because you need a sugar fix? We're a hospital.
not_available We're setting an example by offering healthy snacks.
not_available Who are you, the nutrition Nazi? Poor eating habits help keep us in business.
not_available Did you even take the Hippocratic oath? 
not_available I had my fingers crossed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Well, I guess I don't have to ask what you've been up to.
not_available Look, I need a favor.
not_available If it's taking time off, talk to Weaver.
not_available Maternity leave is a topic for those bearing ovaries.
not_available No.
not_available It's about my parents.
not_available I figured you'd run into them at the conference.
not_available I'll say hello.
not_available Well, actually I haven't told them I'm pregnant yet.
not_available I'd appreciate your not saying anything.
not_available I want to surprise them.
not_available How? By going into labor at Sunday dinner? "Mom's" the word.
not_available Just a little longer, Mr.
not_available Griffis.
not_available I've already been here three hours.
not_available How long is this gonna take? What are you doing here? 
not_available Looking for Weaver.
not_available She's under the impression I'm her personal temp.
not_available She's next door.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is somebody gonna dig this wood out of my butt before it sprouts roots? Would you mind, before you go, removing some splinters? Can't you do it? Weaver won't let me use any instruments.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sure.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available You need an ortho surgeon for a closed reduction.
not_available I've been paging them for half an hour.
not_available Call the Attending, tell them you're Weaver.
not_available That usually will scare somebody down.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? I've got a 9year
not_available old who got hit in the larynx with his skateboard.
not_available He's pretty hoarse.
not_available Any sub
not_available Q emphysema? No.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available No stridor, good sats, he's handling secretions.
not_available He woke up with pain.
not_available Visualize his cords? Well, our scope is being serviced.
not_available I paged Head and Neck, but I've been waiting three hours.
not_available Yes, it's moved to the lower right quadrant.
not_available Yes.
not_available We have to scope him.
not_available Call the Attending.
not_available Well, I tried, but they're either in surgery or at some damn conference.
not_available He's too sick for a jump test! Hold on one second.
not_available Dave, do you have a problem? Stewart's had two days of vomiting and diarrhea.
not_available Corday says it's not a good story for an appy.
not_available But now he's got classic 
signs guarding and rebound tenderness.
not_available Did you tell her that? 
not_available Yeah, but she won't come down.
not_available She wants me to make this poor guy get up and jump around! Thanks, Elizabeth.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Where are we going? Where are we going? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, did you page me? 
not_available Yes, Abby.
not_available Hi.
not_available I need those in Exam 4.
not_available Why am I here? 
not_available We're short on nurses.
not_available I'm an OB nurse.
not_available Planning on going back to med school? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then you might as well work in the ER.
not_available You'll see more medicine here.
not_available Right, but I
not_available I'm offering you a learning opportunity that'll put you ahead when you come back as a student.
not_available Which should only take me about two more years.
not_available It's really not so bad down here, Abby.
not_available Yeah? Compared to what? Excuse me.
not_available I'm having trouble with my card key.
not_available What's the name? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Peter Benton.
not_available You're not on the list.
not_available I just became a Surgical Attending.
not_available You're gonna have to park on the street.
not_available I'll park in the visitors' area.
not_available No, you said you work here.
not_available Employees can't park in visitor spaces.
not_available Well, if I'm an employee, then you have to let me in.
not_available I can't.
not_available You're not on the list.
not_available You've got a corneal abrasion.
not_available You mean pinkeye? No.
not_available You've got a scratch on your eyeball.
not_available Probably some dirt got trapped under the eyelid there.
not_available How on earth would that happen? I don't know.
not_available Maybe the wind blew it in.
not_available Well, the last time I was in here they said I had pinkeye.
not_available And crabs.
not_available I think I might have them again.
not_available Well, why don't we treat one thing at a time? I'm gonna get antibiotics and put them in your eye so it doesn't get infected.
not_available Will it stop the hurting? 
not_available We'll get you something for the pain.
not_available Am I gonna get a patch? 
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Hello.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Have you gone downstairs to see that ruptured appy yet? I thought it was a rule
not_available out.
not_available That was 10 minutes ago.
not_available I'm sure it's ruptured by now.
not_available I told you there's a surgical conference, and we're jammed.
not_available If Dr.
not_available Malucci fails to give me a good enough story
not_available I gave you a great story for an appy.
not_available When we call for a consult, we need you to do just that.
not_available Well, thank you for the clarification.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Some things we need downstairs.
not_available Well, these "things" belong to the O.R.
not_available The surgeons can bring them back once they come down to the ER to use them.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available So, Willie, it says here that you're having earaches.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Could you take off your hat so I can have a look? Gee! What happened? 
not_available I couldn't stop the bleeding.
not_available Who did this to you? 
not_available I did.
not_available With what? 
not_available Kitchen shears.
not_available On purpose? Didn't it hurt? 
not_available What do you think? I tried to numb it with ice, but they're still pretty sore.
not_available Yeah, I bet.
not_available Now, why would you give yourself Doberman ears? 
not_available They're Vulcan.
not_available Is that like a Shih Tzu? No, I think he means like Mr.
not_available Spock.
not_available On Star Trek.
not_available Right, right Okay.
not_available We'll irrigate the wounds, wrap them in saline gauze.
not_available Give him a DT and run in a gram of Ancef.
not_available Psych consult? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And I'll call Plastics.
not_available Psych? Wait a second.
not_available But I'm not crazy.
not_available You mutilated yourself with kitchen shears.
not_available How long is it gonna take? The sci
not_available fi convention's today.
not_available I'm already running pretty late.
not_available We're moving at warp speed here.
not_available Hey, I got a present for you.
not_available What? One fiber
not_available optic laryngoscope, compliments of the O.R.
not_available Where did you get this? 
not_available You're better off not knowing.
not_available So you pick out a name for the little bambino yet? No.
not_available Let me get that.
not_available You planning on something Chinese or a little bit more Western? I haven't given it much thought.
not_available Hey, you got a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Got a corneal abrasion that needs Vicodin and I'm not allowed to write for it.
not_available Yeah, I'll take it.
not_available There's an otitis in Exam 2 you can have.
not_available He presents it as pinkeye.
not_available But all he needs is the meds.
not_available Okay.
not_available And wear this mask, because he's pretty rank, and he's got crabs.
not_available Are you going soft on me, Carter? God! It looks like I missed a few things while I was away.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So how far along are you? Twenty
not_available four weeks.
not_available Was this planned, or 
not_available No.
not_available Not particularly.
not_available You know, I gotta run.
not_available Sit still so the doctor can look at your hand.
not_available It hurts.
not_available We'll give you medicine to make it better but let us clean out the germs first.
not_available Irrigate the wound and start him on Augmentin.
not_available Gloria, this looks like a human bite.
not_available His Uncle Charlie bit him.
not_available Did you call Social Services? 
not_available That's Uncle Charlie.
not_available Albert's my grandson.
not_available Charlie's mine.
not_available You're babysitting? if you call that babysitting.
not_available Her daughter got involved with someone with a drug problem.
not_available She got pregnant.
not_available I got Albert.
not_available How long have you had that cough? 
not_available A couple months.
not_available It comes and goes.
not_available Do you smoke? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I go outside.
not_available I don't light up around the kids.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'd like to get a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I just need you to look at Albert's hand.
not_available It'll only take a few minutes.
not_available As long as you're here.
not_available What about Albert and Charlie? 
not_available I can take them to Daycare.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available It's not a problem.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go to the playroom.
not_available I'll get a PA and a lateral chest on Gloria.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Grandma! Grandma! Uncle Charlie bit the nurse! Is everything gone crazy? I can't log on to the system.
not_available Forget your password? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano! 
not_available Peter, you're still here.
not_available I had problems getting into the garage.
not_available Now I can't get onto the computer.
not_available You didn't get my letter? What letter? 
not_available Your privileges have been revoked.
not_available What? Yeah, you remember that dialysis patient of yours? Fletcher, that's right.
not_available Your tattletaling to the inspector general cost me a $50,000 fine 
not_available which my insurance doesn't cover.
not_available I was looking out for my patient.
not_available You also cost the hospital an EMTALA fine.
not_available I had to recoup those monies somewhere.
not_available I was forced to eliminate the Attending position.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We can't talk about this in private? Why? You didn't seem to feel the need to talk in private about our problem.
not_available You just decided to go off on your own.
not_available So now you are.
not_available So, what is my position here? 
not_available You have no position here, Peter.
not_available You're firing me? 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You fired yourself.
not_available Hey, Cleo.
not_available How are you at getting insects out of little boys' ears? Keep him still.
not_available I'll get to him in a minute.
not_available I brought her in with a sore throat.
not_available That was three weeks ago.
not_available She's still not getting any better.
not_available Where are we? 
not_available I see tonsilar exudates.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available It's pus.
not_available Gross.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It looks like strep.
not_available Did you take all the medication the doctor prescribed? 
not_available Yes.
not_available She can't miss any more school.
not_available I'm going to order a couple of tests to rule out other infections.
not_available Rapid strep, mono spot, Gram's stain and culture? 
not_available That'll do it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yep.
not_available Abby, can you find a room for Mr.
not_available Duncan here? Sure.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I need you to suture a head lac, Abby.
not_available I can't do that now.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Can you clean it up for me? 
not_available In a minute.
not_available Abby, just the person I wanted to see.
not_available Bear attack.
not_available I've got businessmen with food poisoning.
not_available Shoot them up with Compazine and plug them into IVs.
not_available You might want to call Housekeeping for some buckets.
not_available Buckets? It was an allyoucan
not_available eat buffet.
not_available Anybody else need anything? 
not_available If I'm being arrested, I get a phone call.
not_available You'll get it.
not_available There's a phone upstairs.
not_available Why are you letting them move him? 
not_available He's wanted for murder.
not_available Lucky I recognized him.
not_available Once a cop, always a cop.
not_available This is not a police department.
not_available They can observe him in the jail ward.
not_available If people don't feel safe, they'll stop coming when they need medical attention.
not_available Only the criminals.
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available I think we're done here, Frank.
not_available I was still observing him.
not_available Freaking liberal foreigners.
not_available It's my decision to transfer or not.
not_available He's a threat to patients and staff.
not_available He needs to be in custody.
not_available That's my decision.
not_available Hey, it's not so bad down here.
not_available I'm gonna give you some antibiotics.
not_available But the next time that you want to pierce your nipples go to a professional, okay? 
not_available You almost finished? I need the bed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, how's it going? 
not_available Great.
not_available Actually, it sucks.
not_available I'm not allowed to do anything.
not_available Well Easy does it? 
not_available You might want to give yourself time.
not_available Time and scut.
not_available I got plenty of both.
not_available It could be worse.
not_available How's that? Did you have to pluck maggots out of anybody's crotch today? 
not_available I had a guy with crabs.
not_available That's not even close.
not_available Anything interesting on the big board? 
not_available A UTI in Exam 2.
not_available I was hoping for something more than a bladder infection.
not_available There are no small patients, Carter.
not_available What about dwarves? You've known Jing
not_available Mei for a while.
not_available I knew her before she was Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available So do you know who got her pregnant? 
not_available Even if I did, I don't know if I'd tell you.
not_available That's not a definitive no.
not_available You two haven't been Yeah.
not_available Sometimes this medicine can give you muscle spasms.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available That's easily reversed with Benadryl.
not_available And I'm sure you'll all feel much better after you're rehydrated.
not_available Okay? Abby, you need a hand in here? 
not_available Everything's under control.
not_available How did you become paralyzed? I was hit by a car.
not_available On my bike.
not_available I would've been killed if I wasn't wearing a helmet.
not_available You were lucky.
not_available You know, I didn't used to think so.
not_available But now I come to the hospital, and I see kids way worse off than me.
not_available It says on your chart you think you might have a urinary tract infection.
not_available Does it burn when you pee? I don't know.
not_available I don't feel much below my waist.
not_available But I can feel pressure on my stomach when I need to go.
not_available That's when I know to catheterize myself.
not_available And how often do you do that? About every six to eight hours.
not_available But lately I've been having to do it more which is usually a sign I have an infection.
not_available You put in your own catheters? 
not_available My grandmother used to help me.
not_available She passed away in February.
not_available Who takes care of you now? 
not_available I live in a retirement home.
not_available It used to be me and my grandmother and now it's just me.
not_available I know that sounds really lame.
not_available But it's across the street from my school and some of the old folks don't get a lot of visits from their families.
not_available It's kind of like having Yeah, it is.
not_available Okay.
not_available You might need some antibiotics.
not_available I'm gonna have a nurse come in and get a urine sample.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I can do it myself.
not_available I'm used to doing stuff like that myself.
not_available I'm gonna have a nurse come in and help, okay? I seem to be a magnet for the weird ones today.
not_available Why? What's up with this guy? Where did this water come from? Mr.
not_available Kamatovik, what did I tell you? I found him soaking his blanket in the sink.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to make a mess.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kamatovik, why is your blanket wet? 
not_available I was afraid I was gonna burn.
not_available I have a family history of spontaneous human combustion.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I gotta stay wet, or I'm gonna go up like a Roman candle.
not_available Get that oxygen away unless you want this whole place to explode! Mr.
not_available Kamatovik, please just sit and relax.
not_available I'll turn off the oxygen in the hall.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen Let's get Mr.
not_available Kamatovik started on a flame
not_available retardant saline and get somebody from the special burn unit.
not_available Yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't worry, Mr.
not_available Kamatovik.
not_available We've got you covered.
not_available Okay? Hey, chief! Malucci, you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's a multi
not_available trauma coming in.
not_available A causeway collapsed at a sci
not_available fi convention.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Spin a crit, dip a urine.
not_available C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available You okay, Cleo? 
not_available So far, so good.
not_available We had to double up.
not_available First one's a forearm fracture from falling concrete.
not_available Open or closed? 
not_available Closed.
not_available The neuro
not_available circ is intact.
not_available Got a 10
not_available centimeter scalp lac.
not_available No LOC.
not_available Olbes got a bad one in 43.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Looks like a dislocated shoulder.
not_available Neck pain with mid
not_available line tenderness.
not_available BP, 125/78.
not_available Pulse, 90.
not_available You got it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where do you need me? Triage the most critical patients to the beds.
not_available You got it.
not_available fell at least 20 feet.
not_available Danny.
not_available Danny, where is he? Who's Danny? 
not_available He's my brother.
not_available He was next to me.
not_available I think Morales got him.
not_available He didn't want to go today.
not_available I made him.
not_available Danny.
not_available Looks like a bad tib
not_available fib.
not_available Please, don't let him die.
not_available Let's take care of you first, sir.
not_available What's your name? Sir? Sir, open your eyes.
not_available Losing the pulse.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available Blunt chest trauma, tachy at 120.
not_available Decreased breath sounds on the left.
not_available Abby? I said we could handle one major.
not_available They've got 30 critical patients on scene.
not_available I told them we'd take three major and 10 minor.
not_available How can we, if we don't have any surgeons? We can stabilize and triage them one at a time.
not_available I hope that we can, Mark.
not_available Frank, page the surgeons.
not_available They're at the conference.
not_available Page them.
not_available Hey, can I help? 
not_available No.
not_available You're slammed.
not_available All the more reason for you to take the minor medicals.
not_available No trauma.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, we need you in Trauma 1.
not_available Let's take him to Curtain Area 2.
not_available Give me the greatest hits.
not_available Crushed his right foot under a girder.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Open fracture.
not_available Bleeding through the perineum.
not_available Pressure's down to 60.
not_available I'll put in a central line.
not_available How's the other patient? 
not_available They're putting in a chest tube.
not_available Elizabeth, you should go check on him.
not_available I can't leave this patient.
not_available Where's Peter? Didn't Romano fire him? 
not_available What? No, I saw him earlier.
not_available Try paging him.
not_available Go on.
not_available I can handle this.
not_available He needs a MAST suit inflated a suprapubic Foley, and either a pelvic embolization or a external fixator.
not_available You can't do all of that.
not_available I'm not leaving until he's stable.
not_available The other patient has a blunt chest trauma.
not_available He might be bleeding out.
not_available If he is, I'm sure Dr.
not_available Kovac will come get me.
not_available Get me a 3
not_available 0 nylon and an OpSite.
not_available Got it.
not_available Tell Mark Greene we are closed to trauma! Urine dip is negative for blood.
not_available Hemoglobin's 11.6.
not_available Get him a unit bed.
not_available Working on it.
not_available Third liter of saline up at 
15 10.
not_available Pressure's down to 60.
not_available Tachy at 130.
not_available I have some breath sounds on the left.
not_available I'll intubate.
not_available Abby, prep for a chest tube on the left.
not_available Suction.
not_available Open a Steri
not_available Drape.
not_available Too much edema.
not_available I need the fiber
not_available optic scope.
not_available Abby, put in the chest tube.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available This guy needs a chest tube.
not_available You're gonna have to do it.
not_available It's a tough intubation.
not_available You know how.
not_available Go! Ten blade.
not_available Hey, hey! Get back in bed, Mr.
not_available Kamatovik.
not_available You're not supposed to be here.
not_available Are you feeling better? There was probably a lot of dust.
not_available It aggravated your asthma.
not_available All right.
not_available 60 of prednisone.
not_available Repeat nebs in 30 minutes.
not_available It's like Mars Attacks in here.
not_available BP's 130/85, pulse, 110.
not_available There's no obvious deformity.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's cut this off, please.
not_available No! Don't cut my costume! 
not_available I need to take a look at your hip.
not_available The zipper's in the back.
not_available Fine.
not_available Unzip Zontar here.
not_available Titrate 10 of morphine and get an AP pelvis and a right hip film.
not_available Where the hell is Benton? 
not_available I think he quit.
not_available We got a bad tib
not_available fib fracture, and he's losing foot pulses.
not_available We gotta get him to the O.R.
not_available We're short surgeons.
not_available I thought we were closing to traumas.
not_available Too late for that now.
not_available I'll get Corday.
not_available Liver and spleen look good.
not_available Bleeding is limited to the pelvis.
not_available We've got a patient with probable compartment syndrome.
not_available Do your best to stabilize him.
not_available Then we need the digital Stryker.
not_available Call upstairs.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's under the sink.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene borrowed it from the O.R.
not_available Stole it, more like.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Let him use it.
not_available Just tell him I want the results of the readings.
not_available Systolics are down to 70.
not_available Another two units of packed cells.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, cops are coming to arrest your pneumonia mom.
not_available For what? 
not_available For writing bad checks.
not_available Elizabeth, you okay for a minute? 
not_available Yeah, go.
not_available Hey, did somebody get hurt? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did that nurse come in and get the urine sample? No.
not_available What happened? A walkway collapsed over at the Tarver Center.
not_available Run two units O
not_available neg on the rapid infuser.
not_available Type and cross for four more.
not_available A lot of people got hurt.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available I bet they never saw it coming.
not_available I sure didn't.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get you up here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I would've cathed myself, but I was waiting for the nurse.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No big deal, Dennis.
not_available I'll get to him in a minute, Carter.
not_available That's all right, I got this.
not_available They need you in the trauma rooms.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah, go.
not_available You know, most doctors don't like to do this stuff.
not_available All right, let's get you out of those wet clothes.
not_available BP's stable at 140/90.
not_available It's increasing in all three compartments.
not_available His leg is cool.
not_available He's losing circulation to the foot.
not_available Gloria, this is the Zithromax.
not_available Take two tomorrow, then one a day for the next four days.
not_available Is something wrong? The police are on their way to pick you up.
not_available What? 
not_available They have a warrant out for your arrest.
not_available Sometimes I have to bounce a check to buy some time.
not_available But I usually pay everything off in time.
not_available I've got two jobs.
not_available I understand.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Right this way.
not_available Daycare
not_available Honey, Daycare is up this way.
not_available The fourth floor! Thanks for everything! 
not_available Kerry.
not_available Tell me that you're here to help out.
not_available No, but I will take Mr.
not_available Kamatovik to Psych once a bed's available.
not_available I appreciate that, but we could really use an extra pair of hands.
not_available Sorry, we've got our own problems.
not_available Tonight's a full moon.
not_available Stop by later if you want.
not_available It'll be like Mardi Gras.
not_available Anterior compartment pressure is 68.
not_available That's not good.
not_available Normal is 30.
not_available He needs a fasciotomy now.
not_available You're gonna do this? I did one in med school 
not_available on a cadaver.
not_available You can't do it down here.
not_available If we don't, he's gonna need an amputation.
not_available Get Corday on the intercom.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? What is it? 
not_available Got the pressures.
not_available An average 
reading 65.
not_available I have to open the compartments.
not_available Yeah, well, we' re ready.
not_available This guy's bleeding from his pelvis.
not_available You'll have to wait.
not_available Can't wait.
not_available We've lost foot pulses.
not_available Can you get another surgeon? 
not_available No one's here.
not_available You're gonna have to talk me through this.
not_available Well, I don't think I can.
not_available You 're gonna have to, Elizabeth.
not_available Another 0
not_available silk, please.
not_available What are you doing? Sewing in a chest tube.
not_available When I said you'd get more experience down here, this is not what I meant.
not_available Nurses do not sew in chest tubes.
not_available Do they, Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available She knows how.
not_available Of course.
not_available But our malpractice insurance no longer covers her doing anything outside the scope of normal nursing practices.
not_available We were short
not_available handed.
not_available The patient could have died if she hadn't put it in.
not_available You let her put in the chest tube? It's your responsibility if anything goes wrong! 
not_available She did a great job.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available You should've called me.
not_available You were busy.
not_available Step back.
not_available I'm almost done.
not_available Step back! Get Corday some Pavulon.
not_available I need some Pavulon.
not_available How's it going in there? 
not_available I'll live.
not_available Hey, do you know if we have any extra
not_available small scrubs in here? Sure they'll fit you? I got a paraplegic kid with a UTI who just wet himself.
not_available I want to give him something to change into.
not_available Well, don't ask me.
not_available I didn't even know I was working here till today.
not_available I swear, I can't win with Weaver.
not_available Well, who can? She drags me down here claiming it's for my benefit so I can get more experience, but not too much.
not_available Talk to your nurse manager.
not_available Right.
not_available Then Weaver completely hates me if I ever come back as a med student.
not_available You'll come back.
not_available I don't know if I want to.
not_available This place is a freak show.
not_available It grows on you.
not_available So does foot fungus.
not_available Abby, give Mr.
not_available Palmer a CBC, urine dip, myoglobin, and put in a Foley.
not_available Which one's Palmer? Threehundred
not_available pounder with blue skin.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Fat and colorful.
not_available Here.
not_available Well, at least you got something to do.
not_available I'll trade you Jabba the Hutt for the UTI.
not_available I said I was bored, not desperate.
not_available Corday's still waiting on that Pavulon.
not_available Right.
not_available Your self
not_available diagnosis was right on! You got a urinary tract infection.
not_available Hey, are these for me? Well, you think like a doctor.
not_available So you might as well dress like one.
not_available I'll help you put those on when I get back.
not_available I'm writing you a prescription for some Bactrim.
not_available If you follow all the directions and take all the pills, you'll be better in no time.
not_available Do you think I could get some extra catheters while I'm here? 
not_available Sometimes they forget to order them.
not_available I think we can manage that.
not_available Really? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Here, I made this for you.
not_available Hey, thanks.
not_available That's very cool.
not_available It's supposed to look like an F
not_available 22 Raptor.
not_available You like jets? 
not_available Yeah, I wanted to be a pilot.
not_available Now I make paper airplanes, but Will it fly? Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available Check it out.
not_available Frank? Where is Frank? Grow up, Malucci! 
not_available What'd I do? You got patients to treat.
not_available Lydia said you needed more Versed? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Try another two.
not_available There's a lot of masseter spasm.
not_available So when are we gonna meet Daddy? The father of your baby.
not_available Everybody's kind of curious.
not_available How's he doing? He's out.
not_available You know, my pregnancy is none of your business.
not_available In fact, nothing remotely concerned with my personal life is anybody's business.
not_available I just wanted to meet the lucky guy.
not_available You do know who the father is, right? Hey, I'm sorry.
not_available I can't help myself sometimes.
not_available There's something about seeing you this way that I find very sexy.
not_available I'm gonna order a post
not_available reduction film.
not_available Conscious
not_available sedation protocol.
not_available Somebody's gotta babysit this guy until he wakes up.
not_available Yeah? Well, I guess that would be your job, Dave.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Crap! What's wrong? I've got a 16year
not_available old with gonorrhea in her throat.
not_available I gotta tell her without her mother finding out.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available You've got your hands full.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Lateral incision.
not_available Start three finger breadths below the fibular head.
not_available Carry it down to above the lateral malleolus.
not_available How deep? First incision just through the skin and sub
not_available Q.
not_available Got it.
not_available Is there anything I can do? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get Elizabeth out here.
not_available What's next? 
not_available Now, carefully extend the incision through the deep fascia of the anterior and lateral compartment.
not_available What about the anterior tibial nerve? 
not_available You should be okay.
not_available Don't cut too deep, and you'll stay superficial to it.
not_available How's he doing? Who? Mark or my patient? I'm gonna need more type
not_available specific.
not_available Hey, Moira.
not_available Where's your mom? She went to find you.
not_available She was getting really pissed off waiting around.
not_available Well, it's good she's not here.
not_available Why? 
not_available You have a sexually transmitted disease.
not_available What? You contracted gonorrhea.
not_available Wait, but that's impossible.
not_available I've never even had sex.
not_available I'm a virgin.
not_available What about oral sex? 
not_available That doesn't count.
not_available God! You and your boyfriend both need to be treated with antibiotics.
not_available He gave me gonorrhea in my throat? Have you had any more partners? I'm not a slut.
not_available I didn't even want to do it in the first place.
not_available Then don't.
not_available You're not gonna tell my mom, right? No.
not_available But you have to promise me you're going to practice safe sex.
not_available I thought I was.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Peter? What are you doing home? There was a surgical conference, so elective surgery was canceled today.
not_available I figured I'd come home and hang out with Reese.
not_available Being an Attending has its privileges.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Reese, how are you? What's happening? What's this? What you playing with? Playing with your fire truck? Want to be a fireman? No? What's that? Horse? Want to be a cowboy? Looks like I'm gonna have two doctors in the family.
not_available How much longer am I gonna have to wait? 
not_available Someone will see you in a minute.
not_available I've been seen.
not_available She disappeared.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Some black woman.
not_available She came in, looked at my daughter's throat three hours ago! What's your daughter's name? This is ridiculous! 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Garvey.
not_available There she is.
not_available Where have you been? At lunch? 
not_available I had some traumas come in.
not_available I gave Moira her shot.
not_available She's ready to go home.
not_available Three hours to get a needle.
not_available I'll be right there to discharge her.
not_available What did you say to her? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I don't even know who she is.
not_available BP, 110, pulse, 95.
not_available I'll be up in a little while to put in a suprapubic catheter.
not_available Tell the blood bank to send the other two units upstairs.
not_available Hey, how's he doing? 
not_available Pulses are bounding.
not_available May I take a look? Did you get your guy's pressure back up? Yeah, after eight units of packed cells.
not_available That's not bad for a first time.
not_available Piece of cake when you follow directions.
not_available Yes, funny how I can talk you through a complicated fasciotomy but when I tell you to pick up your socks, you ignore me.
not_available I'm sorry, did you say something? Dr.
Dave 14.
Death Zero.
not_available Nice job on triage, Dr.
not_available Malucci.
not_available Thanks a lot, chief.
not_available I can't believe we didn't get one penetrating chest trauma.
not_available Hey, we got another one! Greg Fulton, Exam 5.
not_available Wanted for assault, battery and indecent exposure.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Sorry, Frank.
not_available This isn't working.
not_available What? We made two arrests.
not_available It would've been three if that mother hadn't escaped.
not_available I think someone tipped her off.
not_available No more record checks on patients.
not_available What'd you do with my patient? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Kamatovik? I got him a bed, but he's gone AWOL.
not_available Well, he can't have gotten too far.
not_available You look pretty good in scrubs.
not_available Can I keep them? Sure.
not_available Hey, I'll be right back.
not_available Hey, Cleo.
not_available Was that your gonorrhea patient? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Did you manage to treat her without Mom finding out? Listen, I wasn't trying to step in your toes when I offered to take the case, I was just trying to help.
not_available I know.
not_available Hey, Cleo.
not_available Do you have a problem with me being here? Of course not.
not_available I told you.
not_available He's disappeared.
not_available What is this? 
not_available Alcohol wipes.
not_available He says he has to stay cool to avoid spontaneous combustion.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He begged me to give him a Popsicle enema.
not_available We settled for ice chips.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kamatovik, are you in there? Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available Come out so we can help you.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm burning up.
not_available I need wet blankets.
not_available We can get you some upstairs.
not_available You want me to bring him out, chief? 
not_available Please.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kamatovik, open up.
not_available Somebody call the burn unit! Get a gurney! This is a modified version of Ken Blackburn's 1998 world
not_available record design.
not_available You sure you want to launch it? 
not_available It's folded paper until you let it fly.
not_available All right.
not_available Let it fly.
not_available All right.
not_available Wow! 
not_available That looks like it could go on forever.
not_available Theoretically, it could, if the wind kept blowing and it kept finding up currents.
not_available This is really cool.
not_available I've never been up this high before.
not_available Looks like your ride is here.
not_available I'm out of airplanes anyway.
not_available Thanks for bringing me up here, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Make some more airplanes and we can do it again sometime.
not_available I'd like that.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You were popular today, huh? 
not_available I know.
not_available What's that about? I'm everybody's favorite nurse.
not_available But that's the problem because as a med student, I screwed up everything.
not_available Everything.
not_available Things I could do even with my eyes closed.
not_available I think it's all in here.
not_available You are a good nurse, Abby.
not_available But you could be a great doctor.
not_available You just need a little confidence.
not_available Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
not_available I can't believe I did that.
not_available Abby.
not_available Yeah? You got a code brown with Mr.
not_available Pozoni.
not_available Again? Jeez.
not_available How much can that guy eat? I gotta go.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Peter, are you here? I've been calling.
not_available Why didn't you pick up? 
not_available I didn't feel like talking.
not_available I went during my break.
not_available Shirley said you'd been fired.
not_available I guess the whole hospital knows by now.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? Peter, I was worried.
not_available I called Jackie.
not_available She said you had been gone for hours.
not_available What did you tell her? 
not_available I didn't tell her anything except I didn't have any idea where you were.
not_available What happened? Peter? You can tell me.
not_available Romano got hit with a big EMTALA fine over the Fletcher case.
not_available Good.
not_available He deserves it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, now he's taking it out on me.
not_available Maybe he's just blowing off steam.
not_available No, I've seen him do that.
not_available This time he's serious.
not_available Talk to somebody.
not_available Call Anspaugh.
not_available Tell him what? Tell him Romano is a racist, sexist, elitist jackass.
not_available Cleo, he knows that.
not_available You're an excellent surgeon, Peter.
not_available And you're a good man, and we'll work it out.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available My day got better.
not_available You? Yeah, I think so.
not_available It was like the guy just went up in flames.
not_available You should have seen it.
not_available Hey, Carter, you ever see spontaneous human combustion? 
not_available No, Dave.
not_available It doesn't exist.
not_available I was there.
not_available I saw it.
not_available No lighter, no matches, no nothing.
not_available I went on a missing persons call once.
not_available All we found was this gal's legs, the rest of her burned to a crisp.
not_available But that chair she was sitting in
not_available Barely singed.
not_available So, Carter, how was your first day back? It was good.
not_available A little slow.
not_available Glad to hear it.
not_available Finished up? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I am officially out of here.
not_available Just one last thing to do.
not_available Sure.
not_available You coming with me? 
not_available That's the rules.
not_available Sorry, I have to witness the entire process.
not_available Trust me.
not_available It's no treat for me either.
not_available Seen any good movies lately? 
not_available No.
not_available You want me to run some water or something?
