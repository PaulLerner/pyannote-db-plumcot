not_available So I just found this in my locker.
not_available It has been in there for a very long time.
not_available And, to be honest, I haven't given it much thought for many years.
not_available Not since Mark died.
not_available When you interned for Dr.
not_available Greene he would have everybody write a letter to themselves that they wouldn't open until their very last day of Residency.
not_available So that's your letter to yourself? What does it say? It says that I'm scared.
not_available And that I know I have a lot to learn.
not_available And I hope I learn it quickly.
not_available And that I pray to God that I don't kill anybody.
not_available And it says that if I'm good at this and I can stick it out and become an Attending well, that will be all I ever need.
not_available I got a plane to catch.
not_available One day you'll look up, and maybe 10 years will have passed.
not_available Carter, you're gonna make a good doctor.
not_available Carter, you gotta hurry it up.
not_available You got a million things to do.
not_available You set the tone, Carter.

not_available It's good enough for Carter.
not_available Think it's weird if I put, "Dear Neela"? Hey, Erica, any word? Did Bobby's mom call back? He wasn't with him? Okay.
not_available Yeah, it's gonna be all right.
not_available What about Navy Pier? He likes the rides there.
not_available It's after 11, it's closed.
not_available What about your phone, is it charged? Sam.
not_available Sam.
not_available It's all gonna be okay.
