not_available You know, tanning puts you at serious risk for cancer.
not_available Ever think about a selftanner or spray
not_available on tans? Yeah, you don't want to have skin like leather when you're in your 40s.

not_available Oh, happy birthday, by the way.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Mr.
not_available Gower, we got a new G
not_available tube in your size.
not_available You can't unclog it? They tried flushing it, but it didn't work, so doctor's gonna have to replace it.
not_available Let's forget about the G
not_available tube.
not_available I'll buy us all a steak and a bottle of Cabernet.
not_available That's tempting, but how about I get you a pureed meal and an Ensure chaser? Somehow that doesn't quite make it.
not_available Uh I didn't get a chance before.
not_available My name is Diana Moore.
not_available Hi.
not_available Sam Taggart.
not_available Listen, about earlier Don't worry about it, no problem.

not_available Don't blame Diana, she's dedicated to her work.
not_available What is that, patient paparazzi? 
not_available Yeah, actually.
not_available I'm documenting hospice patients through their deaths.
not_available But I keep mucking it up by continuing to breathe.
not_available It's all about you, isn't it? Look, I got to hang around long enough to convince her to run away with me to Cabo.
not_available And I'm holding out for Maui.
not_available Okay, Maui.
not_available Okay then.
not_available Sam do you have someplace I could stash my stuff and maybe upload some photos? You know what, let me check.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Hey, Frank.
not_available Can I get a pureed meal for trauma one? You're asking me because?

not_available Gower.
not_available Well, I think you should be.
not_available That's when gravity takes over and everything north of the equator turns south.
not_available What? 
not_available He means you got a very small window before you go from "Miss" to "Ma'am," skinny jeans to relaxed fit, blonde highlights to little black chin hairs.
not_available Oh, that's so wrong.
not_available No, really Larry, I realize you're a smart guy, and I know Pratt assigned you to me, 
not_available but I do my best work alone.
not_available But I really want to learn.

not_available And you don't find it a tad morbid? Well, yeah, I mean, it's been known to stop a few conversations at cocktail parties, but I'm not really just documenting the end of somebody's existence, I'm telling the story of people's lives rich with history, 
not_available engaged in the struggle to survive.

not_available Sometimes.
not_available Could be beautiful, too.
not_available You know? Seen a lot of dying in my life.

not_available Morris suggested we should get married in Vegas with Celine Dion.
not_available Well, we need to shut them down before they tell everybody.
not_available How do you do that? Beat them with a bag of oranges? I hear it doesn't leave any marks.

not_available We drove straight through to New York.
not_available We worked the pile for a couple weeks, not that we found anyone alive.
not_available You think that's what caused this? Well, we kept working, breathing in pulverized concrete, glass, dust particles laced with benzene, dioxin, asbestos, lead Were you wearing any protective gear? According to the government and the EPA, we didn't need any.

not_available I feel a defect.
not_available Surgery, what's the story? 
not_available Blunt trauma, flail chest.
not_available Hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation and transfusion.
not_available We hooked up the cell saver to recycle the blood while I put in the second chest tube.
not_available There was a small amount of fluid in the 
not_available Pericardium.
not_available And I thought maybe there was a ventricular laceration from a fractured rib, so we decided to do a thoracotomy.
not_available There was a defect in the ventricle, and now Neela's holding pressure on it.
not_available Excellent, Mae Lee.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available That is not ex I'll take it from here.
not_available There's still a couple of surgical consults in the ER.

not_available We're still the poor stepchild of the breast cancer publicity machine.
not_available All those pink ribbons.
not_available Do you know what color is associated with ovarian cancer? Teal.
not_available I mean, what is that? It's not blue, it's not green.
not_available I'm guessing that your illness has something to do with your project.
not_available My cancer was my wake
not_available up call.
not_available It made me more passionate about living, about doing the things that make me happy.
not_available Not worrying about the stupid stuff.

not_available Grandpa let me ride ride Beauty.
not_available She's the one that's completely jet black with a white spot in the middle of her forehead.
not_available Sounds like fun.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And they told me all these stories about mom.
not_available Like, when she was my age, she took Grandpa's car for a ride without asking.
not_available Yeah? Well, don't get any ideas.
not_available Do you think maybe you'd like to spend a little more time with them? Sure.
not_available Maybe, I don't know, you think you might want to live with them? Well, I don't know.
not_available I mean, my school's here, so I can't really do that.
not_available And all my friends are here.
not_available You're here, too.
not_available I mean, why would I want to do that? Just asking.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's get my stuff, get out of here.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Charge the internal paddles.
not_available Tie the suture while they prepare to defibrillate.
not_available Tie the knot.
not_available Mae Lee, tie the knot.
not_available Charged! Clear.
not_available Clear! Still no response.
not_available Mae Lee, tie the knot! 
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Got it! Could be hypocalcemic from massive transfusion.
not_available She's also hypoxic from the pulmonary bleed.
not_available Clear! Still no pulse.
not_available She's in pump failure from cardiac contusion.
not_available Resume internal compressions.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available V
not_available fib again! I don't think we're going to get her out of it this time.
not_available No, she's coagulopathic.
not_available I can't stop the bleeding.
not_available 30 joules.
not_available Okay, clear.
not_available Stop, stop, stop.
not_available Stop it! Stop it! There's nothing more we can do.
not_available Stop it.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over.
not_available Call it, Ray.
not_available Okay.
not_available Time of 
death 13:25.
not_available Repair of a cardiac laceration is way beyond a fourth
not_available year medical student.
not_available I did the repair.
not_available Mae Lee put in one stitch.
not_available I was already there.
not_available I was in a much better position to assist you.
not_available You're going to have to learn to share the sandbox, Neela.
not_available Mae Lee's here for four weeks.
not_available You've got four more years.
not_available You'll get another chance.
not_available This isn't about the procedure.
not_available Do you have a problem with me? Do I have a problem with you? Look, you're a very talented surgeon, Neela, but yeah, maybe I've let our personal friendship get in the way 
not_available of our professional relationship, yeah.
not_available Well, how? What do you mean? I'm the chief, and you're an intern.
not_available That's it.
not_available Maybe I've sent off mixed signals.
not_available No, no.
not_available no.
not_available It seems very clear.
not_available You're angry with me, but I don't understand why.
not_available Is this about Manish? I am not angry with you.
not_available And this is not about Manish.
not_available I just I just think it's time we reset our dynamic.
not_available Reset? Are you going to reset that dead woman in there? Reset her grieving husband? No.
not_available You can't take it personally when a surgery doesn't go well, just as I can't make surgical decisions based Based on what? 
not_available on my personal feelings towards you.
not_available Look, we both know that poor woman didn't die because Mae Lee was in there, and you weren't.
not_available Her injuries were far too great.
not_available Nothing on this earth could have saved her.
not_available Give it to me straight.
not_available Your blood work was normal.
not_available Your chest X rays were clear.
not_available But there is some evidence of sinusitis.
not_available So here are your films and your test results, plus a prescription for azithromycin and Pulmicort
not_available that's an inhaler.
not_available It should help.
not_available So I'm okay for now? 
not_available Looks like it.
not_available This is a good thing.
not_available There's lots of other people worked at Ground Zero, and at the landfills.
not_available I mean, how many of them are walking time bombs? No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.
not_available Maybe, next time, we'll be smarter.
not_available Maybe, now, you'll tell your wife.
not_available What? And give her more ammo to nag me about? 
not_available Night, Lockhart.
not_available Good night.
not_available Someone from Social Work will be down to help you with arrangements.
not_available Is there anyone we can call? No.
not_available It was just the two of us.
not_available We liked it like that.
not_available We never ran out of things to say, even on long stretches of road that seemed to go on for days.
not_available Must be nice to spend that much time with the person you love.
not_available Actually, she was the brains behind everything.
not_available Did all the paperwork, paid the bills, read the road maps.
not_available I can't tell you how many times she kept us from getting lost.
not_available Today was going be different.
not_available Different? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The rain makes her sleepy.
not_available So I told her to take a nap.
not_available I was sure I knew what exit to take.
not_available But the sign wasn't the sign.
not_available I
not_available I got confused.
not_available I didn't want to wake her up.
not_available I wanted to do it myself.
not_available Do what? Read.
not_available I wanted to read the damn exit sign.
not_available Derek, you You don't know how to read? Mary was trying to teach me.
not_available You graduated high school and went to college? They just passed me along.
not_available Nobody cared as long as I could read the defense and get the ball in the end zone.
not_available Coaches said I was gonna get drafted first round.
not_available I wasn't prepared for it not to work out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just wanted to make you proud.
not_available I'm sorry.

not_available Sarah? I'll do the dishes after I do my homework, okay? This isn't about the dishes.
not_available Could you come back in here a sec? I need to talk you for a second.
not_available I've been trying to figure out a way to tell you this, and if I should tell you this.
not_available What? The night that your mom died she told me that I'm your father.
not_available My dad's name was Keith.
not_available He died.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available We all thought that your dad was Keith.
not_available But, um there's a chance that that might not be true.
not_available But Mom didn't tell me.
not_available Why wouldn't she tell me? 
not_available I don't know, sweetie.
not_available She must have had her reasons.
not_available So are you my dad or not? Well, there's a simple test we can take.
not_available It's called a paternity test, and, um if you want we can take it tonight.
not_available Why are you doing this now? Is this just because I don't want to go and live with Grandma and Grandpa? Sarah, I just, I 
not_available You're just trying to get rid of me.
not_available I just, I want what's best for you.
not_available No, you're lying! I know you're lying.
not_available You're lying just like Mom! She always lied.
not_available Sarah 
not_available No! Okay?! I don't want you to be my dad, and I'm not taking your test! You know, Morris might have something.
not_available Maybe we should get married someplace exotic.
not_available Like where? The beach or the mountains.
not_available Why don't we go to Croatia? Really? But no one from work would be able to be there.
not_available Do it! Do it! I'm gonna do it.
not_available Would that be so bad? Morris! Hope.
not_available We need to talk to you.
not_available Who? Us? Look, listen.
not_available Abby and I really appreciate your interest in our engagement.
not_available It's so exciting! The wedding! Sorry.
not_available And while your planning is very thoughtful it's borderline obsessive.

not_available To anybody.
not_available Not us, just, no one.

not_available That is destined to be a classic.
not_available On what planet? Now I now we're pretending to be normal, and I know we're pretending that this isn't awkward, but, uh it's kinda awkward, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Kinda.
not_available So, what do we just gonna say that this never happened? Well, I know we should talk about this, but these days I just feel like my head's gonna explode.
