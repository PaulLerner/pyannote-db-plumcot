not_available What's that? 
not_available When we open his eyelids, they flutter.
not_available He responds to a Q
not_available Tip in the nose.
not_available I don't think it's a real coma.

not_available It's from her diverticular disease.
not_available I'm afraid you'll need an operation to fix it.
not_available Is that really necessary? She's so weak.
not_available It's really the only option.
not_available Can't we wait a few days? Then she'll become extremely ill, and surgery could be dangerous.

not_available They'll send me away, out of the country.
not_available And I don't want to live there.
not_available I can't.
not_available What? Do you know what an ectopic pregnancy is? A miscarriage? Not exactly.
not_available It's where the fetus grows in the fallopian tube.
not_available So then I have to have an abortion.
not_available It's more complicated than that.
not_available You'll need surgery.
not_available An operation? 
not_available Right now.
not_available Well, how long does it take? 
not_available You leave the hospital by tomorrow.
