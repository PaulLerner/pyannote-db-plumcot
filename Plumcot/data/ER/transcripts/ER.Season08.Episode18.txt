not_available I just want to keep doing what I've always done.
not_available You couldn't hold that ET tube.
not_available It's little spasms in my hand.
not_available Is that from the vincristine? A side effect of the treatment or a progression of the disease.
not_available You pick the poison.
not_available Still, I'd like you to take over Pratt's orientation.
not_available Whatever you want, Kerry.

not_available As much time as possible.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm sorry, Mark.
not_available I'm sorry we had such a rough go.
not_available Maybe if I hadn't switched jobs or been more patient We made choices, Jen.
not_available Both of us.
not_available We weren't so bad together, were we? I wouldn't change a thing.
not_available None of it.
not_available Okay.

not_available Line's in.
not_available It shouldn't be news to you.
not_available Did you get a good history? I am a glorious history.
not_available I told you to get his old chart.
not_available So what was that, like a test? Make sure he flushes all three lumens.
not_available Don't give him an air embolus.
not_available CBC, Chem
not_available 21 and a urine.
not_available He's good.
not_available Sats are 90, pulse is 110.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Add a hemoglobin, A1 C, serum ketones, blood cultures and 12
not_available lead.
not_available Liter up, good 18 in the right foot.
not_available Add 40 of K in the liter, intubation tray, 8
not_available 0 ET tube.
not_available Why? What's that for? 
not_available Sats are dropping.
not_available Come on, Al, breathe.
not_available Carter, get ready to bag him.
not_available Do the Sellick.
not_available The what? The Sellick.
not_available Give me your hand.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available When his blood sugar's over 700, sometimes he stops breathing.
not_available Thanks for mentioning that.
not_available Give him 10 of regular, IV push.
not_available Start him on 8 units per hour.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You could've told me he was diabetic.
not_available I said to work him up.
not_available I was looking for chronic athlete's foot.
not_available You missed the DKA because you didn't follow instructions.
not_available It didn't seem necessary.
not_available That assessment is up to me.
not_available Okay? You do the learning, I'll do the teaching.
not_available Do I seem like a punk to you? 
not_available No.
not_available Then stop trying to treat me like one.
not_available I'm sure that you think that you're ready for anything.
not_available Wait.
not_available Is this the one about the old guy and the young guy? 
not_available Because, see, I've heard it all before.
not_available There's a door there that goes outside.
not_available If you don't like the way I'm doing this, keep walking.
not_available He's a good doctor.
not_available He's a burnout if I ever saw one.
not_available I learned a lot from him.
not_available If I had my call, I'd stick with you.
not_available You don't.
not_available You saw him in there.
not_available I just can't figure out what's going on with this guy.
not_available A tumor.
not_available What? 
not_available He has a brain tumor.
not_available An inoperable GBM that's recurred.
not_available That's what's going on with him.
not_available That's what the IV's for.
not_available He's in his second cycle of chemo.
not_available And he's still working? Everything okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, Pratt was just saying how much he's benefiting from Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available He's a good teacher.
not_available You could start feeding me this information a little earlier.
not_available Labs back for Seidel.
not_available Thanks.
not_available His PSA's higher than his Alk Phos.
not_available Six hundred? Did you call his doctor? Left three messages on his service before I got the cell number.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available What do you think? He knew? He should have.
not_available This guy shouldn't have to find out from doctors he's never met in the ER.
not_available Hey, listen, in med school I was a hotshot.
not_available And I forgot I'm not one here.
not_available Well, not yet at least.
not_available Like I said, no rush.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Yeah, is your father there? 
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Greene from the County ER.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Listen, I didn't mean any disrespect earlier.
not_available Someone told you I'm dying.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, is it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Call my office.
not_available I'm not taking any calls.
not_available I understand you' re on vacation.
not_available Your patient's PSA set a record high.
not_available Oh, well, how can I be of help? Well, for starters, when was the last time you examined him? 
not_available About two years, I'd say.
not_available Two years? Have you made a diagnosis? 
not_available In fact, yes.
not_available Metastatic prostate cancer.
not_available Really? I never saw any indication.
not_available Well, the huge irregular mass on his enlarged prostate may have been a clue.
not_available You want me to put him on the phone? Why don't you put down your hot cocoa, and get your ass on a plane to Chicago
not_available He hung up.
not_available Very persuasive.
not_available I try.
not_available Should we tell him? 
not_available Let him sleep.
not_available Call Urology for a bed.
not_available I panicked.
not_available Okay? You weren't here, and I didn't know what to do.
not_available You knew this wasn't what she wanted.
not_available You're extubating? You should have never intubated her in the first place.
not_available What about the obstructions? 
not_available It's a mild ileus.
not_available I don't care what it is.
not_available I have durable power of attorney.
not_available And we want to take our mother home now.
not_available Get that line out of her.
not_available You may wanna leave that in, in case she needs fluid.
not_available Don't you get it? She wants to die.
not_available You people can't accept that.
not_available It's like a defeat to you.
not_available Do you have the DNR? Okay.
not_available Pull it.
not_available Just at the bed right around the corner.
not_available All right.
not_available What's this about? I got called down from Oncology, so the nurse is here with my vincristine.
not_available You sure you're feeling all right? 
not_available Wish people would stop asking me that.
not_available Could you unplug her and let them go? Yeah, sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, I want my cart.
not_available What? 
not_available They threw my cart outside.
not_available Ready? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I want my cart.
not_available I always have it with me.
not_available It's okay, Al.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right.
not_available I almost had to call an Oncology staff meeting.
not_available They weren't crazy about my doing this down here.
not_available Please, I want my cart.
not_available Give me my cart! These new needle
not_available less systems are a pain.
not_available Give me my cart.
not_available You know what? I'm not doing this.
not_available I can't come back.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Please! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene 
not_available I want my cart.
not_available Al, let me help you find your cart.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Aspergilloma is what people used to superstitiously take as the curse of the mummy.
not_available I'll never hear the end of this at work.
not_available How did I get it? You went to Egypt recently on an excavation, right? Pulmonology will bronch her.
not_available Give her 200 of itra
not_available Itraconazole, BID, will help with the oral steroids.
not_available I work too much, that's why I'm sick.
not_available You'll be okay soon.
not_available You know that song, "Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you got till it's gone? " 
not_available Joni Mitchell.
not_available Story of my life.
not_available I hate that song.
not_available Mark.
not_available I spoke with Oncology.
not_available I told them you'd be up soon.
not_available You shouldn't have.
not_available They're holding a room for you.
not_available I'm finished.
not_available I've had enough.
not_available You can go up now, and I'll drive you home.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available This isn't something that you decide by yourself on the spur of the moment.
not_available This might be the last important decision I get to make.
not_available You haven't given it time to work, Mark.
not_available Please.
not_available I dropped an ET tube today.
not_available I couldn't wrap my thumb around it.
not_available That doesn't mean the chemo's not working.
not_available It's a game, Elizabeth.
not_available I don't wanna play.
not_available Look, it's only the second cycle.
not_available This treatment could prolong your life.
not_available Maybe.
not_available For a couple of months.
not_available Well, then give yourself that time.
not_available Give it to me and Ella.
not_available Give it to Rachel.
not_available Who knows what might happen? We see patients here every day who are told that they should have been dead long ago.
not_available I need to be realistic.
not_available You mean give up.
not_available It's not giving up.
not_available It's making a choice.
not_available I'd rather have two good months than twice that chained to meds and needles and IV stands, stuck in a bed sitting next to other clockwatchers, being prodded and small
not_available talked to by doctors and nurses, all of them with that look in their eye like you're already gone.
not_available I don't want to end it like that.
not_available Look, we can look into some new regimens.
not_available We can find some alternative therapies that we haven't heard about.
not_available Mr.
not_available Seidel is awake.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Please? There's no alternative.
not_available Just dying the way I've lived.
not_available I'll see you at home.
not_available I love you.
not_available You ready? 
not_available I can do it.
not_available Not the easiest news to give someone.
not_available I know the job.
not_available Mr.
not_available Seidel.
not_available My old lady's waiting with my daughter, so can we get this over with? Your presentation is consistent with metastatic cancer of the prostate.
not_available Cancer? Are you sure? Maybe you got it wrong.
not_available Allanson never said anything about cancer.
not_available He may have overlooked it.
not_available He always acted like I was a hypochondriac.
not_available He should have caught it.
not_available Maybe we should call your wife before we explain everything.
not_available Tell me, is it bad? Possibly, it could be.
not_available What? Do I need chemotherapy or an operation or what? I mean, it's not like I'm gonna die, right? I could die? We need to admit you for tests.
not_available The cancer appears to be very advanced.
not_available You need to prepare yourself for the worst.
not_available I know what a shock this is and what must be going through your mind right now.
not_available You can't.
not_available Yeah, I can.
not_available I'll call his family.
not_available Go in and sit with him.
not_available What did you say to him? Wasn't anything I learned from being a doctor.
not_available No, no, no, we need to keep that in.
not_available Okay? 
not_available I want to go.
not_available It's wet out there.
not_available It's raining.
not_available It stopped.
not_available I don't want to be here.
not_available Me either.
not_available When can you get him upstairs? 
not_available Oh, I'll call the Telemetry Unit.
not_available Last serum ketones? 
not_available Still positive.
not_available Urine? 
not_available 200 cc's in the last hour.
not_available I'll take it out.
not_available You know I know how.
not_available Al, it's gonna become harder for you to be able to take care of yourself.
not_available Do you have any family you can go to? 
not_available No.
not_available There's nobody.
not_available Then let me admit you.
not_available You know I don't like this place.
not_available I don't belong here.
not_available Whatever's going to happen, I want it to happen outside.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available It'll be over soon.
not_available Right? 
not_available Yeah, it will.
not_available How much longer do I have to sit here? 
not_available Ms.
not_available Raskin, it's been a long time.
not_available The service isn't what it used to be.
not_available What's the trouble? 
not_available I have this hangnail, it is very painful.
not_available I have a brain tumor, and it's inoperable.
not_available What? 
not_available I win.
not_available Excuse me, can somebody please see my daughter? 
not_available A nurse will be right with you.
not_available I've been here for over two hours.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Hi, doctor.
not_available No, it'll hurt, Daddy.
not_available Oh, what will hurt? Katie's class mythology project.
not_available Why they let kids play with wooden spears, I'll never know.
not_available I like your outfit.
not_available Can I put you up here? 
not_available There.
not_available It hurts.
not_available I know.
not_available I'll be gentle.
not_available It's up under the nail.
not_available She won't even let me near it.
not_available Can I look? 
not_available I don't want a shot.
not_available No, no, no shots.
not_available I promise.
not_available Let's play a game.
not_available Close your eyes, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available What do you see? 
not_available The sky.
not_available What's up there? 
not_available Orion's Belt.
not_available Orion's? 
not_available He couldn't beat the scorpion.
not_available So he jumped into the sea.
not_available Really? Artemis put him in the sky, where the scorpion never gets him.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available There.
not_available That didn't hurt, did it? 
not_available Is it over? It's all done.
not_available Thank you, Katie.
not_available What did I do? You just became my very last patient.
not_available Your shift over? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Haleh, can you give that hangnail lady a cast shoe sign her out and tell her to never come back? If you say so.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, I set up Seidel for the biopsy, and his family's on the way in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, I just wanted to say, you know, I learned a lot today.
not_available Good.
not_available Come back tomorrow.
not_available How's Pratt doing? A little eager, a little cocky.
not_available He should fit right in.
not_available Think he'd want to take on some extra shifts? Pretty safe bet.
not_available What about you? Me? How many shifts should I put you down for next month? Never let your work become your life, Kerry.
not_available Live a little.
not_available No rest for the weary, Carter.
not_available I've been on since 4 a.
not_available m.
not_available You leaving early? 
not_available Not early enough.
not_available Fisher in the hall's an alcoholic.
not_available Knocked himself out.
not_available Check a head CT and road
not_available test him before you let him go.
not_available Withdrawal? 
not_available Just your usual midweek party.
not_available Chakarova has hives.
not_available Got prednisone, Benadryl.
not_available Feeling better.
not_available Watch her for half an hour.
not_available Send her on her way.
not_available Dispo's written.
not_available Anybody actually sick? 
not_available Just the doctor.
not_available Hey, did you see the guy in 3? Pacio, 56year
not_available old, chest pain.
not_available Ruled out going to Medicine.
not_available Got aspirin, beta
not_available blockers, heparin and an Ace.
not_available Fell through a plate
not_available glass window.
not_available Just keep pressure on that dressing.
not_available Bleeder in the left arm is the worst.
not_available Good night, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available BP, 100/70.
not_available Bye.
not_available So EKG for Pacio? Flip T's in lateral leads.
not_available X
not_available ray's clear.
not_available Check his troponin and repeat EKG in 10 minutes.
not_available It stopped raining.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Clear sky.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available You on tomorrow? Your ball needs air.
not_available It's not my ball.
not_available You set the tone, Carter.
not_available What? Work on your jump shot.
