
not_available E.R.
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available But you can't change the fact that he misdiagnosed the kid.
not_available I'll talk to Doug.
not_available So you're a cameraman
not_available ? Woman? Director and producer of infomercials.
not_available The whole study is a sham.
not_available Are you prepared to back that up? 
not_available I'm adopting her.
not_available She's my baby, Susan.
not_available They have a right to know.
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available We made a decision.
not_available That's final.
not_available Good news.
not_available The oncologist can take care of Brett.
not_available You missed it and didn't have the decency to tell us.
not_available This is about your guilty conscience.
not_available You didn't have the guts to speak up about Vucelich so you blow the whistle on Doug.
not_available "Fire In The Belly" Hey, Carol.
not_available Carol, I got an idea.
not_available Two more minutes.
not_available It's beautiful out.
not_available Let's call in sick.
not_available Take a day trip somewhere.
not_available Trip? 
not_available Yeah, we'll play hooky.
not_available We'll just jump in the car and head north and find a lake and just sit there.
not_available I can't skip work.
not_available I need the hours.
not_available Please? The thought of having to cart around the wretched of the Earth all day long with Reilly yapping in my ear about his stupid beer can collection I can't.
not_available Not today.
not_available You go.
not_available You go.
not_available I don't wanna go without you.
not_available That's the whole idea.
not_available I want us to get away together.
not_available We'll just go someplace where there aren't any sick people.
not_available Just cows.
not_available Healthy cows.
not_available Good cows.
not_available Some place where we can make love in the grass.
not_available In front of the cows? 
not_available Sexy cows.
not_available We could take a trip this weekend.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available I might be persuaded to be a little late for work.
not_available Next? 
not_available I repacked Mr.

not_available Quite nicely, thank you.
not_available Give Mr.

not_available Normal.
not_available It began after dinner in Mexico City.

not_available White count?

not_available Loperamide and clear liquid diet.
not_available Do you wanna see her? 
not_available No, you can send her home.
not_available Peter.
not_available You won't be scrubbing in on Dr.
not_available Heizenbach's jejunostomy this morning.
not_available Why not? 
not_available He won't work with you.
not_available The word's out about your difficulty with Doug Ross.
not_available It spread to the surgical crew.
not_available The prevailing view is that you betrayed a colleague.
not_available Is that what you think? I think maybe you're in for a chilly summer.
not_available We still on for tonight? 
not_available If you tell me where we're going.
not_available It's a surprise.
not_available How do I know what to wear? 
not_available Dress nice.

not_available And you're coming from? 
not_available Boston.
not_available Meaning Harvard? 
not_available Go Crimson.
not_available The last time you e
not_available mailed me, you were taking out your first appendix.
not_available That's right.
not_available You took out an appendix? They let us do appys lipomas, pilonidal cysts, all that small stuff.
not_available God, it's great to see you.
not_available You too.
not_available I don't know, Doug.
not_available You, me, Inga, Hulda 
not_available and a Chinese restaurant.

not_available Just got here.
not_available I'm burning with fever.
not_available Temp's normal.
not_available After sitting in your drafty waiting room.
not_available Your pain's gone? It's coming back.
not_available Okay, let's get that EKG.
not_available What's that? It monitors the heart's electrical activity.
not_available How? The leads carry impulses from your heart to the monitor.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Explain it again.
not_available We wanna make sure you're okay.
not_available Don't patronize me.
not_available You doctors are all the same.
not_available I came in here for stitches, I had to come back five times and my leg's never been the same.
not_available This place is filthy.
not_available Your EKG is abnormal.
not_available We're gonna have to draw some blood.
not_available Why? 
not_available To check your cardiac enzymes.
not_available What are those? Elements that tell us if you've had a heart attack.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Explain it again! I'm the only fourth
not_available year in the country who hasn't done an appendectomy yet.
not_available I'm about to start my Residency and I'm three steps behind the curve.
not_available GSW to the chest coming in.

not_available She looks stiff.
not_available Her jaw won't move.
not_available She looks really cyanotic.
not_available Boxcars in the eyes.
not_available Let's get the Oneg going! Let's go! Should we even be doing this? 
not_available How long was she down? It could have been a long time.
not_available From the degree of lividity, she's been dead three hours.
not_available Let's move with the Oneg! 
not_available I agree with Dale.
not_available Let's call it.
not_available No, I wanna crack her.
not_available Time of death
not_available No, I'll do it.
not_available Time of 
death 10:32.
not_available What a gyp.
not_available She's got an engagement ring.
not_available She had a little boy too.
not_available Forty
not_available seven brought him in.
not_available The boy wasn't hurt? 
not_available There's nothing physical.
not_available But he hasn't spoken since he came in.
not_available It could be posttraumatic shock.
not_available His mother make it? 
not_available Anybody know what happened? Neighbor said she heard the mother and her boyfriend fight this morning.
not_available Poor kid must have seen the whole thing.
not_available What's his name? Where is the boyfriend? 
not_available In the wind.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available I'm Doug.
not_available And that's Carol right there.
not_available What's your name? I'm gonna listen to your heart, okay? 
not_available Doug, his name's Jeremy.
not_available Jeremy? Can you hear me? Good reflexes.
not_available I'll call Psych.
not_available Why don't you see if you can track down a relative.
not_available He witnessed a murder.
not_available Boyfriend could come back.
not_available We'll get the cops to post a guard.
not_available Hey.
not_available Peter, come quick.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Mendoza.
not_available Who? The woman I sent home with Montezuma's revenge.
not_available The pain's moved from mid
not_available abdomen to the right lower quadrant.
not_available Are you a doctor? 
not_available I'm a surgeon.
not_available She's in so much pain.
not_available It's her appendix.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Don't worry, we're going to take it out.
not_available We were here earlier, but that nurse sent us home.
not_available We never saw a doctor.
not_available Don't worry, Mr.
not_available Mendoza, we'll take care of her.
not_available Clear! Did Psych come down for that boy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's in there with him now.
not_available Jerry, will you fax this for me? 
not_available Loan application? Sorry.
not_available No more personal use of the fax.
not_available Per the Weaver.
not_available Jerry.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Call Pathology to take that lady's body, these video people need to get in there.
not_available What video people? 
not_available You didn't read the memo? No.
not_available I wanna start videotaping the traumas so we can critique our work.
not_available I don't think this sounds like a good idea.
not_available David Morgenstern thought it was.
not_available He wrote the memo.
not_available On a trial basis.
not_available Path's backed up.
not_available They asked for you to keep that DB here.
not_available Put her in Exam 3.
not_available These guys need to get to work.
not_available Come on.
not_available Gown me, quick! Is that the appy? 
not_available Knife.
not_available What, I can't do it? 
not_available No.
not_available I've seen dozens.
not_available I said, no.
not_available Carter, go cover the ER.
not_available All right, here we go.
not_available Retract the fascia.
not_available Can you see? 
not_available Suction.
not_available Pulse is up to 120.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Damn it! Belly's full of puss.
not_available She done perfed good.
not_available Let's load her up with amp, gent and Flagyl.
not_available Liter of warm saline.
not_available We gotta irrigate before she goes septic.
not_available What a mess.
not_available Yeah, too bad she didn't come in sooner.
not_available Damn.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Garvey.
not_available You've got some nerve.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Garvey.
not_available "Patient is uncooperative demanding, prone to exaggerate symptoms"? Can I have my chart back? 
not_available Give me a pen.
not_available I want this changed.
not_available Doctor is unprofessional, openly hostile.
not_available Your enzymes suggest a heart attack.
not_available We need to do an echocardiogram.
not_available What's that? 
not_available It's like an ultrasound of your heart.
not_available Why do I need one of those? We need to make sure that your artery is not blocked.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Explain it again.
not_available This is your heart.
not_available This is an artery going into your heart.
not_available If it is blocked, it can explode causing a massive heart attack which would kill you within minutes.
not_available You are a sick woman.
not_available said they heard fighting.
not_available Did your mom and her boyfriend have a fight this morning? Is that what happened? Detective? Can I talk to you outside, please? What are you doing? 
not_available Trying to talk to him.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available I asked what happened.
not_available This boy's had a psychological trauma.
not_available You could have set him back weeks.
not_available Didn't know that.
not_available Well, now you do.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Where's your email pal? 
not_available He took a hernia up to the O.R.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available About an hour ago.
not_available Should be back soon.
not_available Seems like a great guy.
not_available He is.
not_available So you guys went out? 
not_available We never exactly went out.
not_available But you 
not_available Once.
not_available One night, anyway.
not_available Harper.
not_available Guy in 6 needs a rectal.
not_available I have to take these to the lab.
not_available See you.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Pass.
not_available Abdominal pain, could be surgical.
not_available Haleh, have you seen that cute guy from Harvard? 
not_available He just came down, try the desk.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available I got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Try the 15 mm for me, tilt down, get the whole bed in the frame.
not_available How's that? 
not_available Good.
not_available Pan left
not_available Iris.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Would have thought we were small potatoes for an infomercial director.
not_available I do educational tapes, equipment rentals.
not_available I'll take your money any way I can.
not_available Would you zoom in to a medium shot for me, Max? How's your eye? 
not_available Oh, fine.
not_available Nice profile.
not_available You sure you won't go on the air? I wouldn't feel right plugging your hair
not_available growth products.
not_available I don't believe in them.
not_available Well, you're more secure than most men.
not_available And you look like you're in pretty good shape.
not_available You exercise? 
not_available Run, pushups a little.
not_available Why? 
not_available I'm just about to go national with a new exercycle and I haven't found a pitchman yet.
not_available You interested? He's had periumbilical pain that localized to the right lower quadrant 
not_available nausea and vomiting.
not_available What's his white count? Nine thousand.
not_available I'm thinking appendix.
not_available Appys usually present a bit lower, but they can fool you.
not_available Let's take him up.
not_available Can I do the procedure? Does Benton let you do appys? 
not_available He talked about it.
not_available Well, there's a first time for everything.
not_available All right.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kennerly, you're going to the O.R., but there's no reason to worry.
not_available Everything is going to be fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Clean her out yet? 
not_available Still gotta drain the abscess.
not_available She's tachy, 180.
not_available Temp's 104.
not_available I'll get a cooling blanket.
not_available This is making me nervous, Peter.
not_available Just hold on.
not_available Isn't that your med student next door? What? What's going on over there? 
not_available Another appendix.
not_available When it rains, it pours.
not_available Somebody close those blinds.
not_available Run of five.
not_available Your time's about up.
not_available Just give me two minutes.
not_available Too late! 
not_available She's fibrillating.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available Crash cart.
not_available Charging at 200.
not_available Come on, don't do this to me! Clear! 
not_available three enzymes that are released by the heart after a heart 
attack CKMB, AST and LDH.
not_available By graphing the levels of each enzyme, we can determine that you had your heart attack at approximately 4 this morning.
not_available Oh, thank you, doctor.
not_available She's the one! Susan! 
not_available Yes, Kerry.
not_available One of the nurses alerted me that Ethel was about to sign out AMA which in her condition might have killed her.
not_available I thought it best to indulge her in order to save her life.
not_available Good thinking.
not_available I know it's frustrating dealing with difficult patients but you have a tendency to become anger
not_available locked and inflexible.
not_available Thank you for pointing that out.
not_available If you feel yourself getting dug in just call me.
not_available I'm here to help.
not_available Retractor.
not_available Expose the internal oblique.
not_available Can I have some suction? 
not_available Good.
not_available Now cut it open.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Okay, now put your hand in the peritoneum and feel around until you find the appendix.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay, let's see.
not_available Well, that is the pinkest, most healthy appendix I've ever seen.
not_available But he had all the symptoms.
not_available They can fool you.
not_available Well, as long as we're here 
not_available Better not.
not_available Besides, I think I see the cause of Mr.
not_available Kennerly's bellyache.
not_available What? Toothpick in the terminal ileum.
not_available I think if you pull on the gold tassel it'll slide right out.
not_available Congratulations, Mr.
not_available Carter, on your first toothpick
not_available echtomy.
not_available Now, let's start irrigating.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mendoza.
not_available Yes.
not_available Your wife is out of surgery, but she's very sick.
not_available Her appendix burst before I could remove it and the bacteria invaded her bloodstream.
not_available We're giving her antibiotics.
not_available I expect her to pull through it.
not_available Are you saying she could die? 
not_available It's a possibility.
not_available When we first came in was there no way to tell that it was the appendix? The symptoms and the story suggested food poisoning.
not_available That woman sent us home without ever seeing a doctor.
not_available She consulted a doctor, who ordered your wife discharged.
not_available How could this happen? How's the kid doing? 
not_available The same.
not_available Think I could take a peek in there, give him this? Did you draw that yourself? 
not_available I did.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Jeremy? 
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Jeremy! Jeremy! Have you seen the kid? What kid? 
not_available The one who won't talk.
not_available No.
not_available Jeremy! Oh, God.
not_available Jeremy! Hey, sweetie.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available Let's go back to your room.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay? The Pedes Attending's name is Keller, and there's a med student named Amber who will sit with him till his aunt comes.
not_available Okay, you got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Who does this belong to? 
not_available I told you to hold on to him.
not_available I just turned around for a second.
not_available We picked him up on Michigan Avenue.
not_available He's zonked out of his gourd.
not_available He's tachy, diaphoretic.
not_available Could be coke, PCP.
not_available All right, well, let's get him a room.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available What's this? Some guy dropped it off for you.
not_available Wanna order something from Psycha
not_available Deli? I'm starving.
not_available Could someone release the guy in 4? I gotta go.
not_available Sure.
not_available You okay? 
not_available I'm having a walking anxiety attack.
not_available Call me.
not_available Hi.
not_available You're all wired up.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available I'm gonna show you how everything works but I wanna eat something.
not_available How about you? I'm not really hungry.
not_available So, what's wrong with her? What is this? 
not_available Check it out.
not_available Yowza! Twentyfive thousand in
not_available Oh, it's a gift from the old man.
not_available 10 to 1 it's dirty.
not_available Looks like your treatment fund just got richer.
not_available It's going back.
not_available Penance doesn't mean anything if it's that easy.
not_available What do you know about penance? 
not_available I used to date a lot of Catholic girls.
not_available You want their numbers? 
not_available Her lungs are filling up with fluid.
not_available How is she? She might not make it.
not_available How could you miss the signs of appendicitis? 
not_available Pain localizing to the right.
not_available She told me it was diffuse.
not_available Check rebound and guarding? 
not_available I told you I did.
not_available I'm asking you if you actually did.
not_available Yes.
not_available And if you had any doubts, you should have examined her yourself.
not_available I trusted you to do that.
not_available You know how difficult appendicitis is to diagnose.
not_available I asked if you wanted to see her
not_available The appendix that wasn't.
not_available There'll be plenty more ahead of you.
not_available I wish I had at least one behind me.
not_available It is cause for concern 
not_available what with the pyramid system.
not_available Pyramid system? From now on, all surgical interns will be ranked.
not_available Those who fall in the lower third won't be asked back a second year.
not_available Come on, you gotta help me out here.
not_available Hey, come on, bud.
not_available Cooperate.
not_available This Rolling Stones, that's a cool one.
not_available "Ban the bra.
not_available " "All the way with LBJ.
not_available " What's that about? I won't hurt your buttons, I promise.
not_available I'll give your buttons right back, you just gotta take this off.
not_available Let go of her! Shep! I don't think he's breathing.
not_available Shep! There's no pulse! 
not_available Get the crash cart.
not_available Get CPR! What are you doing to my crash cart? Where's the ET tube? 
not_available Wait! He's got a pulse.
not_available He's back.
not_available I got it! Security! Security! Hey! Did they call us in? 
not_available Relax, we still have a few minutes.
not_available Where's Mom? 
not_available She went to Northfield to see Sally.
not_available Called that one right.
not_available Well, this is very upsetting for her.
not_available And for me.
not_available To have to choose between your own daughters.
not_available It's not right.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I'm not going in.
not_available Dad.
not_available I don't wanna take sides.
not_available For three weeks you've been promising to back me up and you change your mind now? You haven't spent five minutes with Chloe.
not_available You haven't met Joe.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available Your sister is like a new person.
not_available She got a job the first morning.
not_available She insists on paying for the food.
not_available Joe is a good guy.
not_available Did you check his rap sheet? 
not_available He's a cop.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm not going.
not_available It's all set.
not_available Inga's counting on you.
not_available I'm not going! 
not_available What is the problem here? I was married for 11 years.
not_available To be faced suddenly with dating You're over
not_available thinking.
not_available Follow your id.
not_available It's more complicated than that.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available What is about to pass between us must remain in the strictest of confidence.
not_available When I first met JenWhen you first met Jen? 
not_available I had never had sex before.
not_available You were 17, right? 
not_available Sixteen.
not_available And through all those years, I've always been faithful.
not_available Wait, are you telling me that you've only had sex with Jen? That so unusual? In the 20th century? 
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available I'm a freak.
not_available That's a little strong.
not_available No, it's true.
not_available I've only had sex with my wife.
not_available The thought of being intimate with a stranger What if she can't arouse me or I can't please her? 
not_available The thought alone scares me to death.
not_available Well you're right, Inga's not for you.
not_available County, this is Unit 52.
not_available We have a 16year
not_available old male, beating victim.
not_available Multiple injuries to the face and torso.

not_available Why don't we do the lunch room? On October 10, 1994, Chloe was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.
not_available At this time, she swore she would seek treatment.
not_available Six months later she was arrested for driving under the influence.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, we are here to explore the possibility of you and your sister settling this without the court's help.
not_available I take it you're not interested.
not_available No, Your Honor.
not_available And on the issue of visitation rights? 
not_available I don't trust her.
not_available Based on? 
not_available Based on her history of drunkenness addiction and false claims of rehabilitation as outlined here.
not_available I have a copy.
not_available Chloe, is there anything you'd like to say? Everything Susan said about me is true.
not_available But I've never stayed in rehab more than a week before now.
not_available And you've been free of alcohol and drugs for? Five months.
not_available Here are the urine test results.
not_available You've barely started taking responsibility for yourself.
not_available How do you expect to take responsibility for a child? I ask myself that a lot.
not_available But I am on the right track now.
not_available And I never, ever wanna go back to who I was.
not_available And I feel that with the help of God and my friends and my family that I can be a good mother to my baby.
not_available And you've been employed as a claims adjuster in Phoenix for four months.
not_available Yes, here are the affidavits.
not_available They're holding a job for me and I got a job here.
not_available Could you step outside, please? I want to speak to Dr.
not_available Lewis alone.
not_available I am going to allow your sister three overnight visits a week, starting tonight pending resolution of the adoption issue.
not_available And I'm telling you now that if you proceed with a custody fight you will lose.
not_available Chloe is the mother and, as far as I can see, she presents no danger to her child.
not_available Given that, I want you to consider the cost of proceeding.
not_available Not just financially, but in terms of the disruption to your life to Chloe's life and to the baby.
not_available We should've gone fishing.
not_available We could be sitting on a pier with our toes in the water, drowning a couple of worms.
not_available Instead, here we are, two urban casualties of the Button Man.
not_available My throat's fine, by the way.
not_available We're not raising our kids here.
not_available We're not? 
not_available No.
not_available Definitely not.
not_available Okay.
not_available What happened here? 
not_available Appendix ruptured.
not_available She's septic.
not_available I took a look at her chart.
not_available And lo and behold, you sent her home without examining her.
not_available Nothing in the P.A.'s exam suggested appendicitis.
not_available I disagree.
not_available Abdominal pain.
not_available Cramping.
not_available Fever.
not_available You should have laid hands on her, that's what a surgeon does.
not_available You were quick to assign blame when Doug made a mistake.
not_available But when your ass is on the line, you hide behind excuses.
not_available If this hits the fan, don't expect your colleagues to line up with support.
not_available Reap as you sow.
not_available 7.43.
not_available I got it.
not_available You get it next time.
not_available Why don't you go ahead.
not_available Oh, damn it.
not_available Labs are up.
not_available They can wait 10 minutes.
not_available Better not.
not_available You go ahead, I'll catch up.
not_available Your soup's gonna get cold.
not_available bruises to face, chest and abdomen.
not_available Possible fractured left tib
not_available fib and facial fracture.
not_available Anybody seen Dale? This guy sure pissed somebody off.
not_available He got jumped out of a gang.
not_available Can I do something? 
not_available You wanna run it, run it.
not_available Airway? Patent.
not_available No tracheal deviation.
not_available Bruises on chest and abdomen.
not_available No blood in the canal.
not_available Let's get a C
not_available spine, chest and head CT.
not_available Pupils? Round, equal and reactive.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Virgil.
not_available BP is down to 60.
not_available Carter? He's bleeding from somewhere.
not_available Where? 
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available That clears the chest.
not_available There are no marks on his back.
not_available Must be the belly.
not_available Lavage kit! 
not_available Lavage kit, please.
not_available Number 11 blade.
not_available Ever done this? 
not_available Not until today.
not_available Well, Mr.
not_available Carter, I see you're finally getting a procedure.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available Make sure you're into the peritoneum.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Hook up the saline.
not_available And extension tubing.
not_available Almost looks like he knows what he's doing.
not_available How is she? 
not_available A little better.
not_available I put a catheter in her artery to make it easier to draw blood.
not_available I don't see any other doctors sitting by her bed all day.
not_available Thank you for taking care of my wife.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mendoza.
not_available When you asked earlier if the appendicitis could have been caught I didn't give you a full answer.
not_available I'm the doctor who discharged your wife.
not_available If I'd examined her, I probably would have caught it but I didn't.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Nothing.
not_available No blood in the belly.
not_available BP's down to 40.
not_available Where is the bleed? 
not_available You check his back? Take a look.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available Maybe a faulty pressure cuff? Colon's clear.
not_available Spoke too soon.
not_available Must have blown a clot.
not_available Where is that damn wound? 
not_available What's that? That is a very small puncture wound.
not_available Probably an ice pick.
not_available Went right by me.
not_available Me too.
not_available Let's get this kid upstairs.
not_available Do you think he took it in the kidney or renal artery? 
not_available Renal.
not_available Wanna come up and find out? Sure.
not_available Nice catch.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Stumbled right into a trauma.
not_available Ice pick to the kidney.
not_available We're taking him up now.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is weird, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You haven't really met Joe yet.
not_available Hi, Susan.
not_available Hi, Joe.
not_available I brought extra diapers and some baby Tylenol in case she gets a fever.
not_available And Mr.
not_available B.
not_available She can't go to sleep without him.
not_available What's her bedtime routine? 
not_available Well, a bath.
not_available And then we read two picture books.
not_available And a bottle while she's getting rocked.
not_available And usually I sing to her.
not_available All right, I better go.
not_available We were hoping you'd stay for dinner.
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available Oh, please? I know little Susie would want you to.
not_available She doesn't know who I am.
not_available Come on.
not_available First, let's review a relatively simple trauma led by our own Mr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Note the uneven distribution of personnel screen right.
not_available Everyone clumped together like a herd of wildebeest while the left side is underutilized.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Very enlightening.
not_available Next, we'll see an example of poor trauma hygiene.
not_available Observe Mr.
not_available Carter wiping his nose with his gloved hand just prior to grabbing the scalpel.
not_available Let's look one more time.
not_available The wipe and now the grab.
not_available One more time.
not_available Wipe and grab.
not_available Good.
not_available Now let's take a look at a more organized trauma led by Dale earlier in the day.
not_available You wanna have dinner tonight? 
not_available Love to.
not_available Are you saying that you've never had sex with anyone but Jen? That so unusual? 
not_available In the 20th century? I may have gone too far back.
not_available What if she can't arouse me or I can't please her? 
not_available The thought alone scares me to death.
not_available Well, you 're right.
not_available Inga's not for you.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Mendoza's doing better.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I spoke to her husband.
not_available He said that you told him it was your fault.
not_available It was my fault.
not_available Peter, do you hate me? 
not_available No.
not_available You don't even look at me when we talk.
not_available It's been like this all year.
not_available Look, I'm sorry that I hurt you, but I thought by now we'd be past it.
not_available I am past it.
not_available Way past it.
not_available You have to admit it was funny.
not_available It was the most humiliating moment of my life.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, this came for you.
not_available Bad news? I've been denied a loan from a company whose motto 
is 
not_available "We lend money to anyone.
not_available " 
not_available There's always your dad's dough.
not_available Yeah, then I'd have to thank him.
not_available Penance has its price.
not_available Ready? 
not_available As I'll ever be.
not_available How's your appetite? 
not_available Good.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available It's strong.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I hate to bring up the elephant in the room but I think you did a wonderful thing.
not_available You mean taking care of Susie? I didn't have a choice.
not_available Even so, you gave Chloe a chance.
not_available When she first came to AA, she had as low opinion of herself as anyone could.
not_available But she wanted to get well.
not_available I thought you were a cop.
not_available I'm also a recovering alcoholic.
not_available Nine years.
not_available The program frowns on old
not_available timers like me getting involved with newcomers.
not_available But we fell in love.
not_available Won't get married for a while, though.
not_available Not till Chloe gets her year cake.
not_available If she makes a year.
not_available Weren't you going home to change? 
not_available I did, but I changed my mind.
not_available You don't wanna go.
not_available No.
not_available I bought the tickets.
not_available Normally that would bother me.
not_available Considering the occasion, I don't care.
not_available What occasion? 
not_available My dumping you.
not_available You're dumping me? 
not_available And I feel good about it.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available You know.
not_available No, I don't know.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available You lured Dale and me upstairs so that you could do a procedure.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Yeah, it is! You're a weasel! All that matters to you is making suck
not_available points with surgical Residents.
not_available Let's go someplace and talk.
not_available No.
not_available Harper, please.
not_available No, it's too late.
not_available I don't even know who you are anymore.
not_available Hey.
not_available Are you ready? Almost.
not_available Where's Reilly? At Magoo's with that cute tech he's after.
not_available Boy doesn't waste much time.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Hey, doc, did you hear? 
not_available No, what? That kid that saw his mom get shot finally started talking.
not_available Turns out that the boyfriend was slapping mom around, so the kid runs gets a gun from the drawer.
not_available He's gonna protect his mom, right? 
not_available Only he's not such a good aim.
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Killed his own mother.
not_available Nice world, huh? I feel like I just plucked the virtue of a virgin.
not_available I'm so glad you did.
not_available Wanna do that again? 
not_available I need a minute to recuperate.
not_available Okay.
not_available You let me know.
not_available Meantime, we can play back the tape critique your technique.
not_available Relax, sweetie.
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available You're awful quiet.
not_available I was just thinking about that kid.
not_available He will never get over what happened.
not_available He will be, for the rest of his life, damaged goods.
not_available Probably end up like the Button Man.
not_available No, he won't.
not_available Yes, he will.
not_available He is a Button Man in the making.
not_available What's going on here? 
not_available Idiots.
not_available Unit 47 requesting police backup at 46 and Hutchins.
not_available Couple of guys bonking each other over the headHey! Jeez! What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Son of a bitch! Hey, Shep! Shep, get back here! Shep, what are you doing?! Shep! Stop! For God's sake, Shep! Stop it! Get off of me! 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, I'm looking for Ray.
not_available He's not here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, come on in.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm Karen.
not_available I'm Doug.
not_available Can I get you something to drink, Doug? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Do you have any idea when Ray's gonna be back? 
not_available Not tonight.
not_available I'm his son.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available I saw you the night you came into the bar.
not_available That's right.
not_available He said that you were his boss.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I try to remind him of that every chance I get.
not_available So are you his boss? 
not_available Why don't you just ask me.
not_available Ask you what? Do I sleep with your father? Do you? 
not_available I'm not going to answer that.
not_available I only say that because it's unusual that your boss would be living in your apartment.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Scotch.
not_available Who said I lived here? What are you doing here? I'm staying here tonight.
not_available What are you doing here? I have no idea.
not_available What's this? Names, dates, case numbers that Dr.
not_available Vucelich dropped from his study.
not_available I'm going on record to show that he's a fraud.
not_available Why are you doing this, Peter? 
not_available Like you said it's easy to make excuses for not doing the right thing.
not_available No more excuses.
not_available She takes four ounces of milk at night heated for 40 seconds at 50 percent.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm so glad you stayed.
not_available I know everybody thinks you've changed, and I hope to God that you have but forgive me for not rejoicing just yet.
not_available Maybe I can't be objective because I've been so angry at you for so long.
not_available Do you really think you can be a good mother to this little girl? Yes.
not_available More than anything, that's what I wanna be.
not_available Well, I can finish up in here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm so glad Susie's got an aunt that'll always be there who's smart and a doctor.
not_available She's gonna give you good advice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, you wanna say good night? Yeah.
not_available Good night, sweetie.
