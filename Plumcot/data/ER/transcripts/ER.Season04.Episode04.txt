
not_available ER Previously on ER But I'm confident that you'll make things work.
not_available Thank you for your trust.
not_available My teacher told me I had talent, but he was trying to get into my pants.
not_available So you trust me? This time.
not_available Deep penetrating, poorly visualized cabinets.
not_available I think it should be off limits.
not_available We don't usually refer to our senior surgeons that way.
not_available So I should stop speaking my mind? I don't think taxpayers are interested in buying Doris a tox screen.
not_available You're out there working with us and you got AIDS? I gotta get by like everybody else.
not_available "When The Bough Breaks" Hold on! Hold on! I got stuck on call today, so I gotta drop this stuff off and then head back.
not_available I couldn't get anybody to cover for me.
not_available I've already taken off so much time.
not_available I'll get you a key if you'll be coming in this early.
not_available Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
not_available What is that? It's oxygen.
not_available Peter, this is getting morbid.
not_available Do we really need all this stuff? Breathing monitor, devibullator
not_available No, no, no.
not_available "Defibrillator.
not_available " They wouldn't be sending him home if he was in any danger.
not_available Paramedics take six minutes to respond to a call.
not_available If something happens, you need to resuscitate.
not_available Come here.
not_available The mask attaches to the ambu
not_available bag.
not_available The ambu
not_available bag to the tank.
not_available If he stops breathing, call 911 and make sure his airway is clear.
not_available Then turn the oxygen to 10 liters per minute, and then bag him.
not_available One squeeze every three seconds.
not_available Now, if you don't get a pulse
not_available One hundred chest compressions per minute.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available Well, good.
not_available If something happens, you'll be glad you know.
not_available Go to work, Peter.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll meet you at the nursery at 10.
not_available Is somebody picking you up? I'll call my mom.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't forget about the car seat.
not_available Peter? It's gonna be all right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's it going, Doug? Need some duct tape? That's what this is? An ego check? No, this is about spending time together.
not_available I can think of better activities.
not_available I like to keep you off balance.
not_available I'm sorry to disappoint you, Carol 
not_available but you underestimate me.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available It's like ice
not_available skating.
not_available Until you have to stop.
not_available That's what lampposts are for.
not_available Your helmet.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available No helmet.
not_available Safety first.
not_available You're not wearing a helmet.
not_available You'll mess the 'do! 
not_available I know what I'm doing.
not_available You mean you wear that on purpose? 
not_available Skate, Tonya.
not_available All right, Mr.
not_available Crash.
not_available Crash? I'm not gonna Mark, are you there? Mark? Who is it? It's me.
not_available Jen.
not_available Just a sec.
not_available Is something wrong? 
not_available No, I got it.
not_available Come on in.
not_available You sleep in your clothes? 
not_available No.
not_available What's that? 
not_available It's an infomercial thing.
not_available Sorry, I wasn't expecting visitors.
not_available What's up? Rachel fell asleep in class Monday.
not_available She said her daddy kept her up watching movies all weekend.
not_available You never went out.
not_available You order pizza every night.
not_available You're telling me how to spend time with her? It's getting to her.
not_available She's nervous, her stomach hurts all the time.
not_available She's worried about you.
not_available She is? 
not_available I am! Look at this place, Mark.
not_available It's normal to be frightened after something like that.
not_available Don't try to fix me, Jen.
not_available It's not your job anymore.
not_available Want to sit down? Fine.
not_available I won't drop Rachel off this weekend.
not_available Don't expect to pick her up.
not_available You can't keep me from seeing my daughter! You need some time to work this out, until you're more yourself.
not_available Look, I am her father, okay? And she loves you.
not_available But you're hurting her right now.
not_available I'm doing you a favor, Mark.
not_available Call me when you have your life back together.
not_available I feel happy.
not_available I feel healthy.
not_available I feel terrific.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available Nice pep talk.
not_available Motivational tapes? Success is 99 percent attitude.
not_available Really? That makes me a miserable failure.
not_available No, no.
not_available Failure is a state of mind.
not_available You didn't pay for that advice? I didn't get a great start this year, and unless I change my approach I'm gonna hate all of my internship.
not_available What are you doing? Symatic presentation.
not_available Boring, but they had a great buffet.
not_available Free penlights.
not_available I snagged you a couple.
not_available See? It's working already.
not_available New pups are waiting outside.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Hi.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Welcome to what promises to be your most exciting rotation.
not_available You are? 
not_available James Sasic.
not_available Ivan Fu.
not_available Ivan, good to meet you.
not_available Jim.
not_available James.
not_available James, right.
not_available I assume you've met Anna Del Amico.
not_available Great.
not_available Let's get started, shall we? Chuny, what you got for a couple of eager new med students? A 4
not_available F with abdominal pain in 3.
not_available 4F? 
not_available Female, fertile, fat and 40.
not_available Add flighty and flatulent.
not_available Always nice to start off with a round of gallstones.
not_available Follow me! We call him Sergeant Sunshine.
not_available That's a nasty bump.
not_available Lucky I have a hard head.
not_available Ouch.
not_available What happened? Sports accident.
not_available He won't be specific.
not_available A testosterone injury? 
not_available He who laughs last, laughs hardest.
not_available I'll remember that.
not_available Mark, how you doing? Didn't you hear? I stay up late, don't go out, order pizza, watch too much TV.
not_available What is that? 
not_available He's a little cranky, I guess.
not_available What else is new? 
not_available Turn it up.
not_available Cops are chasing a motorcycle.
not_available Again? past the other traffic.
not_available That's so stupid.
not_available At least he's wearing a helmet.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd like to compliment you.
not_available On what? Your fellowship pediatric proposal on pediatric PCA.
not_available Very intriguing.
not_available Where'd you get that? 
not_available Department of Pediatrics.
not_available Allowing children to control their own pain medication is ahead of its time.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available Of course, it has been three years.
not_available It's a shame you never finished it.
not_available UC San Diego is actually implementing the idea.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available Take a look.
not_available Unfortunately, they've proven your original thesis.
not_available But you could use their data to develop a smaller clinical study.
not_available Say, PCA in the Emergency Department.
not_available Clinical studies were never really my strong suit.
not_available If you already have something else, then go with it.
not_available I've outlined a research and grant application schedule.
not_available I'd be happy to review any material before submission.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available I do.
not_available But I can handle this on my own.
not_available If that were true, you would've been done a long time ago.
not_available I'm serious, Doug.
not_available The ER cannot continue to pay for a Pediatric Fellow.
not_available You need a research grant to cover your salary before the end of the year or look for a private practice.
not_available What's this? This is my eviction notice.
not_available So which student do you want? 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available You got boned last time.
not_available I'll give you dibs.
not_available No, you choose.
not_available Either one is gonna be great.
not_available Be careful, doctor.
not_available Blind optimism will screw you every time.

not_available quadrant pain.
not_available And what do you wanna do? Get a CBC and an ultrasound to confirm thickening of the gallbladder wall and/or common bile
not_available duct dilation.
not_available And what are the other two borders of Calot's triangle? Excuse me? 
not_available The common duct and? The cystic duct in the liver.
not_available Hooray.
not_available What have we got? Jeremy Willis, isolated right leg injury.
not_available Nineteen, going on infinity.
not_available Say again? 
not_available He thinks he's an angel.
not_available Flew into traffic.
not_available Can you feel this? 
not_available He walked against the signal.
not_available Can you wiggle your toes? He can't see me, but I'm always there.
not_available Distal neural's intact.
not_available Bad hair day, huh? I'm trying to grow it out.
not_available Let's not humor him, huh, Lily? Let's get a right tib
not_available fib and a knee series.
not_available Looks like a fracture.
not_available We'll have to get some x

not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico can handle it.
not_available You're gonna help him, huh? You are? You can? No problemo.
not_available Doctor, I'll take it from here.
not_available Sure.

not_available It was hard for me.
not_available I work in medicine, where people understand.
not_available But it gets better.
not_available No one wonders how you got it.
not_available I used to be one of those guys.
not_available We'd tell fag jokes.
not_available Believe me it won't get any better.
not_available You wanna pull the skin a bit tighter.
not_available You don't want the vein to roll on you.
not_available Great.
not_available You're ready to stick her.

not_available Peter, are you coming? Peter? Hey, Carla.
not_available It's me.

not_available Everything's fine.
not_available How is he? Tell me if you feel one poke or two.
not_available Two.
not_available Two.
not_available One.
not_available Don't draw on your body in a moving vehicle.
not_available Now you tell me.
not_available It's a good cartoon, though.
not_available Let's get a hand series, a gram of Ancef, and a tetanus booster.
not_available Aren't you gonna pull it out? Not yet.
not_available We want to get an x
not_available ray and numb your hand first.
not_available You think I could sue for this? I'm serious.
not_available I was gonna go to art school.
not_available I should be able to sue somebody.
not_available Great technique back there.
not_available Where'd you learn it? Dr.
not_available Benton showed me.
not_available You were lucky to have him as a teacher.
not_available It's serving you well.
not_available How's that new attitude of yours holding up? 
not_available Maybe I'll start tomorrow.
not_available Where's Ivan? He's in the lounge, reevaluating his career choice.
not_available Teacher ID'd him as Matthew Blevins.
not_available Get me when his parents get here.
not_available He died, didn't he? Yeah, he did.
not_available Hi.
not_available You want to talk to me? 
not_available It can wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry that I barged in on the asthma kid.
not_available His grandma knows me.
not_available What asthma kid? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Wow, what happened? How was lunch? You were lucky, Officer Mulvihill.
not_available Your cervical spine's normal.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But your wrist may require some surgery.
not_available Orthopedic surgeon will be down shortly.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mulvihill? How bad is it? It might require a couple of pins.
not_available Not me.
not_available The kids.
not_available How bad are the kids? Some are very serious but we were able to save just about everybody.
not_available Just about? Let me tie off this bleeder.
not_available The Marines have arrived.
not_available Cut.
not_available Are you with me, Peter? Oh, yeah.
not_available You certainly managed to surprise me this morning.
not_available And that doesn't happen often.
not_available What do you mean? I can read people well, but I didn't have you pegged as a family man.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Most surgical residents aren't.
not_available And you strike me as ambitious, driven.
not_available I wonder how you'll manage it.
not_available Lovely wife, though.
not_available Actually, she's not my wife.
not_available Well, there you go.
not_available You surprised me again.
not_available This place has negative energy.
not_available You're lost in negative energy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, can I talk to you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Stay where you are.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Don't give in to it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lowrey from Psych left a note in his chart when things were crazy.
not_available Yeah, I saw it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I guess she's gonna try to find the poor guy's family.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You surviving all this? I'm trying.
not_available That was pretty amazing what you were doing in there.
not_available Yeah, well, not amazing enough.
not_available Doc? 
not_available I'll let you get back.
not_available Okay.
not_available I know a secret.
not_available You wanna hear? Not particularly.
not_available She likes you.
not_available Hey.
not_available You disappeared on me.
not_available What happened? 
not_available You don't want to know.
not_available Boy make it? 
not_available No.
not_available I was hoping for some good news.
not_available Talk to Anna? About what? 
not_available About the asthma kid.
not_available She's cool.
not_available She wasn't cool about it before.
not_available Really? 
not_available You might want to talk to her.
not_available Why? She talked to you.
not_available Carol, you got a minute? 
not_available Your turn.
not_available I heard about your unexpected delivery.
not_available Whose version? She's screaming for a lawyer.
not_available She's high on something.
not_available Crack, probably.
not_available When she comes down, she might see things differently.
not_available Fill out an incident report.
not_available Document your account.
not_available She's a crack addict.
not_available That baby popped out, I did not drop it.
not_available But after your suspension, her accusations might carry more weight.
not_available Can anyone back you up? 
not_available Mark Greene was there.
not_available Make sure you're on the same page.
not_available What do we got? 
not_available Motorcycle accident.
not_available Multiple abrasions on the right side, elbow and abdominal pain.
not_available He was fleeing the police.
not_available Slid 15 feet into a fence.
not_available This the guy they were chasing? Damn straight! We finally got the punk.
not_available I wasn't the jerk that ran into a bus full of kids.
not_available Just the jerk that caused it.
not_available Oh, bite me, lady! 
not_available Hey! Shut up! Put him in Suture.
not_available Carter! Take him.
not_available I'm afraid I might stick an IV pole up his ass.
not_available Wouldn't want that.
not_available I checked with upstairs, and Mr.
not_available Melgato is satting well.
not_available No injuries other than the ribs.
not_available Good.
not_available I waited to put in that chest tube.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available He had rib fractures.
not_available You could've cut yourself and bled inside him.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available We agreed you wouldn't put your hands in any cavities.
not_available What was I to do? 
not_available Walk away.
not_available He would've died.
not_available That's the risk you assume for your patients when you work here with HIV.
not_available Did you black out at all? No, I don't think so.
not_available Any trouble breathing? Blurred vision? No.
not_available BP's 132/88.
not_available So you slid on your right side? Yeah.
not_available What's this from, then? 
not_available Guess.
not_available There was a piece of fence sticking out.
not_available He must've rolled into it.
not_available Straight into it? You tell him, doc! Okay, Lily.
not_available Let's get a CBC, type and screen.
not_available Lateral C
not_available spine, chest AP pelvis and an abdominal CT.
not_available Surgical consult? Yeah.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available He's stable.
not_available Let's wait and get the abdominal CT first.
not_available Remind me why I do this again.
not_available Because you hate yourself? Oh, yeah.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Mark, you know I didn't drop that baby, right? Sure.
not_available Kerry thinks there could be some trouble.
not_available Well, don't worry.
not_available Crack addicts generally lack credibility.
not_available So I can count on your support? 
not_available I didn't actually see it.
not_available What's that mean? It means I didn't see it.
not_available I did not drop that baby.
not_available I went to put the rail down, I told her not to push.
not_available She pushed.
not_available I reached for it but never touched it.
not_available Sure.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Mark, I did not drop the baby! What do you want me to say? I saw something that I didn't? No, I would like you to believe me.
not_available Sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available We had a bit of a crisis.
not_available Yes, I saw.
not_available Pretty bad, huh? Yeah.
not_available Well, he seems to be breathing okay.
not_available The puffer isn't working.
not_available I'll give him prednisone.
not_available It's a steroid.
not_available He's gonna take one tablet two times a day.
not_available Can you give him something for his stomach? Stomach's still bothering him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The diarrhea is back.
not_available Diarrhea? Let me take a look.
not_available Does that hurt? Let's get a stool sample.
not_available Yes, the lady doctor said he should have one.
not_available The lady doctor? You sure? When do I get out of here? 
not_available I have to examine you.
not_available When do I get out of here? I see your high is wearing off.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Checking your uterus.
not_available Lie still
not_available No, get somebody else.
not_available A doctor.
not_available You're stuck with me.
not_available Come on, Doris.
not_available Open up.
not_available Doris! I hear you asked for a lawyer.
not_available It was a boy, wasn't it? Yeah, Doris.
not_available It was a boy.
not_available I didn't know I was pregnant.
not_available I swear! I was so wasted.
not_available If someone told me, I would've given up the crack.
not_available You can still do that, Doris.
not_available Where is he? Where's my baby? Just a minute.
not_available What, did they cut him up? A doctor will talk to you about it.
not_available They never say nothing.
not_available He would've got messed up with me anyway.
not_available I can have another one, though, right? I'm okay down there? Yeah, Doris.
not_available You're okay down there.
not_available I'm really sorry, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I've never seen that much blood before.
not_available You get used to it.
not_available This isn't gonna affect my evaluation, is it? I have to get honors.
not_available Get a good night's rest.
not_available We'll start with a clean slate tomorrow.
not_available I'm leaving right now, okay? You need anything? All right.
not_available How's he doing? Oh, yeah, I'm coming.
not_available Bye.
not_available Going home early? 
not_available No, I'm leaving on time for once.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Benton? Did you save that girl's arm? The team is still working on it, but it looks good.
not_available Oh, that's great.
not_available That's great.
not_available So how's your baby doing? 
not_available He's good.
not_available We need you.
not_available The motorcycle guy's crashing.
not_available What happened? 
not_available We moved him and he passed out.
not_available What's the story? 
not_available Motorcycle accident.
not_available I'll handle it! 
not_available BP's 50 palp.
not_available Set up for a lavage.
not_available Set me up for a lavage.
not_available How many units did you crossmatch? 
not_available None.
not_available He was stable.
not_available Four units, type
not_available specific.
not_available Two liters of saline.
not_available Why didn't you page me? 
not_available He needed a head CT.
not_available That's a surgical call.
not_available I was saving time.
not_available You did sayCarter, the patient is critical! 
not_available He's tachy at 120.
not_available He wasn't hypertensive.
not_available Crit was normal.
not_available There was no sign of bleeding.
not_available Damn it! Lavage is positive.
not_available Let's get him up to O.R.! He was stable! 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Pathology call about that preemie? No, but Dr.
not_available Lowrey called and found that crazy guy's family in Indiana.
not_available They think he went off his medicine when he went to college.
not_available His mom's coming.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lowrey said go ahead and give him Hadlaw.
not_available You mean Haldol? Right, Haldol.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Talk to Greene.
not_available He's an Attending.
not_available Talk to Greene about what? Nothing.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Then just confront Benton.
not_available It's not that easy.
not_available I haven't talked to him for months.
not_available Make him talk to you.
not_available You can sulk, or let him go on treating you like this.
not_available No, I'm gonna talk to him.
not_available Good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico, guess what? You know Jamie Landeta, the asthma kid? He doesn't have asthma.
not_available He has strongyloides.
not_available Causes a bronchial irritation, masks as asthma.
not_available The prednisone would've made it worse.
not_available Good catch.
not_available Yeah, one I almost didn't make.
not_available Why didn't you tell me about the parasite? 
not_available It was a hunch.
not_available You should've shared it.
not_available I tried.
not_available You had it covered.
not_available We work as a team here.
not_available Come on! What team? You could've explained there were other good doctors.
not_available Instead, you took the easy way out.
not_available What? What?! I'm sorry.
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available Blevins.
not_available You wanted to talk to her about her son.
not_available Where is my son? 
not_available Your son was in an accident.
not_available On the bus, I know.
not_available Yes.
not_available On the bus.
not_available He suffered multiple injuries, very grave injuries.
not_available We gave him blood transfusions.
not_available We gave him emergency surgery.
not_available We exhausted all of our capabilities.
not_available But despite our best efforts we were unable to save him.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Blevins, he died.
not_available Need some help? 
not_available No.
not_available I got it.
not_available You have another surgery? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available An emergency splenectomy.
not_available I thought you'd left.
not_available I did.
not_available Here, I'll do it.
not_available You should go.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available I got it.
not_available Don't be stubborn.
not_available It's your baby's first day home.
not_available I, on the other hand, have no life.
not_available Look, I appreciate it, but it's okay.
not_available You should take advantage of my generosity when it's around.
not_available Trust me.
not_available You'll see it rarely.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell Hicks that I
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Go.
not_available Go! I knew you'd come back.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Something to make you feel normal.
not_available I don't want to feel normal.
not_available No, don't run away from it.
not_available Don't run away from the fear.
not_available I know how to deal with it.
not_available You need to make friends with the fear.
not_available What do you mean? Death is all around.
not_available Stick to the light.
not_available Embrace it.
not_available The light will save you! Dr.
not_available Benton! 
not_available Hang on, I want to talk to you.
not_available Not now, Carter.
not_available No, wait.
not_available For a long time, I bought into your abuse and your humiliation because I was learning something.
not_available You were.
not_available Even if there was a point to it then there's no point to it now.
not_available Good night, Carter.
not_available I'm tired of you blowing me off! You're gonna have to talk to me.
not_available You wanna talk? You wanna talk now? 
not_available Right now! Carter No.
not_available Carter, move.
not_available No.
not_available Carter, move.
not_available No.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Get off of me! You okay? What, you care? What's wrong? 
not_available I'm not your student.
not_available I know.
not_available Then treat me like a colleague.
not_available You're an intern! For three years I did everything you asked.
not_available I earned your respect! And you threw it away! Because I'm not like you? 
not_available Because you wasted my time.
not_available This isn't about your time.
not_available This is about your egotism.
not_available Yeah, right, Carter.
not_available I'm egotistical.
not_available A lot of people worked damn hard to make sure I am where I am.
not_available I gotta be self
not_available centered.
not_available I don't take time for anything.
not_available But you I did for you, Carter.
not_available I did, man.
not_available You don't want to be a surgeon, you don't come to me.
not_available You go to Anspaugh.
not_available I was afraid you'd talk me out of it.
not_available I wish I had the chance to try.
not_available Hey, okay.
not_available You're right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Can I go home now? Yeah.
not_available You know what, Carter? You don't wanna be treated like my student? Stop seeking my approval.
not_available Doug, have you seen Carol? Yeah.
not_available About 5'6", pretty.
not_available Packs an attitude.
not_available What are you reading? 
not_available Research.
not_available You? 
not_available Pain management for kids.
not_available It's an idea I had once.
not_available Carol.
not_available Carol.
not_available I got that autopsy report on the crack baby.
not_available He died in utero two days ago.
not_available I guess we're both off the hook.
not_available It wasn't a matter of me believing you or not.
not_available I would've been on your side.
not_available If you'd been on the patient's side, this wouldn't have happened.
not_available What? 
not_available I checked her chart.
not_available That woman was here four times in seven months.
not_available You saw her twice.
not_available Never did a pregnancy test.
not_available Was there reason to? Evidently, yes.
not_available We're supposed to give pregnancy tests to every crackhead who comes in? 
not_available That's not what I'm saying.
not_available Then what? God forbid she ever finds out what her real malpractice suit is.
not_available I would back you up.
not_available Say there was no reason for a pregnancy test.
not_available We should've done something.
not_available What should we have done? We can't help people who can't help themselves.
not_available No, Mark.
not_available Those are exactly the people we should be helping.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm glad you're still here.
not_available I'm surprised that you are.
not_available Jeanie, I had every right to be angry.
not_available I went to the mat for you.
not_available We had a deal.
not_available I couldn't stand there and watch him die.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available We were losing a pulse.
not_available It was worth the risk.
not_available You made a decision to continue working here.
not_available I supported it.
not_available But our decisions affect more than just ourselves.
not_available In this case, a man is still alive.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available We agreed you'd work under specific guidelines.
not_available You have to stick to them.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available But if I had to do it again, I can't say I wouldn't do the same thing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Do you take the El? No, I drive.
not_available I park around the corner.
not_available It's more convenient.
not_available Aren't you afraid your car will get stolen or scratched up? Nothing's happened so far.
not_available Do you mind walking me up to the platform? I get scared at night.
not_available Where do you live? 
not_available Near Humboldt Park, for now.
not_available I'll give you a lift.
not_available I don't wanna be a bother.
not_available No bother.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks.
