
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available Woman I went to med school with has a patient who's very sick.
not_available Young boy.
not_available And the surgical team that performed it in Croatia has disbanded since then.
not_available What! I got a guy here says he's your husband.
not_available We wanted burgers.
not_available So we took a cab to this drive
not_available through.
not_available Turns out to be a mini
not_available chapel.
not_available So I spoke to an attorney.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available He said annulling it should be fairly easy.
not_available That's what my guy said.
not_available Any word on Eric? I don't expect any.
not_available It's like a bear hibernating.
not_available Any patient here over six hours is your failure, not mine.
not_available Treat, turf or dispo.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available Clear.
not_available Got a rhythm.

not_available Yeah, I'm not.
not_available Why did they send it to you? They're hoping that I'm gonna change my mind.
not_available My shots are good for a year.
not_available You didn't sign anything? No.
not_available It's a volunteer organization.
not_available They can't draft you.
not_available Luka is still going to the Congo.
not_available I know.
not_available He doesn't listen to me, either.
not_available So with Weaver back down here, does that mean that Romano is history? He moved his office out of exam one.
not_available Could be the urine smell burned his eyes.
not_available She's probably working a couple shifts for appearance's sake to keep people from killing him.
not_available We tried that.
not_available Carter.
not_available They keep putting him back together.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, meet your new students.
not_available My students? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're chief resident, aren't you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And this is still a teaching hospital? Yes, but
not_available Good, then start teaching.

not_available We're gonna need a second line for lidocaine.
not_available Is it unit 27? The helicopter? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Why? 
not_available Chuck flies with the 27.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Chuck.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available It's weird.
not_available But there's something about him.
not_available He makes me feel good.
not_available Not that way.
not_available Well, that way too.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available His name's James Shaw.
not_available He's on Mellaril, per Dr.
not_available Kazanjian.
not_available Mellaril, anti
not_available psychotic.
not_available James, how many Mellaril did you take? They're all gone.
not_available I need some more.
not_available If you take too many pills, your heart can stop.
not_available The pills scramble the signal.
not_available It keeps them from finding me.
not_available Keeps who from finding you? 
not_available They know my neural pattern.
not_available No.
not_available Nobody's gonna find you here.
not_available They monitor the 40hz range.
not_available Abby.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Brother's on the phone.
not_available What? Eric.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available You can tell because it tastes like metal.
not_available Your brother's okay? 
not_available I haven't heard from him in two months.
not_available I must leave before they scan this place.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available James, they can't scan you in here.
not_available Okay, because radiology is upstairs and the floors and the walls are lined with lead.
not_available Okay, my name's Abby.
not_available I'm gonna help you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Give him five more of Haldol.
not_available Use restraints if you have to.
not_available Call his PMD, let him know he's here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you watch him? I have to take a phone call.
not_available What line? What line's my brother on? He said he'd call back in an hour.
not_available Call back from where? I don't know.
not_available Well, did he sound in trouble? Did he sound like he was all right? He said he'd call back in an hour.
not_available Are you the only person here that doesn't know about my crazy family? What? 
not_available Just, can you please come find me when he calls back? Drag me out of a stall if you have to.
not_available Yeah, can I? Could you help me over here, please? 
not_available One second.
not_available Hey, Mom, it's me.
not_available Eric called and I was wondering if you'd heard from him.
not_available Can you call me at work? Thanks.
not_available I got a guy who came in complaining of a severe sore throat.
not_available I wanna send off a culture and a CBC.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is Andrew.
not_available Hi, Andrew.
not_available What is this guy still doing here? 
not_available I'm still working him up.
not_available Yeah, wrong.
not_available Hold this.
not_available Take these.
not_available I'm already seeing eight.
not_available Now you're seeing 12.
not_available I'll give you four more every 15 minutes.
not_available So I suggest you start turfing people, beginning here.
not_available He has low
not_available grade fever and adenopathy.
not_available If I wanted a nurse's opinion Well, I don't know what I'd do, because, quite frankly, it's never happened.
not_available Say "Ah." He's got no exudates.
not_available Write a scrip for Erythro and get him out of this bed.
not_available He's in a lot of pain.
not_available That is why they call it a sore throat.
not_available Viral pharyngitis will go away on its own.
not_available If it's viral, why would you give him antibiotics? You kept him here two hours.
not_available Call it a consolation prize.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Rocket Romano.
not_available I'm head of the ER.
not_available You look a little lost.
not_available Dr.

not_available He had a prolonged extraction and we tubed him for LOC.
not_available Susan, this is Gordana, a surgeon from back home.
not_available Hi.
not_available Did he talk before he crashed? Headache, belly pain? No.
not_available He was just cursing me out till he crumped.
not_available You want me to call a social worker down on this? She's not mother of the year, but I don't sense she'd hurt the child.
not_available Baby's sick and the mother's evasive.
not_available Could be MÃ¼nchausen by proxy.
not_available Let's get our tests back.

not_available Not my fault.
not_available There a problem? Mrs.

not_available Which magically resolved along with her abdominal pain after passing gas.
not_available You're gonna charge my insurance Her belly is tender.

not_available So admit her and work her up.

not_available Hey.
not_available Don't you "hey" me.
not_available If you wanna get a CT scan and reconsult me, fine.
not_available Or send her home and bring her back.
not_available But I refuse to admit her just so you can clear ER beds in 30 minutes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, can you take a look at this patient? Let me guess.

not_available Might go faster.
not_available Might go a lot faster if he came properly intubated.
not_available Glad to see your leadership skills rubbing off here.

not_available Always playing practical jokes on the other students, on our professors.
not_available Really? You could always tell when Luka was in the building because you'd hear him laughing.
not_available You know that laugh of his.
not_available It's contagious.
not_available He doesn't really laugh much at work.
not_available He seems like he's changed.
not_available He's been through a lot, I guess.
not_available Still, I thought I'd find him married to some American supermodel with three children and a dog.
not_available His wife Danijela would have wanted that.
not_available Abby, page Psych again.

not_available We have to proceed with the surgical interrogation.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are you on your meds? Well, why didn't you go to a hospital? Well, what's the phone number of the booth you're using? Stop talking to them.

not_available James! Look out, look out, look out.
not_available Hey, just hang out.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available When are they gonna stop this? Well, usually it doesn't take more than four or five hours.
not_available You think I'm kidding? Now you see why I want out of this place.
not_available Well, it's not all bad.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available You can get a job at Northwestern too.
not_available I left County once, but I came back.
not_available Something about this place just gets in your blood.

not_available She spiked a fever.
not_available Oh, am I interrupting something?

not_available r.
not_available Tylenol and four of MS.
not_available Should I page Dr.

not_available If I were you two, I would concentrate on my patient.

not_available It's classic.
not_available We must page Corday to book an O.R.

not_available Do you know how hard it is to hear on that chopper with rotors and the vibration and the headphones? 
not_available I do know.
not_available But
not_available That lung was up when I transported him.
not_available He had pneumo.
not_available You should've caught it.
not_available You didn't.
not_available I stood up for you in there.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? You felt like you had to because I'm a nurse and you're a doctor? No, that is not it.
not_available Well, maybe a little.
not_available I know how they bag on the EMTs.
not_available What is so funny? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available We just
not_available We bag on doctors all the time.

not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Come with me now.
not_available Now.
not_available I got a septic patient moments from badness.
not_available I need you to help me put a catheter in a pocket of pus.
not_available Think you can do that? Perhaps, but
not_available Good.
not_available Pressure's better.
not_available What's her temp? 
not_available 39.
not_available Cefoxitin running in.
not_available I need you to sign this.
not_available What is it? 
not_available A consent for the procedure.
not_available What happens if I don't? 
not_available You'll probably die.
not_available What are they saying? 
not_available Pillow talk.
not_available Kidney stone in Two is pain
not_available free.
not_available Send him home with Vicodin and a strainer.
not_available Eleanor Carter.
not_available It might be under Eleanor Ferguson.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Drummond can have Compazine.
not_available She can come back if pain persists.

not_available Lewis can take care of everybody else.

not_available Thank you.
not_available I need to go home.

not_available Trocar and pigtail.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Pull the needle out and put the trocar right over the wire.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Do you know anyone in the state department? Why? My friend is trying to get a little boy into this country for an operation
not_available Luka, I'm really sorry.
not_available I can't help you with this right now.
not_available Jerry, have you seen Abby? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Can you find her for me? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, Dad, it's me.
not_available No, I didn't get ahold of Mom.
not_available Are you sure that you're gonna make the 5:30 flight? Okay.
not_available No, I'll just leave right from here to come to the airport to pick you up.
not_available Okay.
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Bye.
not_available I've been looking for you.
not_available I've been looking for you.
not_available I got a 26year
not_available old with stridor in severe respiratory distress.
not_available I can't tube him.
not_available His epiglottis is the size of my fist.
not_available Nothing's open.
not_available Put him in Three.
not_available Pre
not_available op labs, blood cultures times two, soft tissue lateral to the neck.
not_available Three grams of Unasyn.
not_available Pulse ox is 85.
not_available He's barely moving any air.
not_available I saw this guy for a sore throat.
not_available Romano told me to turf him.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Needs a surgical airway.
not_available You ever do a crike? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, you're about to.
not_available Prep and drape the neck.
not_available Abby, can you open a Melker kit? What comes next? 
not_available The cricothyroid space.
not_available Do it.
not_available Can you leave right after this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm ready to go right now.
not_available Angle the needle at 45 degrees.
not_available Good.
not_available Because I don't wanna do this alone.
not_available Do what? 
not_available Aspirate air.
not_available Good, you're in.
not_available All the arrangements.
not_available Everything that has to be taken care of.
not_available Guide wire next.
not_available What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Where are you going? 
not_available To get Eric.
not_available What? 
not_available Needle out, 11 blade.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He called from a truck stop outside of Des Moines.
not_available Just enough to pass the introducer.
not_available Okay.
not_available When did this happen? 
not_available This afternoon.
not_available Oh, and I need you to write me a scrip for Depakote and Zyprexa.
not_available Introducer out.
not_available Okay, bag him.
not_available Sats are coming up.
not_available Nice work, Pratt.
not_available What's wrong? My grandmother died today.
not_available Just didn't wake up from her nap.
not_available Oh, Carter, I'm so sorry.
not_available No one told me.
not_available Hey, I got it.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Yeah, she called me, like, for three days.
not_available She was on some new committee.
not_available She wanted me to hear somebody speak about a wetlands learning center.
not_available She knew I hated that stuff.
not_available I think she just wanted to see me.
not_available Well, you spent more time with her than anybody.
not_available Then she called again last night.
not_available And I saw her number on the caller ID.
not_available And I just
not_available I didn't pick it up.
not_available Well, she lived a very full and happy life and you're a big part of that.
not_available She wasn't sick.
not_available She wasn't in pain.
not_available She was in her own bed.
not_available It's not a bad way to go.
not_available And I'll be back tonight.
not_available The flight's only an hour.
not_available Do you have to go? I mean, my dad's flying in.
not_available I gotta do all the funeral arrangements.
not_available I just
not_available I have to go get him.
not_available Why? I mean, Eric's been gone for weeks.
not_available What's one more day? He's off his meds.
not_available And if I don't go now, he might disappear again.
not_available I'll be back tonight.
not_available John.
not_available Go.
not_available Go find your brother.
not_available My grandmother will still be dead when you get back.
not_available What should I tell Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available That she's welcome.
not_available And the least she can do is admit this patient to Surgical ICU.
not_available Good God, it's the Stepford children.
not_available Where's your handler? He said you'd shepherd us the rest of the shift.
not_available Oh, isn't he generous with my life.
not_available Come on.
not_available Wean him down to 50 percent and check a gasWould you like to present some cases to the future of medicine? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available It's not a request.
not_available Okay, listen up.
not_available This is what happens when your chief forces you to clear beds at the cost of proper examination.
not_available Even a sore throat can result in a near mortality.
not_available Now, this particular patient came in complaining of odynophagia.
not_available It hurts to swallow.
not_available I checked this guy's throat.
not_available See, posterior pharynx looks benign.
not_available But when pain is out of proportion to exam, one must visualize the epiglottis either with a lateral xray or looking down the throat with a fiberoptic scope or a right
not_available angled mirror.
not_available Can't help it if the guy's a wimp.
not_available Epiglottitis is a pediatric illness, junior.
not_available Maybe back in the day.
not_available But we tend to see it in adults now more and more.
not_available If one takes the time to look for it.
not_available I had to crike this guy.
not_available Well, good for you.
not_available Don't ever do this.
not_available Get out, now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Move.
not_available Move, now! Move! What's the matter with you? Get out of here.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You just bought yourself a month of midnights.
not_available Move.
not_available Good.
not_available I love the nightlife.
not_available Where's your friend? Dr.
not_available Horvat left.
not_available I heard Romano had her doing surgery in the trauma room.
not_available She drained an abscess.
not_available It wasn't a big deal.
not_available Unless there are complications.
not_available I think you may have gotten the wrong impression today in Exam Four 
not_available when you were looking for Carter.
not_available You mean with the flight nurse? Chuck.
not_available And technically we're married.
not_available Oh, so it's technically okay to boff your husband in the hospital? 
not_available We weren't boffing.
not_available We were talking.
not_available Good night, Susan.
not_available It's not the same as a patient's mother.
not_available Hey, at least I used an empty room.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What are you still doing here? I'm picking up my dad at the airport before I go home.
not_available Good.
not_available Do you remember any genetic disorders that cause a buildup of ethylene glycol? Not offhand.
not_available But if it's not in Harrison's it probably doesn't exist.
not_available There are hundreds of rare ailments that fall under glycogen storage diseases amino acid disorders, metabolism
not_available Try a Medline search for substances that give you a false positive for ethylene glycol.
not_available Might get lucky.
not_available You went pretty long and hard on that guy earlier.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I figured it was the least I could do.
not_available He was dying.
not_available If you need to take a couple days
not_available I'm not on until Saturday.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good.
not_available Crash resuscitation means lines, tubes, fluids ASAP.
not_available Like, now.
not_available In a real case, you'd have a minute.
not_available Make a threecentimeter incision in the fifth intercostal space, mid
not_available axillary line.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I am teaching.
not_available Give it all you got.
not_available Stop.
not_available Aim for the ipsilateral nipple while you keep aspirating.
not_available Somebody broke his ribs doing CPR.
not_available He needs chest tubes and volume for hypotension.
not_available Could've bagged his spleen.
not_available So do an ultrasound.
not_available Look, you coded him for 35 minutes.
not_available He's brain dead.
not_available He'll arrest in the next four hours.
not_available No next of kin.
not_available Might as well get the maximum student benefit.
not_available Run in 500 cc's.
not_available No, I said stop.
not_available I'm about to cannulate
not_available Everybody get out.
not_available This is a patient, not a cadaver lab.
not_available Look, you need to go home
not_available Get the hell out of here right now.
not_available I wasn't sure you'd come.
not_available I wasn't sure you'd be here.
not_available What's going on? Traveling.
not_available You know.
not_available Here, there.
not_available Visiting old friends.
not_available Just trying to reconnect and keep in touch.
not_available Not with me.
not_available Not with Maggie.
not_available You know that guy? 
not_available No, do you? Does he look familiar to you? He's been looking at me like he knows me.
not_available No.
not_available They all have.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Did you notice when you walked in? This is a weird place, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm glad you came.
not_available I don't know this area.
not_available This is a strange part of the countryAbout ready to get out of here? 
not_available I need to pay for my coffee.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't have any money.
not_available Don't tell me your HMO doesn't cover somebody to do that for you.
not_available You know what they say, you want something done right Is that why you thought you could perform surgery in the ER? Hey, it worked, didn't it? She's on dopamine and still febrile.
not_available The good news is we haven't had to intubate yet.
not_available She could've died.
not_available I still haven't ruled that out.
not_available It was a good call, Robert.
not_available Unfortunately, the drainage was incomplete.
not_available There were loculations you couldn't reach so I'll have to do an open laparotomy.
not_available Damn shame that you didn't catch it the first time.
not_available Subphrenic abscess is a surgical disease.
not_available They don't see it much here.
not_available Robert, I would've caught it if you'd let me.
not_available And she'd be cooling down on Zosyn before surgery.
not_available Now she's more of a mess than if you'd done nothing.
not_available Did that hurt? No, but I wish it had.
not_available How long's it been like this? 
not_available A few days.
not_available More than a few, I'd guess.
not_available I'm gonna pack the cavity with lodoform gauze.
not_available Is Gunn following this? Gunn, Plastics, Ortho, Hand and ID.
not_available Hyperbarics want me to try them next.
not_available What's after that? Witchcraft? Magnets? I'll try anything at this point.
not_available You know, at some point maybe
not_available What? It's nothing.
not_available Say it.
not_available "When the wound becomes life
not_available threatening because of gangrene or sepsis it may be in the patient's best interest to consider a definitive surgical cure.
not_available " Luka Kovac.
not_available Hey, John, it's me.
not_available I'm at a motel room at the airport because we missed our plane.
not_available And I'm sorry.
not_available I'm trying to get us on the first flight out tomorrow, and I'll try to call you later.
not_available Bye.
not_available Better? Better.
not_available Thanks for the clothes.
not_available Thank Carter.
not_available They're his.
not_available He also sent this.
not_available What is it? Depakote.
not_available This is my life now, isn't it? 
not_available It's up to you.
not_available We all thought you were dead, you know.
not_available Except for Mom, of course.
not_available She refused to believe it.
not_available She know you were coming? 
not_available Couldn't get in touch with her.
not_available For all I know, she's missing too.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available I know.
not_available It's a little funny.
not_available So, what happens now? We go home.
not_available Well, what about me? I don't wanna live like this.
not_available I can't keep doing this to you.
not_available You have to get into a program.
not_available Will you help me? Don't I always? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Where's your father? 
not_available He took a later flight.
not_available He'll land in a couple hours.
not_available Did my mother call? No.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Emerson was here earlier.
not_available He said you can call him tonight if you'd like.
not_available And Mr.
not_available Garrett called from the funeral home.
not_available He apologized for the delay.
not_available They didn't come yet? They should be here any minute.
not_available Can I get you something to eat? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Tea? No, I'm fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available She was a wonderful woman.
not_available Yes, she was.
