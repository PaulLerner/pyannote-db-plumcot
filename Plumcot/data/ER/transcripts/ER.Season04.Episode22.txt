
not_available ER Previously on ER Peter! Oh, hi, Lizzie.
not_available I think it's about time you and I had a little sit
not_available down.
not_available Is there a problem? Am I hearing jealousy? 
not_available I just that I think you're trouble.
not_available What about his heroin addiction? 
not_available It wasn't heroin.
not_available It was painkillers.
not_available I'll do an ultrarapid detox and end his addiction today.
not_available You're gonna keep him hiden here for 12 hours? I found Doug in Exam 4, detoxing this baby.
not_available What! You're gonna explain this to the Administration and the Executive Committee! You lied to me, Doug.
not_available You looked me right in the face and lied.
not_available "A Hole In The Heart" That's not fair.
not_available You wouldn't have let me do it.
not_available You couldn't monitor him! EKG, pulse ox, endtidal CO
not_available 2, and invasive BP.
not_available You never got consent.
not_available From his methadone
not_available chugging mom? DCFS would have followed through if you'd left it alone.
not_available His development is already stunted.
not_available Been expecting you.
not_available Your desk clerk just called.
not_available Admit orders? 
not_available None.
not_available Here's everything you need right there.
not_available Start him on labetalol titrate 0.5 q five minutes to a diastolic of 60.
not_available Alexander Babcock, pediatric anesthesiologist.
not_available Kerry Weaver, Acting Chief of ER.
not_available This is Josh McNeal, 7 months old
not_available The boy was born addicted to heroin.
not_available I put him on an ultrarapid detox.
not_available A couple have been done in the US.
not_available It's still an experimental procedure.
not_available BP's not bad, 150/90.
not_available This boy needs to be stabilized and put back on methadone until Administration and Legal reviews the case.
not_available What did you use to induce? 
not_available Ketamine and Narcan.
not_available Propofol's better.
not_available ER didn't have it.
not_available But we got it up here.
not_available D/C the ketamine and three mgs of propofol.
not_available Then 150 mics per kilo per minute.
not_available You're continuing with this? The approach seems medically reasonable.
not_available You cannot perform procedures on children without permission.
not_available It seems in the best interest of the child to complete what's been started.
not_available Who's the followthrough? 
not_available I am.
not_available I'm off work till tomorrow, so I'll stay.
not_available Your actions are totally irresponsible.
not_available You've broken every rule and regulation we have in the ER.
not_available What happens here won't change that.
not_available I want him to have a shot at life.
not_available I don't care about rules.
not_available I hope you also don't care about being an ER Pediatric Attending.
not_available You've given up any chance of that.
not_available Mark, 7:00.
not_available What? Seven o'clock.
not_available Rise and shine.
not_available Did you hear from the PICU about that baby? Haleh just went off duty.
not_available She didn't mention anything.
not_available Am I supposed to wake up Dr.
not_available Weaver? She stayed too? 
not_available Snoozing in Exam 4.
not_available Let her sleep.
not_available Come on, girls.
not_available Sweep, sweep, sweep! Randi's in my way! I'm supposed to be here! Curling? 
not_available We were inspired by Nagano.
not_available Three years and nine months left till Salt Lake City.
not_available These crazy white folk.
not_available You having a slumber party? No.
not_available Did you hear anything from Doug? No.
not_available Is that why you spent the night? I was nostalgic for my residency.
not_available I thought Carol was here.
not_available She is.
not_available But she's on a break.
not_available There's no new patients, why'd you wake me? 
not_available Haleh said 7:00.
not_available That was for Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I'll just get some breakfast.
not_available Can you call Anspaugh and find out his schedule? 
not_available I need a meeting with him soon.
not_available Okay.
not_available You didn't answer me.
not_available No idea how they got their names.
not_available The drinks go down so smoothly at the Velvet Lounge.
not_available I wouldn't know that.
not_available That's what this is about.
not_available I was drinking and you weren't.
not_available You know I don't drink.
not_available You think I drink too much.
not_available Damn it, we missed the 
7 10.
not_available We can get the next one and cross over at Madison.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I've gotta go to Carla's and pick up Reece for daycare.
not_available You always like this after a night out? What? We saw the whole show.
not_available We didn't need to stay for another set.
not_available I thought we were having a good time.
not_available We were.
not_available Until I made that song request.
not_available The look on your face There's some places that you go to listen to the music, just listen.
not_available So it's not like the pub where you can play darts nobody cares if you drink too much or put something stupid on the jukebox.
not_available I'm saying in a place like that, it wasn't cool.
not_available Well, if you ask me, being cool seems somewhat limiting.
not_available You taking this one? Yes, I think I will.
not_available I'll see you in there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why didn't you wake me? I have a meeting with Anspaugh.
not_available We woke up Dr.
not_available Greene by mistake.
not_available We just got two bounce
not_available back migraines.
not_available One's mine.
not_available A fractured clavicle, complaining of coldness to his hand.
not_available A suicidal guy with intention marks to his left wrist.
not_available Who else is on? Del Amico, Jeanie and Carter are coming.
not_available In other words, they're late.
not_available I'm the only one here.
not_available Why is that? Thank you, Lydia.
not_available I'll be right out.
not_available I thought you might want a refill.
not_available I just got one.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I hear it's supposed to rain.
not_available You want to talk about last night? 
not_available It's very serious what Doug did.
not_available You mean what we did, don't you? It's the nature of your job to assist a doctor when they ask you.
not_available I was there because I wanted to be.
not_available Not because Doug asked me.
not_available I'm sure you were.
not_available Doug can be pretty passionate about these kids.
not_available Oh, give me a little credit, Mark.
not_available You think I'm a fresh
not_available faced nursing student under the doctor's spell? I'm only saying that Legal and Administration are going over every detail of this case.
not_available I'd hate to see it reflect on your record.
not_available So you're saying I should fudge my involvement? Tell the truth.
not_available Tell them you were assisting a doctor.
not_available I insisted on being there because Doug was working in the best interest of the patient.
not_available And that's my job.
not_available Every bit as much as it is his.
not_available I gotta get back.
not_available We had our noses pressed on the glass.
not_available The tracks moved right beneath us.
not_available You've never done that before? 
not_available No.
not_available All you have to do is ask.
not_available Hi.
not_available John.
not_available Have you ever ridden in the front car of the El? With the driver? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Anna and Dr.
not_available Rosher just did.
not_available Max.
not_available Please.
not_available Max.
not_available Max.
not_available See you.
not_available That sounds exciting.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Max just asked the guy if we could.
not_available Pretty clever.
not_available Well, thank you, John.
not_available You'll give me that one.
not_available But maybe not the next.
not_available I gotta go pry a kid's leg out of a shopping cart.
not_available Call Maintenance.
not_available Bolt cutters'll do it.
not_available Right.
not_available Does feel cold.
not_available That's what I'm saying.
not_available It's the damnedest feeling.
not_available Nails are cyanotic, cap refill's poor and he barely has a radial pulse.
not_available Doesn't sound good.
not_available I want to get an ultrasound and an angiogram to rule out a blood clot which affects blood flow to your hand.
not_available Whatever you need to do.
not_available I've got great insurance.
not_available You get excellent care here even without it.
not_available Can I talk to you? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Can you get consent from Mr.
not_available Wass and schedule him? Okay.
not_available I have a call into Anspaugh's office to talk about Doug.
not_available I'm seeing him in a few minutes.
not_available We need to be involved.
not_available My meeting's about something that's been on his calendar for a while.
not_available I'll set up another for us two.
not_available Let me know the time.
not_available Don't worry, I will.
not_available Send home the rule
not_available out appy in 3 with the diagnosis of constipation.
not_available Is there a good trauma on its way? No.
not_available But this letter came down for you from Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available He's a weird little dude, isn't he? Did he drop this off himself? 
not_available No.
not_available It was his secretary, I think.
not_available Where is he now, do you know? It's not my job to keep track of stuff like that.
not_available On our way in he drank all of his juice without spilling.
not_available Go play.
not_available There you go.
not_available Is he pretty responsive to you these days? As responsive as a oneyear
not_available old can be.
not_available Why? Sometimes it's hard to get his attention.
not_available Have you had his hearing checked? What? 
not_available It's not a problem.
not_available Just things we notice.
not_available Reece.
not_available Reece.
not_available Come here, man.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available He seems pretty responsive to me.
not_available He probably gets distracted by all the other kids.
not_available Listen, Carla's gonna pick him up around 4, okay? Sure.
not_available That's fine, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Who's hiding? Who's hiding? Hi, Reece.
not_available Who are you playing with today, huh? I just feel so ridiculous.
not_available I never really meant to kill myself.
not_available So it wasn't just an accident? You see, my wife and I, we had a fight, you know? And So I went out to my workshop I brought a glass of orange juice with me and I dropped the glass and when it broke, there was a shard lying there and I just I was just so angry.
not_available So it was impulsive.
not_available It was stupid, is what it was.
not_available I worried my wife.
not_available Although it's nice to know she cares.
not_available This is Jeanie Boulet.
not_available I'm a Physician's Assistant.
not_available I'll suture up your cuts.
not_available Shouldn't be more than a few stitches.
not_available A Psychiatric Resident will speak to you.
not_available Oh, listen, I'm fine.
not_available Okay? This was just a mistake.
not_available I really don't need that.
not_available We're sure it was.
not_available But it's required in a case like this.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Give it more time.
not_available Kerry.
not_available Hi.
not_available We're finishing up.
not_available Doug called an emergency meeting to fill us in on Josh McNeal.
not_available I'm familiar with it.
not_available Because of the circumstances, I wanted to bring everyone up to speed.
not_available Doug has admitted to stepping over the line.
not_available But he prevented the baby from going home.
not_available Anesthesia and Pediatrics needed to be involved.
not_available And he needed to get the mother's consent.
not_available He wouldn't have gotten it if it meant losing her methadone.
not_available I knew Max was doing a feasibility study on ER Pediatrics.
not_available I didn't want to jeopardize that.
not_available I think it's still the best thing for County General.
not_available Doug, I don't want to minimize the ramifications of this.
not_available But thank you for coming forward.
not_available Sure.
not_available If you'll excuse me, I want to get to PICU.
not_available Doug, thanks.
not_available We'll talk.
not_available Don, I don't think I need to tell you that Doug's actions violated every policy we have regarding patient care.
not_available I know.
not_available And there'll be a full review and QA.
not_available It may not go so well for him.
not_available But I must say he's certainly there for his patients.
not_available I'm sorry this has eaten into our time.
not_available What is it that you wanted to talk to me about? Well, as you know, when David Morgenstern had his Ml last fall I took over as Acting Chief of Emergency Medicine.
not_available And you've done a fine job with the exception of that little Ellis West/Synergix fiasco.
not_available With Dr.
not_available Morgenstern having resigned, it seems appropriate for me to be Chief of ER.
not_available The department is running well, and we owe you many thanks for your efforts.
not_available Well, I think everyone's responded to my authority.
not_available So it's just a simple change in title.
not_available I'm glad you'd like to be considered for the position.
not_available We will be doing a national search for the best candidate.
not_available But I'm happy you're throwing your hat in the ring.
not_available A national search? 
not_available County policy, as I'm sure you know.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Don Anspaugh.
not_available How's he doing? Pretty stable.
not_available Turned off the propofol a half
not_available hour ago.
not_available When's Doug gonna extubate? I figured I'd give him a couple more minutes.
not_available Hey.
not_available I was in the middle of a pretty decent dream.
not_available Was I there? Big
not_available time.
not_available Did I do the right thing? Yeah.
not_available You did.
not_available Even if we both get fired for it? That would just be icing on the cake.
not_available Kit, you ready to extubate him? He's breathing spontaneously.
not_available Vitals? Afebrile, BP's stable 90/70.
not_available Suction cath.
not_available Okay, buddy.
not_available Prove us right.
not_available Get ready to bag him.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Pulse ox? Holding steady.
not_available 98 percent.
not_available Do you think he's gonna make it? Too soon to tell.
not_available Shirley, I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available He's not here.
not_available Do you have his schedule? 
not_available He's not here.
not_available He went to some headand
not_available neck conference in Costa Rica.
not_available He doesn't do headand
not_available neck.
not_available Maybe he wants to learn.
not_available Maybe he's just playing golf.
not_available So when's he due back? 
not_available Teresa does the travel scheduling.
not_available Lovely.
not_available Where can I find her? Right here.
not_available Except she's on a break.
not_available I wanted to inform you on a patient.
not_available He's a 7month
not_available old boy, addicted to heroin.
not_available His mom stole his methadone.
not_available You know? Doug briefed us with your Chief and some of the Pedes.
not_available There was a meeting? Kerry, I'm sure, can give you the highlights.
not_available Anspaugh seemed calm.
not_available But, man, if that had happened at CHoP Doug would've been fired.
not_available Anyway, I gotta go to chart hell.
not_available You seen Kerry? 
not_available No.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We're concerned you get angry in a self
not_available destructive way.
not_available Look, I know I should handle it better.
not_available Okay? And I will.
not_available But I really don't want to stay overnight.
not_available I'm not a crazy person.
not_available This was just stupid.
not_available I need to talk to you for a minute, Dr.
not_available Meyers.
not_available Excuse us a moment.
not_available He isn't staying? 
not_available I don't have a reason to keep him.
not_available I pulled up his old records.
not_available He's been here 3 times in the past year.
not_available Migraines, abdominal pain, back pain.
not_available Think he's drugseeking? 
not_available He wants help.
not_available Depression is not grounds for admission.
not_available Hell, that'd be half the city.
not_available He's released? He's responsive, doesn't seem suicidal or psychotic and he's willing to come in for a follow
not_available up.
not_available I wish we could do more.
not_available He's fighting with his wife, job isn't good
not_available I know; half the city.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Usually she's everywhere.
not_available Do you think it's too late to reconsider my ER residency? Oh, you getting bored? Oh, I just cleaned out an old guy's ears.
not_available And dislodging a 5yearold from a shopping cart
not_available Any unsickly patient is good.
not_available Stop complaining.
not_available By 9:00, I'd been puked on twice.
not_available I also did two bowel disimpactions.
not_available Do you want to answer the phones instead? Why don't you take the coma patient in 4.
not_available Paramedics have a double trauma.
not_available Double? Two Elvis impersonators crashed into Lake Michigan.
not_available Cool.
not_available Ooh.
not_available Maybe, Dr.
not_available Greene, I could 
not_available No, take the coma patient.
not_available Jeanie, Anna how about getting a handle on the "Elvi.
not_available " We got your Overthe
not_available Hill Elvis.
not_available Here's Junior Elvis.
not_available Parachuted out of a plane to land on a pier.
not_available Lines got tangled.
not_available Lake landing.
not_available But he's up there picking his pimples.
not_available Can't skydive to save his life.
not_available At least I can do Elvis.
not_available That's more than I can say for you.
not_available I was doing Elvis before you was even born.
not_available I'll be doing him after you're dead.
not_available Shall we? You need anticoagulation therapy in order to prevent any further clotting.
not_available In the hospital? 
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available There's a fairly new drug, enoxaparin which you inject under the skin in your abdomen twice a day.
not_available My wife could do that.
not_available You're an excellent candidate for it.
not_available Or you'd have to stay here for a few days
not_available I don't want to do that.
not_available I'll take the drug.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Kerry, I need to talk to you now.
not_available Sure.
not_available Nurse Jarvik will discharge you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available What do you got? Two jokers fell in the lake out of an airplane or something.
not_available That Doug Ross meeting happened this morning.
not_available It sure did.
not_available I asked specifically to be notified.
not_available Mark, nobody told me either.
not_available I just walked in on it.
not_available You could've mentioned it so I didn't have to hear about it third
not_available hand.
not_available I had patients.
not_available Give the bullet.
not_available I already did.
not_available Give it again.
not_available A Junior Elvis
not_available Jeanie, we've got this.
not_available Help Anna.
not_available Tell that wanna
not_available be his "Heartbreak Hotel" sucks the big one.
not_available Oriented and alert.
not_available Vitals normal.
not_available BP 120/70.
not_available Cap refill's fine.
not_available BP's high.
not_available 180/120.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Better here than in there.
not_available Those two make the Elvises sound like Boy Scouts.
not_available Spin a crit and dip a urine.
not_available Want a Chem
not_available 7? Sure.
not_available Why didn't they tell us? Why don't you ask your pal Doug? Do you think there'll be an inquiry? 
not_available Hopefully, Doug will let us know.
not_available Why're you angry at me? I didn't detox a baby and hide it.
not_available But giving him an inch, he gets away with a mile.
not_available So this is my fault? 
not_available It's not a question of fault.
not_available It's about style.
not_available You close your eyes and hope things will disappear.
not_available Here.
not_available When I try to come down firmly, you tell me to pull back you fight me and it'll disappear.
not_available It's not disappearing this time, is it? It's not the time or place to discuss this.
not_available Chuny, let's repeat a BP, please.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Lang, this is Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available How do you do, Mrs.
not_available Lang? I've just been going over your chart.
not_available I see your husband has
not_available I couldn't wake Bill up this morning.
not_available He was diagnosed 14 months ago with brainstem glioblastoma.
not_available They tried to do radiation therapy.
not_available But that didn't work.
not_available He's had some visual disturbances and some paralysis.
not_available But we were not expecting this.
not_available We'll do everything that we can.
not_available Let's order an MRl with gadolinium.
not_available Get in a Neurosurgery consult and the Oncology Fellow on call.
not_available I hope it's okay that we opened the window.
not_available Bill, he just loves the smell of the rain.
not_available That's fine, Mrs.
not_available Lang.
not_available Last time I complain about kids in shopping carts.
not_available What? 
not_available Never mind.
not_available Oh, hi, Adele.
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available This is Vicki McNeal.
not_available This is Josh McNeal's mother.
not_available Baby Josh, right.
not_available Hi.
not_available She'd like to see her son.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Randi, an audiologist is gonna call.
not_available An "audi"
not_available what? Hearing tests.
not_available Write it down.
not_available But we've got an MVA coming in.
not_available A Mazda versus a milk truck.
not_available I'm just signing charts.
not_available But I can't find Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Upstairs says she's checking out Costa Rica.
not_available What? 
not_available That's what I said.
not_available About the MVA? Oh, damn it.
not_available Dumar, what do we have? 
not_available Sam Wiser, 32.
not_available Head
not_available on TC.
not_available Head, neck and abdominal trauma.
not_available Did she ask about consent? 
not_available I don't know what Adele told her.
not_available Ms.
not_available McNeal.
not_available Is he gonna be all right? Well, he's stable.
not_available His blood pressure's holding steady.
not_available He's sleepy.
not_available But it's expected after a prolonged sedation and intubation.
not_available Intubation? A tube down his throat to help him breathe.
not_available He was asleep while they did it.
not_available I explained to Vicki about the ultrarapid detox.
not_available How the drugs'll be out of his system.
not_available So he'll be able to sit up like other kids.
not_available We believe he'll be able to catch up.
not_available The procedure went well.
not_available We just have to wait and see.
not_available So what I wanted to know then, Dr.
not_available Ross, is could you do the same thing for me? I'm gonna kill you! Why? You offered.
not_available You get my patty melt? Yes, I got your patty melt.
not_available Hey, will you help this gentleman? He's looking for Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Sir? Can I help you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Wass, what are you doing back? 
not_available I couldn't get the enoxaparin.
not_available It's $500.
not_available My insurance won't cover it.
not_available They'll only cover something called heparin or Coumadin.
not_available Coumadin.
not_available I should be on that? You need to be hospitalized for those.
not_available I'll call the insurance company.
not_available Can you get Mr.
not_available Wass' insurance information and put a call in, please? Carol, you know, I had a meeting with Dr.
not_available Anspaugh this morning.
not_available There will be an executive committee review of the Josh McNeal case.
not_available Doug told me.
not_available It'd be in your best interest to document your participation while it's still fresh.
not_available Oh, that experience isn't going away anytime soon.
not_available You should hope neither you nor Doug Ross is either.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? Mr.
not_available Wass' insurance? Thank you.
not_available Yeah, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I don't want the claims department.
not_available I need a medical supervisor.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Lang? MRl is backed up.
not_available It'll be a little while longer.
not_available I've got Nurse Hathaway checking.
not_available He is gonna wake up, isn't he? His doctors thought we had longer.
not_available We really won't know anything until we get those test results back.
not_available Is there a phone here? I want to call my daughter.
not_available She's a freshman in college.
not_available Tulane Drama School.
not_available She didn't want to go because of her dad.
not_available But Bill, he insisted.
not_available He said that it was enough that his life was being put on hold.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe we made a mistake.
not_available Looks like an avocado.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available You were on trauma call when Mr.
not_available Wiser was brought in.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton was kind enough to cover while I was away.
not_available You've reviewed the chart? 
not_available Avulsed gallbladder.
not_available Can I get some suction here, please? Let's say you find a significant pancreatic injury.
not_available Crushed duodenum and common bile duct.
not_available What are you going to do? A Whipple, which as you know I performed solo back in England prior to my fellowship.
not_available Yes.
not_available I think I did know that.
not_available Speaking of fellowships, can I ask you about the possibility of sponsorship for next year.
not_available What about Dr.
not_available Romano? It seems Dr.
not_available Romano doesn't wish to continue with me.
not_available What? He served me notice today.
not_available And he's unavailable at some headand
not_available neck conference in Costa Rica.
not_available It's too late to arrange another fellowship at County General.
not_available We're past application deadlines.
not_available I was hoping for individual consideration since I've spent a year here.
not_available The committee always seems to frown on that.
not_available You really want to stay in the US? 
not_available Very much so, yes.
not_available If it's staying in America, you could marry an American.
not_available Shirley.
not_available Sorry, Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available Your guidelines are wrong.
not_available He needs anticoagulation therapy.
not_available And he doesn't need to be admitted.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available What is it? The renal failure guy's here.

not_available It's not capturing.
not_available You did come with him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I drop by his house every week.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Lang? Your husband's MRl results are done.
not_available The tumor is blocking his It's a blockage that's increasing intracranial pressure.
not_available And that's causing the coma? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So can it be unblocked? Yes.
not_available A neurosurgeon can perform a ventriculostomy.
not_available So Bill could come out of this? He could.
not_available The outcome is problematic.
not_available Your husband would have very little time.
not_available And it may cause him a great deal of pain.
not_available He would most likely die of respiratory failure.
not_available But Bill would wake up? I mean, I could talk to him again and he could hear me? Yes.
not_available Or he could stay the way he is now and die peacefully.
not_available She wants to handle the funeral? 
not_available He has no family.
not_available What's her relationship? 
not_available Friend.
not_available She looks like a hooker.
not_available She is.
not_available She's been "attending" him twice a week.
not_available Did you say he had a Foley catheter? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Excuse me, Miss? 
not_available Myra.
not_available Miss Myra.
not_available I wonder if you could tell me exactly what happened.
not_available I've been seeing Mr.
not_available Palmieri twice a week for the past couple of years.
not_available It wasn't a lot of money.
not_available But then I was only providing manual relief.
not_available But today my bracelet here got caught on that little tube.
not_available When I pulled back, it popped out.
not_available The next thing I know is, there's blood everywhere.
not_available So I called 911 right away.
not_available I see.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, some insurance company's on the phone.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I say give her the body.
not_available You were here a little while ago talking to Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you seen a vial of Percocet? I lost it around the drug lock
not_available up.
not_available No, I haven't.
not_available But I'll keep my eyes open.
not_available there's always a pile of these.
not_available Now I gotta pore over these.
not_available Went through the last two weeks.
not_available You guys do a lot of kids.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available I haven't much time right now.
not_available I'm trying to catch Langstaff.
not_available Langstaff? I've heard she isn't too keen on her Fellow.
not_available Thinking of letting him go.
not_available I want to get a word in.
not_available Well, shouldn't you wait to see if she does let him go? I want to let her know I'm available.
not_available And desperate.
not_available Excuse me? I mean, asking Dr.
not_available Anspaugh in the middle of an operation? 
not_available He didn't seem put off.
not_available Why're you? 
not_available I'm not put off.
not_available If it's about me hanging you up, I'm sorry.
not_available I appreciate you covering.
not_available I wasn't hung up.
not_available Yeah I would've appreciated a page letting me know about Romano's letter.
not_available Look, I would have discussed it with you.
not_available Romano was my first priority.
not_available That bastard didn't even give me a reason.
not_available He's not required to.
not_available He sponsored you.
not_available I mean, it's his call.
not_available You're taking this in stride.
not_available It's not necessarily about you.
not_available It's very much about me.
not_available You don't know how hard I worked to get here.
not_available I do know what it takes.
not_available Then why aren't you being supportive? You're doing it the wrong way.
not_available You're running all over, asking every surgeon to sponsor you.
not_available So, what do you suggest? You haven't checked out other hospitals, other parts of the country.
not_available I've built up relationships here.
not_available Or so I thought.
not_available I'm not saying I want you to leave Chicago.
not_available No.
not_available But you're not passionate about my fight to stay.
not_available Whatever goes on between us
not_available Peter.
not_available You ready to scrub on that small bowel infarction? Yes, sir.
not_available Please let me finish.
not_available You understand that admitting the patient
not_available I need you to sign.
not_available I'm not working.
not_available These are from yesterday.
not_available I'm not working.
not_available Josh McNeal is doing much better.
not_available You didn't tell me about the meeting
not_available No! I mean, your policy is not sound, Dr.
not_available Stork.
not_available It's obscene.
not_available I mean, you're spending 10,000 to save 500! Then so be it! I will admit Mr.
not_available Wass to this hospital! And I look forward to billing you for every damn dime we can possibly spend! 
not_available Admit Mr.
not_available Wass.
not_available Want me to call them? 
not_available That'll help.
not_available I don't know what helps anymore.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Because I quit.
not_available What? I quit as Acting Chief of Emergency.
not_available Let somebody else "act.
not_available " Wait.
not_available Why am I the only idiot who's worrying about policy? Doug's got the right idea.
not_available Break the rules if it helps the patient.
not_available Everything else be damned! Where do I get by trying to follow them? 
not_available Look, Kerry, wait.
not_available No! 
not_available If anybody needs me, I'm outside.
not_available Cool.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Getting some air? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need it after my last case.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available I was just talking to Lydia Wright.
not_available And she mentioned to me that some Percocet's been missing from the drug lock
not_available up.
not_available That's low, Carter.
not_available Hey, I'm not accusing anybody.
not_available You're my friend.
not_available I want you to know.
not_available Well, Max is clean.
not_available Well, maybe he is.
not_available But
not_available But what? That's what Chase used to say to me.
not_available I gotta get back.
not_available Vitals are stable.
not_available The boy's alert.
not_available You got your next journal article.
not_available Right after they draw and quarter me in front of the committee.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We don't always get results this good up here.
not_available I'm going to go check on the Yezerski kid.
not_available What will happen? Back to his mother? Who knows? I gave her a list of names of doctors who do ultrarapid detox on adults.
not_available But it doesn't change the psychological addiction.
not_available At least she's trying.
not_available Come on, buddy.
not_available I was just coming to look for you.
not_available You knocking off already? Going to St.
not_available Mark's to see how their unit's doing.
not_available When you off? 
not_available Seven.
not_available Want to get dinner at Johnny D's? Yeah, sure.
not_available Feeling good about getting through those charts? Yeah, it'll be a week or two before I can get a report out.
not_available If you can stand to have me around that long.
not_available What's your recommendation? What happens when I recommend in favor of an ER Pedes Department is they ask me to run it.
not_available I've always said no.
not_available But this time I could be convinced to say yes.
not_available You mean stay in Chicago? 
not_available Only if you want me to.
not_available Wow.
not_available I hadn't really thought that far ahead.
not_available Heard some Percocet was missing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I heard that too.
not_available I didn't take it.
not_available I didn't suspect that you did.
not_available You'd be crazy not to.
not_available I didn't want to suspect that you did, anyway.
not_available Don't feel bad about it.
not_available I know I've used up all my free passes with you.
not_available But I'm telling you the truth.
not_available And I'm willing to prove it.
not_available Every day.
not_available It's not that I don't believe you.
not_available It's justAnna? 
not_available Labs are back on that Ml.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available All right, go.
not_available Be a doctor.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Sure.
not_available Where's Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Lang? Mark signed a transfer to White Memorial.
not_available Why White Memorial? 
not_available Maybe his doctor's there.
not_available Will they do the ventriculostomy? 
not_available She didn't say.
not_available Did you tell her there wasn't much they could do? Just would've liked to know what she chose.
not_available Why? 
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available Just seems unsettled.
not_available Unfinished.
not_available We never know about people when they leave.
not_available You haven't seen Anna around, have you? No.
not_available There it goes again.
not_available What? That car alarm.
not_available It keeps starting up and shutting off, and starting up.
not_available Annoying.
not_available It's in the ambulance bay.
not_available I called Security.
not_available But who knows where they ever are? Mark, Kerry, this is the action report on Josh McNeal.
not_available Like maybe why you lied to me? 
not_available You didn't understand.
not_available You didn't give me a chance.
not_available Take it outside.
not_available We got work to do.
not_available If you're no longer Acting Chief, who do I give these budget reviews to? I'll take them.
not_available This kid was more important.
not_available You always have a patient excuse.
not_available I'm willing to go out on a limb.
not_available You took the whole tree with you.
not_available I was trying to support you.
not_available To be the Pedes Attending? You weren't going to support me.
not_available We'll never know now, because you did what you always do.
not_available When you're about to get what you want, you sabotage it.
not_available Is that what you're so angry about? 
not_available I'm not angry.
not_available I'm disappointed.
not_available You like that.
not_available It validates that you're the adult and I'm the screw
not_available up.
not_available You never wanted to grow up.
not_available You like it this way.
not_available We hang out, but you're the boss.
not_available For good reason, based on your actions.
not_available Based on your inability to see me as an equal, Mark.
not_available Bad enough Kerry stepped up.
not_available I support her.
not_available On the surface.
not_available Underneath, you resented her.
not_available Like you resent what I did with Josh.
not_available Where's Mark? He needs to sign this.
not_available He and Dr.
not_available Ross are outside "sharing.
not_available " Mr.
not_available Nable? What are you doing here? Mr.

not_available You just sit down right here.
not_available That's my car.

not_available I don't know why.
