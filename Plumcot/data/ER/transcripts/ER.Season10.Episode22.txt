not_available Yeah, DNR, but he wants antibiotics.
not_available Sir, it's entirely possible these symptoms are due to your colon cancer.
not_available Antibiotics will do nothing to help that.

not_available Yo, doc, you got an office somewhere? Me? We don't really have a doctor.

not_available Not in tamponade.
not_available I know.
not_available Hey! Open up! You' re home early.

not_available Dad said it was okay.
not_available Well, it's not exactly his call, is it? 
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available Later.
not_available I'll speak to you soon.
not_available Can I speak with you a minute? You can't do this.
not_available You can't pull him out of school when you feel like it.
not_available I wanted to take the kid with me
not_available You' re high.
not_available What? You smoked dope in front of him? No, I went outside.
not_available I took a few rips when he was watching TV.
not_available And it's no big deal, okay? 
not_available Maybe not to you, but to me it is.
not_available The reason I kept him out was I wanted to take himWhere? To an arcade or a movie? Or your dealer's house? 
not_available To my interview, okay? Interview.

not_available So now I'm being penalized for not having a big family? This is a conservative judge.
not_available Her idea of what represents the best interests to the family is pretty 
basic two parents, a man and a woman.
not_available Unless she's planning to take the children of every single parent in Chicago and place them with a heterosexual couple, she's a hypocrite.
not_available I don't disagree.
not_available It's a myth.
not_available This idea that there's some perfect setting that everyone gets raised in.
not_available You need to outline how you' re gonna provide a stable, consistent lifestyle for him.
not_available They brought him.
not_available Sit back down.
not_available If you interact, it could get volatile, and that's not gonna help you in court.
not_available He's grown.
not_available You okay in here? Who was that guy? He's just some guy who had a business proposition for me.
not_available Look, Sam, just so you know, I wasn't planning on staying, okay.
not_available It just all kind of fell into my lap which makes me think it was supposed to happen.
not_available You know, this manager job is no great shakes but it'll keep me here and, I don't know maybe I can go to night school or something.
not_available You know what Alex said to me the other day? What? He said, " I love you, Dad.
not_available " Anyways I've got a bunch of furniture with a buddy in Dallas and I figure I'd leave today, and come back maybe this weekend.

not_available Sam.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm gonna take off.

not_available You have to stay in bed.
not_available Need to use the restroom.
not_available But you' re dehydrated, and your blood pressure is low.
not_available Let me get you a bedpan.

not_available I'm here.
not_available Yeah, only because you' re paid to be.
not_available More laps and suction.
not_available BP's down to 78/40.
not_available Ligate the femoral proximal to the popliteal artery.
not_available I can't control the damn SMA bleeder.
not_available Periosteum's shredded up to the midshaft, and the perforating arteries are gone.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, you came after all.
not_available How is she? On a scale of one to 10, probably a four.
not_available Repaired the spleen, still oozing from the liver.
not_available Maxed out on dopa and Levo.
not_available Make that a three.
not_available Anything I can do? 
not_available There's barely anything I can do.
not_available Perry, start neo at 100 mics per minute.
not_available That'll screw up her distal perfusion.
not_available Yes, well, the brain and heart outrank the extremities, don't they? 
not_available This is crazy.

not_available Somebody needs to talk to his dad.
not_available Well, think! I don't know! Another epi? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Pulseless.
not_available I'm calling it.
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available Wait, wait, okay.
not_available We' re pumping air in faster than the chest tube can suck it out.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Bypass the left.
not_available Stick it all down the right lung.
not_available He's lacerated his left mainstem bronchus.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available Even if he did, he's been deprived of oxygen too long.
not_available Just give it 10 seconds.
not_available Okay, hold compressions.
not_available Got a pulse back, 82.
not_available Sats coming up.
not_available Okay, call CT and Surg.
not_available Let's redline him upstairs.
not_available We saved him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pryor? We think your son has a tear in his airway and is gonna need surgery.
not_available But he's gonna be okay? The injury's very serious, but we hope to be able to fix it.

not_available Just that she's in the O.
not_available R.
not_available Someone can take you to the waiting room.
not_available Can I be with her? 
not_available Well, she is being operated on.
not_available She'd want me there.
not_available Dr.

not_available No, not really.
not_available It's about Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available Can you give me a second? Can you just have a seat right there? Yeah, did she seem okay to you? No, neither one of us are having our best day.
not_available Why? 
not_available There's this bruise on her face.
not_available I saw it.
not_available She says it was an accident.
not_available I don't know.
not_available She seeing somebody? I don't think so.
not_available She's focused on her dad.
not_available Think it was him? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Probably.
not_available Look, I'd get into it myself, but things are complicated between us.
not_available I don't think that she'll listen to me
not_available Pratt, your DUI homeboy's back from CT.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So looks like in addition to being high on H, you were also legally drunk too.
not_available How you think your boy out there is gonna feel? You know what he says to me? What? He said because it's my third strike, I'm gonna have to do 25to
not_available life.
not_available I'm 20 years old, doc.
not_available You hit a woman and a kid.
not_available Yeah, but life? What, you think that's right? I think it's the law.
not_available Hey.
not_available Lido and a 4
not_available 0 Vicryl.
not_available I ain't got nothing nowhere anyway.
not_available I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do? I don't know, go to school, get a job maybe.

not_available I guess that makes you one lucky son of a
not_available Hey! It ain't about luck.
not_available You know what? You right.
not_available It ain't about luck.
not_available I guess it's about not looking back once you' re gone.
not_available Doc.
not_available Mom? When are you making dinner? Mom? 
not_available I'll deal with the clothes.
not_available You put all the stuff that you wanna keep in these.
not_available What? 
not_available We' re moving.
not_available No! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available I don't wanna go.
not_available You don't exactly have a choice.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available I like it here.
not_available Yeah, so did I.
not_available You're just being a bitch.
not_available What did you call me? I'm sick of moving because you' re screwed up.
not_available You know what I'm sick of, Alex? I'm sick of pretending your dad is a good guy.
not_available I'm sick of keeping quiet about the crap he's done and the stuff that he hasn't.
not_available I'm sick of him tracking us down every time he loses a job so he can buy you presents to make you think he's actually a father because he's not.
not_available He's a user, a loser and I am not gonna let him turn you into one.
not_available Now get your ass in that room and start packing! Last one.
not_available Cover with ABD pads.
not_available I'll write post
not_available op notes.
not_available So you saw the whole thing happen? 
not_available Yeah, her car broke down.
not_available I stopped to help.
not_available She's lucky.
not_available Most people would've carried on driving.
not_available We've got an audience.
not_available Must be the husband.
not_available I'll go talk to him.
not_available How soon before she wakes up? 
not_available That's hard to say.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pryor? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I was with your wife at the scene of the accident and during her surgery.
not_available I'm gonna check back in with you later.
not_available Is she gonna be all right? She suffered massive internal injuries, and she lost a lot of blood.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available But we were able to stop the bleeding and we' re confident that she's gonna pull through.
not_available But her legs were severely injured and orthopedic surgeons were not able to salvage them.
not_available What? 
not_available We had to amputate.
not_available In both legs? I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah, I took it a couple weeks ago.
not_available Lockhart, Abigail.
not_available I mean, I should've gotten them by now, right? Aren't you supposed to send them to my home address? 
not_available We sent them to your work address.
not_available You' re kidding.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Hey, Frank.
not_available If I received a letter here, would you tell me? Hell, no.

not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for a patient.
not_available Last name, Gould.
not_available Let's see if he's awake.

not_available I mean, I told my parents in third grade that I wanted to be a doctor and ever since then, it's been assumed.
not_available It's a good thing I never said I wanted to join the circus.
not_available I don't think I can do it.
not_available I've been thinking about it the whole way here and for the last year, actually, and
