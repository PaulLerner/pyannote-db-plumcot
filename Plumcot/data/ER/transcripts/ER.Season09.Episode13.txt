not_available No leak.
not_available The posterior cutaneous nerve runs next to the artery.
not_available It's easy to cut both.
not_available And the head bone's connected to the what again? Would you like me to scrub in to check? No.
not_available It would be a shame for him to come for an abscess and have a dropped foot from a severed sciatic nerve.
not_available You' re right.
not_available Look, I just figured out a way you can help me.
not_available Leave.
not_available Labs are back.
not_available This is Sydney's friend Fiona.
not_available What did she take? 
not_available She didn't.
not_available Tox screen's negative for everything.
not_available Did you find any pill fragments? 
not_available No.
not_available Looks like nuts and cherries, maybe.
not_available I smell chocolate.
not_available Her boyfriend cheated on her.
not_available She went on a banana
not_available split spree.
not_available So you called 911? I didn't.
not_available She did.
not_available She wanted to get her stomach pumped.
not_available She must have ate, like, 50,000 calories.
not_available Sometimes she binges and purges.
not_available Sometimes? She's lost her gag reflex from sticking a finger down her throat so many times.
not_available Obviously she has an eating disorder.
not_available I'll tell you what an eating disorder is.
not_available When a mother hasn't eaten in six days because she's giving what food she has to her three children.
not_available She just cost the hospital $3000, and for what? So she doesn't put on a pound? Luka It's cheaper than liposuction.
not_available Did you know him? Was he a friend of yours? What are you doing in here? 
not_available Came to check in on Leon.
not_available Couldn't find his chart.
not_available I'm working on it.
not_available Need any help? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't mind.
not_available He seems kind of shaken up about Biz.
not_available That was your friend's name, right? Biz? Could you excuse us, please? This is between me and my patient.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why don't you come find me when you' re done? Did you tell him you knew Biz? No.
not_available If I did, it was an accident.
not_available An accident? It's always an accident with you, isn't it, Leon? I'm telling you the truth, G.
not_available You told me a security guard shot him.
not_available It wasn't a security guard.
not_available It was a cop.
not_available I didn't look.
not_available It happened really fast.
not_available Did you have a gun? 
not_available It was Biz's idea.
not_available Did you shoot at the police? I don't know! I don't
not_available Maybe.
not_available I don't remember, G.
not_available Everybody just started shooting.
not_available I'm sorry, G.
not_available Please, I don't wanna go to jail! Don't let them put me in jail, G.
not_available I'm sorry, G.
not_available I don't wanna go to jail.
not_available I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you're having a bad day? I'm tired of treating patients who think ice cream is an emergency.
not_available I'm just tired of it.
not_available I think maybe you should talk to him.
not_available He seems a little depressed.
not_available He's European.
not_available That's his baseline.
not_available I'm still mad at him for putting that "adventure doctor" idea into Carter's head.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hennesey in Exam 1 can go home.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available How's the cop? Good.
not_available He's gonna be fine.
not_available So this is where you hide out.
not_available Hi.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, right? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Dorset? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Is something wrong with Mr.
not_available Sutter? He's fine.
not_available I was wondering if you wanted to grab some coffee or something.
not_available I appreciate the offer.
not_available To be honest, I'm swamped at the moment, so 
not_available Right.
not_available Perhaps some other time.
not_available I'm gonna hold you to that.
not_available I like coffee.
not_available He's cute.
not_available Was I rude? 
not_available No.
not_available Look, the problem is that I go home half expecting Mark to be playing with Ella in the backyard.
not_available It's been a long time since I, you know, talked to another man.
not_available I think I overreacted.
not_available It was only coffee.
not_available I think Mark would want you to get on with your life.
not_available I also think if a good
not_available looking guy is interested in you and you' re not interested in him the least you can do is introduce me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm not kidding.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hughes? Where you going? Let's get you back this way, okay? Now, you' re supposed to be 
not_available Looks like you've got your hands full.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available John Bright.
not_available She has Alzheimer's.
not_available Oh, poor thing.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hughes, let's get you back in bed, okay? Your daughter will be here in a minute.
not_available Could you please? I guess I owe you a very big thank
not_available you.
not_available You provide an invaluable service.
not_available It's the least I could do.
not_available I just hope that we earned the allocation based on merit as a healthcare provider for the community.
not_available Had I not been brought here, Dr.
not_available Weaver I probably would not have pushed for County to get the additional funding.
not_available Did you give me special treatment? Well, I
not_available Of course, you did.
not_available From what I've seen, you give everyone special treatment.
not_available And that kind of dedication deserves to be rewarded.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Somebody dropped this off, made me promise to give it to you personally.
not_available I'm thinking nude blackmail photos.
not_available Not again.
not_available Is this because of McNulty? 
not_available What? You leaving, going to a foreign land to bring medicine to the natives.
not_available Because he lives in the back of a free clinic you don't do enough? 
not_available Maybe it's got something to do with it.
not_available Why didn't you talk to me about this? 
not_available I'm not going right now.
not_available You talked to Luka about it.
not_available Even if I was, it's for two weeks.
not_available Some of these places are dangerous.
not_available I thought you forgot me.
not_available You need to go back on insulin.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Thirty NPH in the morning, 15 in the evening, same as before.
not_available And you need to check your sugars four times a day.
not_available I'd be lucky to find four times during the week to do that.
not_available Maybe you can hire an assistant.
not_available Or find the time to remind yourself.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Check.
not_available I can see that.
not_available But I can't take it.
not_available Why not? Well, for one thing, it's got too many zeros.
not_available Get some new equipment.
not_available Hire a nurse.
not_available Hire a physician's assistant.
not_available I don't have to name the place after you, do I? 
not_available No.
not_available Although "The Carter Family Clinic" does have kind of a nice ring to it.
not_available Thank you, John.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available How'd you like to come work for me, beautiful? Do you have a dental plan? 
not_available No, I'm not giving you any time off.
not_available I have sick days.
not_available Are you kidding? You' re lucky you still have a job.
not_available I need time to sort things out.
not_available Yeah, I agree, and you need to do it on your own time.
not_available Wait.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, can I get some help? 
not_available No.
not_available Steven Rafferty, 65, with chest pain, partially relieved by nitro.
not_available Get a 12
not_available lead titrate, Sir, can you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 what your pain level is? Luka.
not_available He seems pissed.
not_available Been here almost two hours.
not_available I figured you couldn't go that long without a cigarette.
not_available What are you doing here? Thank you.
not_available Sure you don't want something to eat? 
not_available I'm fine, thanks.
not_available Good, I need the gas money.
not_available How's Carter? 
not_available He's good.
not_available I like him.
not_available Me too.
not_available It was the disease.
not_available I was scared.
not_available I was afraid that I was gonna end up like Mom.
not_available I didn't want you to see me like that.
not_available Like Maggie.
not_available I never meant to hurt you.
not_available If it wasn't for you, I don't know where I'd be.
not_available It wasn't your fault.
not_available You couldn't help it.
not_available It's just You protected me for so long.
not_available I felt like I'd let you down.
not_available That's not true.
not_available That could never be true.
not_available I just wish sometimes I was 8 years old again.
not_available Because even when things got bad and they got bad, I knew you'd always be there.
not_available And I always will be.
not_available Yeah, but no one's ever there for you.
not_available And I turned my back on you after everything that you did for me and for Mom.
not_available It was a really crappy thing to do.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't have to apologize.
not_available I do.
not_available I want to.
not_available I love you, Abby.
not_available You deserve a better family.
not_available And I just wanted you to know that I'm okay.
not_available Unfortunately I had to get bad before I got better.
not_available It's not over, you know.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Wanna see a picture of my new girlfriend? Sure.
not_available What do you think? It's a plane.
not_available Yeah, I bought it.
not_available Sold my car, my bike, just about everything.
not_available I'm gonna run hunting and fishing charters in Wisconsin.
not_available You' re going to be a bush pilot? Pretty cool, huh? It's probably just a mild virus that'll go away on its own.
not_available I'm going to send off some more blood work so you'll need to follow up with your family doctor, okay? Hey, Susan, you up for dinner? No, I am going home, and I'm going to take a three
not_available hour bath.
not_available Come on, you can do that after dinner.
not_available I know this great new Thai place.
not_available Oh, Jing
not_available Mei, thank you.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available So? I was using the Wood's lamp today when I was wearing your sweater.
not_available And some stuff showed up on it.
not_available Like what? Stains on your sweater.
not_available It's none of my business.
not_available I thought you might just want to get it dry
not_available cleaned.
not_available It was club soda.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah, Susan.
not_available I opened up a can this morning, and it sprayed all over me.
not_available That's why I had to take off the sweater, to let it dry.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh.
not_available Club soda.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Soda water glows under black lights, remember? Good.
not_available I just thought
not_available I don't know What, you thought that I'm this ER slut with spunk all over her sweater? No, no.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei Somebody claim that body? No.
not_available I heard the cop's gonna be okay.
not_available Good.
not_available Pratt.
not_available What do you want from me? I just wanna help you.
not_available Or at least prevent you from getting yourself into trouble.
not_available I'm not in trouble.
not_available What about Leon? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, he seemed pretty scared today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's a scared little kid.
not_available Except he's not a little kid.
not_available He's 27, and he was probably involved in a robbery that left a cop shot and somebody else dead.
not_available I think the cops are probably gonna blame this on Biz.
not_available If Leon went away for a while I doubt anybody would go looking for him.
not_available You know what? I try to keep him out of trouble.
not_available But he wants to have his own friends.
not_available He wants to be cool.
not_available And they talk him into doing stuff.
not_available I can't watch him every minute of the day.
not_available I can't.
not_available You gotta learn to let go.
not_available Stop blaming yourself.
not_available Tell Leon I said goodbye.
not_available Gallant.
not_available I need you to do me a favor.
not_available What do you say we go to dinner tonight? Someplace nice, someplace romantic.
not_available I can't.
not_available Eric's picking me up.
not_available Eric, your brother? 
not_available He's here.
not_available And he's on his meds.
not_available He's picking you up to do what? He's taking me to see his airplane.
not_available He bought an airplane? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You want me to go with you? 
not_available No.
not_available I think it'll be okay.
not_available He seems really, really good.
not_available Are you gonna go flying with him? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm supportive, not stupid.
not_available I have to go by McNulty's clinic anyway.
not_available He forgot his prescription.
not_available I'll call you after that.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't go flying with him.
not_available Don't go to Chechnya.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Your Resident asked for a curbside.
not_available And? There's an area of sensory loss on the posterior aspect of the thigh.
not_available Jensen bagged the posterior femoral cutaneous.
not_available But there's no foot drop.
not_available Sciatic, tibial, and peroneal are completely intact although he'll probably be left with some numbness in his thigh.
not_available Well, I guess he got lucky then.
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available Where's Jensen? 
not_available He said he was going up to the roof.
not_available To get a patient? 
not_available To jump.
not_available Final boarding call for There you go.
not_available Got some snacks for you for the trip.
not_available How far is Baltimore? 
not_available You should get there tomorrow night.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's cool.
not_available So you got the phone number for Greg's Aunt Rose? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Let's get you on the bus then.
not_available But what about Greg? 
not_available Well, he's gonna call you in a few days.
not_available He's not coming? No.
not_available Listen to me, you're supposed to go visit his Aunt Rose for a while, okay? Yeah, right, but is he gonna at least say goodbye? Look.
not_available He's working at the hospital.
not_available He's mad at me.
not_available No, no.
not_available Leon, look, he's just
not_available He's just really busy, man.
not_available He's just really busy.
not_available He sent me away because I messed up.
not_available I'm so stupid! 
not_available No.
not_available Leon
not_available Leon, that is not true.
not_available I need to talk to him.
not_available Leon, you gotta get on that bus.
not_available I don't want to do this.
not_available Leon, listen to me.
not_available You have to get on that bus.
not_available All right, come on, then.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available You have a good trip, okay? Be safe.
not_available Don't do it, Jensen.
not_available My car's down there.
not_available Your patient's going to be fine.
not_available The leg should be fully functional.
not_available There was nerve damage.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But it was minimal.
not_available Hey, you'll do better next time.
not_available You're right.
not_available Because I won't go into surgery with you.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available McNulty! You in there? Hey.
not_available Dr.
not_available McNulty? OneDavidtwenty 
not_available Mac, you in there? It's John.
not_available Is there a problem there, sir? No, no, I'm an ER doc from County, and one of my patients lives here.
not_available I think he might be in a bit of trouble.
not_available Did you try calling him? Yeah, nobody's answering.
not_available He's a stubborn old guy.
not_available I treated him with insulin.
not_available I'm worried that if he didn't eat dinner he might be in a coma from low blood sugar.
not_available Okay, you want an ambulance? 
not_available I just need to get inside.
not_available Hey, Mac.
not_available It doesn't look like he's here, sir.
not_available This is his clinic.
not_available This is This has been his clinic for 20 years.
not_available He lives back there.
not_available I've been working this beat since ' 95, sir.
not_available This clinic was only here a few weeks.
not_available It used to be a Christian bookstore.
not_available And a tanning parlor before that so I was here three days ago.
not_available You know, these clinics, they come and go.
not_available Some are legit, but lots aren't.
not_available Was that guy even a real doctor? I don't know.
