not_available Yeah.
not_available For the next eight hours, if you have a problem, go to him.
not_available Peachy.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Jerry, where are all the pens? Some idiot's idea of an April Fool's joke.
not_available Well, listen, go down to Supply and steal a couple.
not_available I got you.
not_available 1.5 volts.
not_available It's pretty cool.
not_available Real mature.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's April Fool's.
not_available I'd watch my back if I were you.
not_available I've got a hemorrhoids in Four, a kid with a fever in Triage.
not_available Talk to Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available How did it go? 
not_available We got a problem.
not_available Did you get my affidavit? 
not_available Yeah, that's fine.
not_available I get a continuance for disability if Mobalage remains hospitalized.
not_available Urology still has him on the surgical service.
not_available INS confirmed he was discharged this morning.
not_available Where'd you get that? Elizabeth Corday.
not_available I thought you had an open house.
not_available Weinstein pushed up a lung resection.
not_available The cardiothoracic guru? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He got tickets to a game, so Reece has to stay in daycare for another month.
not_available It was only in there for a few seconds.
not_available I want to make sure that the water didn't damage it.
not_available Reece's hearing aid.
not_available How much? 
not_available Don't ask.
not_available I know, but is there any way to test it? 
not_available Peter, Weinstein's ready for us.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I know.
not_available I can't Hey! 
not_available I said, let's go.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available I said, let's go.
not_available I'm trying to fix my son's hearing aid, okay? One word, Peter.
not_available "Nanny." I can think of a word of my own.
not_available Get out now, Elizabeth.
not_available What do you mean? Soon you'll have your license and your pick of fifth
not_available year Residencies.
not_available I think I've found a way to limit my Romano exposure.
not_available Oh, yeah? What's that? Garlic? Trauma surgery.
not_available Fellowship run out of the ER.
not_available It'll start in July.
not_available I didn't know there was one.
not_available There wasn't.
not_available Trauma's the reason I came to the States.
not_available The hours are better, and I'd have a semblance of a normal life.
not_available We got disconnected.
not_available I had the hearing aid in the toilet.
not_available I meant to speak to you.
not_available The INS called about Mobalage.
not_available Did you discharge him? 
not_available I didn't volunteer information.
not_available But I couldn't lie.
not_available He was afebrile.
not_available His wound was clean and intact.
not_available Did you discharge him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available When did he leave? I don't know if Transport's taken him down yet.
not_available Why? We're trying to get a physical disability continuance.
not_available On a pudendal artery bypass? If he's hospitalized, we avoid a deportation hearing.
not_available Now he has to see the judge.
not_available One look at the scars and the judge'll grant him asylum.
not_available It doesn't work that way.
not_available Mobalage has to testify, describe the torture.
not_available Isn't it obvious? 
not_available Apparently not to the government.
not_available They need a sworn statement.
not_available And Mobalage refuses to give it? I don't think he can.
not_available He was a upset.
not_available I thought it was a nightmare.
not_available But he wouldn't stop crying.
not_available Temp's 101.
not_available Now I can't wake him up.
not_available Is he on any medications? 
not_available No.
not_available Has he ever been hospitalized? 
not_available Never.
not_available He's a healthy kid.
not_available He could be septic.
not_available What does that mean? We need to treat him with antibiotics.
not_available Then perform tests to find the source of the infection.
not_available Jerry, is Trauma One open? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're in early.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Hey, who's this? 
not_available Critical patient.
not_available Pulmonary edema.
not_available BP's borderline and 95 after a fifth nitro spray.
not_available You should only give three.
not_available I gave it to her.
not_available You doing a ride
not_available along? Set up a nitro drip.
not_available Hurry! I don't want to intubate.
not_available No extraordinary measures.
not_available She's a DNR.
not_available Set up BiPap.
not_available We'll go from there.
not_available How's you're breathing, ma'am? I'm I'm She's altered, Carter.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three, gently.

not_available Chest film, EIKG, blood gas.
not_available BP's 100/75.
not_available Resps 20.
not_available Tachy at 130.
not_available I can take it from here, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Where's my 12lead? 
not_available I can take it from here.
not_available This one's mine, Carter.
not_available I'm Seniorforthe
not_available day.
not_available I'm running the big board.
not_available Go run it.
not_available Carol, where's the nitro? 
not_available I gotta clear an air bubble.
not_available Then give her another sublingual spray now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Sadowinski is an expert in this kind of case.
not_available I want you to meet him.
not_available I already talked to a psychiatrist.
not_available But talk to this one.
not_available Mobalage, they will send you back.
not_available He's not been through enough? 
not_available IKobe.
not_available I don't understand it either.
not_available I'm not an immigration expert.
not_available I do know that you telling your story is the only way that you can stay.
not_available Let me just get you a little time to think about it.
not_available I'll take you down to the ER.
not_available You're feverish, pulse is tachy.
not_available If anybody asks you, you're experiencing belly pain.
not_available I never imagined frozen sperm would be a good investment.
not_available It's tricky.
not_available You gotta buy the best.
not_available Good of you to join us, Peter.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I had to rearrange my schedule.
not_available In 10 years you get to set the schedule.
not_available So you only inseminate Arabians? No, Thoroughbreds too.
not_available Remind me, I'll get you a brochure.
not_available You like horses, Peter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available They got a big upside once you know what you're doing.
not_available IKeep that in mind.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Your office is on the phone.
not_available A sales rep from Symatac is waiting for you.
not_available Oh, damn! I forgot.
not_available The guy's gonna comp me a new thoracoscope.
not_available Okay if we push this back to 1? Yeah, sure.
not_available No sweat.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll see you then.
not_available End of shift? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Just started.
not_available You? 
not_available Post call.
not_available Six hours to go.
not_available This internship's never gonna end.
not_available It always feels like that.
not_available That looks really good.
not_available I'm famished.
not_available I just can't eat anything, you know? I'm trying to keep something down, but Here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Morning sickness? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I'm really, really tired.
not_available Have you seen your OB? You've not made a decision.
not_available Three months ago I worried that I couldn't get pregnant.
not_available And now here I am, all alone.
not_available I wanted to have a baby with Doug.
not_available I don't want to be a single mother.
not_available Do you have to be? Have you spoken with Doug? I see all these pregnant women parading through here Iost, frightened, not knowing what to do.
not_available And what do you tell them? I say, "Go with your gut.
not_available Most of the time it's right." So, what does yours tell you? I don't know.
not_available I need somebody from Surgery onboard.
not_available You discharged Mobalage.
not_available So according to bounce
not_available back rules, he's yours.
not_available I know, but there's nothing wrong with him.
not_available The incision looks a little erythematous around the sutures.
not_available Could be wound infection.
not_available Mark.
not_available I don't need you to take him.
not_available Sign the readmit orders and we'll observe him down here in the ER.
not_available You want me to falsify his chart.
not_available I'm just trying to buy him some time.
not_available His lawyer's on his way to the judge to tell him he's being readmitted.
not_available You're asking me to sign my name to a lie.
not_available I'm asking you to help him.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mark, can I get you to see a couple of patients? In a second, Carter.
not_available Did you steal my stethoscope? 
not_available No, haven't seen it.
not_available Why will they pick that pen? 
not_available Because it's shiny.
not_available Malik, I need postural vital signs on Bed Three and you can discharge Mr.
not_available Dudley.
not_available Jerry, I need it.
not_available What makes you think I took it? Come on, man! 
not_available Stealing stuff? Where's the creativity in that? There must be a contact person for the Board and Care.
not_available No, her fees are paid for out of a pension.
not_available Thank God you found her.
not_available She was abandoned.
not_available She was gonna die there alone.
not_available Sometimes they're gone before we find them.
not_available Can you do more? Find out where's she from? Any other children? Maybe find my father? Sure, I'll check it out.
not_available Page me if you need anything.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is that you, Claire? No, my name is IKerry.
not_available You were having trouble breathing.
not_available We had to bring you to the hospital.
not_available Hospital? Don't worry.
not_available We're gonna take very good care of you, I promise.
not_available He's still tachycardic.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's add a blood and urine tox screen.
not_available Could he have ingested something from the medicine cabinet? No, I don't think so.
not_available I thought it was an infection.
not_available His pupils are dilated.
not_available BP's up to 170/90.
not_available Anything? Cold medicine, nicotine, bug spray? 
not_available All that stuff's put away.
not_available Your house is childproofed? No, I only have him every so often.
not_available He sleeps in my room.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What? 
not_available No, the drawer was closed.
not_available What was in it? There are different treatments for different toxins.
not_available If I don't know what toxin, he could die.
not_available It was only like half a gram.
not_available Half a gram of what? Cocaine? Get Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available NG tube, activated charcoal, start IV.
not_available Esmolol, 50 mics per kilo per minute.
not_available You should wait outside.
not_available I want to be with him.
not_available This is going to be messy.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Haleh? 
not_available Out.
not_available Now.
not_available I need an ICU bed.
not_available She needs aggressive diuresis.
not_available I thought the beta blockade would do it.
not_available If you must, add phentolamine.
not_available It was a good pickup, though.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, did you hear about this? Guy leaves his cocaine where his 3year
not_available old can find it.
not_available Did you call DCFS? What the hell?! 
not_available Jerry.
not_available Jerry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Mobalage is asking for you.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Sadowinski here? Yes, but Mobalage wants you there.
not_available He trusts you.
not_available Red
not_available blanket baby on the way.
not_available A schizophrenic delivered in the street.
not_available Carter, you got it? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Give me a hand? I don't know.
not_available There was a hood over my face.
not_available Were you frightened? I thought I was about to die.
not_available Then what? They took you to a cell? Yes.
not_available What kind of cell? It was cold.
not_available What did it look like? I don't know, sir.
not_available They kept the hood on your head? Yes.
not_available Then what? They came and got you? How long before they came back? Mobalage, what happened next? I cannot tell you.
not_available Why? Because I do not remember.
not_available She was in the street holding the newborn baby.
not_available It was still wet with amniotic fluid.
not_available BP's 140/90.
not_available How much blood loss? 
not_available About a pad since we found her.
not_available Start an IV.
not_available Call OB.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available No.
not_available Where's my baby? How did she cut her forehead? 
not_available She fell on the sidewalk.
not_available Did they find the placenta? 
not_available She said a dog ate it.
not_available Okay, irrigate this scalp lac.
not_available Get me a speculum.
not_available I'll do a pelvic.
not_available Please, please, please.
not_available Where is my baby? Where? I'll go check on him right now.
not_available All right? Okay? Give her five of Haldol, IM.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available How's the mother? She needs her head sutured.
not_available And I'm putting her on Haldol.
not_available How's it going? Mottled and lethargic initially.
not_available He's warming up.
not_available Good color, good tone, pulse 140.
not_available Looks full
not_available term.
not_available What is that? Is that a garbage tie? 
not_available At least she knew to clamp it off.
not_available Get me an umbilical clamp and some Betadine.
not_available Need to do a heel stick? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where are the 22 butterflies? 
not_available Pedes.
not_available Let's get a newborn screen and a cap gas.
not_available She stole my baby.
not_available Give him back to me.
not_available Honey, you have to go lie down.
not_available No! 
not_available Haleh, call Security.
not_available You can't have him.
not_available He's mine.
not_available We're taking care of him.
not_available Can I hold him? Not now.
not_available Let's go in the other room and stitch that cut on your forehead.
not_available Then you can see him.
not_available I promise.
not_available I love my baby.
not_available I know.
not_available I love my baby.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available No! Give him back to me! Give him to me! 
not_available Coco, let go of me.
not_available He's mine! 
not_available Let go.
not_available Coco! No! No! Help! He's my baby! He's my baby! No! You can't have him! He's mine! No! No! Any signs of trauma? 
not_available No, he seems okay.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available IKerry, you got a minute? 
not_available Lf you want to walk with me.
not_available What'll we do with our sternal saw study? As soon as I've finished compiling the data, I'll pass it on to you.
not_available We should write a paper together.
not_available I assumed that you'd want to write yours separately.
not_available Why would you think that? 
not_available Different specialties and journals.
not_available A joint study should be a joint paper.
not_available It's suited for an emergency medicine journal.
not_available Sure, Peter, that'd be great.
not_available Okay, I'll call you.
not_available Hey, IKerry, you know, I heard there might be a surgical trauma fellowship.
not_available Did Romano tell you that? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? Confidentially, we're trying to go around him.
not_available Oh, well, that makes sense.
not_available Is it an open application process? Anspaugh's taking it to the board next week.
not_available Interested? 
not_available Well, I might be.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I had him readmitted.
not_available The judge suspects we're stalling.
not_available Which we are.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Government prosecutors come tomorrow to take a deposition.
not_available Then the court will make its decision.
not_available He won't be able to tell them anything.
not_available If he wants to stay, he'll have to.
not_available He doesn't remember.
not_available Anything? 
not_available The abduction.
not_available Not the torture.
not_available They've seen posttraumatic stress.
not_available People claim it all the time.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available We have physical evidence.
not_available I'm not arguing.
not_available I'm simply telling you what the reality is.
not_available Without a sworn statement specific to the torture, it can go either way.
not_available How is the baby doing? 
not_available Blood glucose is good.
not_available Up to 68.
not_available He's eating like a champ.
not_available Good.
not_available How are we doing in here? 
not_available She's throwing PVCs.
not_available She's gorked out.
not_available How long? What? Has she been throwing PVCs? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You should've called me.
not_available She's DNR.
not_available I'm working on an ICU bed for her.
not_available Did her family change their mind? 
not_available No.
not_available There isn't any family.
not_available Well, that makes it easier, less complicated.
not_available Why is that guy still in Four? 
not_available He's waiting on a cab.
not_available For 55 minutes? Come on.
not_available I need the bed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene told me to talk to you.
not_available Make it fast.
not_available Time clock's broken.
not_available Call Administration.
not_available I did.
not_available I can't work until they fix it.
not_available Note the time on the card.
not_available Can't.
not_available They're afraid we'll cheat.
not_available Clock in upstairs then.
not_available It's on a different system.
not_available Nice try.
not_available April Fool's? 
not_available You blew it.
not_available He was getting mad.
not_available Chuny, I thought better of you.
not_available Malik put me up to it.
not_available Blame the brother.
not_available Have a pen.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's the deal with CT? I got three patients holding.
not_available Crashed.
not_available Computer guy's working on it.
not_available How long? 
not_available Four hours.
not_available Four hours?! You serious? When am I not serious? Jerry, we're closed to neuro trauma.
not_available I'll call Weaver.
not_available No, I'm Seniorforthe day! 
not_available CT's down.
not_available We're closed to neuro.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available We got another one.
not_available Fourmonth
not_available old female.
not_available High fever, cough.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Sam, don't go anywhere.
not_available I may need a wet read on a chest film.
not_available What are you doing? We need to massage your uterus to help shrink it.
not_available It closes off all the blood vessels? 
not_available That's right.
not_available I read that.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to attack you.
not_available I get crazy without my meds.
not_available I understand.
not_available How's my baby? He's great.
not_available He's in the nursery, and they're taking good care of him.
not_available But he's healthy, right? There's nothing wrong with him? No, no, no.
not_available He's perfect.
not_available I went off the drugs for the pregnancy.
not_available I know.
not_available I didn't want them to hurt him.
not_available I know.
not_available I thought about it.
not_available I knew what I was doing.
not_available I knew I was taking a risk.
not_available That I could get out of control, end up on the street.
not_available But it worked.
not_available I made it.
not_available You got lucky.
not_available But it's not over.
not_available I can go back home.
not_available I'll stay on the medication.
not_available I know that I have to.
not_available Not for me.
not_available For him.
not_available Coco, we're not talking about a month, or six months, or a year.
not_available You can't ever stop.
not_available I won't.
not_available I love him already.
not_available I loved just the idea of him.
not_available That's all that really matters, right? They'll let me keep him, won't they? 
not_available We'll see.
not_available No, no! They can't take him away.
not_available Please.
not_available Please help me.
not_available You need to rest.
not_available Hi.
not_available My name is Lucy IKnight.
not_available I'm a student.
not_available How are you feeling? Michael! Stop it! Be still.
not_available You want a fourth tube? 
not_available Might as well.
not_available Fluid looks pretty clear.
not_available That's good? 
not_available Yes.
not_available If it's a bad infection, the fluid can be cloudy.
not_available We still need to send these tubes to the lab.
not_available Michael! You got a second? 
not_available Be with you in one minute.
not_available Hold him still.
not_available Okay.
not_available I will be right back.
not_available Gram's stain and culture in One.
not_available Glucose and protein in Two, and cell count in Three.
not_available What do we got? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available What's wrong with this picture? Are those rib fractures? 
not_available Four.
not_available One, two, three, four.
not_available Any signs of abuse? I didn't see any ecchymoses.
not_available Bruises heal on infants pretty quickly.
not_available Chuny? 
not_available Yeah? Get DCFS on the phone and call Security.
not_available I want a full bone survey.
not_available Skull, long bones, the works.
not_available Let's take them now before the inquisition.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Leason, there's a problem with the chest x
not_available ray.
not_available What kind of problem? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's fuzzy.
not_available Maybe she moved.
not_available But we need to try again.
not_available Can I go with her? 
not_available It's better if you stay here.
not_available I said, stop it! Your sister is sick! Mrs.
not_available Leason, take it easy.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What's this? We found old fractures that look like the result of trauma.
not_available What? 
not_available By law, I'm required to report them.
not_available I thought you said the x
not_available ray was fuzzy.
not_available We need to document a complete set.
not_available Document what? How did Michael break his arm? He fell off the bed! A representative of the DCFS is coming to talk to you.
not_available The hell they will! I'm leaving.
not_available Not with your children.
not_available I brought my baby because she's sick.
not_available And now you want to take my children? She doesn't leave with this one.
not_available I'll call the police.
not_available You call the police! You don't know what you're saying! You can't do this! Yes, I can! They let Mobalage live for people to see him broken.
not_available To set an example.
not_available Why? What did he do? He wrote a short story.
not_available They saw it as a call for revolution.
not_available Was it? I didn't know he was a writer.
not_available He's an engineer.
not_available But he was a romantic to me.
not_available Not as you see him today.
not_available He was warm and funny.
not_available Energetic.
not_available IKobe, I need to know things about the torture.
not_available Anything that could help spark his memory.
not_available We don't speak of it.
not_available You must know the sort of things they did.
not_available You can see the sort of things they did.
not_available I was thinking more of where, how long, when? 
not_available Details.
not_available I cannot give you details.
not_available I wish I could.
not_available When will we have to go? Your visa's valid.
not_available It's only Mobalage.
not_available When will we have to go? I don't know.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what? You've been very kind.
not_available I want to help him.
not_available So do I.
not_available Hey, IKerry.
not_available Hey.
not_available I was checking vitals on Mrs.
not_available Brennan.
not_available Chart says you pushed lidocaine.
not_available That's right.
not_available Did her DNR status change? "Do Not Resuscitate" does not mean "Do Not Treat." 
not_available You treated an arrhythmia.
not_available Yeah, that's not resuscitation.
not_available So you won't intubate? She's my patient, and I'll make a judgment call if it comes to that.
not_available A "judgment call"? Isn't that hypocritical? What? Doug made judgment calls, what he thought was best.
not_available Carol, Doug created his own problems.
not_available You didn't help much.
not_available Is that what you think? That I drove him out of here? No.
not_available But I know you wanted him out.
not_available I won't have this conversation.
not_available He didn't go against their wishes.
not_available No, this is different.
not_available How, IKerry? She is my mother.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Brennan Mrs.
not_available Brennan is my mother.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? I don't know.
not_available I was adopted.
not_available And I hired I hired this private detective to find her.
not_available I never imagined it would happen like this.
not_available I didn't expect to find an old woman.
not_available I always thought that she was probably some scared teenager who couldn't keep me.
not_available I I thought that I would have more time, have some kind of meaningful conversation, ask her questions.
not_available But the minute I find her, she's dying.
not_available IKerry, I'm so sorry.
not_available It's not your problem.
not_available She's hemacult positive.
not_available Crit's down.
not_available I'm gonna call for a GI consult.
not_available Type and cross
not_available match two units, okay? You know your way around a resection, Peter.
not_available But do more homework.
not_available We keep him busy.
not_available Want some coffee? No, thanks.
not_available I can make the third inning.
not_available Always a pleasure, gentlemen.
not_available You bet.
not_available Take care.
not_available See you later, you jerk.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I didn't know the answer to that question.
not_available No, I should be more prepared.
not_available Go home.
not_available See your munchkin.
not_available His name is Reece.
not_available Oh, like "Reese's Pieces." Cute.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How'd it go? 
not_available Fine, I guess.
not_available Not exciting enough for you? No.
not_available It was interesting.
not_available So why did you feel the need to poach my meager ambitions? What? I spoke with IKerry Weaver about the status of the fellowship.
not_available There might be a selection committee.
not_available There is other interest.
not_available Was that you? I mentioned something.
not_available Peter, I told you in confidence.
not_available I wouldn't have said anything if I thought you'd try and steal it.
not_available It's already yours? It was my idea.
not_available I brought it to Greene and Weaver.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You didn't tell me.
not_available Peter.
not_available Look, I didn't say I wanted it.
not_available I was just asking.
not_available Then let me know when you decide.
not_available I'll go ahead and plan my life.
not_available Elizabeth, it's not like that.
not_available It's just that Things aren't working out right now.
not_available I don't like cardiothoracic.
not_available Oh, what? So trauma's a backup? No.
not_available I just thought that this might make sense.
not_available I can't spend five years as an indentured servant.
not_available I need time for Reece.
not_available Now, that's low.
not_available What? I know you love him, but don't use him as an excuse to screw me over.
not_available Take it! I don't want it! I'll find something else! I don't want you to forfeit it! If you want it, you go for it! I'll still get it! How are those films? Come in.
not_available You're gonna want to see this.
not_available Whose is this? 
not_available I don't know, it's been here all day.
not_available I've looked everywhere for this.
not_available Twenty
not_available eight different fractures total.
not_available Not all calcified.
not_available Bilateral humerus.
not_available Left femur.
not_available Right tib
not_available fib.
not_available Linear involvement of the skull.
not_available What did she do to this kid? We should get a head CT.
not_available There's some pleural scarring.
not_available Possibly a spontaneously healed pneumothorax.
not_available Wait, what is this? Fracture of the eighth rib.
not_available I thought there were only four rib fractures.
not_available There's five here.
not_available You sure this is hers? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I took a whole new set.
not_available Where's the old one? Same technique? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So where's the fifth fracture? 
not_available There isn't one.
not_available What? It happened in the ER.
not_available Did you press on her chest? 
not_available I held her down to do the LP.
not_available It could be osteogenesis imperfecta.
not_available I did it? 
not_available The bones break like glass.
not_available Oh, man! Oh, man! I went right to abuse.
not_available I didn't even think about OI.
not_available Did you call Social Services? 
not_available The cops are talking to her.
not_available Well, honest mistake.
not_available Better to be safe, right? How do I go from "Sorry I accused you" to "She has a terrible disease"? You should put on a jacket.
not_available It's still nippy out here.
not_available I'm ready for spring.
not_available I got your page in the car.
not_available How is she? 
not_available She's dying.
not_available I got some preliminary info for you.
not_available You want to hear? Cathy Brennan.
not_available She was a stewardess when they called them "stewardesses." Married two years after you.
not_available Not to your father.
not_available I'm still working on that.
not_available Divorced six years later.
not_available One child, a daughter Claire.
not_available Died in a car accident in her mid
not_available 20s.
not_available Are you okay? Did you know that her blood type was O
not_available positive? We don't usually get that information.
not_available I typed her blood since I was gonna put her in the ICU.
not_available She didn't want that.
not_available But somehow I thought I had the right.
not_available It's a natural reaction.
not_available I'm AB.
not_available It's impossible for that woman to be my mother.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available It's basic hematology.
not_available "A" plus "B" equals "AB." There's no "O" in the equation.
not_available I'll call my guy at the office.
not_available He stole a peek at the file.
not_available He must have read it wrong.
not_available You should be more careful.
not_available The info's there.
not_available I can get it.
not_available You're not gonna quit? It's my fault.
not_available Don't let it undermine your resolve.
not_available You're fired.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Hi.
not_available How many patients do you have? 
not_available One.
not_available I got a good case.
not_available A schizophrenic had a baby.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I was there.
not_available Right.
not_available How's Seniorforaday? 
not_available Not over yet.
not_available Lucy.
not_available Yeah? Have you called your Resident about Coco? No, I have to complete a comprehensive mental status exam.
not_available I'm presenting her at Chief rounds.
not_available You need to call your Resident now.
not_available Is something wrong? Coco's dealt with a lot of psychiatrists.
not_available I bet.
not_available She feels you're too inexperienced.
not_available A schizophrenic thinks I'm unqualified? She's asked for someone else.
not_available Can she do that? She's got a lot at stake, Lucy.
not_available She's worried.
not_available Call your Resident.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, can I ask you something? Sure, Jerry.
not_available What does it mean if your piss turns blue? Just out of curiosity? My piss is blue.
not_available Dark blue.
not_available Somebody got you.
not_available How could they change my bodily fluids? Did you eat anything you didn't make? 
not_available Brownies in the lounge.
not_available Oh, man! It's not toxic, is it? It's probably methylene blue.
not_available Let me know if it starts burning.
not_available Burning? 
not_available Just kidding, Jerry.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Well, look, how long am I gonna pee like this? Day or two.
not_available Man, someone's gonna pay.
not_available I told you to watch your back.
not_available You're here.
not_available You came back.
not_available That's right.
not_available Claire? Claire? Yes.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too, Mom.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's a bathroom.
not_available Yeah, it's just a bathroom.
not_available Three stalls.
not_available Urinals.
not_available A couple of sinks.
not_available For a long time I had trouble even coming in here.
not_available I used to dream about it.
not_available It was my nightmare.
not_available I was standing right here at the sink.
not_available Someone had just left.
not_available I was washing my face.
not_available Suddenly I feel a pain shooting through my skull.
not_available And I realize that my head has hit the porcelain as I'm crashing into the mirror.
not_available My mind is one step behind.
not_available Someone's attacking me.
not_available I end up on the ground here.
not_available And he's gone.
not_available So I crawl out, and I try to stand up.
not_available And he's on me again.
not_available And he's kicking.
not_available And punching.
not_available And kicking.
not_available And this sharp pain shoots through my hand as he stomps on it.
not_available I can still feel it.
not_available I'm lying there in the middle of the floor.
not_available I can't stand.
not_available I can't talk.
not_available I just keep 
thinking "Why didn't I do anything?" "Why didn't I fight back?" You cannot fight back.
not_available You cannot move.
not_available There's no window there.
not_available Only a bright light in that corner.
not_available Someone lies over there.
not_available You know him.
not_available A friend.
not_available He's dead.
not_available There are voices.
not_available A scream from over there.
not_available A chain.
not_available You hang from a chain right here.
not_available Right here.
not_available There is laughter.
not_available Fire over there.
not_available They heat their long blades.
not_available Hold Holds it to you.
not_available It burns.
not_available You cannot breathe.
not_available It comes again, harder.
not_available Longer.
not_available You smell it.
not_available You smell your own flesh burning.
not_available Death.
not_available I wish for death.
not_available But my wife My family My family 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, can I help you? I was hoping to catch Dr.
not_available McLucas.
not_available She left for the day.
not_available Are you a patient? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Carol Hathaway.
not_available Is it an emergency? No, I just need to see her.
not_available Can I make an appointment? Sure.
not_available What's it for? I'm going to have a baby.
