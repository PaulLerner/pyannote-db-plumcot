not_available I've been evicted.
not_available I have no place to go.
not_available I don't want to hear it.
not_available Why are you so damn stubborn? It's called self
not_available protection.
not_available I did the best I could.
not_available I took care of you and Eric all by myself.
not_available Excuse me, Mom.
not_available We took care of you.
not_available You always had a place to stay, food and clothes.
not_available I worked hard for that.
not_available When you were on your meds.
not_available I tried to be a good mother every day.
not_available Abby, now, you listen to me.
not_available There is a lot of me in you.
not_available I see it.
not_available Please! Do you know that every night before I went to sleep I used to pray that you would take your lithium and just act normal? Do you think it was easy for me? 
not_available But it was exciting.
not_available We never knew what to expect.
not_available Would you bring home a loser you met in a bar? Or maybe you'd run down our street naked screaming your head off.
not_available You can hate me.
not_available It's okay to hate me.
not_available Then there was that Thanksgiving when I was 10.
not_available You remember that one? 
not_available Here we go.
not_available Here we go.
not_available You were cooking mashed potatoes.
not_available Here we go, here we go.
not_available Okay.
not_available I walked in.
not_available You asked where I'd been.
not_available I said I'd been to visit Dad.
not_available I'll never forget your face.
not_available You threw the food on the floor.
not_available You chased me with a knife! I'd never hurt you, Abby.
not_available I'd never hurt you.
not_available I locked myself in the closet! I remember sitting with my feet 
not_available It was the disease.
not_available against the door to keep you out.
not_available It was the disease.
not_available You have to see me.
not_available I'm not just a disease! That night you made me sleep beside you to prove you were sorry.
not_available I couldn't sleep.
not_available I had to watch you.
not_available I'm your mother.
not_available You might flip out again.
not_available I was 10! 
not_available I'm the only mother you'll ever have.
not_available I didn't choose to be sick.
not_available You never tried to get better! 
not_available I can't make things different.
not_available That's right! You can't! So now just go home.
not_available I couldn't talk.
not_available Words just wouldn't come out.
not_available Have you had any other symptoms? Change in vision? Headaches? Nothing significant.
not_available Neck's a little sore from hockey.
not_available Headache, on and off.
not_available Could be an atypical migraine, maybe cerebritis.
not_available You under a lot of stress? Who isn't? 
not_available Right.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah, I guess.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available I'm actually feeling much better.
not_available It's probably hypoglycemia from skipping breakfast and lunch.
not_available Well, when I was dizzy and vomited I took a pregnancy test.
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available I had a period last month.
not_available That was breakthrough bleeding.
not_available What? 
not_available You're pregnant.
not_available Well, that's impossible.
not_available Really? Technically, it's possible.
not_available You know, maybe we should run a serum test just to make sure.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Why don't you lie down? I'll do an ultrasound and see how far along you are.
not_available What's the word? There appears to be a 3.5 centimeter mass in the frontal cortex.
not_available A brain tumor.
not_available How bad is it? I want to discuss it with a neurosurgeon.
not_available You're a radiologist.
not_available How bad is it? 
not_available I really can't say.
not_available What's my prognosis? Phil? You need to talk to a neurosurgeon right away.
not_available It's not like he swallowed one nail.
not_available We're talking pounds of hardware.
not_available There's nails and screws and one of those metric socket sets, a plier.
not_available I mean, I'm palpating this guy's belly.
not_available And there's a crescent wrench outlined in bas
not_available relief.
not_available I mean, just smashed up against the skin.
not_available My husband says to me, "You've got to go in there and consent this guy.
not_available " You were married? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He was a surgical Resident.
not_available So I go in there and I 
say "Mr.
not_available Jebson, how did you get all this stuff down? " And he says, "A good Chablis.
not_available " He says, "A good Chablis.
not_available " Oh, my gosh.
not_available Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry.
not_available It's fine.
not_available No, you missed most of me.
not_available I can't believeI'll pay for the dry
not_available cleaning.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Kerry, it's all right.
not_available Did you bring the guacamole? 
not_available Yeah, and onion dip.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Hey.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I was just heading out.
not_available Good night.
not_available We need dessert.
not_available I can grab something from Doc Magoo's.
not_available We don't need it that bad.
not_available Good night.
not_available Happy Thanksgiving.
not_available Have a good one.
not_available I'm starving.
not_available Those are my favorite, girl.
not_available Hey, what happened? Your? 
not_available I went for a walk.
not_available In the rain? 
not_available How's Mr.
not_available Florea? He threw a clot.
not_available I had to give him TPA.
not_available Oxygen levels are up, vitals are stable.
not_available Can I give you a hand? Help you with anything? 
not_available I'm just starting an IV.
not_available With your mom.
not_available No.
not_available Every time she goes off her meds she says she's not gonna do it again.
not_available Why should this time be different? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available My patient's smoking again.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Thal, I told you if you want to smoke you have to go outside.
not_available In the rain? I've got pneumonia.
not_available Man, this is smelling weird! 
not_available I need an ashtray.
not_available Anything else I can get you? 
not_available An extra pillow would be nice.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, could I speak with you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I know you're a friend of my daughter's.
not_available This is awkward for me.
not_available I don't know what else to do.
not_available Could you talk to her for me? I'm not sure whatAbby's in there! Stay here! Stay here! Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, my God! Abby! Everyone, stay outside! Abby! Stay out here! Abby! Abby! Abby! Abby! God, Abby! Abby! 
not_available Oh, my God, Abby! Please wait outside.
not_available Abby? Is she all right? Is your neck okay? Is she all right? Is her airway clear? 
not_available I think she's okay.
not_available Let's go! Let's go! Down the hall to the right! Carter, you need help? I don't think so.
not_available Curtain 2.
not_available Get me an intubation kit 
not_available lactated Ringer's and burn dressings.
not_available Look out, please! Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is she all right? Is she badly hurt? Can you wait outside? 
not_available No.
not_available Stethoscope.
not_available Do you have any chest pain? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You do? Where's it hurt? 
not_available Right there.
not_available Right here? Okay, take a deep breath for me.
not_available All right, give me the oxygen.
not_available Hello, Mommy.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available I'm so glad you came.
not_available Who's here? 
not_available Everybody.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll go get your father.
not_available You didn't tell Ba
not_available Ba? You asked me not to.
not_available He'll be okay.
not_available Shocked, but okay.
not_available You underestimate us, Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available You've always underestimated us.
not_available Mommy, will you love the baby if the father is black? He's black.
not_available That's what I thought.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei? It's okay, Mommy.
not_available That's why I didn't tell you.
not_available Any idea what started it? 
not_available Ether.
not_available Ether? A couple of guys in the pharmacy were cooking crystal meth.
not_available Transported the ether in IV bags.
not_available One of theirs got mixed in.
not_available Damn! 
not_available Everybody out? All but two patients.
not_available Well, move it.
not_available We're evacuating this whole department.
not_available They're critical.
not_available I'll give you 10 minutes.
not_available Just take a deep breath.
not_available Chest still hurt? 
not_available A little.
not_available Can I get up? 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I could help.
not_available Not until I get a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available I don't need a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Abby, come on.
not_available Let him help you.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I'm a little sore.
not_available I think she cracked a rib.
not_available How's Mr.
not_available Thal? He's going to the Burn Unit.
not_available But he'll be okay.
not_available How much Ringer's do you want? 
not_available Ten liters over eight hours.
not_available How's your guy with the PE? 
not_available CT was normal.
not_available No brain bleeding.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's get you up to Radiology.
not_available He was staring up at me from the pavement.
not_available And with every breath I could see frosted cloud from his mouth get smaller.
not_available I just talked to him, tried to reassure him.
not_available And I held his hand until he died.
not_available The ambulance never came? 
not_available He was gone when they got there.
not_available Oh, my God Well, what happened to the driver who hit him? Not enough.
not_available He was drunk.
not_available But this was 19 years ago.
not_available They revoked his license for a while and had him pick up trash on Saturday or something.
not_available Well I certainly got us off on a very depressing tangent, didn't I? I think we're gonna close this place down.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We haven't taken care of this.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available No, you paid last time.
not_available Let me.
not_available Come on.
not_available You know what? Why don't we split it? 
not_available I got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know, this is our second meal together.
not_available Some people might consider a second dinner a date.
not_available A date? You do know I'm gay? 
not_available Of course.
not_available I don't have a problem with that.
not_available I have gay friends.
not_available I'm sorry, Kerry.
not_available I misread this.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, I didn't
not_available I'm so sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
not_available It's just that you called me for eight psych consults in the past week.
not_available We work well together.
not_available My instincts are usually reliable.
not_available You know what? Thank you.
not_available You know, I'm really very flattered
not_available You're such a beautiful woman.
not_available You're so beautiful.
not_available But I'm straight.
not_available I mean, I don't
not_available I'm straight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, God Oh, my God! I don't knowI don't know what
not_available I mean, I'm sorry.
not_available I just, I don't
not_available I feel very You know what? I just I mean, I guess I never even really considered this.
not_available You haven't said a word since we left the hospital.
not_available We can talk to each other.
not_available That's what people do in relationships.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm pissed that Romano's docking my pay for punching Malucci.
not_available That better? You should be furious.
not_available Malucci was way out of line.
not_available Not that I'm surprised.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? You get docked because Malucci's a jackass.
not_available Your nephew gets crappy care because they assume he's a banger.
not_available Today our patient couldn't get her meds.
not_available I'm tired of hearing you go off on this.
not_available Stop trying to teach everybody how to be black.
not_available And you need to face reality.
not_available Debby Marlin couldn't get pain medication because her pharmacy 
not_available was in a black neighborhood.
not_available You grew up in the suburbs.
not_available What do you know about her? 
not_available I can't relate because I wasn't poor? No.
not_available I'm just saying, I know who I am.
not_available I don't have anything to prove.
not_available And I do because my mother's white? I didn't say that.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available I'm getting off.
not_available This isn't our stop.
not_available I don't want to see you now.
not_available Cleo, we're supposed to be going to your cousin's
not_available Good news.
not_available Your lungs look clear.
not_available But you cracked a rib on the right.
not_available I'll write your discharge orders.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available Fine.
not_available You did have a concussion, loss of consciousness.
not_available So I'm gonna call you later.
not_available Thank you.
not_available "Doctor.
not_available " 
not_available Doctor.
not_available I borrowed an umbrella.
not_available Okay.
not_available Happy Thanksgiving, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available That steak smells fantastic.
not_available How'd you get the charcoal going in the rain? I just pulled the grill in under the overhang.
not_available I've never had a deck to grill on before.
not_available Makes me feel very American.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Shall I help you with the salad? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mark I have something to tell you.
not_available It's not going to be easy.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Well, I know it's not exactly the best time, but What the hell? I'm pregnant.
not_available Chen did an ultrasound.
not_available What are you thinking? 
not_available I think it's wonderful.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
