
not_available "Your full reinstatement," Dr.

not_available You'll be allowed to work shifts on a probationary status until several contingencies have been met.
not_available "Okay.
not_available " "A minimum of two weekly " physician diversion group meetings.
not_available Plus at least three AA meetings a week.
not_available "Okay, understood.
not_available " "Random urine tests " several times a month.
not_available "Whatever it takes.
not_available " "Under normal circumstances" this committee would require you to attend another 30 meetings in 30 days, before allowing you back.
not_available "In addition to the 30" you've already attended.
not_available But because you were so forthcoming, and volunteered to check yourself into a domestic detox facility, we've decided to make an exception.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt also asked us to make some concessions on your behalf.
not_available So effective immediately, you are cleared to return to work.
not_available Oh.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But I need a little more time.
not_available My husband, Dr.
not_available Kovac, and our son are in Croatia.
not_available They've been there I just need to spend some time with them.
not_available And I think I would be better for it when I come back to work.
not_available We have no problem with that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt? It's fine by me.
not_available I can always adjust the schedule.
not_available How much time do you think you need?

not_available I hear him calling me in the middle of the night.
not_available So I don't quite follow.
not_available He wakes you up while you're sleeping? Yes, every night.
not_available Have you considered telling him to stop waking you up? It doesn't help.
not_available Then I just dream about him.
not_available Well, is he here? Maybe we can talk to him.
not_available He's been dead for six years.
not_available Don't worry, Mrs.
not_available Smalls, we're gonna take good care of you.

not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt and Abby need some privacy for a few minutes.
not_available Abby's back?

not_available I think her arm is broken.
not_available Okay, what are people saying? Well, they think you've been in Croatia since Christmas.
not_available That's it? I was sure the rumor train would been running.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, you know how it is.
not_available One minute it's Thanksgiving, then all of a sudden it's next year.
not_available People do their own thing.
not_available Mm.
not_available Listen, thank you very much for your discretion, and And I'm sorry I had to burden you with this stuff.
not_available It's not a burden, Abby.
not_available It's management.
not_available The only reason I know the whole story is because I'm your supervisor.
not_available I gotta say it.
not_available I thought we were friends.
not_available Of course we're friends, Greg.
not_available Then why wouldn't you come to me for help? You know, it didn't have to go like this.

not_available Heh, heh.

not_available Not nice? 
not_available No Yes, it's very nice.
not_available It's just that usually by dessert, they're telling me how worried they are.

not_available Well, if the shoe fits 
not_available Kidding.
not_available What, are they not religious? 
not_available Hardcore Catholic.
not_available He's a hedgefund "millionaire " " so" it doesn't help that I'm a $35,000a
not_available year chaplain.
not_available Yeah, yeah.

not_available It's just "that " You know, I just don't know what time I'm gonna be done here.

not_available Keisha, I told you, stop calling her that.
not_available You got a phone? I need to get somebody to cover my shift.
not_available Right there.

not_available Will it get better? I'm not gonna be paralyzed, am I? It's just a little too early to tell right now.
not_available Those kids I saved, are they okay?

not_available Sweetheart, nobody hates you.
not_available All my foster families do.
not_available That's why I keep getting moved.
not_available Listen to me, grownups can be really weird sometimes.
not_available It may seem like they don't like "you " " but" that's probably because they're really "busy " " or" they're sad, or they're mad.
not_available But I guarantee you, it's not about you.
not_available You understand? And for what it's worth, I like you.
not_available I left the oven on once, but I turned it off all the way this time.

not_available We're gonna help him breathe.
not_available Suction please.
not_available You know anything about Kayla's vision problems? 
not_available Vision problems? No.
not_available Cricoid pressure.
not_available She's only been with me for a couple of weeks.
not_available That explains a lot.
not_available She's clumsy.
not_available You see the cords? 
not_available Yup.
not_available Now why would they send me a disabled kid? They should know better that I can't handle that.
not_available I'm a single foster mom, and I got five of them.
not_available I'm in.
not_available I don't think they knew.
not_available She's been keeping this to herself.

not_available It causes center
not_available field vision loss in kids.
not_available And she had a normal fundoscopic exam and nystagmus, which are indicators.

not_available What is it, Compazine? 
not_available Yeah, I've been puking my brains out.

not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna go work on that splint.
not_available Cool, I'll meet you there.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Then the rabbi says to the 
priest "I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know you were sitting here.
not_available " That's hilarious.
not_available I've never heard that one before.
not_available Hi, looks like you guys are having fun.
not_available Oh, she's delightful.
not_available Well, your labs came back normal, which is good.
not_available There's gonna be another doctor to come talk to you soon, okay? Take your time.
not_available I got nowhere to be.
not_available You mind if I borrow her for a sec? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available I thought a little God talk would do her good.
not_available She's actually an atheist.
not_available But did you know she was a Rockette back in the '50s? That's how she met her husband.
not_available He came to the show and hung out at the stage entrance just so he could meet her.
not_available He said of the whole line of beautiful girls, she was the only one he saw.
not_available So no prayers, no meditation, just shooting the breeze? She's alone and grieving.
not_available And no matter what you believe in " even" if it's nothing, grief is something I'm good with.
not_available Dinner's at Gibson's, by the way.
not_available Lf that sweetens the deal.
not_available Doesn't hurt.
not_available See you later.
not_available Okay.
not_available Could you page Psych for me again? What you mean, she wasn't in Croatia? 
not_available Luka and Joe went without her.
not_available Where's she been? 
not_available Said she had some personal stuff.
not_available Sounds like divorce talk to me.
not_available No, you think? Really? I knew it all along.
not_available Just a matter of time.
not_available Guys.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it's all good.
not_available You bet.
not_available Optho returned your call.
not_available Thanks, Frank.
not_available Watch his IV.
not_available His Iv's flowing.
not_available Trauma 1 is ready.
not_available Hang packed cells now.
not_available What happened? Crashed before we could scan him.
not_available What's he mean? 
not_available Rapid infuser's primed.
not_available He's bleeding internally.
not_available He needs an ex
not_available lap.
not_available He probably opened up his hematoma.
not_available We need more access.
not_available BP's 82/58.
not_available Hold on, maybe it's a pelvic fracture.
not_available You didn't see one.
not_available It's a tough call on kids.
not_available The symphysis is wide, there's a separation and S
not_available I diastasis.
not_available We don't have time to argue a questionable finding.
not_available He could be bleeding in his pelvis.
not_available Liver's the most likely source.
not_available Open his belly and it's a fracture, he'll bleed out.
not_available So we just screw around? 
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Show me free fluid, and you can do your ex
not_available lap.
not_available T
not_available pod him and fuse two units.
not_available We need to take him up now.
not_available All right, just give her two minutes.
not_available You know how this goes if you're wrong.
not_available This should tamponade any pelvic bleeders.
not_available Liver hematoma's enlarging.
not_available Kid needs the O.R.
not_available It's not that impressive.
not_available Two minutes are up.
not_available How much blood has he had? 
not_available Twenty per kilo.
not_available Okay, let's get this show on the road.
not_available Wait, hold on.
not_available Pressure's good, 100/60.
not_available Hemoglobin's up to 14.
not_available You see any free fluid in the belly? 
not_available I suppose surgery can wait a bit.
not_available What's going on? We stopped the bleeding.
not_available Okay, stable.
not_available Take him up to CT.
not_available What are you doing out here? 
not_available What's the deal with my tetanus shot? No one's come for that yet? Man, I'm sorry, we're really slammed.
not_available Why don't you go lay down on one of the beds.
not_available You'll be more comfortable.
not_available She's been mumbling.
not_available I thought she might wake up.
not_available I'm definitely not the first thing that she wants to see.
not_available Oh, I'm guessing she won't mind.
not_available You saved her life, man.
not_available One night I found her in the hall, passed out and drunk.
not_available So I went in and I fished the keys out of her purse.
not_available I couldn't just leave her there.
not_available But when I brought her inside, she woke up and she freaked out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good times.
not_available I'll go check on your tetanus, all right? Hang in there.
not_available Hey, man, listen very carefully, all right? I don't care how backed up you are, just fix it.
not_available Thank you, I'm glad somebody finally gave it to Radiology.
not_available I was on the phone with my landlord.

not_available I can do that, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Yeah, thanks Javier, but I got this.
not_available Come on, fellas.
not_available We need to do a test called an electroretinogram which tells us if the cells in the retina respond to light.
not_available If it is this LCA thing, what then? We'll know what we're dealing with for one.
not_available And there are some new therapies that could help.
not_available You just need to sign here for consent.
not_available Okay.
not_available And they can actually take her today if you want.
not_available Dexter's up in surgery.

not_available Gates.
not_available You have a serious fracture.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You need surgery.
not_available Shut up.

not_available Wanna sign out against medical advice? 
not_available Right, I'm not letting you touch me.

not_available Do you know what happened to you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You got beat up, and your neighbor, Eddie, intervened.
not_available You mean, the freak? He should mind his own business.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Well, he saved your ass, okay? He's got a pretty nasty cut on his head to prove it.
not_available How long's this gonna take anyways, huh? Does the posterior technique have a name?

not_available No, that's not really a problem now.
not_available I found her pulseless and apneic.

not_available She must have died like, an hour ago.
not_available Didn't anyone come and check on her? We were waiting for Psych.
not_available You doing okay, kiddo? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, if it is LCA, it might be worth a write up.

not_available Wow, both, huh? Well, I can't help you with the singing.
not_available I'm really bad.
not_available I'm pretty good.

not_available First, I need you to do me a really big favor.
not_available Rasgotra, practice is Wednesdays at 6.
not_available Game is Thursday at 7.
not_available We'll be at Ike's if you wanna join us.
not_available Hey, congratulations.
not_available Night.
not_available Congratulations? Did you win something? No, I think I just got recruited.
not_available So, what's this big favor? Starting tomorrow, docs will not be permitted to ask a nurse or a clerk to call a consultant.
not_available It has to be a written order.
not_available More work for Frank.
not_available Me too.
not_available Why? What if we're in the middle of a trauma? It's just for a month.
not_available We have to present real data to Admin if we wanna eliminate delays.
not_available Unless anybody has anything else to say, come on, let's get back to work.
not_available Oh, yeah, hey, can I have a minute? With everybody? Um, I know some of you have been wondering.
not_available And I appreciate the concern.
not_available I wasn't in Croatia for the last few weeks.
not_available After Luka's father died, they left without me.
not_available And I was in a residential detox facility.
not_available I'm an alcoholic.
not_available I just wanted to set the record straight and tell the truth because I have way too much respect for all of you to keep lying.
not_available And I'm very, very sorry because I know what I did didn't only affect "me " it affected all of you too.
not_available And I just hope I haven't done any irreparable "damage " to any of the relationships here.
not_available But I'm sober now, and I'm going to stay that way.
not_available So you were in rehab the whole time? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Were you ever drunk at work? Let's get signed out and get back out on the floor.
not_available We still got a lot of patients out there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I told her daughter she was fine.
not_available I worked her up, everything seemed normal.
not_available Did you do everything you were supposed to? Proper history, labs? I could have done an EKG.
not_available You know, cardiac monitor.
not_available Maybe I missed an MI, arrhythmia.
not_available I'd be worried about you if you weren't upset about Mrs.
not_available "Smalls " " but" I think it's pretty obvious what the cause of death was.
not_available She missed her husband, and she wanted to be with him.
not_available You're kidding me, right? 
not_available No, I think she was a pretty lucky lady.
not_available Julia, she died.
not_available She had a beautiful daughter.
not_available She had a full life filled with happiness.
not_available And she found true love.
not_available Some people live their whole lives and never get that.
not_available How else do you explain her husband calling her from the other side? And you really believe that? Yeah, I do.
not_available That's because I have faith.
not_available Faith.
not_available Yes.
not_available Look, we all end up like Rosemary Smalls.
not_available Who knows when? Who knows how? But love, trust, truth, higher power, the things that really matter " you" can't have any of those without faith.
not_available Especially love.
not_available Now, we are losing precious pre
not_available dinner drink time and I need at least two martinis to deal with my brother.
not_available So come on.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available Some meeting, huh? 
not_available Yeah, some meeting.
not_available Admit to Med
not_available Surg for IV antibiotics.
not_available Where are diverticula most likely to be? Narrowest portion with the highest intrasegmental 
pressures Sigmoid colon.
not_available Excellent work, Harold.
not_available All right, you, you, come here.
not_available All right, so here's the deal.
not_available Jaspreet's gone, and she's not coming back.
not_available Where'd she go? 
not_available Well, I could tell you that " but" then I'd have to kill you.
not_available She asked me to relay the 
following Archie, thank you for a wonderful night.
not_available It was great, but please stop calling.
not_available And don't ever call again, ever.
not_available Harold, thank you for a wonderful night.
not_available It was great, but please stop calling.
