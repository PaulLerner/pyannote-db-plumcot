not_available Where is he? Why didn't you get me sooner? 
not_available Thought I could do it.
not_available If his enzymes show he's had a heart attack, you better find him.
not_available How was the committee meeting? I'll let you read the minutes.
not_available Cab company from San Diego called.
not_available They dropped your dad off at the airport.
not_available Any other leads? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Why are you here? 
not_available No time cards, no pay.
not_available Can't somebody else do it? It'll take so long to explain it.
not_available I'd be doing this at home anyway.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Yes, doctor.
not_available The neurologist wants you or Dr.
not_available Weaver to come up.
not_available Where's Kerry? 
not_available Doing a rape exam.
not_available Tell him I'm on my way.
not_available A girl named Meg called.
not_available Really wants to see you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's a volcano.
not_available Mount Etna? Vesuvius? I couldn't tell you.
not_available Volcano will do.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available I feel like a lab rat.
not_available Just bear with me.
not_available Fine.
not_available Give me the cheese.
not_available What's this? Martini glass without the base.
not_available Or it's a It's a cone.
not_available Right? 
not_available Let's try another one.
not_available What's this? The picker
not_available uppers to put ice in a martini glass.
not_available They're also called 
not_available Call them whatever you like.
not_available Tongs.
not_available Tongs? Who cares? How aboutNo, stop this nonsense! 
not_available We're not quite finished.
not_available I am.
not_available I won't sit here and play guessing games with you and lousy drawings.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Let's take a short break.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Don't rush.
not_available Saline.
not_available Ready for the Wood's lamp? 
not_available Yeah, please.
not_available I see a spot.
not_available It looks like semen.
not_available That's it.
not_available Finished up? Waiting for the test results.
not_available Sit.
not_available Share my boredom.
not_available Grab a cup of coffee? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Why not? How are things going? For a doc who can't practice medicine, can't complain.
not_available I called your son.
not_available He's on his way.
not_available No.
not_available I told that neurologist I don't want my son involved.
not_available You can't enlist in a clinical trial without a caregiver.
not_available Someone has to make sure you take your meds.
not_available My son is not gonna babysit me.
not_available You took care of him when he needed you.
not_available Now it's his turn.
not_available That's just it.
not_available I was busy being a doctor, too busy helping everybody else.
not_available Let your son decide, okay? No, I won't be a burden to him.
not_available That new neurotrophin might give you more time.
not_available What difference will a few more months make? You'd give up because you're too proud to ask your son for help? If he says yes I'll still end up the way I'll end up.
not_available I don't think I could bear his saying no.
not_available Talk to him.
not_available He might say yes.
not_available I think it's too late.
not_available I'll clean out my locker.
not_available We'll tack down a tear of the carotid.
not_available Sounds like a plan.
not_available I hear you had quite a day.
not_available I'm not in the mood.
not_available Perhaps you'll want to hear 
this 
not_available Your patient raped that woman.
not_available Oh, dear God A public defender investigator was just here.
not_available It seems some bleeding heart claims you coerced Rollins to tell you where he left her.
not_available Did you coerce him for information to save his life? 
not_available You're out of line.
not_available It's okay, I'll answer that.
not_available It's fair to say I pressured Mr.
not_available Rollins.
not_available You never fail to impress me.
not_available I didn't think you'd cross that line.
not_available You may want to reflect on if that's how you'd really characterize what happened.
not_available Because, unfortunately, in this country when a confession's coerced, it's usually thrown out.
not_available I'm here to see Meg Corwin.
not_available Change your mind? 
not_available I wanted to see the baby.
not_available Social Services will be here soon.
not_available Crazy locking her in like this, but it's County's rules.
not_available Hi, Meg.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Joshua.
not_available He's beautiful.
not_available Hi, Joshua.
not_available They' re sending me back to jail.
not_available I need you to tell them that Joshua should stay with me.
not_available That would do no good.
not_available You did this.
not_available If you hadn't gotten me busted, I wouldn't be here right now.
not_available I did what I thought best for both of you.
not_available I'll be in jail ten months.
not_available Think that's what's best for him? I know it's hard, but if you get your life back together and prove that to them I'm sure you can get Joshua back.
not_available How can you be so damn self
not_available righteous? Meg, Social Services is here.
not_available Just give me a little more time.
not_available You know the rules.
not_available Moms can't keep their babies in jail.
not_available This isn't right.
not_available I know I screwed up bad.
not_available He needs me.
not_available Please do something.
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available Please! 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please.
not_available You did this! Let him stay a little while longer.
not_available Can you open this door?! 
not_available Just a moment.
not_available Yes, sorry.
not_available Open this door now, please! I'm his mother! Please don't take my baby! I'm his mother! 
not_available You can get some sleep.
not_available Mama loves you, honey! 
not_available Come with me.
not_available I love you! 
not_available We'll be back for you.
not_available I'm his mother! What are you doing? 
not_available Waiting for my ride.
not_available Wife found him unconscious.
not_available Seized for three minutes.
not_available Gave him two of Ativan.
not_available History of Type Two diabetes.
not_available He's seizing! 
not_available Two more of Ativan.
not_available Load him up with Dilantin, 
not_available I guess I got worked up over nothing.
not_available Alcohol abuse is hardly nothing.
not_available So he had a few beers with friends.
not_available Thank God it's not speed or coke! Your son's an alcoholic.
not_available He has a serious problem.
not_available With your permission I can refer Chad to a treatment program.
not_available I brought him here for a drug test.
not_available Not to test him for alcohol.
not_available Your son needs help.
not_available He's not on drugs, right? Are you avoiding this because you have a drinking problem? How dare you? Come on, Chad.
not_available How much Dilantin? 
not_available Four hundred mg.
not_available Keep pushing it.
not_available PH low, 6.95.
not_available Potassium's 6.8.
not_available Why's he acidemic? 
not_available He's diabetic.
not_available Blood glucose is normal.
not_available Is he septic? 
not_available Temp and white count are normal.
not_available Seizure stopped.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available He's throwing PVC's.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available He's seizing again.
not_available He's gonna arrest.
not_available Can you help me? 
not_available I don't work here.
not_available Please, a guy's coding.
not_available His pH is falling.
not_available His potassium's rising.
not_available He's having refractory seizures.
not_available Please.

not_available What's going on? Guy with seizures, acidemia.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lawrence says give him Pavulon.
not_available Push it! I've never given Pavulon for acidemia and seizures.
not_available It's strychnine poisoning.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available It worked.
not_available How did you know? Strychnine antagonizes glycine's central inhibition causing hyperexcitation.
not_available I had a case like this 20 years ago.
not_available A patient tried to commit suicide by eating Gopher Go.
not_available You can't forget what strychnine poisoning looks like.
not_available Check his pH.
not_available I bet it's coming back up.
not_available Your patient will recover.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Score one for the absent
not_available minded professor.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available That patient would've died if you hadn't been here.
not_available This old dog can still teach you a few new tricks.
not_available I wouldn't be here without you.
not_available I just gave you a little push in the right direction.
not_available What are you gonna do? Mark had my son stop by today.
not_available We talked, and 
not_available I agreed to live with him.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available He's picking me up now.
not_available I'll see you, Kerry.
not_available I'll see you.
not_available Find that patient? 
not_available Nobody's seen him.
not_available What have you got? Fiftyfiveyear
not_available old male, headache and chest pain along with gospel singers.
not_available We suspect carbon
not_available monoxide poisoning.
not_available This is all your fault.
not_available We missed the festival.
not_available Don't lose him this time.
not_available Mark? 
not_available Dad? You all right? Where you been? I've been worried about you.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available A little tired, but 200 bucks richer.
not_available My flight was overbooked.
not_available I volunteered to take a later one.
not_available They actually paid me.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available I can buy you a ticket.
not_available I can afford my own ticket.
not_available How about a tour? 
not_available I've been in plenty of hospitals.
not_available Not this one.

not_available Seven hundred cc's.
not_available Give him another unit.
not_available Normal sinus at 100.
not_available Lucky bastard.
not_available I should've let him die.
not_available You got him to talk so they found her.
not_available A fat lot of good that did.
not_available She didn't die alone outside under a bridge.
not_available He's in vtach! 
not_available Pressure dropping.
not_available Get the paddles! 
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available Paddles are charged.
not_available What do you want to do, Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Clear! He's back.
