not_available What's wrong with him? 
not_available We'll find out.
not_available Take him to Trauma 1.
not_available Where is that? 
not_available I'll take him.
not_available No, I
not_available It's okay.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Simone, you've lost a lot of blood.
not_available Something's wrong with my baby.
not_available Lily, stirrups.
not_available Gallant, labs.
not_available Maybe I should've had him in a hospital.
not_available You did everything right.
not_available CBC, PT, PTT, DIC screen for four units.
not_available We' re taking care of your baby.
not_available Let's help you now.
not_available BP's 80/60.
not_available Squeeze in another two liters.
not_available What's happening? Blood loss from a retained placenta.
not_available No, I mean with my baby.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac is taking care of your son.
not_available I'm gonna pull gently on the umbilical cord.
not_available Simone? I need you to stay with me.
not_available Pulse ox is 82.
not_available He's retracting.
not_available Pedes intubation tray, number three ET, uncuffed.
not_available What do you hear? Wet crackles throughout.
not_available Fluid in the alveoli.
not_available Okay, let's go look.
not_available Unhook the bag from the mask.
not_available You can bag the ET once I'm in.
not_available I've never done that.
not_available Squeeze the bag every two seconds just like he was doing.
not_available Never pass the tube till you see the cords.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Call for a Pedes vent.
not_available And set me up for an umbilical line.
not_available Relax, relax.
not_available The hard part's over.
not_available Good.
not_available Notify the NICU team.
not_available What do I tell them's wrong? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available It's no good.
not_available We' re into the cords.
not_available Have to do an AKA.
not_available Keep débriding.
not_available We' re not there yet.
not_available We treat this conservatively and it spreads then it's hip disarticulation to stay ahead of bacteria.
not_available Worth the risk.
not_available Of his being nonambulatory? Abovethe
not_available knee amputation.
not_available He can use a prosthetic.
not_available If it gets to his hip, it'll spread to the abdominal wall.
not_available He'll get septic.
not_available I'm trying to save this man's leg.
not_available Dry the field.
not_available What about his life? 
not_available He's young.
not_available Same thing.
not_available Come on, Robert.
not_available Of course it's not.
not_available Look.
not_available This Kelly slices through sub
not_available Q fat like butter.
not_available Fine.
not_available Keep cutting until you hit viable muscle.
not_available It's above the distal third of the thigh.
not_available It's a hopeless wound.
not_available Fine, take it.
not_available Robert.
not_available I said, take the leg.
not_available Bovie, pickups.
not_available Tommy, how are you feeling? He seems
not_available He seems a lot better, thanks.
not_available Good.
not_available Well just keep him on clear fluids tonight and I'll have a nurse sign you out.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's wrong with him? We'll
not_available We'll talk about it later.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available Good.
not_available I think the robot can go home.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get Carter to dispo him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can I get you a cup of coffee? 
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I like your outfit.
not_available It's very retro.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Listen, if
not_available If you ever need anything, like a Like a straitjacket? Is your dyskinesia usually this bad? I don't wanna freeze up on them at work so I upped the medication.
not_available And this is what you get.
not_available At least it helps to dispel the myth.
not_available You know, we don't all have rhythm.
not_available If it happened to me, I'd probably jump on a world cruise, not go to med school.
not_available I already saw the world.
not_available In fact, I was in Italy when I first realized I had a problem.
not_available Sipping wine in this café in Florence, and I noticed my little finger shaking.
not_available I just figured it was from living on espresso and martinis.
not_available When did you find out it wasn't? Well, I used to hate doctors so it took a while for me to check it out.
not_available But once I did, it really put things in perspective.
not_available Yeah, I guess being sick does that.
not_available Her baby's not doing well, huh? 
not_available No.
not_available How are you doing, Simone? 
not_available Good.
not_available He seems better, huh? Maintenance fluids are at five cc's per kilo per hour.
not_available My mother had me at home.
not_available I thought it would be good for him.
not_available His tests came back.
not_available I'm afraid your baby has a disease called sialidosis.
not_available What's that? His body lacks an enzyme that breaks down the waste proteins inside the cells.
not_available And there is already extensive damage to the liver, bones and nervous system.
not_available I've been staring at him for over an hour now.
not_available And I still can't figure out what I wanna call him.
not_available Would you excuse us, please? Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Children with sialidosis are mentally retarded, often blind.
not_available He'll never speak or walk.
not_available His life expectancy is less than two years.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, NICU is on line one.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is there anyone you'd like me to call? No.
not_available There's just us.
not_available I don't think it'll be necessary.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You having a bad night? 
not_available No worse than usual.
not_available That was a little bit insensitive.
not_available I had to tell a mother her baby was gonna die.
not_available I didn't need an audience? Okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm starting to get some complaints about you.
not_available From patients? 
not_available Nurses.
not_available Don't look so concerned about it.
not_available First you accused Chuny of being an idiot.
not_available When she's sexually harassed 
not_available you practically laughed.
not_available The guy grabbed her butt.
not_available Yeah, that's sexual harassment.
not_available Come on.
not_available You were there.
not_available The guy's intoxicated with mandrake.
not_available He's harmless.
not_available This one's all yours.
not_available What patient? Mr.
not_available Hard
not_available On.
not_available Checking his vitals and he grabbed my boob.
not_available What's his status? 
not_available Gonna die if he tries again.
not_available That's his status.
not_available See? Every time there's a problem, she complains.
not_available Everyone complains.
not_available It's part of the job.
not_available Yes.
not_available And it's part of my job as nurse manager to counsel you.
not_available What? You can give nurses orders, but cannot critique.
not_available If you have a problem with a nurse, come to me.
not_available Okay.
not_available What about you? Who do I complain to if I have a problem
not_available ? Here's an idea.
not_available Maybe you should try fighting for the nurses 
not_available instead of fighting with them.
not_available Maybe you should sew swastikas on that costume.
not_available You could be a naughty Nazi nurse, huh? You totally suck, you know that? 
not_available Creating a hostile work environment.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Page him.
not_available The baby with sialidosis is febrile to 102.
not_available Chuny, where's Kovac? 
not_available Don't know, don't care.
not_available Feels like he's on fire.
not_available Why hasn't he gone to the NICU? 
not_available You'd have to ask Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Can you do something? He needs to be pan
not_available cultured.
not_available How much does he weigh? 
not_available Three kilos.
not_available A hundred and fifty milligrams IV piggyback of Cefotaxime and amp.
not_available Set up for a spinal tap.
not_available He has sialidosis.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And he also has an infection.
not_available Sixty mgs of Tylenol.
not_available I'll arrange for your baby to be sent up to the neonatal unit.
not_available We'll do everything we can for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Why are you still here? My piano recital was canceled.
not_available Hey, it's me, Elizabeth.
not_available I'm on my way home now.
not_available See you soon.
not_available Bye.
not_available We did the right thing.
not_available You trying to convince me or you? I went through a period of adjustment when I became a mother, every time I treated a child.
not_available You get over it.
not_available Oh, please spare me the $2 psychoanalysis, Lizzie.
not_available Fine.
not_available Hey, look, look.
not_available I know most people don't like me.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I don't like most people.
not_available But I'm good at what I do.
not_available I save people's lives every day.
not_available People who no one else can help.
not_available If I can't do that Robert I know you' re frustrated.
not_available You' re an excellent surgeon, and you will be again.
not_available I promise you.
not_available You will be.
not_available I'm being paged.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available I'm being paged.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available I just tried calling you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to leave for the airport now.
not_available What about the later flight? 
not_available This is it.
not_available I threw her pajamas, some crackers, a couple toys in here in case she had to stay for a while.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available We got slammed.
not_available I'll see you Monday morning.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Have a safe flight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye, Ella.
not_available Hey, did Kris take you trickortreating? What is it?

not_available Dopamine is up.
not_available We got two liters.
not_available I'm working on an art line.
not_available Any word from her family? 
not_available No.
not_available We don't have her last name.
not_available Lily, could you? 
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available There, it's okay.
not_available Hello, little cow 
not_available girl.
not_available I'll be with you soon, all right? Could it be hemorrhagic? 
not_available The CT was negative.
not_available I'm thinking hypoxia.
not_available If we don't find her family, they'll be ID'ing the body.
not_available Pulse ox is only 82 on 100 percent.
not_available She needs suctioning, Abby.
not_available Set up ultrasound.
not_available She may have blown a clot.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Second crit was only 32.
not_available What happened to Mom? 
not_available In the washroom.

not_available Try the cabinet.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Weaver ordered antibiotics.
not_available No.
not_available Who did the LP? 
not_available She wanted a full septic workup.
not_available This is my patient.
not_available The baby spiked a fever.
not_available This baby is in a chronic vegetative state.
not_available You' re prolonging his and the mother's suffering.
not_available We treat kids like this.
not_available You should've asked me.
not_available We couldn't find you.
not_available I told you to leave.
not_available This isn't your case.
not_available Luka.
not_available Abby? Check with me before you push meds on my patient.
not_available I have to do a cutdown here.
not_available Morrison's pouch looks dry.
not_available It could be retroperitoneal.
not_available What the hell was all that about? You want PEEP on the vent? 
not_available Not until we get her pressure up.
not_available Nathan, why do you think she's hypotensive? Blood loss? 
not_available Not in this case.
not_available Hypoxia can cause myocardial dysfunction.
not_available I'm filing a grievance against him.
not_available Not now, Chuny.
not_available IV's dry.
not_available She needs a fresh one.
not_available I'll get it.

not_available One time with a patient's mother in Radiology.
not_available Hey, you never complained.

not_available So what do you want me to do? 
not_available Tell her you' re sorry.
not_available Tell her it was wrong.
not_available Just fix it.
not_available I'm not gonna kiss her ass.
not_available That's how this problem started.
not_available Have them check a gas on 50 percent.
not_available I'm gonna wait right here for you.
not_available Don't worry about anything.
not_available I love you.
not_available I should've told them I was his brother.
not_available ICU has strict rules.
not_available He'll need roundthe
not_available clock attention tonight, but his lungs are rebounding.
not_available You know what? You should go home.
not_available They'll let you see him in the morning.
not_available Home? Our whole lives were in that apartment.
not_available This dress is all I have.
not_available I've been watching his heart rate.
not_available It goes down when I touch him when he knows I'm here.
not_available Has his fever gone down? 
not_available A little.

not_available I was about to give up.
not_available And then suddenly he was here.
not_available He's here.
not_available We'll keep treating the infection but he will start going into organ failure soon.
not_available His systems will shut down.
not_available You' re so beautiful.
not_available You' re my baby.
not_available His heart could stop beating.
not_available I need to know what you wanna do if something like that happens.
not_available I don't know.
not_available To keep him alive, I may have to open his chest, maybe even shock him.
not_available And I'm not sure you want me to do something like that.
not_available No.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Tell the unit I flushed the Quinton.
not_available He's tenacious.
not_available Gotta give him that.
not_available I wish he'd told me.
not_available Not an easy thing to lead with.
not_available There's Mommy.
not_available There's Mommy.
not_available Hi, Lily had to run Wynn's ABG up to the lab.

not_available be physician ever experiences.
not_available Part of becoming a doctor.
not_available I'm offering you a pass, Mr.

not_available Are you okay? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I was
not_available I was gonna lay down for a second.

not_available No.
not_available There was no need.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available It's been three hours.
not_available We can't board their patients.
