not_available dimer.
not_available Am I having some sort of reaction to the drugs? It's possible, but we need to run some more tests to know for sure.
not_available You've got fluid in your lungs, which could be a sign of a blood clot.
not_available A blood clot? It's unlikely, but I just want to make sure.
not_available It could be a possible side effect of the medication.

not_available I'll be back.
not_available You want me to call your husband?

not_available We're heading into another ice age 
not_available like the one that killed the dinosaurs.
not_available Cold didn't kill them, cholesterol did.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ellison in Curtain 3 can go home.
not_available Miss Renfew in 4 needs to be admitted.
not_available Got a minute? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available I hope your day's shaping up better than mine.
not_available Doubt it.
not_available I picked up Rachel's laundry after you left and this fell out of her jeans.
not_available She's smoking.
not_available I doubt she uses it to light campfires.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Did you find anything else in her pockets? 
not_available No.
not_available What if it's not cigarettes? Her boyfriend tested positive for marijuana.
not_available Ex
not_available boyfriend.
not_available I'll search her room.
not_available Is that wise? Well, if she's doing drugs, I want to know about it.
not_available Asking her doesn't guarantee I'm gonna get the truth.
not_available But searching her room, that's such a violation of her privacy.
not_available You suggested I go through her pockets.
not_available In the course of doing laundry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Can we talk about this? 
not_available Come find me.
not_available Normal vitals.
not_available This is adorable.
not_available Don't you think? It's pretty cute.
not_available You wanna buy it? No.
not_available They won't let me send him any gifts.
not_available He must be getting pretty big now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, they sent a video of him walking, just before Christmas.
not_available Won't be long now before he's asking to borrow the keys to the car.
not_available You know, I'm starting to wonder if I'm making any right decisions lately.
not_available It's mid
not_available year.
not_available Something will open by spring.
not_available Well, maybe they'll open back up at County.
not_available Hey, cool.
not_available Have you seen these? These are really neat.
not_available John, what would you say if I told you I asked the waitress at Doc Magoo's if she remembered Weaver being paged the night we lost the Marfan case? I'd say that place is full of people with pagers.
not_available I know.
not_available I was desperate.
not_available So, what? She didn't remember? Not about Weaver getting paged.
not_available But she remembers Weaver coming back, looking for her pager and finding it in the bathroom.
not_available She couldn't answer my page, John, because she didn't have her pager.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available I believe it.
not_available Don't you? Yeah, that explains it.
not_available What are you gonna do? He died? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Did you know him? Only as Icicle Andy.
not_available I think he was a Vietnam vet.
not_available I heard bums are reincarnated as pigeons when they die.
not_available Really? I think it's the other way around.
not_available Check it out.
not_available Tickets to tonight's Blackhawks game.
not_available And they're good seats too.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Where did he get those? Any ID? Just two dollars, some change and matches.
not_available Are you gonna keep the tickets? 
not_available No.
not_available Can I have them? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I think it's called grave robbing.
not_available He ain't using them.
not_available Somebody might come to claim the body.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Seriously, I need them.
not_available No.
not_available Look, the tickets are only for tonight.
not_available Nobody's coming for this guy.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Oh, come on, Abby.
not_available Abby, look.
not_available He's straight
not_available up dead.
not_available Abby, can you take a look at something? 
not_available What patient? Mr.
not_available Paninski.
not_available Unstable angina.
not_available I called CCU.
not_available I wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.
not_available Did you do a rectal? 
not_available No.

not_available Sure.
not_available Abby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Richard.

not_available They're good.
not_available Good.
not_available That's good.
not_available You seeing anyone or? Oh, yeah.
not_available I'm breaking hearts all over town.
not_available What do you want, ex? Ex? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can I call you "ex"? Because it's almost like sexy, so people might think it's short for "ecstasy" or "triple X," which stands for porn now.
not_available Except for in cartoons where it stands for poison which I always thought was funny, but What do you want? Look, I Well, I wanted to talk to you in person so you didn't hear this through the grapevine.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What? 
not_available Are you going to jail? No.
not_available I'm getting married.
not_available Married? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You'd think I would've learned my lesson.

not_available It's kind of hard to believe.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Instant family.
not_available I always wanted kids.
not_available So Since when? You know, just a while.
not_available I guess we just never talked about it, you know? And you felt that today was the day you had to tell me about all this? Is today a bad day? Nope.
not_available So, what? Am I supposed to give you my blessing? 
not_available That's up to you.
not_available Well, I have to get back to work.
not_available Richard.
not_available I hope that it works out this time.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Aspen's great.
not_available There's three separate mountains.
not_available So you don't have to be an expert.
not_available What is that? What? Yeah, they got runs for every level.
not_available Is that your jaw? What? That clickclick
not_available click sound.

not_available Get out of here.
not_available I'm going back to work.
not_available I'll take care of this.
not_available You should see a dentist.
not_available Either that or you should find someone else to eat lunch with.
not_available I'm sorry about that.
not_available What? I should have said something sooner.
not_available It just sort of snuck up on me.
not_available I hate it when that happens.
not_available It's really more about friendship than anything else.
not_available Really? Never seen you kiss Frank like that.
not_available Abby
not_available Don't sweat it, Carter.
not_available Where's Frank? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Hey, Douglas.
not_available Did you find your mom? Are you getting hungry? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Would you like to eat pizza? A hamburger? My mom says fast food isn't good for you.
not_available Well, she's right, but the fast food we serve here at the hospital is specially formulated to be nutritious.
not_available So would you like some French fries? Okay.
not_available Sit tight.

not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It must be the damn hormones.
not_available I'm not usually a crier.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Sometimes being a woman sucks, you know? It has its moments.
not_available You grow up praying you don't get pregnant every time you have sex.
not_available And then when you finally do want to have a baby, you can't.
not_available It's so unfair.

not_available I'm being treated.
not_available I'm okay now.
not_available Great.
not_available I'm glad you're okay.
not_available I think I'm starting to get it.
not_available Although, that little puck is hard to keep track of.
not_available They should give it a color so your eye can follow it.
not_available What, the puck? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I mean, like bright pink or red or flashing lights or something.
not_available Okay, a flashing, pink puck.
not_available Well, why not?
