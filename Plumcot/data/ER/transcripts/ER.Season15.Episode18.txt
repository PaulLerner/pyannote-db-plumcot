INTERVlEWER About you.
not_available The people who work here.
not_available What you do.
not_available Okay.
INTERVlEWER How long have been at County?.
not_available I started about 1 5 years ago.
not_available That's actually kind of hard to believe.
not_available Wow.
INTERVlEWER Can you focus here?.
not_available Yep.
not_available Oh, here?.
not_available Y ep.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Oh, uh, I was a med student then and, uh.
not_available Well, the thing that you realize pretty soon is that you see it all you see the whole spectrum of human experience.
not_available Does that sound a little pretentious?.
not_available It did, right?.
not_available So pretentUh, well, you guys are gonna probably
not_available Anyway.
INTERVlEWER Go on.
not_available Yeah?.
not_available Good?.
not_available Um, well, whatever you can imagine, it happens here.
not_available Sometimes you're there for the end, and that part never gets easier.
not_available Uh, it can be the loneliest place in the world.
not_available Or where you go for a second chance.
not_available And every once in a while, if you're smart, or lucky, maybe you find exactly what you need right here.
not_available Come on, you can be a little late.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available What's so important?.
not_available Um, a murder investigation?.
not_available Oh, that's the best you can come up with?.

not_available You hate the way this place is decorated?.
not_available You're a man, okay?.
not_available Just get rid of the futon.
not_available I love that futon.

not_available It's like shades of feces.
not_available You know, that's all I'm saying.
not_available Ha, ha.
not_available I was a bachelor till very recently.
not_available Don't worry, Archie.
not_available I'll whip you into shape.
CARTER The one thing that you keep learning is that you can never think that you know what's coming.
CARTER Because when the rig rolls up and the doors pop open you have no idea what's inside.
BERNSTElN Diaz?.
not_available Diaz?.
not_available T alk to me.
not_available B541 2, my partner's been shot.

INTERVlEWER Uh, can we finish this later?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you can find me.
not_available The most common thing I see?.
not_available That's easy.
not_available Rectal insertions.
not_available Seriously.
not_available I say ""stat""
not_available Yeah, I say ""stat"" quite often.
not_available This guy, he was, um, high on PCP but he was, like, over seven feet tall and we had him strapped down on a gurney.
not_available I mean, the funny part is, is that it doesn't matter if it's a shampoo bottle, a light bulb, a whisk, whatever they always tell you the same 
story ""l fell on it.
not_available "" Thoracotomy, stat, ha, ha.
not_available ""l fell on it""?.
not_available And that guy got up and he had the gurney strapped to his back, ha, ha and he was chasing us all up and down the hall.
not_available Men.
not_available People in Australia can understand me, which is good.
not_available I've got an accent.
not_available Yes I have, um
not_available ""Just clerks""?.
not_available Those were his words.
not_available ""Just clerks""?.
not_available He said that we didn't count as emergency healthcare providers.
not_available He?.
not_available Who is this he?.
not_available The writer, I think?.
not_available Of a documentary?.
not_available Documentaries have writers?.
not_available Well, he pieces it together or something, I guess.
not_available That's what's wrong with television.
not_available He seemed like a pipsqueak to me.
not_available So you've met him?.
not_available He interviewed us yesterday.
not_available The nurses?.
not_available Got their own day?.
not_available Get over it, Frank.
not_available We go to school for this.
not_available That's it.
not_available If they can make own stupid reality show, so can l.
not_available Can't argue with that.
not_available Uh, l
not_available I don't think that's such a good idea.
not_available Here.
not_available Press and point.
not_available You know how to work these things.
not_available Okay, okay, but there's nothing wrong with a life lived out of the spotlight.
not_available A stack of files, a broken stapler, a three
not_available hole punch.
not_available But lives are saved and lost right here.
not_available It's a desk, Frank.
not_available Admit, the nerve center of the ER.
not_available What you're about to see is a document of those who serve as the gatekeepers.
not_available My name is Martin, Frank Martin.
not_available Jerry Markovic.
not_available The few, the proud.
not_available The desk clerks.
not_available That film crew get to you yet?.
not_available They just asked me boring questions about the effect of the economy.
not_available The effect is that people get poor then they use guns to get money, the ER stays busy.
GATES Now you tell me.
not_available What we getting?.
not_available I heard officer down.
not_available Detective.
not_available How'd he get shot?.
not_available He's a she.
NEWKlRK This one's ours.

not_available I think you guys know her.
GATES She and Morris have a thing.
not_available A thing?.
not_available Is that what it is?.
CARTER What happened here?.
not_available Son of a bitch shot me when I was walking away.
not_available I bit my damn tongue.

not_available Thank you for bringing breakfast.
not_available You know, this is nice, what you're doing.
not_available Oh, you like it?.
not_available You know, I was torn between an eggshell white and something bolder.
not_available Like a robin
not_available egg type thing.
not_available I sound gay.
not_available Not that there's anything wrong with that.
not_available You're nervous.
not_available Well, it's kind of risky, asking her to move in.
not_available Maybe she'll say no.
not_available I think any girl would appreciate a guy willing to repaint for her.
not_available How are things going with the Wonder From Down Under?.
not_available Good, I guess.
not_available As long as we don't talk much.
not_available Typical guy.
not_available Fellas have to have your deepest thoughts and feelings pried from your cold, dead fingers, but.
not_available Still, he's hard to figure.
not_available Well, it's understandable.
not_available You know, with what happened to him as a kid.
not_available I told him he needs to see somebody.
not_available Well, if you've been hurt like that, you know, sexually at a young age, it doesn't just go away on its own.
not_available Well, it's, um, good he confides in you.
not_available It's been hard for him moving to Chicago.
not_available There's you and there's me.
not_available That's basically his whole circle of friends.
not_available Real ones, anyway.
not_available Right.
not_available Wait, you didn't
not_available ?.
not_available He never told you?.
not_available lt, um
not_available Neela, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean tolt explains a lot, um
not_available I have get to work by 9.
not_available We've got a complicated triple
not_available A repair Dubenko wants me in on.
not_available No, Neela
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Hello?.
not_available Decrease on the right.
not_available Ten blade, sterile 8's and a
not_available And a chest
not_available tube tray.
not_available Hey.
not_available She took two shots.
not_available One in the buttock, one in the shoulder.
not_available An exit wound in the chest.
not_available I told you to get a desk job.
not_available Oh, uh.
not_available Bastard shot in the back.
not_available How's your partner?.
not_available All right.

not_available Whoa, whoa, half a liter out.
not_available All right, hold compressions.
not_available He's still asystole.
not_available Okay, start up.
not_available Let's hang another unit.
not_available Should we do a thoracotomy?.
not_available Aorta's transected.
not_available There isn't much point.
not_available It's worth a shot, isn't it?.
not_available When you're new, everything's a question.
not_available Even when you know you know something you say it with an inflection.
not_available It's never, ""Thoracotomy.
not_available "" It's more like, um, ""Thoracotomy?.
not_available "" 
not_available You got my smokes?.
not_available Hi.
not_available The orderly said he could get me a carton of Salems for the right price.
not_available That was two days ago.
not_available I hate smoking these things.
not_available Taste like wet leaves.
not_available Where's Carlos?.
not_available I was, uh, kind of hoping today would be the day you remember me.
not_available I remember you well enough.
not_available I'm your daughter.
not_available I'm Sam.
not_available I said, I know who you are.
not_available They told me you've been around.
not_available That's good.
not_available You're more alert.
not_available Yeah, this place is like a dream come true.
not_available I feel like I won the Super Lotto.
not_available Turn off my tank for me, would you?.
not_available You can't smoke in here.
not_available It's against the rules.
not_available What?.
not_available So it's your turn now, is that right?.
not_available I just wanna make sure that you're okay.
not_available Kelly and I both do.
not_available Kelly never left.
not_available Kelly stayed home and took care of me.
not_available I don't know what you've been doing.
not_available You kicked me out.
not_available I didn't.
not_available You called me a whore and a slut.
not_available I didn't belong to you anymore.
not_available You didn't care what happened to me.
not_available You were always dramatic.
not_available You told me no one would even notice I was gone.
not_available I was 1 5 years old.
not_available What happened to that baby of yours?.
not_available His name's Alex.
not_available Alex?.
not_available When a head injury rolls into the ER, every minute counts.
not_available And, um
not_available Delays.
not_available T alk about delays.
not_available A delay of even 1 5 minutes can mean the difference between life Hey.
not_available and death.
HALEH Here's the pelvic film.
not_available Brenner's calling it next door.
not_available The guy lost a lot of blood.
not_available Ahem, how we doing in here?.
CLAUDlA I can't stay.
not_available I'm late for a meeting.
not_available She's not lucid.
not_available They lose him?.
HALEH Yeah.
not_available Well, I bet no one will miss him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come on, a guy died.
not_available Bullet traversed the pelvis.
not_available Could have hit it.
not_available Or the bladder or the uterus on the way through.
not_available Where's Surgery?.
not_available ln the OR.
not_available They promised they'd send someone in few minutes.
not_available There's fluid around the liver.
not_available Tachy at 1 34.
CARTER Hang a unit, type specific.
not_available Gonna need an ex
not_available lap.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Let's CT her.
not_available It's gonna take time for the surgeons.
not_available She could be out of the scanner in 1 O minutes.
not_available Of course.
not_available Mac 4 and 7.5.
MORRlS lntubate?.
not_available Protect her airway.
GATES Airway's fine.
not_available Don't know.
not_available Lungs are re
not_available expanded.
not_available This isn't the time.
not_available This is the time.
not_available He's right.
not_available You're right.
not_available Laryngoscope and a tray, please.
not_available How's she doing?.
MORRlS How's it look?.
not_available Hang in there, Diaz.
MORRlS What happened?.
not_available We were taking statements on a murder case.
not_available Some guy started shooting through the door.
not_available Can I get that laryngoscope?.
MORRlS Where were you?.
BERNSTElN Right next to her.
MORRlS Not a scratch.
not_available What a lucky guy.
BERNSTElN Problem?.
not_available Not as long as you had her back.
not_available Think about slowing your roll.
not_available ls that what I wanna do?.
not_available Take it from me.
not_available A badge beats a lab coat any day.
not_available Band of brothers, right?.
not_available Where's your chief?.
not_available The department?.
not_available On their way, pal.
not_available Ease up.
not_available This guy always such an asshole?.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available You wanna get into it with me?.
JERRY All right.
not_available You got us both in frame there, Boris?.
not_available Composition not ideal.
not_available You are freakishly tall and Frank's head is square like block of wood.
not_available Thanks for the input, Spielberg.
not_available In this segment, we are going to highlight some of the unsung heroes of the ER.
not_available First up is Sadiq, the computer guy.
not_available Sadiq Gilbran
not_available Hassani, I'm not just the computer guy.
not_available My family has illustrious history in Syria before we were forced out.
not_available Uh, let's just try to stay on point, Sadiq, okay?.
not_available Without me, there'd be no timely lab results or x
not_available ray readings which are crucial in saving of life.
not_available You let me know when I can speak again, hey, Uncle Sam?.
not_available Thank you, Sadiq.
not_available You're the boss.
not_available And this is Crystal Hung, pharmacy tech.
not_available Okay, when a doctor says, ""l need an amp of lidocaine,"" a nurse goes to get it.
not_available If there's no lidocaine, it's a problem.
not_available I put the lidocaine in the cart, every damn day.
not_available So that's that.
not_available Interesting.
not_available Very interesting.
not_available And here we have good old Fred T ennyson custodial service engineer and catcher for the ER softball team.
not_available I switch out whatever's broken.
not_available Like light bulbs.
not_available Without light bulbs, it's hard to see.
not_available And doctors, they
not_available Well, you know, they need to see stuff.
not_available And, uh, here we have, um 
not_available uh, from the cafeteria.
not_available And without food we would all go hungry.
not_available And on, uh, camera we have Boris from, uh, Media Services.
not_available Please leave me out of this.
not_available This is horrible.
not_available When was your last dialysis?.
not_available Dialysis?.
MORRlS Banfield thought I should know.
not_available It was two days ago.
not_available I'm not due for another four hours.
not_available Must be fluid overloaded since he's not making urine.
not_available Waiting on kidney transplant?.
not_available Yes.
not_available Any fever?.
not_available No.
not_available Increased salt or fluid intake?.
not_available Maybe an extra sip of coffee.
not_available I had a handful of popcorn.
not_available Nothing crazy.
not_available Sometimes this kind of thing is idiopathic.
not_available lt can happen when on chronic dialysis.
not_available I know.
MARQUEZ Systolic's down to 92.
MORRlS Let's get Nephrology here.
not_available And grab the ultrasound.
not_available If there's a big effusion, we need to tap it.
not_available Get my nephrologist, Gustavo Petrov at Northwestern.
not_available Anyone else you want us to call?.
not_available No.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Pelvic trajectory goes through the soft tissues.
not_available Could have bagged the arteries.
not_available I need the ultrasound.
not_available How's she doing?.
not_available She needs angio.
not_available She should go to the OR.
not_available Didn't enter the peritoneum.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's not argue here.
not_available I'm not denying she needs surgery.
not_available I'm saying 
not_available that let's look at the iliacs first.
not_available There's no hematoma.
not_available What if she's bleeding in OR?.
not_available We'll deal with it.
not_available You've got vascular standing by?.
not_available Did you listen to a word?.
not_available You're not thinking things through.
not_available No?.
not_available No.
not_available We've got time to be systematic.
not_available Systematic?.
not_available Angio, retrograde cystogram.
not_available Let's not lose our head
not_available Calm down and make a decision.
not_available Archie, it's your call.
not_available Angio or surgery?.
not_available You guys need to decide this.
not_available Bone fragments in the bladder wall.
not_available She needs the OR.
not_available The pace down here is visceral.
not_available It demands being instinctive in the moment.
not_available I prefer having time to think something through hash out different possible versions, make a plan.
not_available I mean, that's why I'm better at being a surgeon than I was strictly working in the ER.
not_available You're gonna get in trouble if they catch you doing that.
not_available Maybe they'll throw me out.
not_available You know, if you don't want me here, you should just say so.
not_available It's not like I'm gonna leave, but at least we could talk about it.
not_available Why don't we just try to forget our mistakes and wipe the slate clean.
not_available Mistakes?.
not_available What mistakes?.
not_available The ones that we both made.
not_available Speak for yourself.
not_available All right, you know what?.
not_available I' m not gonna sit and play along with you as the martyr and me as the evil child.
not_available You don't have to sit here at all.
not_available I was young and dumb and in love, Mom.
not_available I believed everything he said.
not_available I raised you better than that.
not_available I raised you better than that.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available You actually know you didn't.
not_available What is this?.
not_available It's all wet?.
not_available Did you spill something?.
not_available Leave it.
not_available I'll get somebody to clean it up.
not_available No.
not_available It's what they get paid for.
not_available I don't want the staff in here.
not_available I said stop.
not_available It's disgusting.
not_available It's not.
not_available Leave it.
not_available Would you please get out of here, you bitch?.
not_available Get out.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Get out.
not_available Mary, I was coming to get you for Flex and Fun.
not_available You ready?.
not_available Do I look like I'm ready for Flex and Fun, you idiot?.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So your mother's stroke affected her frontal lobe.
not_available Do you know what that is?.
not_available Y es, I'm a nurse.
not_available Oh, I thought you were in fashion.
not_available No, that's my sister.
not_available Heh.
not_available I didn't realize there were two of you.
not_available Anyway, what we see with frontal lobe injuries is the filters come down.
not_available The ability to self
not_available censor, be empathetic, sensitive, all tends to be affected.
not_available Yeah, I know what you're getting at.
not_available So the things that she says, it's not really her.
not_available It's the stroke talking.
not_available It changed her.
not_available I appreciate what you're saying, I do.
not_available But the thing is, uh my mother hasn't changed a bit.
not_available What you see in there, that's who I grew up with.
not_available That's exactly how I remember her.
not_available A bit more angle on the needle.
not_available Eureka.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available We'll, uh, do a liver lac, then explore the pelvis.
not_available Urology will fix the bladder.
not_available GYN will scrub in to address the uterine issue.
not_available Primary repair will get it done?.
not_available I hope so.
not_available But she may need a hysterectomy.
not_available Well, whatever you have to do.
not_available Okay.
not_available She has four units cross
not_available matched.
not_available We'll have them sent up with her.
not_available OR's ready.
not_available I hate the fact that you put yourself in danger every day.
not_available Every time you do, I'm so proud of you.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available How's it going?.
GATES Fluid is serosanguineous and Johnny boy here is a backseat driver.

not_available I'm trying to remain professional.
not_available If you're not walking away within three seconds I swear to God, I may start doing compressions on your head.
not_available I spent a lot of years in the Army, jumping out of choppers and I thought I was a team player.
not_available But I wasn't.

not_available No matter what.
not_available You won't go through this alone.
not_available You do what you gotta do.
not_available We all have our cross to bear.
not_available The UNOS list can take a long time.
not_available Have you thought about direct donation?.
not_available Yeah, I've considered it.
not_available And?.
not_available Your wife not a match?.
not_available If not, we have a paired organ
not_available donor program.
not_available The two of you could qualify.
not_available Y eah, I'm aware of that program.
not_available I just haven't talked to Kem about that yet.
not_available There's very little risk in testing.
not_available Well, it's just not something we're in a place to get together on right now.
not_available Oh.
not_available Does she know about your status?.
not_available She knows that I have some medical issues and I came back to Chicago.
not_available She's in France.
not_available She's visiting her family.
not_available I left the whole thing kind of vague.
not_available Okay.
not_available I will shut up now.
not_available I'm just kind of tired.
not_available I'll split.
not_available Pull that curtain for me?.

not_available Not a problem.

not_available You know, you're not such an ass as some people say.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Um, what were we talking about?.
not_available Oh.
not_available But, you know, eventually, I started to figure things out as a doctor.
not_available You know, and how I fit in professionally with this place in this community of people, you know.
not_available That's a big, big part of it, for me is, uh, being good with yourself and who you are, and who you're meant to be.
not_available You know, finding yourself.
not_available And then there's the next step after that which is finding somebody else.
not_available And sometimes you 
think ""You know, that's just
not_available That's never gonna happen for me.
not_available "" Then you meet someone who makes you feel you know.
not_available Who gets you and you get her.
not_available Someone you can imagine.
not_available S
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available People think all we do is scrub poop and vomit off the floor.
not_available But I refill the paper towels, the toilet papers stock the soap, the dispensers.
not_available Without clean hands, you get lots of bad infections.
not_available She's right.
not_available Nosocomial infections cause over He knows.
not_available So, boys, what's this all about?.
not_available Oh, the interview guy said that we were non
not_available essential staff.
not_available Non
not_available essential?.
not_available We're offering a rebuttal.
not_available You're essential.
not_available You're quintessential.
not_available Um, yeah.
not_available I'm sure you'll set him straight.
not_available Let me get a little rest, eh?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available I think this lady's having an allergic reaction or something.
not_available Uh, okay, we'll page somebody.
not_available Let's put her right over here.
FRANK Let's get Morris.
JERRY Morris is upstairs.
FRANK How about Brenner?.

not_available This is getting weird.
not_available Peanut.
not_available Peanuts.
not_available It's a peanut allergy.
not_available I knew a kid who had this in school.
not_available And?.
not_available He died.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available She's not moving any air.
not_available We need help.
JERRY Uh, uh.
not_available No, we don't.
MARGlE Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, in your face, reality boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do we look non
not_available essential now?.
not_available I thought you'd be upstairs working on Claudia.
not_available Uh, Urology is doing the bladder reconstruction.
not_available They swapped me out for their own resident.
not_available Ah.
not_available I'm, uh, going on a heart retrieval so I figured I'd grab a coffee before the airport.
not_available A heart retrieval for Joanie?.
not_available Yeah, it's good news.
not_available That's fantastic.
not_available The, uh, heart's in Seattle, so we won't be back until the middle of the night.
not_available Are we all right?.
not_available What do you think?.
not_available Well, um, that something's bothering you.
not_available Clever twist.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Explain it to me.
not_available Hey, how is my being worried about you a twist?.
not_available Because you keep turning everything around.
not_available I, uh
not_available I don't think I'm smart enough to fight with you.
not_available Like that.
not_available You're plenty smart enough, but right now it's easier to make me seem hyper
not_available analytical.
not_available This morning, it wasn't going your way, so I was irrational.
not_available I never said you
not_available I'm the one bothered by something.
not_available I'm the one refusing to have a reasonable conversation and I'm the one who doesn't make sense.
not_available It's all a defense mechanism.
not_available Defense?.
not_available Defense for what?.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Something you haven't told me?.
not_available I don't tell anyone everything.
not_available Then what are we doing?.
not_available We hit a speed bump weeks ago and you react by disappearing.
not_available We see each other all the time.
not_available We talk, we sleep together.
not_available There's a way to do all those things and still disappear.
not_available Why would I wanna do that?.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Now, Neela, there are things that should be kept private.
not_available Not between two people trying to figure out if they belong together.
not_available Now, I am comfortable with you.
not_available Well, maybe that's not enough.
not_available Not when I have to find out things important things, about you from other people.
not_available Oh, so that's it, that's it, is it?.
not_available I'm not chatty enough so you go snooping 
not_available trying to get under my skin?.
not_available It's not like that.
not_available Make me be what you think a boyfriend should be?.
not_available Sharing my emotions and talking about every stupid damn thing that bothers me?.
not_available No.
not_available No! Look, a terrible thing was done to you.
not_available I understand that.
not_available I hate that it happened.
not_available But somewhere in all of what's gone on between us, one thing is clear we're not meant to be together.
not_available It doesn't mean we don't care about each other deeply.
not_available You know, I truly believe there's something better out there for both of us whenever we're ready for it.
not_available Better?.
not_available Something more right.
not_available Northwestern, huh?.
not_available T oo good for County.
not_available Well, what can I say, Frank.
not_available I've seen how you care for your patients here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris says to make sure they check another potassium 
not_available as soon as you get there.
not_available Thanks, Haleh.
not_available We're gonna see you soon, right?.
not_available Not if I see you first.
not_available Folks, it's only a mile away.
not_available You can visit him when we're not on the clock.
not_available Um.
not_available Primary repair worked.
not_available So I guess the world can look forward to a gaggle of olive
not_available skinned kids with red hair and freckles.
not_available You know, if that's something that you want.
not_available The life you lead, the things that you have been through they define how you do your job.
not_available The quality of
not_available The quality of your work.
not_available Especially in a place like this.
not_available So at the, uh.
not_available At the end of the day, you choose to, ahem, deny or deal.
INTERVlEWER And which do you choose?.
not_available It's evolving.
not_available I'm evolving.
not_available Um.
not_available All I know is that I know, um that there is a lot of work that I need to do.
not_available Can you be more specific about that?.
not_available No.
not_available Not with you.
GATES Mrs.
not_available Taggart.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Tony Gates.
not_available I work with Sam.
not_available I used to play.
not_available You know, at Christmas time, I'd play the carols.
not_available It's all gone now.
not_available Yeah, well, Sam wanted me to get this back to you.
not_available Well, she said she was coming by.
not_available Well, she, uh, can't tonight.
not_available She's on a work call.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available And you are?.
not_available I am a friend.
not_available A friend?.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Do you smoke?.
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available I don't.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available You're a good
not_available looking fellah though, aren't you?.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Must be the lighting in here.
not_available Do you know that out of all these people in here I'm the youngest one by about 1 5 years.
not_available What the hell did I do to deserve this?.
not_available I can't imagine.
not_available I don't want her to stop coming.
not_available So if she thinks that's so, you tell her it's not.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know, Sam's an amazing person.
not_available She's very strong, she's overcome a lot of obstacles.
not_available When you get to know her, you'd be very proud.
not_available She hates me.
not_available No, she doesn't.
not_available Well, she thinks that I hate her.
not_available Then change that.
not_available Sure.
not_available Ta
not_available da.
not_available Change.
not_available Well, it's up to you.
not_available Have a good night.
MARY Hey.
not_available You're not lying, are you?.
not_available She's gonna come back tomorrow?.
not_available When Sam makes up her mind, nothing stops her.
not_available I love helping people.
not_available You know, originally, I wanted to be the first baseman for the Chicago Cubs.
not_available The thing I hate most about my job?.
INTERVlEWER Mm
not_available hm.
not_available The smells.
not_available The smells.
not_available Human body's got some pretty interesting smells.
not_available What's the dating life like?.
not_available Ha.
not_available Well, I'm not gonna tell you.
not_available It's personal.
not_available A patient is a patient.
not_available Um, pain is pain.
not_available It's universal.
not_available And I reached a point about five years ago where I started to feel that every day was the same thing.
not_available And I'd had enough.
not_available But I've been through a lot of stuff since then.
not_available And now I try to embrace the idea that everything that happens has never happened before.
not_available Like that saying that you can't stand in the same river twice because by the time that you come back it's not the same river.
not_available And you're not the same man.
not_available Anyway I look around this place now and I can't imagine ever finding it boring.
not_available Because right at the moment that you think you've seen it all something happens that you never could have expected.
