not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available My car's up the street.
not_available You want a ride? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, you're back.
not_available Hide your wild enthusiasm of my return.
not_available I find overt displays of emotion embarrassing.
not_available Did you even think about me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available What did you think? Where am I going? Give this to Abby when you see her.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 10x03 "DEAR ABBY" On any given day, this Emergency Department will treat 300 patients.
not_available Another 40 will leave without ever being seen.
not_available In order to not get buried, you have to maintain adequate patient flow.
not_available This all starts with the nurses.
not_available Treat them with respect, they'll get you through your shift.
not_available Treat them as your personal scut slaves, you'll be lucky to get out alive.
not_available Triage is our first line of defense.
not_available Patients are signed in and vitaled 
not_available by whoever's working the cage.
not_available The cage? Like a shark cage.
not_available You can see them circling around, but they can't get you.
not_available When is Kovac getting here? 
not_available Flight should land at 7:30.
not_available What about Carter? Can you rack this? Triage nurse starts the chart, which is then racked at Admit.
not_available Put your name in for the lottery.
not_available Once the patients are brought back their name is put on the board, along with time, location and chief complaint.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt is also a second
not_available year Resident.
not_available Pratt, this is three of our new R
not_available 2s.
not_available Sofun, Morris, Cooper.
not_available Welcome to the zoo.
not_available What do I give a 10year
not_available old with road rash? Acetaminophen's easy on the stomach, but ibuprofen's better for inflammation.
not_available Med students work up patients and present them to Residents.
not_available You can mentor, but ultimately every case has to be looked at by an Attending.
not_available I know my rights! This is assault and battery! 
not_available I'm coming back for you, bitch.
not_available Yeah, yeah 
not_available bring me a latte when you do.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis is one of our Attendings.
not_available We usually we have two working.
not_available They have to sign off on every case.
not_available Don't remind me.
not_available Secondyear Residents? 
not_available Cooper, Sofun, Morris.
not_available Grab a chart.
not_available Abby, could you set up the airway box in Exam 3 so they can practice assembling laryngoscopes? Nursing orders go there.
not_available Clerk orders go here.
not_available These are two of our clerks, Jerry and Frank.
not_available Please don't feed them.
not_available When you're done, the discharge rack is over here.
not_available Any questions? Yeah, why is the board seethrough? 
not_available So we can see through it.
not_available Remind me not to get sick anytime soon.
not_available The ambulance pick Luka up yet? 
not_available An hour ago.
not_available They should be here soon.
not_available He need a bed down here? 
not_available No, no, they got one for him upstairs.
not_available Have you seen the new schedule? I'm only working four shifts in two weeks.
not_available I only got three.
not_available How many do I have? Two? 
not_available We're starting a petition.
not_available We got more beds, but fewer nurses.
not_available Romano's cutting senior nurse hours 
not_available so he can bring in cheaper travelers.
not_available You need to talk to him.
not_available You lost the Triage lottery, Abby.
not_available You got the cage from 9 to 1.
not_available Come on, no way.
not_available I lose every time.
not_available That's, like, statistically impossible.
not_available Abby! What? How you doing, Luka? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Welcome back, man.
not_available Africa agrees with you.
not_available I need you to help me with a GI bleeder.
not_available Two minutes.
not_available Let me say hi to Luka.
not_available Sir, you have to stay in bed.
not_available Here, lie down.
not_available Lie down.
not_available I need sedation orders over here.
not_available I think Mrs.
not_available Dunn's in labor.
not_available She's only 36 weeks.
not_available Explain Braxton Hicks contractions to her.
not_available Her water broke.
not_available Did you nitrazine it? 
not_available No, I was helping her to the bathroom.
not_available Well, page OB and call an Attending.
not_available Please, somebody, help me! Hi.
not_available Okay, breathe.
not_available Don't push.
not_available It's too early.
not_available No, 36 weeks is what we start calling "normal term.
not_available " All right, try and relax.
not_available I'm gonna do a quick exam.
not_available I need a fetal monitor and an IV.
not_available Okay.
not_available I got it.
not_available Lewis needs that in Curtain 1.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Show me how to set the slitlamp? 
not_available Yup, just one second.
not_available Luka.
not_available Hey, I think this old lady stopped breathing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, hi.
not_available How are you today? 
not_available I'm busy.
not_available How's the stump feeling? It's suffering from delusions of grandeur.
not_available It still thinks it's an arm.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Your new prosthesis.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just assumed as a prosthetist that you would have some rudimentary knowledge of medicine.
not_available I have a degree in bioengineering.
not_available Well, then you have a vague civilian concept of what doctors do.
not_available I'm a surgeon.
not_available That's why I was specific about needing a Utah Arm.
not_available Your hospital insurance won't cover a myoelectric device.
not_available I lost my arm on the roof of this damn hospital 
not_available trying to save a patient's life.
not_available They require proof you can't get by 
not_available with a traditional device.
not_available What do I do? Am I supposed to just duct
not_available tape a coat hanger to my stump? I can prepare another letter to insurance.
not_available I've got two letters for you and the insurance company, F and U.
not_available It's hurting my arm.
not_available A little bit longer.
not_available Why can't I just have my prescription filled without being tortured? 
not_available How much longer? My back's killing me.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available I don't wanna miss my turn.
not_available Then you should sit down.
not_available Okay, put this in your mouth.
not_available Be a good girl, Ilanna.
not_available Open your mouth.
not_available I think it was a black widow.
not_available Darren, don't touch that.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Darren, stop it.
not_available Give me that.
not_available Is it almost my time? No.
not_available Tell her.
not_available Tell the nurse what you ate, Lisa.
not_available Well, go on.
not_available Tell her.
not_available Maybe you should, Mrs.
not_available Brandenburg.
not_available I brought my own urine sample to save time.
not_available Could I at least get a sandwich? 
not_available How did you get back here? Security! Hey, wake up! She's getting worse.
not_available Do you have asthma, Elle? 
not_available No.
not_available Anybody sick at home? Any fevers? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay, deep breaths.
not_available How long have you had that cough? 
not_available Since we went camping.
not_available A few weeks, maybe.
not_available She lets herself get rundown, and she doesn't eat enough.
not_available What's that? The oxygen level in your blood is a little bit low which can happen with infection.
not_available Frank, what's open? 
not_available Curtain 1.
not_available Okay, I'm taking this one back.
not_available Come on, Elle.
not_available Gonna put you in a bed, get you some oxygen and that should make you feel better.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available Ryser and her daughter, Elle.
not_available Shortness of breath, sats are 86, bibasilar rales.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you grab a Resident? I think an Attending should take a look at her.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Come on this way.
not_available The rest of her vitals okay? Tachy at 116.
not_available BP's 98/52.
not_available A &amp; O times three.
not_available What are rales? It's the sound fluid makes when it's in your lungs.
not_available That doesn't sound good.
not_available It's probably just pneumonia.
not_available Great.
not_available She never dresses warm enough and she's always going out with wet hair.
not_available Mom, please.
not_available All right, let's get a chest.
not_available I'll be back to do a full exam, okay? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Are you coming back? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And don't worry.
not_available The only thing you can catch from wet hair is split ends.
not_available Yeah, send her up for a chest and draw a CBC.
not_available How's Luka? 
not_available I haven't had a chance to get upstairs.
not_available If you do go upstairs, let me know and maybe I can come.
not_available Okay.
not_available Have you talked to him? Luka? 
not_available No, Romano.
not_available We gave him the petition.
not_available You better do something or you're gonna have a mutiny on your hands.
not_available As soon as I can, I will.
not_available I promise.
not_available Frank, where'd they send Kovac? 
not_available Five West.
not_available He looks good.
not_available You saw him? Just popped my head in to welcome him back.
not_available Wouldn't hurt you to do the same thing.
not_available Hi, could I get an update on a patient, please? Kovac.
not_available KOVA
not_available C.
not_available Right, malaria.
not_available He's still spiking on quinine but lucid between fevers.
not_available And he's asking for a meatball sub.
not_available Either he's delirious or hungry.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Gillian.
not_available Abby.
not_available Oh, you're Abby? John talked a lot about you.
not_available John Carter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Who did you say you were? I'm sorry.
not_available You don't know.
not_available I'm Gillian.
not_available I was working with Luka and John in the Congo.
not_available Oh, I have something for you.
not_available John asked Luka to give you this.
not_available He wrote me a letter? 
not_available Now, there's a lost art.
not_available Well, it's hard to find a phone and when you do, they seldom work.
not_available Where do I find Dr.
not_available Magoo's? 
not_available You don't.
not_available It burned down.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Nance, I'm taking my break.
not_available Am I interrupting? Your assistant wasn't at his desk.
not_available We're in the middle of a meeting.
not_available That's why you haven't returned my pages.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Jeez.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Let me get that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stop.
not_available You know what? I'm not good at using this thing.
not_available Maybe if the hospital's workers' comp had covered a myoelectric arm, it would be better.
not_available What do I have to do? Pay for it myself? That'd make a good news story, huh? Amputee surgeon has to pay for his arm to work in the hospital where he lost it.
not_available It's not the place or time to discuss this.
not_available You're right.
not_available I've got a lot of patients in the ER.
not_available That's where using this hook really gets dicey.
not_available Wish me luck.
not_available Hopefully I won't take someone's eye out with this thing.
not_available We're staging a walkout.
not_available Meeting at Dunkin' Donuts to plan.
not_available If we don't take a stand, they're gonna replace us with parttime nurses 
not_available so they don't have to pay benefits.
not_available Yeah, they're welcome to replace me.
not_available Is anybody working here today? 
not_available Talk to Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available I will.
not_available A joker just fainted in the waiting area.
not_available Took a header into an end table.
not_available There's blood everywhere.
not_available Abby? Why are you telling me this? Well, according to my watch, your break is over.
not_available That's right.
not_available Leave me to pick up after you.
not_available Hey, wait.
not_available Hold up, hold up.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I just ran down from CT.
not_available You're Pratt? Nick Cooper, second
not_available year Resident.
not_available Friends call me Coop.
not_available Plastics or Head and Neck for an unstable mandible fracture? Call them both.
not_available Take whoever is first.
not_available What do I tell the other? 
not_available Patient left.
not_available They'll be happy.
not_available It's one less consult for their team.
not_available Cool.
not_available You new guys got to start picking it up.
not_available It's only 10:30, we're already 20 patients behind.
not_available I got six.
not_available The other two are slow.
not_available Morris has an LOL with abdominal pain and altered mental status.
not_available It's a big workup, possible LP.
not_available Sofun's still getting the lay of the land.
not_available They're killing me.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Look, we'll blast through these.
not_available Let me see what you got.
not_available Epistaxis and vertigo.
not_available Nasal pack for the nosebleed, Meclizine for the vertigo.
not_available They're out the door in 20.
not_available How's it going? Rather deep.
not_available I used a 4
not_available 0 Vicryl subq.
not_available Nice.
not_available What was that that you were just saying? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I heard you talking to him.
not_available It was a prayer.
not_available He's not dying.
not_available It wasn't for him.
not_available It's a private prayer.
not_available Oh, something 
like "Please, Lord, don't let me kill somebody today"? Somewhere along those lines? Neela, I need you to run down to Medical Records and get Mr.
not_available Perkins' old chart.
not_available If you can't find that Cardiology should have his last EKG on file on the fifth floor.
not_available He's got anemia and renal insufficiency, so print out his BUN, creatinine 
not_available and CBC trends for the last two years.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey there.
not_available Don't forget.
not_available Dinner tonight, 8:00.
not_available Oh, they have a dress code, so wear something nice.
not_available How nice? I'm wearing my little black dress.
not_available I think I'm in.
not_available You think? No, no.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Hey.
not_available How come I wasn't invited to this party? Hook up the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay, what's next? You want 0 silk? 
not_available Yes, 0 silk.
not_available Girl's in 2's x
not_available rays.
not_available You better check it out.
not_available Not good.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Tachypneic girl in 2.
not_available Huge heart.
not_available Call Cards.
not_available She's in failure.
not_available I don't think this is normal.
not_available Maybe it's a brain tumor.
not_available I've tried everything.
not_available I can't stop drooling.
not_available I'm out.
not_available A nurse will be with you in one minute.
not_available Hey, what about that sandwich? What about it? Where's Amanda? She's supposed to relieve me at 1.
not_available The nurses are over at Dunkin' Donuts plotting some kind of a coup.
not_available Hey, did you sign this? 
not_available No.
not_available Smart girl.
not_available Should have.
not_available I want everyone on this petition in the lounge in five minutes.
not_available They staged a walkout.
not_available They're on a break.
not_available For over an hour? 
not_available Well, page them.
not_available Anyone who's not back in five minutes is fired.
not_available You can't fire nurses.
not_available I can if they walk off the job.
not_available I'll go get them.
not_available Hey, you got a hook.
not_available Suits you.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Nobody's called my name yet.
not_available They will.
not_available Would it help if I gave a stool sample too? No, just Are you a nurse? Checkin's at TriageWhat happened to you? 
not_available Somebody shot me.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay, sit down, sit down.
not_available I need a gurney.
not_available What's your name? What's your name? 
not_available Bobby.
not_available Okay, Bobby.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't let me die.

not_available I won't.
not_available I won't.
not_available Okay.
not_available Who shot you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Dumped by a homeboy ambulance.
not_available You're gonna have to hold still.
not_available We need to tube him.
not_available Well, get that line in, and I will.
not_available Bobby? Bobby? Bobby, open your eyes.

not_available No, not yet.
not_available Tube.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm prepping the chest.
not_available All right, I'm in the hole.
not_available Bag him up, Abby.
not_available Where's Lewis? Abby, crash cart, now! Sorry, I had a hot Ml.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Talk to Abby.
not_available I'm putting in a chest tube.
not_available He was talking, now he's arresting.
not_available Good breath sounds, airway secure, hypotensive.
not_available Okay, run the code, Pratt.
not_available What are you gonna do, crack him by yourself? Get Corday and order some more O

not_available There he goes again.
not_available Hey, I have an idea.
not_available How about a thoracotomy? "Wow, that is just so crazy, Abby, it might work.
not_available " There's only 300 cc's out the chest.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available Look out! Prep for a thoracotomy.
not_available He's already prepped.
not_available Ten blade, now.
not_available First incision is in the fourth intercostal space from the lateral sternum 
not_available to the posterior axillary line.
not_available Clear.
not_available What's Carter mean by "unfettered"? 
not_available It means she's been dumped.
not_available Did you get rid of those nurses? 
not_available They went to Nursing Administration saying something about hiring a hit man.
not_available Hell hath no fury like an RN scorned.
not_available Whose patient is this? 
not_available She's mine.
not_available Well, get her back in bed and use restraints if you have to.
not_available It's okay.
not_available She's harmless.
not_available Can you sign off on a wound infection?

not_available Go away and take her with you.

not_available I'm Nick Cooper.
not_available Coop.
not_available I'm a new Resident.
not_available I didn't realize who you were.
not_available Do me a favor would you, Coop? Air Rescue's bringing in a bad MVA.
not_available Go up on the roof.
not_available Wave in the chopper.
not_available Stand in the middle of the landing pad so they see you.
not_available You're Rocket Romano.
not_available You were a surgeon.
not_available Used to be chief of staff.
not_available I still am a surgeon.
not_available Yeah, you got scalpel attachments for that bad boy? I'm right
not_available handed.
not_available Lucky.
not_available This guy's 10 days
not_available Let's get a few things straight.
not_available One, we don't offer remedial medicine here.
not_available Two, you don't talk to me.
not_available I talk to you.
not_available Three
not_available Should I be writing this down? Stay out of my face! Thirty again.
not_available Clear.
not_available Fine V
not_available fib.
not_available More like coarse asystole.
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available Units five and six are up.
not_available How long's it been? Thirty
not_available five minutes.
not_available Should be able to shock him into sinus.
not_available Hold CPR.
not_available There's nothing to shock.
not_available High
not_available dose epi might coarsen his rhythm.
not_available He's been down too long.
not_available He's young and healthy.
not_available With fatal wounds.
not_available His hilum and aorta are cross
not_available clamped.
not_available We've replaced his volume and maxed out on atropine and epi.
not_available He walked in here.
not_available He was talking to me.
not_available That's it.
not_available Time of 
death 1336.
not_available Abby, can you try and locate the family? I was coming down the ladder and I stepped on the cord to my sander.
not_available I only fell about 3 feet, but I twisted my ankle pretty good.
not_available And my collarbone's killing me.
not_available Well, let's take a look.
not_available Okay.
not_available Heard about your run
not_available in with Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Someone should have warned you.
not_available He's quite a character.
not_available That's one word for him.
not_available What were you sanding? 
not_available The hull of a boat.
not_available Fiberglass? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you all right? Hey, Coop, you ready to present some cases? 
not_available His asthma is acting up.
not_available All right, give him an albuterol treatment.
not_available Then come find me.
not_available We have to clear this board.
not_available So, what's the story? 
not_available Call Respiratory to set up nitric oxide.
not_available Give her more Lasix and start an isoproterenol drip.
not_available Wait.
not_available What? 
not_available She has primary pulmonary hypertension.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Can you even diagnose PPHN from an echo? If you know what to look for.
not_available We'll cath her in the lab to be 100 percent.
not_available Tough break.
not_available Seemed like a nice kid.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hennesy in Exam 3 needs a Foley and an IV.
not_available CBC and chem panel on Gininni in Curtain 4.
not_available And that scalp
not_available lac kid in the Suture Room needs a setup.
not_available Am I the only nurse working today? 
not_available Close.
not_available Romano fired six.
not_available Oh, so that leaves four of us for 35 patients.
not_available Looks like you dodged a bullet.
not_available Hey, I'm sorry about the thoracotomy on that kid.
not_available Didn't seem to make a difference.
not_available Maybe if we'd done it sooner.
not_available You reached the parents? 
not_available No.
not_available Hey, you know, for what it's worth, I think it's Carter's loss.
not_available What? 
not_available Do you know where my parents are? They went to talk to the doctor.
not_available They said they'd only be a few minutes, but that was a while ago.
not_available Why don't you hop back into bed and I'll find them.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I think he's getting even tighter.
not_available Try not to talk.
not_available Slow, deep breaths.
not_available Epi.
not_available Epi.
not_available Subq epinephrine? 
not_available Point three.
not_available His nebulizer's dry.
not_available Okay, we'll try five of albuterol this time.
not_available Push it.
not_available Little stick here, Coop.
not_available Too much.
not_available Too much.
not_available We gave you 0.3.
not_available You said push it all.
not_available You gave 1 milligram? 
not_available That's over three times the dose.
not_available I'll get an Attending.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available He can handle it.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Crash cart.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available Too much epi.
not_available Has he got a pulse? Can you hear me? 
not_available Charge to 300.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available It's stable V
not_available tach.
not_available He only needs 50.
not_available Do you want some Valium first? 
not_available This could be uncomfortable.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Charged to 50 for synch cardioversion.
not_available Clear.
not_available Jeez! V
not_available tach.
not_available Let's try 100.
not_available Valium.
not_available Charged.
not_available Valium.
not_available Clear.
not_available Okay.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You just saved your first Resident.
not_available You can't just sit here.
not_available The union steward said to stay the entire shift.
not_available But we're getting slammed.
not_available I mean, we'll work it all out tomorrow.
not_available I'm sorry, Abby.
not_available Think how you're gonna feel 10 years from now when they replace you with minimum
not_available wage grads right out of nursing school.
not_available Abby, Lewis is yelling for you.
not_available Are you nurses? 
not_available No.
not_available How come you're still working? I'm an LVN.
not_available They don't get no cheaper than me.
not_available Pratt needs a chaperone for a pelvic in 3.
not_available If you could cath the little boy in 4.
not_available Done deal.
not_available You still with us? Okay, I also have a guy in 2 that needs something 
not_available I can't read.
not_available What's that say, "nipple lips"? I got a Resident who needs a holding help for a spinal tap 
not_available on the dirty old man in Exam 3.
not_available He died.
not_available For real? 
not_available Real dead.
not_available Do you think you could cover for me for, like, five minutes so I could go up? I gotta deal with the nursing situation.
not_available I haven't seen Luka yet.
not_available I haven't stopped for six hours.
not_available I had to use a patient's urinal.
not_available And that Carter letter, I'm sorry.
not_available I know that was pretty harsh.
not_available How did you hear about this letter? 
not_available Jerry.
not_available Jerry.

not_available Romano, if we don't get some help down here 
not_available patients will die.

not_available Someone from the service should be here soon.

not_available I'm sorry, dear.
not_available He's a putz.
not_available Who, the drunk? That Carter boy.
not_available It's too bad you didn't dump him first.
not_available You've gotta be kidding me.
not_available The big man, he let me read the letter.
not_available The guy in 3 needs another bolus and an emesis basin.
not_available And call the lab and ask why it's taking over two hours 
not_available to get a set of electrolytes.
not_available Malik can do this.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you hear about my letter? 
not_available What letter? Oh, yeah, I need a phenytoin level on my seizure guy.
not_available And your girl in Exam 2 needs 20 of Lasix, IV.
not_available Oh, Elle.
not_available I told her I was gonna find her parents.
not_available How's she doing? She has primary pulmonary hypertension.
not_available Won't live to see her 21st birthday.
not_available Other than that, she's fine.
not_available Are you sure? Ninety
not_available eight percent.
not_available They won't be certain until after the cath on Monday.
not_available Her parents don't want her to know until after the tests.
not_available Not gonna tell her for three days? 
not_available It's awkward.
not_available It's not awkward.
not_available It's stupid.
not_available She already senses something's wrong.
not_available She deserves to know the truth.
not_available After the cath, she'll know and then it'll all be downhill from there.
not_available Just stay out of it.
not_available It's the parents' decision.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hi, I'm sorry.
not_available We got turned around.
not_available We were going to the children's ward to visit a classmate.
not_available Okay, go back to the elevator.
not_available Go up to the third floor, take a left

not_available Thanks.
not_available Are you a nurse? 
not_available Yes, I am a nurse.

not_available I want to be a doctor.
not_available Me too! Me too! 
not_available Robert.
not_available To what do we owe this royal visit? Do you know who that was in my office this morning?

not_available The hospital boning me with a prosthesis with a limited functional field.
not_available I'll have peripheral neuropathy, overuse syndromeDid you fire six nurses today? 
not_available It was the only good part of my day.
not_available How'd you like me to fire you? Well, I've got a handicap, remember? 
not_available Somehow I don't think that's an issue.
not_available You guys have an audience.
not_available Fire anyone else, even a candy striper, and you're gone.
not_available Consider this an official reprimand.
not_available You are one Grade A bitch! You know that, Kerry? No, Robert, I'm your boss.
not_available And as long as I am, you're my bitch.
not_available Now get your ass back to work.
not_available Fecal impaction in 4 needs some good old
not_available fashioned finger digging.
not_available Enjoy.
not_available Jerry! Show them how to get to the Pedes playroom? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What is that? 
not_available This is human blood.
not_available Hi, Elle.
not_available Feeling any better? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can finally take a deep breath.
not_available That's good.
not_available They had a heart doctor come see me.
not_available Why? I thought it was my lungs, not my heart.
not_available Well, your heart Your heart and your lungs are connected, so it only makes sense that Cardiology would come and take a look at you.
not_available I'm sure Dr.
not_available Lewis was just being thorough.
not_available So was it okay? My heart? My parents were acting a little weird.
not_available Well, all parents are a little weird, right? I'm sure they just want you to get better.
not_available I'm gonna go find Dr.
not_available Lewis and see if she's heard anything, okay? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available These are my parents.

not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, I heard there was a PPHN in here.
not_available Cardiology said I should listen for a tricuspid regurge murmur.
not_available A what? Is that what I have? There's something wrong with my heart? This is not a good teaching case, Neela.
not_available Come with me.
not_available No, I want her to stay.
not_available I wanna know what's wrong with me.
not_available Okay, I'll be right back, all right? 
not_available I've never seen a PPHN before.
not_available I
not_available She's not a PPHN.
not_available She's a girl who's about to find out she's going to die a slow, horrible death.
not_available She hasn't been told yet? There are extenuating circumstances which you don't know about.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What are you doing? He
not_available He wasn't eating it.
not_available That doesn't mean you get to.
not_available What's his story? Forest Herman.
not_available Just snoozing off pain meds for lower
not_available back pain.
not_available Mr.
not_available Herman, I'm Dr.
not_available Mr.
not_available Herman? 
not_available Tell me he's sleeping.
not_available Not unless he's taking a dirt nap.
not_available Wait, I feel a pulse.
not_available It's weak.
not_available Get a crash cart.
not_available Bag him.
not_available What'd you give him? 
not_available Just Demerol for back pain.
not_available Somebody page Corday.
not_available Okay, what did I do? What did I miss? While you were stealing his tuna fish, he was bleeding out from a triple A.
not_available He's drifting down.
not_available You want more blood? Yep, hang it.
not_available This man needs vascular right now.
not_available Get his pressure up, they can do an endovascular procedure.
not_available He probably won't survive an open wound.
not_available I paged them.
not_available They were unimpressed.
not_available Right.
not_available Let's page Dr.
not_available Dorset again.
not_available Tell him Dr.
not_available Corday needs him.
not_available Badly.
not_available I tried to get you a room with a fireplace by the pool but the guys from Coldplay rented out the whole top floor for a party.
not_available I can walk.
not_available I know, but hospital policy says I have to do the driving.
not_available Where are your parents? They disappear every half
not_available hour.
not_available My mom pretends they're making phone calls for work.
not_available But when they come back, I can tell she's been crying.
not_available So either the stock market crashed or there's something wrong with me and no one is willing to talk about it.
not_available So, what, am I dying? Do I have cancer or something? Okay, Elle the doctors still have some more tests to do.
not_available But so far
not_available Abby, I need to talk to you.
not_available We're on our way upstairs.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Hey, Malik, can you wheel Elle to Three South? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need help with the code.
not_available This is wrong.
not_available You know it.
not_available We're teaching her not to trust us exactly at the time she should be trusting us the most.
not_available Abby, what is wrong with you today? You practically start a thoracotomy on your own.
not_available Now you're talking to my patients when I asked you not to.
not_available Somebody should.
not_available It's not your call.
not_available You're not her doctor.
not_available You're her nurse.
not_available When I ask you not to do something, don't do it.
not_available Mind if I watch? 
not_available You should be at home in bed.
not_available Unit six type
not_available specific is up.
not_available Pressure's down to 80/40.
not_available Shouldn't we start pressors? 
not_available You wanna kill this guy.
not_available He's not stable.
not_available He was.
not_available Your service didn't come down.
not_available Those bastards hate to leave the hot tub.
not_available You.
not_available Grab some Betadine, scrub this guy like a sweet potato.
not_available Ectopy.
not_available Kick that tray over here.
not_available You don't wanna do this upstairs? Love to.
not_available Didn't leave enough gas in him to get there.
not_available Scrubbed.
not_available Nicely done.
not_available Maybe you can detail my Jag after work.
not_available Ten blade.
not_available Drape this area here and here.
not_available Suction to Lewis.
not_available You wanna try a little more teaching, a little less standup? Are you serious? My name's on this chart.
not_available It's like we say upstairs, "What happens in the ER, stays in the ER.
not_available " 
not_available Thanks.
not_available His BP's still 50.
not_available Cover your eyes, kids.
not_available This is gonna be some badass juju.
not_available Midline transperitoneal incision.
not_available There.
not_available Pull down a bit, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available You know, it really is like music when we work together.
not_available You boys remember the Law of Laplace? Stress on the arterial wall is pressure times radius, divided by wall thickness.
not_available You two have just been nurse
not_available slapped.
not_available You know what it means? 
not_available It means this man's about to die.
not_available Anyone can rip a man's heart out.
not_available But fixing it without looking? That's why I get the big money and all the hot chicks.
not_available Right
not_available angled retractor.
not_available Is this where I get to make a joke about this man bleeding to death? Only if you're qualified.
not_available I got the supraceliac aorta in my hand, meaning we have proximal control.
not_available Don't try this at home.
not_available Or anywhere near this hospital.
not_available You need a clamp? I think it's best if I just pull a Dutch boy, keep my finger in it.
not_available Let's roll.
not_available How wicked was that? 
not_available Guy's got balls the size of my head.
not_available I want the blue one.
not_available Hey, you know what? A medical student was crushed to death working on this computer last year.
not_available I can believe it.
not_available You save any lives today? 
not_available Nope.
not_available She saved one.
not_available Hey, I'm Nick Cooper.
not_available My friends call me Coop.
not_available Michael Gallant.
not_available Good to meet you.
not_available So did I miss anything good? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac is back.
not_available He's upstairs.
not_available He's doing better.
not_available Abby got a Dear John letter from Carter.
not_available And she gave it to you? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available What's it say? I imagine it's private.
not_available Yeah, you're probably right.
not_available What's it say? "Dear Abby
not_available " Has anybody not read this letter? I haven't.
not_available What, you pulled this out of the trash? I
not_available You guys are pathetic.
not_available You're not the only one who got a letter today.
not_available We all got 90
not_available day suspensions.
not_available I hate my job.
not_available Don't worry, dear.
not_available It'll get better.
not_available I hope you don't mind, Greg but we went ahead and ordered something that's not on the menu.
not_available Oh, no, this is okay.
not_available It looks good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sorry.
not_available So, Greg, what do your parents do? Well, my mom passed away when I was 12 and my father and I never kept in touch.
not_available Well, that's unfortunate.
not_available Family is such a valuable part of one's life.
not_available It's important to have roots.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei is going to China with us.
not_available She's going to rediscover her ancestry.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Mom, we talked about this.
not_available It's difficult to know where you're going if you don't know where you came from.
not_available What's that? Confucius? Common sense.
not_available Lizzie, burning the midnight oil? 
not_available Not if I can help it.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Very well, thanks.
not_available So is this where all the cool kids hang out? Not if we can help it.
not_available How is our triple A? 
not_available Not dead yet.
not_available Well, that's encouraging.
not_available Thank you for coming down so quickly.
not_available And? And what? This is where you say, "I owe you one.
not_available " What do you want? 
not_available Foot rub.
not_available I'll settle for coffee.
not_available I have to be home in an hour, and nothing fancy.
not_available No coconut
not_available frosted double javaccino or anything like that.
not_available All right.
not_available Good night, Robert.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Okay, okay, how bad was that? 
not_available What, the jellyfish or the ambush? I'm so sorry.
not_available You know, they caught me off guard.
not_available You know, if it's any consolation, they didn't hate you.
not_available Is that what they were saying? They're just old
not_available fashioned.
not_available Taxi! Meaning? Meaning they want me to be with someone more traditional.
not_available You know all that talk about going to China? They just wanna find me a husband.
not_available Well, just tell them to relax, all right? It's not like we're getting married.
not_available Taxi! Oh, come on.
not_available What? What are we doing? You're kidding, right? We're dating.
not_available You know, we're having fun.
not_available Neither one of us is ready to settle down, right? Right.
not_available What, did I say something? Nope.
not_available Then why are you mad? 
not_available I'm not mad.
not_available I'm sure you'll find yourself a new bang buddy.
not_available Good night.
not_available Thank God I got you a decaf.
not_available He left.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I needed to stretch my legs.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available You look great.
not_available You look like hell.
not_available Too much partying on the plane.
not_available So So? 
not_available So I met Gillian.
not_available She seems
not_available Yeah, she is.
not_available Must be nice having a private nurse.
not_available She give you your letter? Did you read it? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, you're the only one.
not_available I think he wanted to try and explain why he stayed.
not_available He saved my life.
not_available It's different over there.
not_available Changes you.
not_available I think Carter found himself.
not_available I didn't know he was missing.
not_available He's gonna be okay.
not_available I don't wanna talk about Carter anymore.
not_available I think it was doomed from the start.
not_available I'm glad one of us had the courage to put it out of its misery.
not_available It feels strange to be here.
not_available I think maybe I've changed too.
not_available Well, change is good, right? I think I'm way overdue myself.
not_available I hope he hasn't talked you into helping him escape.
not_available Nope.
not_available You need to take these and get back in bed.
not_available You're still warm.
not_available I'll stop by tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available It was really nice to finally meet you.
not_available You too.
not_available I'm glad you're back.
not_available What are you doing up? Come on.
