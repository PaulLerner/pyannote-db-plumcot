not_available Cspine is non
not_available tender.
not_available No elevated JVD.
not_available They let you guys work without vests? No guns, no vests.
not_available We're volunteers.
not_available Breath sounds equal.

not_available And others, to give back.
not_available HemoCue, 13.2.

not_available Did I tell you my mom's applying to medical school? I talked to the guys at Hopkins.
not_available We're trying to get you into the IGF
not_available 1 trial.
not_available IGF1, what's that? Insulin
not_available like growth factor.
not_available Yeah, it could protect the nerve cells and slow down the progression of the disease.
not_available When can he start? Soon, I hope.
not_available I just have to get through some red tape.
not_available I'm working that out.

not_available Okay.
not_available Aim for the apex.
not_available Second HemoCue's 13.
not_available It just goes in a few centimeters, then stops.
not_available Okay, because you're tracking under the muscle.
not_available You wanna get in between the ribs.
not_available It just doesn't wanna go through.

not_available He's killing me.
not_available You did fine with Moretti last week.
not_available I know, it's just she makes me nervous.
not_available Me? Forget it.
not_available I shouldn't have said anything.
not_available The inflammation of his pancreas caused his calcium level to drop.
not_available That's why his heart stopped? But he'll get better? Yeah, but pancreatitis is rare for someone his age.
not_available It's often associated with excessive alcohol use.
not_available I don't drink.
not_available Well, does anybody in your family have gallstones? Not that I've ever heard about.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Hey, wait, look at this.
not_available See this area of black? It looks like there's a cyst in the pancreas and it's big.
not_available Should I take him for a formal scan? 
not_available No, he's too unstable.
not_available I don't wanna risk another bout of V
not_available tach off the floor.
not_available Page Radiology to come do an ultrasound and get Surgery down here.
not_available Good chest
not_available tube placement, sats are down, decreased breath sounds.
not_available Something's not right.
not_available What would you do? There's a clot.
not_available Strip the tubing, it might clear obstruction.
not_available Yeah, good, do it.
not_available I think he needs a second chest tube.
not_available Sats are up to 96.
not_available Looks like it was a clot.
not_available Always a good thing to check, Abby.
not_available Why am I coughing? 
not_available Your lung's expanding, that's good.
not_available So he's okay now? If there's not much bleeding, we could put the tube back in.
not_available And his lung will heal.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, can't get a BP here.
not_available Okay, move him to Exam 2.
not_available Repeat portable chest and set up for ultrasound.
not_available Why didn't you mention the tubing earlier? I didn't think of it until Dr.
not_available Morris asked.
not_available You make me nervous.
not_available We have to work together without you getting brain freeze.
not_available Works fine when you're not in the room.
not_available I'm gonna be in the room.
not_available Figure out a way to handle it.
not_available Will you stop yelling at me? 
not_available I'm not yelling.
not_available I am trying to teach you.
not_available Your tone's not helping.
not_available Wanna be breastfed? Abby, I need you in here.
not_available Get on your game.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Try harder.
not_available Get in here.
not_available Got a flash.
not_available Saline's primed and ready.
not_available Right upper quadrant is soft.
not_available Liver hematoma is not impressive.
not_available Something else is going on.
not_available Liver looks stable.
not_available Spleen is good.
not_available Pelvic view is unremarkable.
not_available Subclavian's in.
not_available Let's hang a unit here.
not_available Could be an allergic reaction? She didn't get anything.
not_available Set up for intubation, 80 tube? 
not_available Mind if I try? Don't start yet.
not_available Mach tube, suction.
not_available Have the bag ready.
not_available This is Sergeant O'Malley.
not_available She runs the auxiliary program.
not_available Lauren and Tim are my trainees.
not_available Need an extra set of hands? 
not_available No, it's crowded enough already.
not_available Bag her up, guys.
not_available Is she gonna be okay? She would be, if you guys had given her a vest.
not_available It's not in the budget.
not_available They're neighborhood patrol.
not_available They're just supposed to call in.
not_available Well, they didn't.
not_available You put them out there with nothing, didn't back them, didn't support them.
not_available Not her fault, Morris.
not_available Of course it is.
not_available Would you send a soldier to war without the right armor? Oh, wait, we did that too.
not_available You don't need to make me feel any worse.
not_available These are like my kids.
not_available Well, you didn't look out for them.
not_available Nice work.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available What's happening? What's going on? Systolic's up to 130.
not_available Hemoglobin steady at 12.9.
not_available Your crashing patient isn't crashing.
not_available She was completely unstable.
not_available When did her BP drop? 
not_available Ten minutes ago.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available What were you doing? 
not_available Starting a second line.
not_available It was all vagal.
not_available Wait, my blood pressure dropped? Yes, some people get low blood pressure when they're stuck by a needle.
not_available I fainted the last two times I gave blood.
not_available Try taking a better history.
not_available I prefer not to get paged because a patient swoons.
not_available She was unconscious.
not_available Hey, how's Neela? She's drinking all my coffee.
not_available Maybe I'll stop by and see her later.
not_available He's got a large pseudocyst obstructing the duct.
not_available It needs to be drained immediately.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dawn, could you call Surgery again? 
not_available Right away.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm having an operation? 
not_available Yeah, we need to get rid of that fluid.
not_available Actually, Dr.
not_available Pratt, can I? Yeah.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Um 
not_available Yes? These can be drained internally with endoscopic ultrasound.
not_available I'm between cases and would be happy to do it.
not_available I never heard of that before.
not_available We did a study, the complication risk is lower than an external drainage.
not_available I see.
not_available And how do I know that you're not just faking your data? Onepointfour
not_available percent complication rate for endoscopic drainage versus 18 percent if done externally.
not_available Are you gonna let me do this procedure or not? Do your thing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, 32year
not_available old male.
not_available Single GSW to the left thigh.
not_available Get off of me.
not_available Hey, shut up already.
not_available He shot the auxiliary cops.
not_available Get me out of here.
not_available These guys are gonna kill me.
not_available His vitals? Tachy to 118.
not_available BP, 155/84.
not_available Did you give him any pain meds? 
not_available Nobody gave me jack.
not_available All right, hey, Sam, I need CBC, type and cross five of morphine and bolus a liter of NS.
not_available Okay, come on, let's go.
not_available Dawn, will you jump on this? Uh, you, you come with me.
not_available Hey, Morris, this is for that consent.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We sent Lauren to CT.
not_available Make sure there's no internal bleeding.
not_available Good, that's good.
not_available Tim seems stable, but we need to observe him.
not_available It shouldn't have happened.
not_available Lauren just started.
not_available Tim hasn't even been with us six months.
not_available How long has the program been around? A year.
not_available I saw it work in New York, I thought it'd be good here.
not_available Took Lauren under my wing.
not_available Tim, pfft, I found him lying in the middle of Halstead one night crashing from meth.
not_available I told him to go home, he didn't have one.
not_available When I started the program, he wanted to join.
not_available Who better to clean up the streets than someone who knew them? Well, hopefully, they'll pull through.
not_available Lou.
not_available How they doing? The mayor's office wants an update.
not_available When Lauren comes back down from CT, we'll wanna monitor her closely.
not_available We're gonna admit her for observation.
not_available For how long? 
not_available A couple of days, maybe more Hey, get out of the way.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, expanding liver hematoma and her pressure dropped again.
not_available Sure it's not vagal again? 
not_available No procedures, no new needle sticks.
not_available Okay, get me the ultrasound.
not_available Dropped her crit to nine.
not_available From 13? It's the girl's father.
not_available Oh, my God, Lauren, baby? Run in two units.
not_available Larry, get Dubenko back down here.
not_available How'd this happen? 
not_available She was on patrol.
not_available There was a carjacking 
not_available What do you mean patrol? Your daughter is a volunteer cop.
not_available What the hell is that? She's a college student.
not_available Hey, what are you doing? 
not_available Hanging the blood.
not_available You open your line to the saline, not to the patient.
not_available She's not getting any of it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, I think Fix the blood, go outside, then work on your charts.
not_available He can stay, he'll learn.
not_available Is my daughter gonna be okay? Hematoma doesn't explain the big drop in crit.
not_available I agree, spleen's intact I swear Is my daughter okay? 
not_available Tachy at 120.
not_available Let's take a look at 
not_available Somebody answer me.
not_available We don't know, now move back! 
not_available Okay, come on.
not_available Shh! Morris, look, she's oozing from the old IV sites.
not_available Coagulopathy.
not_available I've been trying to tell you that.
not_available Okay, send off platelets and a DIC screen.
not_available You've gotta be bold in trauma room.
not_available You have something to say, speak up.
not_available We got the shooter in the other room.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt is asking for another set of hands.
not_available I'll go.
not_available No, I'll take it.
not_available I think you guys got this under control.
not_available See, this is why I don't like to date cops.
not_available You never know when they're gonna be in a shootout with some scumbag.
not_available I never shot anyone before.
not_available Yeah, well, you should've killed that guy for what he did.
not_available Yeah, well, it's not that easy, Sam, pulling the trigger.
not_available Even if it is the right thing.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I know it's not.
not_available Yeah, they're gonna take my gun away, make me talk to some shrink.
not_available That's just protocol.
not_available You are gonna be back on the streets in a week.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available What's up? You have a emphysemic on BiPAP coming up to the unit? Oh, yeah, I got the chart.
not_available You know, I'll be right back with you.
not_available Were you sucking face with Barney Fife? No, for information about the shooting you need to contact our media
not_available relations office.
not_available Here's the emphysemic.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, your kid's 14, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got a hypothetical for you.
not_available Say he ran away, right, across state line to a friend's "house " do you know how much trouble that friend would be in? Hypothetically? 
not_available Yeah, for instance.
not_available Good, because I thought Sarah ran away from her grandparents " and" she's at your house.
not_available All right, we'll talk about this later.
not_available Tony, send her home.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko, I heard that you did your trauma fellowship at Hopkins, right? 
not_available Not a good time, I'm busy.
not_available You know Dillon Subrin in Neurology? We got wounded cops.
not_available We got a shooter in the other room.
not_available Your friend's the head of the IGF
not_available 1 trial, and they closed enrollment.
not_available I have this kid up in ICU.
not_available Nice kid, single mom 
not_available What happened? This time, it's for real.
not_available Dropped her pressure and her crit.
not_available Call upstairs, tell them to get an O.R.
not_available Ready.
not_available There's another problem.
not_available DIC.
not_available She needs fresh frozen plasma.
not_available I'll give her FFP in surgery.
not_available Hold on, the PT and PTT are normal.
not_available It's not really consistent with a DIC, now, is it? Could be a dilutional coagulopathy.
not_available Or platelet problem? No, her count's over 300,000.
not_available Plenty, but they might be bad platelets.
not_available Maybe they can't clump and clot.
not_available Hey, we don't have time for a lecture on hematology.
not_available I'll cover all the bases, give her FFP, give her platelets in the O.R.
not_available Not gonna help if it's von Willebrand disease.
not_available Lacking the factor for platelet adhesion.
not_available You're doing bleeding time? Yeah, I've seen a lot of coagulopathy in the ICU.
not_available Over 10 minutes, we have the diagnosis, we can treat her without surgery.
not_available That's all it takes, 10 minutes.
not_available Pressure's up after the second unit.
not_available Okay, hang another two.
not_available You got 10 minutes, Gates.
not_available Please, just kill me.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available If our guys die, I will.
not_available He's threatening me.
not_available I didn't hear anything.
not_available Hold still.
not_available I can't find the pulse.
not_available Officer, please move back.
not_available I'm not moving anywhere.
not_available Benny, give them some room.
not_available Shut up.
not_available This guy needs two of Ativan and five of MS.
not_available How do you think our guys feel? Stop it.
not_available Think if you die, they gonna fill the hall? 
not_available Move back.
not_available Please get him out of here.
not_available You're making my job harder.
not_available Not gonna ask you again.
not_available You jack somebody for $ 10? Want me to call Vascular? 
not_available And Radiology.
not_available You're just a scumbag! 
not_available All right, look.
not_available Hey, Benny, back down.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Stop.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Sir, stop.

not_available Okay, okay, one second, one second.
not_available Should we fold this? Should we fold this? Look, this dirty, dirty nappy.
not_available Ohh.
not_available O.R.'s ready.
not_available Let's go, it's been over 15 minutes.
not_available Hold on, the DDAVP will increase the von Willebrand factor.
not_available The bleeding will stop, trust me.
not_available Time's up.
not_available Let's move her out, Lucien.
not_available Give me a few minutes.
not_available Give it up already.
not_available Look at the abdominal wound, see that? Look, stopped bleeding.
not_available We have hemostasis.
not_available Same with the liver.
not_available We've given her the ability to clot.
not_available So she doesn't need surgery? No, probably not.
not_available We'll admit and monitor closely.
not_available Good pickup, Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available Well, someone tell Moretti.

not_available No point tenderness around the orbit.
not_available Ice it three times a day.
not_available How did you get that? By being bold.
not_available I was bold.

not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Well, your GSW is in Room 3.
not_available They've been prepping his groin now.
not_available Thank you.

not_available And as promised, no complications.
not_available Nice.
not_available I told you it would work.
not_available Hey, Finn, how you feeling, man? 
not_available He's still a little snowed.
not_available His repeat calcium is up.
not_available That's good.
not_available How does a kid get pancreatitis? Who knows? But he'll do a lot better after the anesthesia.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Second chest tube is in, 0 silk.
not_available BP is still 40.
not_available Bag him.
not_available No more bleeding from the chest.
not_available Nothing left to drain.
not_available I need ultrasound.
not_available Check his pericardium again.
not_available I thought he was stable.
not_available We were just talking.
not_available Sometimes this happens.
not_available Blood in the pericardium.
not_available With no diastolic filling.
not_available Barely has a BP.
not_available Pulse thready.
not_available Come on, Tim.
not_available Uh, pericardiocentesis needle.
not_available A thoracotomy tray? Wanna do that? Yeah.
not_available Not gonna get the clots with needle.
not_available Prep fast and wide.
not_available No, no, Grady, no.
not_available Atropine now.
not_available He's like a son.
not_available I can't lose him.
not_available Wait, he's got a rhythm and a pulse.
not_available We can still try pericardiocentesis.
not_available Penetrating trauma, pre
not_available arrest.
not_available Perfect indication for a thoracotomy.
not_available Lost his pulse.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, Morris, hurry up.
not_available Abby, take it.
not_available What? 
not_available Ahem.
not_available You do it.
not_available Oh, it's all right, Joe.

not_available Come on, Joe, I just don't bring out my Hindi for anyone, you know.
not_available Come on, who's at the stair? Who's at the door? Who's at the door? Ah.
not_available Lucien, what are you doing here? 
not_available Hi.
not_available I brought you some wheatgrass to help build your immune system.
not_available I thought we might do yoga for your post
not_available op stiffness.
not_available You have anything for crying babies? I don't know, do I? Here.
not_available Help yourself.
not_available Hi, little man.
not_available There you go.

not_available It's okay, Joe, it's okay.
not_available Great.
not_available Units five and six are up.
not_available We have a pulse with CPR? Yeah, good carotid.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Looks like asystole now.
not_available Please keep going.
not_available Might be fine.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Internal paddles.
not_available Charging to 30.
not_available Clear.
not_available Come on, Tim.
not_available No change.
not_available Another milligram of epi.
not_available He's had three.
not_available Then make it four.
not_available Archie.
not_available No, don't stop, don't stop.
not_available Start compressions again.
not_available Do you think we could? 
not_available Concentrate.
not_available Epi's in.
not_available Shock one more time.
not_available Again? 
not_available One more time.
not_available Clear.
not_available Asystole for sure.
not_available Come on, Tim.
not_available Morris, I think we're done.
not_available Continue compressions.
not_available We repaired the wound.
not_available He just needs more volume.
not_available Heart is full.
not_available What about more pressors? 
not_available Yes, good idea.
not_available Pressors should've worked by now.
not_available He might still respond to Morris, he's been down too long.
not_available It's over.
not_available Please, no.
not_available No, move, move, move.
not_available Morris, we're done.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you feeling? Ready for wrestling practice.
not_available I just need to check a few things out first.
not_available Go, "ah.
not_available " Ahh.
not_available All good? Actually, no.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available You're bulimic.
not_available What are you talking about? I'm talking about the calluses on your fingers.
not_available Your eroded tooth enamel.
not_available Your vomiting caused the pancreatitis.
not_available You know, I had a buddy in high school.
not_available He was a wrestler like you.
not_available He had the same problem.
not_available He was always trying to make weight.
not_available Your vomiting caused an electrolyte imbalance that stopped your heart.
not_available That's nuts.
not_available You could have died.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Not this time.
not_available Dude, it's all good, okay? I have college scouts looking at me, so there's some things I have to do.
not_available Everyone that's good has to sacrifice.
not_available But this isn't a sacrifice.
not_available This is a problem.
not_available Nothing I can't handle.
not_available You call this handling it? You're never gonna get into college if you keep this up.
not_available Is that what you really want? I wanna win.
not_available All right, then we'll get you some counseling.
not_available We'll talk to your parents.
not_available Because if you stay along this path you're gonna lose.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey, good news.
not_available You know the IGF
not_available 1 trial at Hopkins? He's in.
not_available When can we start? 
not_available Soon, next week.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available Say thank you, Joshua.
not_available For letting me be a guinea pig on some unapproved drug? Hey, you're a Cubs fan.
not_available Come on, gotta be an optimist.
not_available I'm a cautious optimist.
not_available Look, honey.
not_available You wanna go back to school, don't you? Finish your thesis? Well, sometimes you have to do things you don't wanna "do " so you get what you want in the end.
not_available Think they have Wi
not_available Fi in Baltimore? I bet they do.
not_available Fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you, Tony.
not_available Hello? This is about me.
not_available Heh

not_available Well, this is gonna be good.
not_available I promise, all right? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You talk to him? Yeah, but I need to call Psych.
not_available Look, about this morning You never struck me as someone with self
not_available esteem issues.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Oh, well, you think it's okay for a man to get what he wants and you get nothing? Look, you know, I've jumped through a lot of hoops for you.
not_available I've asked you out the way you wanted me to ask you out.
not_available I call you when you want me to call you.
not_available But I'm not a mind reader.
not_available Now, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna have to do this together.
not_available Next time, I will tell you if I don't.
not_available Well, that would help.
not_available Hell, you speak up about everything else.
not_available Guess you're right.
not_available So dinner tonight? Sounds good.
not_available Do you mean that or are you just faking? Oh Heh.
not_available Mmm.
not_available You believe me now? Is there any family I can call? No.
not_available I'm all he's got.
not_available He's gonna be here for a while, then we're gonna have to move him.
not_available But you can stay until we do.
not_available What about the jerk who did this? Is he gonna make it? He's upstairs right now, but tomorrow he'll be transferred to the jail ward.
not_available You know, I see kids die a lot way more than I should.
not_available Just this year, we have had more young people get shot than God knows when.
not_available But he, after everything that happened to him when he was a kid he was trying to help.
not_available Do you think he died in pain? No.
not_available Good.
not_available He'd been through enough.
not_available Breathe in.
not_available And out.
not_available And in.
not_available And out.
not_available Wow, I do feel better.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Yeah, there's so much healing yoga can do.
not_available Western medicine isn't everything.
not_available You know, when I get better, I might take a class.
not_available They have them in the anesthesia conference room.
not_available It's Mondays and Wednesdays.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Neela, about what happened at the wedding 
not_available Oh, Lucien, we were both drunk.
not_available Listen, let me just finish.
not_available I may have gotten my fondness and respect for you confused with something else.
not_available And I hope you can forgive my inappropriateness.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Did I do it again? 
not_available Where's Joe? He's walking.
not_available Abby will be so 
not_available Pissed off.
not_available She missed it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available What are you doing out here? I figured you'd be home, we'd get something to eat.
not_available All right, what do you want? 
not_available Chinese.
not_available Chinese it is.
not_available Can we go to the movies after? No, after we have Chinese food, I'm gonna take you back to Wisconsin.
not_available What? You changed your mind, didn't you? You don't want custody of me.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Come on.
not_available Sarah, sometimes you have to do things you don't wanna "do " so you can get what you want in the end.
not_available What's that mean? I'm trying to make it so we'd live together forever.
not_available But if you keep running away, that's not gonna happen.
not_available You gotta work with me here.
not_available I guess we should probably call them.
not_available I already did.
not_available Chinese? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'll race you, come on.
not_available Grady, wait up.
not_available Fifteen thousand die every day.
not_available He was not supposed to be one of them.
not_available It wasn't your fault.
not_available I should've been thinking tamponade.
not_available No, you shouldn't.
not_available Trajectory was nowhere near the heart.
not_available Scan showed a normal pericardium.
not_available I should've monitored him.
not_available We were monitoring him.
not_available I just wanna go home.
not_available No, you just need to relax.
not_available And pay attention to the details.
not_available If the ER feels too overwhelming, don't worry about it.
not_available I wanna go out with you.
not_available Ever since I mistook you for an intern, I've been thinking about it.
not_available How about dinner? A movie, a drink at Ike Ryan's? 
not_available I'm married.
not_available You're what? It's a ring.
not_available Husband, I'm married.
not_available Oh, God, I am such a rube.
not_available It's the details, Grady.
not_available It could save somebody's life.
not_available Maybe get you a date.
not_available Go home.
not_available Tim's getting full honors.
not_available At least there's that.
not_available What happened to you in there? My dad died.
not_available What? Yeah.
not_available I got the call this morning before those cops came in.
not_available Well, why didn't you say something? We could've covered for you.
not_available What was there to say? My cousin called.
not_available He said my dad was in the hospital for a week and keeled over.
not_available You didn't know he was sick? You mean, does my family talk? Did my dad 
say "Call my son, I want him by my side"? No, no.
not_available That's not the way the Morris family does things.
not_available You know, everything I ever did was to prove him wrong.
not_available Everything.
not_available He said he was wasting his money on medical school because he thought I'd never pass, but I did.
not_available He said I'd never find a job at a good hospital, and I did that.
not_available I had this plan.
not_available To pass the boards in a few weeks, and go tell him and 
say "Look, I did it.
not_available You big dummy, I'm a specialist.
not_available " But it's too late.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's still laughing at me.
not_available Oh, Morris, I'm sure he was proud.
not_available I mean, maybe he just didn't know how to say it.
not_available No.
not_available No, he's laughing.
not_available I can still hear him.
not_available He's laughing.
