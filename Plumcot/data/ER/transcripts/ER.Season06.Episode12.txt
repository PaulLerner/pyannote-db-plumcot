not_available I wanna see how the MD's affecting your body.
not_available Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by the wasting of skeletal muscles.

not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He really hates hospitals.
not_available Don't be afraid.
not_available We wanna make you better.
not_available He's good
not_available natured, considering what he's been through.
not_available What surgery has he had? A Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux.
not_available A hemicolectomy, and a few laparotomies.
not_available When was he vomiting? 
not_available Today.
not_available Mucous membranes are moist.
not_available Did you feed him orally, or in his G
not_available tube? I gave him a little by mouth.
not_available But not enough to induce this.
not_available I pray it's the flu.
not_available But it may be a bowel obstruction.
not_available Abby, can you get this foreign body ingestion? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Just a sec.
not_available Luka? Can I steal Abby? We're backed up.
not_available It's okay.

not_available popping abscesses.
not_available You get a tox screen? 
not_available It's negative.
not_available He's clean.
not_available You can't be sure.
not_available What are you thinking? I don't know.
not_available But maybe you can bluff it out of him.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Somebody stole my patient.
not_available Peter, did you steal Lucy's patient? 
not_available Check the lost and found.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Fulton.
not_available I took Tia to surgery.

not_available Dr.
not_available Ashcoff change his mind? No, no, no.
not_available We just have to reschedule.
not_available Well, we came all the way down here.
not_available We can wait.
not_available Tia hasn't eaten in eight hours
not_available We can't do it today.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not gonna get them fixed? You've waited long.
not_available A few more days won't hurt.
not_available Hold on a minute, honey.
not_available Can we? It has taken me months to get Tia out of the house.
not_available I can't give her false hope.
not_available If this isn't gonna happen you need to tell us.
not_available It's gonna happen.
not_available I just need a little time.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mr.
not_available Barnes needs Compazine, run saline through and check his electrolytes.
not_available Can't you get a nurse to do that? 
not_available You used to be one.
not_available I'm not now.
not_available You're here to learn.
not_available This is an opportunity to learn how to check his stool for fecal leukocytes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's his pulse ox? 
not_available 82.
not_available And how much oxygen is he on? 
not_available 10 liters.
not_available The flu is making it difficult to breathe.
not_available It ain't just the flu.
not_available No.
not_available You also have congestive heart failure.
not_available A tube will help you breathe.
not_available No.

not_available Do you have someone we can call? 
not_available No.
not_available All my friends is homeless.
not_available No phones.
not_available Any family? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available I really think you need to go on a ventilator.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I always hoped I might die in a warm bed with clean sheets, if it's all the same to you.
not_available X
not_available rays show nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
not_available So, it's not another adhesion? 
not_available Right.
not_available Blood gas is back.
not_available PH is 7.38.
not_available PCO
not_available 2 is 30.
not_available Is it respiratory alkalosis? Partly.
not_available But also an acidosis.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available Are you a nurse? 
not_available No.
not_available I've read every book on chalazia.
not_available Did they do an upper GI? 
not_available Six months ago.
not_available They thought he had a gastric outlet blockage.
not_available You're not gonna do that? 
not_available It'll rule out an obstruction.
not_available No, please.
not_available They put an NG tube up his nose.
not_available He wouldn't stop crying.
not_available I know he's been through a lot.
not_available He has a metabolic disorder.
not_available We have to find out why he's sick.
not_available I will be as gentle as possible.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available What? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available Nothing.
not_available We tested your blood, Marty.
not_available Yeah? So? Where do you get the dirty needles? 
not_available What do you mean? Marty, I know.
not_available You can't tell my dad.
not_available Please.
not_available He won't understand.
not_available You can't use dirty needles.
not_available You're infected and if you share, you could get HIV.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I stole them from my grandmother.
not_available She's got diabetes.
not_available Why do you do it? 
not_available Kids with crooked teeth get braces.
not_available My mom got laser surgery on her eyes.
not_available Why can't I use hormones? For what? 
not_available To grow taller.
not_available You're injecting human growth hormone? Where do you get it? 
not_available It's not illegal.
not_available Where do you get it, Marty? 
not_available Off the Internet.
not_available Then you don't know what's in it.
not_available Do you know the health risks you've been exposed to? It can't be worse than being beat up.
not_available Even that stupid kid in the wheelchair picks on me.
not_available If you can get me the real stuff, I
not_available Hormone therapy is not for healthy adolescents.
not_available Well, I'm not healthy.
not_available I go to school every day knowing that I'm gonna be beat up or shoved into a locker, or dragged into the girls' shower room.
not_available Do you know how embarrassing it is to be stuffed inside a trash can while the whole cafeteria's laughing at you? Hormones aren't going to help that.
not_available Yeah? Well, being bigger will.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you seen the Cetacaine? 
not_available No.
not_available We always keep it on this counter.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Carol? Are you uncomfortable with my being here? Why would I be? It's hard for nurses when nurses go to med school.
not_available I switched teams.
not_available I'm gonna be sick.
not_available Actually, I almost went to med school myself.
not_available Is it something else? 
not_available It's just stupid.
not_available Oh, my God! Have you had an ulcer? 
not_available What's wrong with him? I don't know.
not_available I'll get a doctor.
not_available I need a Yankauer.
not_available Top drawer.
not_available Peter! I'm gonna start a line.
not_available Check his BP.
not_available He just started vomiting bright red blood.
not_available What's the history? Looks like triple
not_available A.
not_available Ulcer, I think.
not_available Think? 
not_available He's not my patient.
not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available Set me up for a central line.
not_available Squeeze in two liters.
not_available Get me four units O
not_available neg.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Bleeding through his GI.
not_available Call the O.R.
not_available What happened? Aorto
not_available enteric fistula.
not_available Should we take him? 
not_available Just tube him.
not_available 80 ET.
not_available Damn it! Now! Why is he here? 
not_available Corday said it was the flu.
not_available His pulse is weak.
not_available BP's 50 palp.
not_available We need to stop the bleeding.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Abby.
not_available Can you sew this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available A suture? As long as it doesn't pull away.
not_available Prep him for a lap.
not_available You can't do one here
not_available No choice.
not_available Scalpel! I'll make a small midline incision, and clamp below the diaphragm.
not_available Got that? 
not_available Almost.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Pressure's at 90.
not_available This should hold him.
not_available Tell the O.R.
not_available we're coming.
not_available Two units of O
not_available neg in.
not_available Operating in the ER, Peter? He had an aortal
not_available enteric fistula.
not_available Why isn't he in surgery? 
not_available He had flu symptoms.
not_available Look like the flu, Malatucci? 
not_available Malucci.
not_available No.
not_available But Dr.
not_available Benton
not_available Save it for the disciplinary hearing.
not_available Let's get him to O.R.
not_available before you use the rest of our blood supply.
not_available You got to admit, that was pretty cool.
not_available Can I go home now? 
not_available Not just yet.
not_available I want you to try something first.
not_available What? 
not_available Computer.
not_available I've seen one or two.
not_available Maybe the MD's affecting your motor skills and causing trouble at school.
not_available Wrong.
not_available You can keep up with other kids.
not_available The school is full of losers.
not_available Oh, well.
not_available Come on, just give it a try.
not_available Oops! Feel better? 
not_available A little.
not_available Want to smash something else? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Is that the best you can do? Here.
not_available Yeah, that's it.
not_available That's it.
not_available Let me see you write your name.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm trying to help.
not_available I'm tired of people trying to help me all the time.
not_available People try to help too much sometimes? I don't need to be pushed around.
not_available I don't need to have my food cut.
not_available I don't need my mom to give me a freaking bath all the time.
not_available I'm not a baby.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available I'm gonna go talk to your mother.
not_available Why don't you clean this up? 
not_available Me? You helped me make the mess.
not_available You help me clean it.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's okay, honey.
not_available There.
not_available No more.
not_available Luka, I need to talk to you.
not_available Hold on.
not_available It'll take a second.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good boy, honey.
not_available I tried contacting his pediatrician.
not_available He doesn't have one, which seemed weird to me for a kid this sick.
not_available I called Northwestern, Rush, Mercy.
not_available He's been admitted to all three ERs.
not_available Several times, multiple admissions.
not_available I know.
not_available I've seen the scars.
not_available He needed surgery once for his fundoplication.
not_available All the rest were exploratory procedures.
not_available He has a metabolic disorder and is at high risk for obstruction.
not_available Nobody has documented anything.
not_available I know.
not_available But something's making him sick.
not_available You thought about the mother? 
not_available What about her? Maybe she's inducing his symptoms.
not_available She wants to find out what's wrong with him.
not_available Maybe she likes the attention.
not_available She'd hurt her child? 
not_available I've seen parents do it before.
not_available Okay.
not_available How? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You can't say this without proof.
not_available What if his upper GI is negative? CT shows nothing? Are you gonna admit him for surgery? I just started the work
not_available up.
not_available Let me figure it out.
not_available Would you just consider it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's fine.
not_available He's being abused by his classmates.
not_available He has to fight back.
not_available That's not a solution.
not_available Look, Dr.
not_available Finch, my son's short.
not_available So what? I'm short.
not_available And, yeah, I got picked on.
not_available I dealt with it.
not_available So will he.
not_available By injecting himself with God knows what? That won't happen again.
not_available I can assure you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch, Marty spiked a fever of 103.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Crummy.
not_available What do you expect? Have you had a fever recently? 
not_available He had the flu.
not_available There's a pansystolic murmur.
not_available What? Has he had a heart murmur? 
not_available No.
not_available He's got splinter hemorrhages.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Get blood cultures pentox and gent.
not_available Order a cardiac echo.
not_available Something's wrong with my heart? The needle may have put bacteria into your blood causing an infection of your heart.
not_available Mr.
not_available Spencer? I'm Abby Lockheart.
not_available I need a private room.
not_available We don't have any.
not_available With this flu epidemic, this place is a big petri dish.
not_available Take a deep breath? What if somebody comes in with TB? What's the problem? 
not_available My pulse is thready.
not_available Really? 
not_available My chest feels tight.
not_available I'm fatigued.
not_available My head's pounding and I can barely hear anything.
not_available Do your stools glow in the dark? What? 
not_available Your ears are full of wax.
not_available Oh, man! You can get that from food additives or toxins.
not_available I can clean them out.
not_available How? 
not_available I never put anything in my ears.
not_available We use a drill.
not_available A drill? 
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available I use peroxide.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Brant? Radiology is ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here we go, sweetie.
not_available I think I need an EKG.
not_available Carol, where's the EKG machine? Try Trauma.
not_available Need me to draw labs? No.
not_available I got it.
not_available We can wheel him out.
not_available I'd rather carry him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'm still on shift downstairs.
not_available Should've considered that before turning the ER into O.R.
not_available I'm not doing
not_available It won't kill you to observe! You still need to learn.
not_available Somebody turn down the heat! 
not_available It's 68 degrees.
not_available Maybe it's the flu.
not_available I don't get sick.
not_available Is it the change? 
not_available DeBakey clamp.
not_available I can finish up.
not_available I would like you to shut up while I save this man's life.
not_available Suction.
not_available What did you find? 
not_available The study was negative.
not_available So, what do we do now? 
not_available We should do a CT scan.
not_available What about endoscopy? I don't want to put your son through an unnecessary invasive procedure.
not_available I feel we're wasting time.
not_available Shouldn't a surgeon see him? After the scan.
not_available Sat's down to 78.
not_available Put him on 100% nonrebreather mask.
not_available Anything else I can do to make you more comfortable? My lunch box.
not_available This? There's $118 in there.
not_available Give it to my friends.
not_available Do you want it to go to a shelter? No.
not_available Just throw it off the roof.
not_available Throw the money off the roof? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They'll find it.
not_available Conner's GI series was negative.
not_available You seem surprised.
not_available I was hoping to find something wrong with him.
not_available She wants an endoscopy.
not_available She was disappointed when I wanted to wait.
not_available And I think you might be right.
not_available Is this gonna hurt? 
not_available No.
not_available It's just peroxide.
not_available You might feel a few bubbles.
not_available Bubbles? What if they get into my blood? 
not_available That won't happen.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available What about my chest? 
not_available EKG was normal.
not_available Maybe I should have a stress echo.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available What is the sense of sophisticated technology if you die before you get a chance to use it? Hey! 
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available That's okay.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Well, not so good.
not_available Lots of tests and they don't know what's wrong.
not_available I'm sure Dr.
not_available Kovac is beingDid he call for a surgical consult? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I could check.
not_available Would you? Sure.
not_available Another 30 Prolene.
not_available Get that rake out of my way, please.
not_available Oh, man! Sure you're okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're over
not_available sewing the duodenal defect.
not_available There's no substitute for precision.
not_available Lizzie, joining the party? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Barnes eroded his aortic graft.
not_available Is he a friend? I thought he had gastroenteritis.
not_available Peter didn't mention that.
not_available How valiant of you to not rat Lizzie out on her gross oversight.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Now that he's been diagnosed.
not_available Lizzie, scrub in.
not_available I'm off.
not_available You're not anymore.
not_available I'm gonna dissect the small bowel off the aorta now.
not_available You should use a Metz.
not_available I'd quit whileDamn it! Robert? I'm fine Robert? He's burning up! Let's get Metz and pick
not_available up.
not_available Get a gurney! He's got a weak pulse! Suction.
not_available 30 Prolene.
not_available Let's get ready.
not_available Not afraid you'll catch cold? No.
not_available They're not stacking up again, are they? It's over.
not_available Figure out what was wrong with that kid? Got tired of being short.
not_available Injected himself with hormones.
not_available Why didn't I think of that? 
not_available Vegetations on his valve.
not_available Endocarditis? He used Grandma's insulin needles.
not_available What did Cardiology say? 
not_available They put him on antibiotics.
not_available Hopefully, he won't need surgery.
not_available All of that for a couple of inches.
not_available Yep.
not_available You're releasing too early.
not_available Why don't you show me? 
not_available You don't want any of this.
not_available I don't? Okay.
not_available Show me what you got.
not_available What is it? His stomach is distended! 
not_available Get me a syringe.
not_available I told you to call a surgeon! What? What are you doing? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available What's that? Is he bleeding? No.
not_available Indicator mixed with saline.
not_available Turns red in the stomach acid.
not_available What are you talking about? That's not mine.
not_available That belongs to the doctor or nurse, she left it here.
not_available Actually, we had her leave it.
not_available It's not peroxide.
not_available It's saline.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available You know.
not_available You've been poisoning him.
not_available Security
not_available Stop! I didn't give you permission.
not_available We are leaving! I'm afraid you are not.
not_available I can't allow this.
not_available I love Conner.
not_available I would never hurt him.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Brant, you need help.
not_available Sweetie, it's okay.
not_available It's okay, sweetie.
not_available They're not gonna hurt you.
not_available Mommy has you.
not_available Mommy has you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Call Transport.
not_available Mr.
not_available Clayton has to go to the morgue.
not_available That old guy died? From the flu? 
not_available Put him into respiratory failure.
not_available I should've gotten that flu shot.
not_available Someone give you a tip? 
not_available He had a daughter.
not_available Who? 
not_available He told me he had no family.

not_available He has a kidney stone.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Not big enough.
not_available He won't need surgery.
not_available That can't be a lot of fun.
not_available Thanks for covering for me.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available Anybody could've missed it.
not_available My mind was elsewhere.
not_available So, you're going in to gloat?
