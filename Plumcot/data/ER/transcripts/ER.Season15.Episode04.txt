not_available Great teaching point, Dr.

not_available Uh, Brenner, Martin.
not_available Morris, Sanchez.
not_available Mentors.
not_available As they go, so you go.

BRENNER Y eah.

not_available How's that board look?.
not_available We're down to 44 in the waiting room.

not_available So what's up?.
not_available No broken bones in the x
not_available ray.
not_available Just a sprain.
not_available Should I get a stirrup?.
MORRlS No, an ace bandage is fine.
not_available You know the drill.
not_available Ice, rest, elevation.
not_available And early weight bearing gives superior functional results compared to immobilization.
not_available Are you back in school for physical therapy?.
not_available Started a month ago.
not_available All set.
not_available Well, uh, it was great seeing you again, Christine.
not_available Hopefully you'll stay on the Pilates machine next time.
not_available Ha, ha.
not_available Yeah, I'll try.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Uh, thank you.
not_available Look, I was just wondering if maybe you were free later?.
not_available Oh, um.
not_available Well, I'm flattered, Christine but, um, we have a policy against dating patients.
not_available Technically, she's my patient.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
not_available I can't.
RYAN Doctor Morris.
not_available I can't.
not_available Well.
not_available Here.
not_available If you change your mind, call me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What the hell was that about?.
NEELA Suction, Andrew.
not_available Hope we don't have to access the aorta.
not_available Divert the tube to the left main stem.
ANDREW Why?.
DUBENKO Makes it easier to clamp the right hilum.
DAWN Fifth unit is up.
DUBENKO Okay.
not_available Satinksky to Neela.
NEELA That's better.
not_available I can see the hilum.

not_available We're gonna meet them in the O.R.
not_available Can we follow?.
not_available You stay here.
not_available Until you prove you're not drunk, I don't want you anywhere near your mother.
not_available She likes salsa dancing and screwball comedies.
not_available You hurt her, I'll remove your gallbladder.
not_available Not good.
not_available She implicated the mother?.
not_available Yells, loses her temper from time to time, spanks them.
not_available I need to get Child Protective Services involved.
not_available You'll be able to keep the kids together?.
not_available Since the dad's not in the picture Claire will go into foster care.
not_available By the time her sister's released, maybe a relative will step up.
not_available If all goes well, she'll be discharged in a week.
not_available Great, I'll start the paperwork.
not_available Well, that's settled.
not_available This blood test will show us your alcohol level.
not_available Which will be zero.
not_available Can you guys rush this, so my dad can calm down?.
not_available One test is not gonna solve the problem.
not_available Trust me, I know.
not_available All right.
not_available You're all set.
not_available Your mom will be out of surgery in a couple hours.
not_available I'll go get some coffee, give my dad some space.
not_available Hate to get all Jerry Springer in the waiting room.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Back in Oz, we don't waste tax dollars on family disputes we talk it out over a beer.
not_available Well, it was nice of you.
not_available What's so funny?.
not_available Your accent.
not_available It's cute.
not_available I dated this guy in New Zealand once.
not_available I spent a summer there in college teaching Maori kids science.
not_available New Zealand?.
not_available It's totally different.
not_available Oh, well, if you say so.
not_available The shopping sucked.
not_available Do you miss Sydney?.
not_available Every now and again.
not_available Where are you from?.
not_available Newton, Mass.
not_available You didn't want to train at the Brigham?.
not_available No, I'm all about Michigan Avenue.
not_available Get Banfield! God! What happened?.
not_available Get security.
not_available I saw a piece of glass in Julie's leg, I wanted to get it out with the tweezers.
not_available But I wanted to sterilize them with a flame first so she didn't get an infection.
not_available But I accidentally dropped it on the bed sheet.
not_available T ake her to another room and don't let her leave.
not_available Looks like 1 5 percent body surface area.
not_available Nothing circumferential.
GUARD Let's go.
not_available I didn't mean it.
not_available I was just helping.
SAM What should I do?.
not_available Hang another liter of Ringer's.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner, call the Burn Unit and get back to your other patients.
not_available Who are you, Stevie Wonder?.
not_available Did you see her smile?.
not_available Her legs?.
not_available lsn't she lovely?.
not_available Forget lovely.
not_available I' m not doing it.
not_available Why?.
not_available Give me one good reason.
not_available You' re gay?.
not_available Not that there's
not_available I'm not gay.
not_available You're seeing someone?.
not_available She
not_available lmpotent?.
not_available Because she's a patient.
not_available A technicality.
not_available Do it for the team.
not_available Okay, here it is Sanchez, okay?.
not_available She's a call girl.
not_available Yeah, a whore, an escort.
not_available So it's even better than I thought.
not_available We're all whores.
not_available You prescribe antibiotics from some drug companies that give you stethoscopes and free lunch, whore.
not_available Look, I am done with dating.
not_available Ryan, the last girl I really liked took my heart to Caracas.
not_available You're just gonna sit on the sidelines forever?.
not_available Yeah, that's the plan.
not_available Then I need another mentor.
not_available Why?.
not_available I want someone who's well
not_available rounded and understands interpersonal relationships.
not_available I understand them.
not_available Then get in the game, Archibald.
not_available It's time.
not_available Keep the Ringer's at 85 cc's per hour.
not_available Ortho's ready for her in the O.R., then she has a Burn Unit bed.
not_available Let's move her to surgery.
not_available Why does she need that?.
not_available They need to pin the femur.
LAUREN Is she gonna be okay?.
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available But we need to talk about something else.
not_available I'm afraid Claire is a danger to others, Mrs.
not_available O'Fallon.
not_available No, it was an accident, like she said.
not_available There was no glass in Julie's leg.
not_available How do you know if her legs were burned?.
not_available I realize this is hard.
not_available Claire is a good kid.
not_available Has she been depressed lately?.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, maybe a little.
not_available Uh, her friend got hit by a car last spring, but I thought she was over that.
not_available Someone from Psychiatry needs to talk to her.
not_available Why?.
not_available She's just acting out.
not_available Well, we'll see if they agree.
not_available And if they don't?.
not_available Then she might need to spend some time in the hospital.
not_available My kids are okay.
not_available Claire's down the hall.
not_available You're welcome to go be with her.
not_available Physical and psychological things 
not_available can push kids to do all kinds of stuff.
not_available I know, Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available If this woman is hurting them, all this makes sense.
not_available We're both trying to get to the bottom of it.
not_available Go clear some patients.
not_available Score any goals?.
not_available They got to go get pizza and see a movie, and I'm stuck here.
not_available Why can't I go home?.
not_available You take that thing out?.
not_available No.
not_available It's my body, and I can do what I want with it.
not_available Sarah, I know it's your body.
not_available This is something we have to discuss.
not_available You know, you're getting to that age where you're, you know you're starting to get curious about boys and sex.
not_available What does a tongue stud have to do with sex?.
not_available Come on, Sarah, don't play dumb with me.
not_available That's not why I got it.
not_available Do you have a boyfriend?.
not_available No.
not_available And I'm not having sex.
not_available We thought it would be fun.
not_available I was gonna do my belly button, but they bet me 1 0 bucks to do my tongue.
not_available I'll give you 20 bucks to take it out.
not_available Tony.
not_available Listen.
not_available I want you to take that out before you go back to school on Monday.
not_available Fine.
not_available I think you're overreacting.
not_available I know this is weird, you know?.
not_available And it's weird for me too, but do me a favor.
not_available Next time you think about piercing something else on your body or if you wanna talk about sex, then you come to me, okay?.
not_available Because I'm here for you.
CHUCK I'll just wait over here.
BRENNER All right, give me a minute.
not_available You know, it killed me to put her in a nursing home but after a while, I couldn't deny that she put the eggs in the hamper ice in the microwave.
not_available Alzheimer's is hard.
not_available Oh, it kills you.
not_available She doesn't remember me half the time.
not_available And him?.
not_available He can't even help out.
not_available His blood
not_available alcohol level came back.
not_available It was zero, none detected.
not_available The other driver ran a red light, Mr.
not_available Holmes.
not_available I know your son has made mistakes in the past but let him show you that he's changed.
not_available He's trying.
not_available How is she?.
NEELA The surgery went well.
not_available We were able to repair her pulmonary artery and vein.
not_available Good
not_available That's good, right?.
not_available I mean, at her age, her rehab could be a while but she's already starting to wake up.
not_available Thank God.
not_available When can l
not_available ?.
not_available When can we see her?.
not_available Come on, I'll take you to Recovery.
not_available That seems like it calls for a celebration.
not_available Bringing up Baby is playing at the Limelight, we should, uh
not_available We should go.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm working here, late.
not_available Or we could grab a quick coffee at the Jumbo Mart?.
not_available Think of it as an olive branch.
not_available All right, coffee it is.
not_available Great.
not_available I will meet you out the front, one hour.
not_available Good thing you weren't seriously hurt.
not_available Been a few muggings recently that didn't end so well.
not_available How much time will he get for this?.
not_available Depends on his priors.
not_available You'll be called for a court date.
not_available I don't have time for court.
not_available Unless he takes a deal, this is the only way we can put him behind bars.
not_available Here, if you have any questions, call me.
CATHERlNE Thanks.
not_available How you doing?.
not_available I'm fine, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available You know, I don't get it.
not_available You get mugged, you beat him up, you're injured but you still go through the day?.
not_available I don't buckle, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sometimes you might wanna give yourself a break.
CATHERlNE No.
not_available Because then I might have to give someone else one.
CATHERlNE Just wait outside for me.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Sure.
not_available So how you doing, Claire?.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You know, you never told me what grade you were in.
not_available Sixth.
not_available What do you think of school?.
not_available It's boring.
not_available You know, some kids, when they're bored, they cut class.
not_available I've never done that.
not_available Hm.
not_available Your mom said you did.
not_available School's a waste of time.
not_available I'm smarter than most of the teachers.
not_available Hm.
not_available How do you and your sister get along?.
not_available Okay.
not_available She thinks she's going to the Olympics.
not_available What happens when you fight?.
not_available My sister and I always fought.
not_available It really sucks, because she's always right.
not_available She's Little Miss Perfect.
not_available And even if she starts it, my mom always sides with her.
not_available That must bug you.
not_available It's every day.
not_available If she breaks a plate, it's because I bumped into her.
not_available How do you get back at someone for doing that?.
not_available Teach her a lesson.
not_available By doing what?.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Are you sure?.
not_available Claire, we have video cameras in the ceilings of our trauma rooms.
not_available We saw you adjust the ventilator and light the sheet on fire.
not_available I didn't want to kill her.
not_available I just wanted to mess her up.
not_available You did.
not_available If she's in the hospital, Mom will see what a good girl I am.
not_available She won't be blaming me for everything.
not_available Is that why you pushed her off the wall?.
not_available Claire, they're accusing your mother of child abuse which means she could go to jail, and your sister and you could both go to foster homes.
not_available Now, something tells me that she doesn't hit you two and she didn't push your sister.
not_available Did you do it, Claire?.
not_available Did you?.
not_available It was cool seeing her lying there all pale, with blood coming out.
not_available And then when she couldn't move, and her legs were getting burned it was great.
not_available That made you feel good?.
not_available Really good.
not_available Hm.
not_available Well.
not_available It'll probably be better if you stay in the hospital for a while.
not_available Why?.
not_available I'm not sick.
not_available We just think it would be a good idea.
not_available No, I won't.
not_available I won't! No, I won't! I won't! I won't! 
not_available Claire.
not_available Claire.
SAM I got her.
CATHERlNE Get me a gurney.
not_available Mommy.
not_available Call the Psych Ward.
not_available We can hang out now that Julie is in the hospital.
GATES What's happening?.
not_available Claire, relax.
CLAlRE No! Help, Mommy! 
GATES Come on.
not_available Mommy, help me! Claire, relax.
not_available Let us take care of her, Ms.
not_available O'Fallon.
not_available Relax.
not_available Get off of me! Get 2.5 of Haldol.
not_available Ativan.
not_available Hard restraints.
not_available This is just for a short time, right?.
not_available Then I can take her home soon?.
not_available I will kill you! I will kill you! I will kill you! I'm gonna cut you up into little pieces.
not_available Can't remember last time we did a right
not_available sided thoracotomy.
not_available The guy's lucky.
not_available Well, l, uh, lost a trucker in Sydney with a right hilar tear.
not_available You miss it once, you never forget.
not_available I guess you're right.
not_available We should go, uh, salsa dancing sometime.
not_available How do you know I like dancing and old comedies?.
not_available I do my research.
not_available We're just gonna be friends.
not_available I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
not_available What, you mean sleeping with me?.
not_available The awkward shag that on a horrible day, doesn't count as ""sleeping with you"" 
not_available it counts as poor judgment.
not_available Oh, you romantic fool.
not_available I thought we fit well together.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, I'm not gonna hound you.
not_available I'm not gonna beg.
not_available But one day, you will wake up next to me and you're gonna wonder, ""How did this happen?.
not_available "" And I'm gonna smile and remind you that I predicted this over coffees and chocolate
not_available glazed donuts.
not_available You're a cocky bastard.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I'll be a correct cocky bastard and that's all that will matter.
not_available You ready to go?.
not_available Are you all right?.
not_available Oh, Claire left her coat down here.
not_available You know, about a month ago I, um, caught her throwing rocks at the neighbor's dog.
not_available And then a few days later, she was trying to stick a metal rod through one of the fish in our tank.
not_available And I just tried to pretend it was normal.
not_available You know, just a kid acting out.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available Why her?.
not_available Why our family?.
not_available I don't know.
not_available That's all you can say?.
not_available You can't lie to me and tell me that she's gonna be okay?.
not_available That she's gonna grow up to be a normal girl?.
not_available I mean, that's why we come here, to get answers.
not_available You're gonna have to do better than that.
not_available I'm sorry, that's all I have.
not_available Well that's not good enough, doctor.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available MAN 1 [VOlCE
not_available OVER.]
 No, he doesn 't take anything.
not_available MAN 2 [VOlCE

 Get some atropine.
not_available MAN 3 [VOlCE

not_available MAN 9 [VOlCE

 We have no choice.
not_available MAN 1 [VOlCE

 Clear.
