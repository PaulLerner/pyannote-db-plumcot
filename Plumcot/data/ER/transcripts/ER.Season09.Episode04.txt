not_available Yeah, metal detectors.
not_available Bulletproof glass.

not_available The gang go out again last night? 
not_available It's not a gang.
not_available It's a club.
not_available Not another stage
not_available diving incident, I hope? First rule of girls' club is we don't talk about girls' club.
not_available You won't tell me what you did? 
not_available The usual.
not_available Crank calls, pillow fights, lesbian experimentation.
not_available They're live in a minute.
not_available We need your outlet.
not_available What channel? Four.
not_available You'll keep it down once were rolling, right? Nothing new on the board? It's three hours since we had a patient, five since the last ambulance.
not_available What's that about? 
not_available Mission General reopened.
not_available Oh, don't sound so depressed.
not_available I'm waiting on some action.
not_available In school, we ate dried eel and almonds.
not_available I think I'll live with the headache.
not_available Eel? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available For Susan's hangover.
not_available Kudzu.
not_available What? Asian root.
not_available You make a tea with it.
not_available Hair of the dog that bit you.
not_available It feels like a pack of dogs and they all had a Mexican tag.
not_available Thank you for getting me home.
not_available I'm so sorry about your shoes.
not_available Sounds like some party.
not_available Theyre starting.
not_available Okay, folks, a little quiet.
not_available Were coming to you from County General Hospital 
not_available Fixing her hair.
not_available with its Chief of Emergency Medicine.
not_available We've asked her to demonstrate how easy it is to get a flu shot.
not_available Tell us, Dr.
not_available Kerry.
not_available Any risks associated with this? You may experience some mild flu
not_available like symptoms, muscle ache, low fever.
not_available But it's really a very safe prophylactic measure.
not_available Now, a week or more of misery is worse than one little shot, isn't it? Yes.
not_available And that's why we recommend flu shots for the elderly, those with chronic illnesses and anyone taking care of or exposed to sick people.
not_available Wow, that was like butter.
not_available So, what's the other one for? Tell me she didn't forget to switch needles.
not_available She forgot to switch needles.
not_available Nice setup you got here.
not_available It ought to keep the riffraff out.
not_available So how did you manage to score opening
not_available day triage duty? I'm thinking a nice doctor put in a good word.
not_available I hate triage.
not_available Nothing to do, Pratt? 
not_available I'm orienting Lola.
not_available Mona.
not_available Melanie Shepherd? Yes.
not_available Take you in now.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Right.

not_available Come on.
not_available Where's Mommy going? 
not_available Stop whining and sit down.
not_available When can we go home? I wanna go home.
not_available What? Are you a baby? Is this what big boys do? Hey, shut up.
not_available Mommy is not gonna get any better if you don't knock it off.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Do you need anything? 
not_available No.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I want Mommy.
not_available I want Mommy.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, if you do not shut upSir, I don't mean to interrupt you, but
not_available Then don't.
not_available Okay, pal? You're real helpful now.
not_available Where were you three hours ago when we got here? Stop it.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available Will you stop it? 
not_available I'll take a look.
not_available I have my own internist.
not_available You almost found yourself a badge.
not_available Excuse me? I'm guessing Eagle Scout.
not_available I didn't wanna make it worse.
not_available Did you make it any better? 
not_available I tried.
not_available I wanna take karate.
not_available Karate? Really? 
not_available I was thinking judo.
not_available But I want something more aggressive.
not_available So you like it rough? A gun to the head brings out the fighter in a girl.
not_available Now you' re showing off.
not_available Your girlfriend's asking for you.
not_available Girlfriend? Stella Willits, 45 frequent flyer, going on 60, with a borderline personality.
not_available Yes.
not_available That sounds about right.
not_available Asking for Michael Gallant, M.
not_available D.
not_available I've seen her four times in the last week.
not_available You' re doing an excellent job.
not_available Get her exam.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available The tests are a precaution.
not_available They should take about an hour.
not_available Then I'll know if she infected me.
not_available Don't be such a jerk.
not_available She used to date a bisexual.
not_available He wasn't a bisexual.
not_available He was just open
not_available minded.
not_available Right.
not_available I'll be back when the results are in.
not_available You wanted to do the medical spot.
not_available Shut up, Leland.
not_available You shut up.
not_available No, you shut up.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Is anyone aware that, according to this, there aren't enough nurses on duty to reach the maximum patienttonurse ratios? 
not_available I'll take a look at it.
not_available Not even an MICN scheduled Friday.
not_available Randi, get Haleh on the phone.
not_available She's off.
not_available I don't care.
not_available She's the nurse manager.
not_available Nope.
not_available She resigned in September.
not_available Have they appointed a replacement? 
not_available Yep.
not_available She resigned last week.
not_available Why wasn't I informed? You haven't been around that much.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver your makeup looked great.
not_available Abby could you come by my office later? Sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano's office? 
not_available Why? Let's make it 2.
not_available Breathe in deep.
not_available Good.
not_available Again.
not_available I gave up cholesterol, Michael, after our little talk.
not_available You'll thank me later.
not_available I'd thank you now.
not_available Find anything? 
not_available Chest pain, reproducible by palpation.
not_available Hey, you know Howdy Doody? You look like Howdy Doody.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I hate Howdy Doody.
not_available Sorry to hear that, Miss Willits.
not_available Call me Stella.
not_available It means "star, " you know.
not_available I'm concerned about her dyspnea on exertion.
not_available My what? 
not_available Your shortness of breath.
not_available Congestive heart failure? Her lungs are dry.
not_available It could be symptomatic ischemia.
not_available Flat T waves in her lateral leads.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I'd still recommend O2, aspirin, nitro paste, and a card's consult.
not_available She should go upstairs for monitoring.
not_available I think that might be premature.
not_available Why don't we send some enzymes get her old chart, take a look at her previous 12
not_available lead? If the changes are acute? Have Cardiology come down.
not_available So are you gonna run some tests now? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Can I go out and grab a smoke first? Dr.
not_available Corday will take care of your wife.
not_available How long have you been retired? I ain't retired.
not_available I'm not.
not_available A nurse's work is never done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How's the hangover? I'm going with aspirin and caffeine.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abby said it was a good time.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She hasn't cheated on you since that stripper named Thor.
not_available I can be concerned, right? Don't be.
not_available He was wearing an American flag thong.
not_available No.
not_available I mean her drinking.
not_available Did I bring my lunch? 
not_available We'll get you something.
not_available I'm the one who barfed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But she's the alcoholic.
not_available It's not easy to stay on the program when you' re out bar
not_available hopping.
not_available The program? I thought you knew.
not_available Would you take Mr.
not_available Evans upstairs to CT? She doesn't drink that much.
not_available I never even thought about it.
not_available What's not that much? 
not_available If you' re worried, talk to her.
not_available Carter, films are back on your patellar fracture.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Exam 1? What's the best way to rule out PE? A spiral CT or a V/Q scan? Okay, I'm only gonna say this once.
not_available I hate surprise parties.
not_available Carter assumed I was in the loop.
not_available What loop? The drinking loop? He's concerned.
not_available Which I think is very sweet.
not_available I didn't want you to feel weird about it
not_available It's none of my business.
not_available I just wanted us to have a good time.
not_available I understand.
not_available You've seen me.
not_available It's not like
not_available It's between you and Carter.
not_available I'm sorry he got you into it.
not_available No.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available He thought I knew.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it's not like it's a big secret either.
not_available It's Kerry.
not_available Susan.
not_available Abby.
not_available You don't think she could be? 
not_available No chance.
not_available That's how it looked.
not_available The straightest gay woman since Janet Reno? I don't think so.
not_available You're right.
not_available She was probably just practicing her flu shots.
not_available She could use practice.
not_available My turn now? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available When is my turn? 
not_available Later.
not_available I was here before.
not_available Go back to your seat, Phil.
not_available Where's the nearest bar? We should have left him in triage.
not_available The other patients were complaining.
not_available Abby.
not_available The junkie in 4 fell out of bed and lost his IV.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Listen It's just not something I talk about much.
not_available We' re friends, Abby.
not_available If you wanna talk you know where I am.
not_available And if not, that's okay too.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Did you get meat loaf this trip, Miss Willits? 
not_available No, I'm a vegan now.
not_available Good for you.
not_available It's a simple case of costochondritis.
not_available I think the DOE is her anginal equivalent.
not_available Or it could simply be that the only exercise the old bird gets is lighting her cigarettes.
not_available Send her home on Naprosyn.
not_available Do you still work here? 
not_available Last I checked.
not_available Shouldn't we be concerned about progressive dyspnea? When you become an actual doctor, Mr.
not_available Gallant then you can make the diagnosis.
not_available Just thought you might want to monitor her in Cardiology.
not_available Don't know why your student calls me in for a consult, then refuses my advice.
not_available Just trying to be thorough? She had 10 unnecessary admissions for rule
not_available out MI in two years.
not_available She always had flat T waves.
not_available Next time, check the records.
not_available I did.
not_available Then you know I already cath'd her.
not_available So much for thoroughness.
not_available Did you check the chart? 
not_available There's no record of a cath in there.
not_available I looked in volumes 8 and 9, since 2000.
not_available Maybe he cath'd her before.
not_available A lot could have changed.
not_available If he won't admit her, we can't do much.
not_available Can we keep her for observation? 
not_available We cannot.
not_available We don't have any beds.
not_available We got 10 patients waiting.
not_available She needs a monitor.
not_available You have a minute? Yeah.
not_available I can give you two.
not_available We can park her in the hall till a bed opens up.
not_available Until her troponin comes back from the lab.
not_available I talked to Susan.
not_available Abby? Elevenyear
not_available old with possible UTI.
not_available Okay, I'm coming.
not_available Me too.
not_available A little help, folks? Unidentified Latino found seizing in a phone booth.
not_available Gave two of Ativan.
not_available Head atraumatic.
not_available Pulse ox, 99.
not_available Glucose 110 GCS five on scene.
not_available Looks post
not_available ictal, but he's got a good DBI.
not_available DBI? Dirt
not_available ball index.
not_available Big dog, lots of tattoos.
not_available He's gonna be all right because he has tattoos? Good guys die, bad dogs walk.
not_available This one looks like he's gonna be okay.
not_available He has a little abrasion to his chin.
not_available No prison tats.
not_available Too bad.
not_available They count double.
not_available He's military.
not_available Sats, 98.
not_available BP, 110/76.
not_available I don't know if I'm supposed to.
not_available Slow down.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available It's all right.
not_available How about that signature? 
not_available Margaret usually signs.
not_available Well, she can't right now.
not_available That's why I need you to do it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, she's waking up.
not_available Thomas, I want you to stay right here for a moment, okay? 
not_available Third unit going in.
not_available Hold the FFP until we' re upstairs.
not_available Margaret Margaret, I'm Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available You were in an accident.
not_available Is Thomas okay? Yes.
not_available He's fine.
not_available But you've suffered a splenic laceration.
not_available And your husband feels unable to sign the consent for your surgery.
not_available Operation? I can't.
not_available There is some risk involved, but it needs to be done.
not_available I can't stay in bed so long.
not_available He couldn't cope without me.
not_available I'm sure he'll make do.
not_available He has Alzheimer.
not_available Well, you shouldn't be incapacitated very long.
not_available But you need to sign so we can help you.
not_available Please can't we just wait and see? Margaret, splenic fractures can form clots that may hold for a while.
not_available But if the clot breaks, you might bleed to death before we can fix it.
not_available Meds are in.
not_available PER
not_available R.
not_available What? 
not_available Pupils equal, round and reactive.
not_available Airway's good.
not_available Gato, you okay, man? We've given him some medication to prevent seizures.
not_available Has he been sick recently? We were out late, going hard.
not_available He seemed fine.
not_available He just got back on leave.
not_available He hasn't even seen his girl.
not_available Nothing besides alcohol, right? Coke, ecstasy? 
not_available Just beer and bourbon.
not_available No liberty stunts, right? 
not_available How's that? He shows signs of toxicity.
not_available You guys didn't play any pranks? Roofies, quaaludes? 
not_available He's our buddy, all right? Easy, sergeant.
not_available We just need to be sure.
not_available We wouldn't do that.
not_available Okay.
not_available You guys can wait in the hall.
not_available Gallant, send up a Dilantin level in 15 minutes.
not_available Got it.
not_available Malik, let's go.
not_available Keep him on two liters, pulse ox You guys are Rangers? Seventy
not_available fifth Regiment, Special Forces Group.
not_available Where they taking him? He needs a CT to check for any sign of a tumor or intracranial bleeding.
not_available You guys see action? 
not_available Nothing to talk about.
not_available I did a summer duty down at Fort Houston a few months back.
not_available You Army? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Medical Corps.
not_available Why are you here? 
not_available Finishing med school.
not_available Must be rough.
not_available We spent the last three months jumping out of Black Hawks on the Pakistani border.
not_available Let us know when our buddy's back.
not_available It burns when she pees.
not_available She's achy and sick to her stomach.
not_available Low
not_available grade fever.
not_available I think it's from the trip.
not_available On vacation? 
not_available No.
not_available Just a weekend away.
not_available We' re supposed to go to Shedd Aquarium.
not_available Has she had any UTIs before? A bunch.
not_available It usually clears up with antibiotics.
not_available Her doctor gave us some Bactrim, but I left it in Milwaukee.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's dip a urine.
not_available I don't want a catheter, okay? You' re the boss.
not_available So, what kind of accent is that? What accent? 
not_available Come on.
not_available Where are you from? I don't think you've heard of it.
not_available A place called Idaho.
not_available Well, that explains it.
not_available You like potatoes? Who doesn't? 
not_available Mom.
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me go get you a sandwich.
not_available Here you go, Abby.
not_available Why are you giving me this? 
not_available Next Friday.
not_available I need it off.
not_available I'd like a month in the Bahamas.
not_available I'll settle for a long weekend at my cousin's.
not_available Jerry, are the labs back on my UTE girl? No.
not_available But look.
not_available I made origami.
not_available It's a swan.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I think it is.
not_available You should hang it on the refrigerator by your report card.
not_available Thanks, Mom.
not_available You're the best.
not_available Hello.
not_available We are waiting for your labs.
not_available I got bored in there.
not_available There's too many sick people.
not_available Where's your mom? 
not_available She went to the cafeteria.
not_available To get food? It's not a good idea.
not_available We' re supposed to do all this fun stuff.
not_available I wanted to see the aquarium.
not_available The aquarium? Really? 
not_available You should have said so.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Open room? Try Exam 2.
not_available How's his CT? 
not_available It was all clear.
not_available What's going on, Stella? Nicotine fits are a bitch.
not_available We' re checking on a bed for you, okay? How about a decent coffee? How's he doing? 
not_available No sign of a tumor.
not_available That's good.
not_available What's up with his mouth? We gave him a charcoal slurry to soak up drugs in his GI tract.
not_available Look, I already told you guys.
not_available There's something toxic in your buddy's system, okay? We' re just trying to fix him up.
not_available Hey how are you feeling, bro? Perk? 
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available It's Sammo.
not_available Hey, is Elena here? We called her.
not_available She wasn't home.
not_available Where are we? 
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Gallant, Felix.
not_available You're in County Hospital.
not_available My eyes.
not_available Are my eyes open? 
not_available Shut up, fool.
not_available I can't see you.
not_available Cut it out.
not_available I can't see anything.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Hold still.
not_available Okay, bring me a scope, page Ophtho, find Carter.
not_available Not quite the Shedd Aquarium.
not_available But it's the best we got.
not_available You could be over
not_available feeding them.
not_available Do you think the water smells weird? Or someone else could be.
not_available Or maybe it's our funny way of warning people they' re entering a house of death.
not_available Are you really a good nurse? I'm technically proficient, despite certain attitude issues.
not_available Well, then maybe I should have stayed in Milwaukee.
not_available Is that where your dad is? He moved away.
not_available My parents are getting divorced.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It sucks bigtime.
not_available Well, you know? Now you get to double up on presents, right? 
not_available Christmas and your birthday.
not_available I guess.
not_available There's always the fun of playing one against the other.
not_available Actually, I did that before anyway.
not_available Now I just live with my mom.
not_available You know, moms can be cool.
not_available I grew up with just a mom.
not_available And it was good? Yes.
not_available Have you seen Phil? 
not_available No.
not_available Her labs aren't back? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Whatever she says about pet care, disregard.
not_available Yeah, I kind of got that idea.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Ken.
not_available Where do you keep the oral contrast? Why? Did you lose a drunk again? Try the hall.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I misplaced an x
not_available ray.
not_available Did you find it? I've checked everywhere.
not_available I keep walking into the wrong doors today.
not_available Luka and UTI Mom? Yeah.
not_available Is this kind of thing normal in Croatia? Yeah.
not_available They call it "alternative medicine.
not_available " I'm not supposed to laugh.
not_available It's a patient's mother.
not_available Where did you find them? 
not_available In the closet in Radiology.
not_available That's so strange.
not_available Neuro's so much more cozy.
not_available Is that what you two were like? 
not_available No.
not_available We stuck to beds mostly.
not_available Too bad.
not_available I think you should talk to him.
not_available Me? 
not_available You know him better.
not_available You walked in on him.
not_available I'm not the sex police.
not_available We get the labs on Hernandez? Ophtho can't give an assessment 
not_available till we ID the cause of his vision loss.
not_available Here you go.
not_available What's his bloodalcohol level? 
not_available None detected.
not_available I'm going for coffee.
not_available Does anybody want anything? No, I'm good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No methanol or ethanol in his system.
not_available What about tricyclics? 
not_available Tox screen's negative.
not_available I did think of something else.
not_available An anti
not_available malarial is used in the service.
not_available Quinine.
not_available Something he might have access to that isn't detectable in the tox screen.
not_available You'd have to take a lot of quinine to get that sick.
not_available I know.
not_available Want me to talk to him? No.
not_available Why don't you let Gallant handle it? Give it your best shot, Mikey.
not_available You should come see Milwaukee sometime.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I hear they have good beer.
not_available You' re very informed about U.S.
not_available regional consumables.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be back when the labs are in.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Can we discharge this patient? They've been here four hours.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We' re still waiting on Chem
not_available 7.
not_available I saw the chart.
not_available Looks like a simple UTI.
not_available I'm concerned about vesicoureteral reflux.
not_available Luka, come on.
not_available What? Well, let's clear this patient as soon as possible.
not_available Her workup is not finished.
not_available Well, her mother's is.
not_available And unless you have unusual stamina, there's no further reason to keep them.
not_available The girl's at risk for renal insufficiency.
not_available What I'm trying to say is that when you' re waiting on a patient's results it's not necessary for you to boff that patient's mother in the storage closet.
not_available Get the labs back, write a scrip, dispo the girl.
not_available Chemistries on your little girl.
not_available Is she a renal patient? She is now.
not_available Did my girl call back? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available I guess she won't then.
not_available How's your vision? Starting to see shapes.
not_available You get my peepers going, I'll be fine.
not_available You were in the Philippines? 
not_available Before Pakistan, yeah.
not_available You ever hear of quinine? What about it? 
not_available Service gives it out to prevent malaria.
not_available So? It also induces blindness 
not_available when ingested in large quantities.
not_available Maybe they gave me too much overseas.
not_available This would have been something you ingested in the last 12 hours, Felix.
not_available Maybe you found out something when you got home.
not_available Like about your girl? 
not_available You don't know me.
not_available I know that in combat, home is the only thing that keeps you going.
not_available You want things to be the same when you get backAre you a shrink or a doctor? 
not_available Only it's not.
not_available Like, "What's the point?" To make you better, I gotta know what made you sick.
not_available When you' re in country it's easy to forget that life keeps going.
not_available Sometimes without you.
not_available Elena? She waited for me a long time.
not_available I guess she got tired of waiting.
not_available Just fix me up, okay? Just fix it.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll get you some bicarbonate to eliminate the toxins.
not_available And I'll get somebody down here to talk to you.
not_available I'm Special Forces.
not_available This gets out, I'm through.
not_available Look, Felix, I'm concerned about getting you healthy.
not_available It was a split second.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available If I put you in touch with a clinic
not_available I'll do counseling, I promise.
not_available Look, I'll follow it up, Felix.
not_available You won't have to.
not_available I'll be okay this time.
not_available Hey, have they croaked yet? Your fish? 
not_available Honey.
not_available I'm much better with human patients.
not_available You must not be a Pisces.
not_available Okay, just for that you' re getting meat loaf for lunch today.
not_available We were wondering where you went.
not_available Marlene's blood tests are back.
not_available They show a high creatinine level consistent with chronic renal failure.
not_available We have to send for an ultrasound.
not_available You said it didn't look like anything.
not_available It's still not clear.
not_available That's why we need to image the kidneys and bladder.
not_available A renal ultrasound is fast, very easy, and it'll help us figure out the problem.
not_available But I thought it was just an infection.
not_available That's what we were hoping for.
not_available And it's painless, so you don't have to be afraid.
not_available Well, that's as long as I'm not a fish.
not_available That's right.
not_available Ready to go for a spin? 
not_available It's okay, we'll just take pictures.
not_available Okay.
not_available You better call Dad.
not_available Can you pop a wheelie again? 
not_available Sure, hold on tight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Should I be scared? Won't make it any easier.
not_available It's gonna be like a ride, right? Kind of.
not_available I bet you say that to all the kids.
not_available I need some Brevital for 2.
not_available Sure.
not_available Dislocated elbow? How long you on for? I have to stick around for the shift change.
not_available I can hang around.
not_available How does a couple of burgers, some shakes and maybe see if you get lucky sound? I haven't had an offer that good since the eighth grade.
not_available Yeah, but I'm treating.
not_available Thirteenyear

not_available In boarding school, they do.
not_available Well, make me a counteroffer.
not_available Are you out of Brevital? Only Versed.
not_available Plus 200 of fent.
not_available We gonna talk about this Carter? 
not_available I got a patient waiting.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is this backing off? Because if I get to choose, I prefer butting in.
not_available I took care of that this morning.
not_available I know.
not_available I blew your cover.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Then what? 
not_available I want us to be clear is all.
not_available I think it's pretty clear.
not_available My time sheet.
not_available Why are you giving me that? No.
not_available You' re the nurse manager, right? Guess again.
not_available Memo from Weaver.
not_available What? Weren't you supposed to see her today? Yeah.
not_available I kind of dodged that.
not_available Funny how that happens.
not_available I had rounds.
not_available You kids fighting? 
not_available Shut up, Jerry.
not_available You should talk to her.
not_available What? I'm just trying to help navigate love's wavy water What do you people have against paper? Jerry, what's the guard there for? 
not_available Psych hold.
not_available What? Why? Guy's suicidal.
not_available They' re moving him up to a locked ward.
not_available Do you have his chart? 
not_available Yeah, it's right here.
not_available Where's Pratt? 
not_available Try Curtain 2.
not_available I'll be right back, Mr.
not_available Geary.
not_available Don't throw up just yet.
not_available Do you know where Dr.
not_available Pratt is? 
not_available Exam 1, with a Valium OD.
not_available ABG results? 
not_available It's on the clipboard.
not_available You re
not_available did the Hernandez chart? Get RT to drop to 80 percent, and check her gas in an hour.
not_available Because you marked it "accidental.
not_available " 
not_available So what? So? Nobody takes that many pills without meaning to off themselves.
not_available That was not your call to make.
not_available What's your problem, brother? I'm trying to watch your back.
not_available I have a lot of brothers.
not_available I don't need another.
not_available Don't need a malpractice suit either.
not_available Why are you always riding me? You need to learn to stick up for yourself.
not_available I told Kayson what I thought.
not_available You didn't make him hear you.
not_available Look, okay, you know what? I do things the way I do things.
not_available Okay? You and me? We' re different.
not_available No.
not_available We're not that different.
not_available We're both trying to fit in.
not_available The only difference is that I'm doing it by being a man.

not_available two centimeters.
not_available It's in the right stem.
not_available Must've put the balloon past the cords.

not_available That might pull it out.

not_available That's nice.
not_available CT? 
not_available Negative.
not_available Negative? Is that okay? 
not_available You' re fine, Thomas.
not_available But we had to remove Margaret's spleen.
not_available She has some liver damage.
not_available It caused bleeding.
not_available And for a while, her blood pressure was very low.
not_available That's not good.
not_available No.
not_available We had to put her on a breathing machine, a ventilator.
not_available We' re not sure when she'll come off it.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available Would you like to go and see her? I can take you up.
not_available See who? 
not_available Margaret, your wife.
not_available My wife couldn't come today.
not_available Yes, Thomas.
not_available She's upstairs.
not_available Margaret.
not_available Margaret? Margaret who? Thomas, do you remember why you're here? I remember.
not_available I remember everything.
not_available Charge to 360.

not_available Call it.
not_available Time of death, 
16 57.
not_available Is there any family we need to talk to? Nobody.
not_available She didn't have nobody.
not_available A frequent flier with atypical presentation.
not_available Ninety
not_available nine times out of 100, nothing happens.
not_available You go with the odds.
not_available If you like to gamble.
not_available Sometimes there's nothing else you can do.
not_available You'll learn that soon enough.
not_available Progressive symptoms of dyspnea, suggesting cardiac ischemia.
not_available Gallant.
not_available I let you miss the signs.
not_available She was a batty, self
not_available medicating hypochondriac.
not_available Who you did not feel like dealing with.
not_available Let it go now.
not_available If she was admitted, we could've picked up the V
not_available tach.
not_available We could have gotten her back with early cardioversion.
not_available If you felt strongly, you should have spoken.
not_available He tried.
not_available Is anyone talking to you? With all due respect, you' re Chief of Cardiology.
not_available He's a medical student.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And I offered him my expertise and guidance.
not_available And where did it get me? Where did it get her? Nothing.
not_available She is dead.
not_available Easy, son.
not_available I am not your son.
not_available Pratt, take him for a walk.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available All right.
not_available Are you training doctors or pit bulls? 
not_available He's upset we lost her.
not_available You should have put her on a monitor.
not_available You should have paid more attention.
not_available Patient care is all about taking calculated risks.
not_available I thought it was taking care of the patient.
not_available You know, it's really something, the way you all stick together down here.
not_available Mikey, listen.
not_available What you did in there, that was a man.
not_available That's what being a man is.
not_available Come here.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Guys.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Hey, calm down.
not_available Do not call me Mikey.
not_available Lucky I know how to take a punch.
not_available So that's why you were on the floor.
not_available Hey, how's that feel? You should see the other guy.
not_available Maybe I should go talk to him.
not_available You might wait a bit on that.
not_available Susan, can you get the nursing schedules together for Abby to work on? I was hall monitor for a day in fifth grade, fired for selling passes to the kids.
not_available I'm sure you've matured since.
not_available Not that much, really.
not_available It's my understanding the position comes with a raise.
not_available It's not the money.
not_available If it was about money, why would I be working here? The Director of Nursing agrees with my recommendation.
not_available The job is yours, like it or not.
not_available Like it or not? 
not_available I don't care to argue about it.
not_available Okay, how much? Excuse me? 
not_available How much is the raise? I'll get back to you.
not_available Kerry? Romano sent this.
not_available What did it say? "Your 15 minutes is up.
not_available " Hey, Pratt wants you to hit him on the other side of the face, even things out.
not_available She had a daughter who died in a car crash.
not_available She's been alone since then.
not_available You know, Kayson knows what happened in here today.
not_available He was right.
not_available I backed down.
not_available That's not how I saw it.
not_available No, I always back down.
not_available We' re supposed to be saving lives.
not_available And sometimes it just seems like we end up fighting each other.
not_available I mean, I should I should have fought for her.
not_available I could have tried harder with Kayson too.
not_available She was my patient.
not_available She trusted me.
not_available She would be alive now if I wasn't so scared of being wrong.
not_available Everybody gets scared.
not_available Not Pratt.
not_available Sure he does.
not_available Why do you think he acts so cocky all the time? Everybody that comes in here does.
not_available But you learn to work through it.
not_available When does that happen? As soon as you've killed a patient.
not_available I just did.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available Maybe you won't have to.
not_available Don't stay in here for too long.
not_available Marlene's ultrasound came back positive for bilateral renal scarring.
not_available Are her kidneys shot? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She definitely needs surgery.
not_available All those UTls in Milwaukee, and no one ever caught it.
not_available Yeah, somebody should have.
not_available VCUG first? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Start her on gentamicin.
not_available And the moral of the story is? Never sleep with a patient's mother.
not_available At least not until the labs are back.
not_available A little girl's sick.
not_available Next to that, nothing much matters.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Janet, can I speak to you? Chuny, can you mix me a bag of gent? What room? 
not_available I'll take it, get me started.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I thought you were on till 7.
not_available Deb's covering the shift change.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm not really sure what we' re not talking about.
not_available Can't this wait until we' re off? Who's angry with who? 
not_available I'm not angry.
not_available Okay.
not_available And I never lied to you.
not_available Well, I guess I must have talked myself into something.
not_available Well, let's figure it out.
not_available No.
not_available I agreed not to rescue you, or help you, or fix you, so I'm just gonna shut up and wait for the car wreck.
not_available Wait.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? We both know where this is going.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available You know, everything would have been fine if you had just come to me in the first place.
not_available Then I'm the overprotective boyfriend.
not_available You know, I'm not drinking to get drunk.
not_available I'm hardly drinking at all.
not_available Good night.
not_available Okay, wait.
not_available Do you wanna know how much I drank? Last night, I had two beers.
not_available Wednesday, I had a Cosmo.
not_available Last week, I had nothing.
not_available The week before that, I had a beer and a pink drink.
not_available I don't know what it was.
not_available You' re keeping close track.
not_available Because it's under control.
not_available Well, I just don't understand why you'd wanna go back to that.
not_available I drank last year.
not_available You knew that.
not_available It was a little different then.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now, it's not about being scared and alone.
not_available It's still drinking.
not_available Look.
not_available Look, wait.
not_available I used to drink because I was miserable.
not_available I was in a lousy marriage.
not_available I had a life I didn't want.
not_available And now I'm happy.
not_available With you, things are good.
not_available Having a casual drink with my friends makes me feel I'm past the bad part.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know, maybe
not_available Maybe I just have a little bit more faith in me than you do.
not_available Is that how you translate my concerns? No faith? I don't know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Carter? Forget it.
not_available Let's not do this.
not_available Look.
not_available I'm a pro at walking away.
not_available I've done it one million times.
not_available And I'm asking you, please, don't do this.
not_available Stay here and talk to me.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available What about the girl in 1? 
not_available Alisha Murphy.
not_available She's off the vent.
not_available And the guy in 2? 
not_available He's still puking up his shrimp platter.
not_available A transplant would only be a last resort.
not_available I should I should call my husband.
not_available There's a phone right here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Could I have some privacy, please? Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hello there.
not_available If you wanna know what I want for my last meal, the answer is pizza.
not_available Well, your kidney is sick.
not_available I'll give you medicine to help stop the infection then the doctors are gonna figure out what to do to make it better.
not_available How did I get like this? It's a genetic condition, probably.
not_available From my parents? The combination of their DNA.
not_available Maybe that's why.
not_available They had a fight one night, and my dad left.
not_available They never told me why.
not_available They just gave up.
not_available I'm sure it seemed that way.
not_available I think they made a mistake.
not_available Maybe the reason I'm sick is so I can bring them back together.
not_available I'm gonna give you some medicine in your vein.
not_available It might sting a little bit.
not_available I'm not scared.
not_available I really think this could fix everything.
not_available Glad to see Romano hasn't lost his sense of humor.
not_available I've made Abby the new nurse manager.
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available Let me know if she's not satisfying 
not_available the responsibilities of the position.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'd also like at least two MICNs and no more than three LVNs on any given shift.
not_available Kerry, is everything okay? 
not_available I made a small mistake on a TV program.
not_available I wish everyone would get over it.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available In the ladies' room? Yeah? You dropped a syringe.
not_available What? No.
not_available Kerry, I know what I saw.
not_available I'm taking hormones.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Pratt, Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available Night.
not_available Watch out for the paparazzi, Dr.
not_available K.
not_available Hey, Gallant.
not_available I understand you were involved in an altercation today.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available You hit another doctor? Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available In that case, I'll overlook it.
not_available Good night, Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Take it easy, Iron Mike.
not_available Hey.
not_available Gallant.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, look, I'm sorry about Hernandez.
not_available You should have stayed out of it.
not_available I respect you for going from the gut, but for once I was the one thinking clearly.
not_available So he went up to Psych? I'll check on him before I leave.
not_available How's your face? 
not_available Don't even sweat it.
not_available I know it wasn't me.
not_available You were punching Kayson.
not_available Actually, no.
not_available It was you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Next time I hit back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell Leon I said hey.
not_available All right.
not_available Daddy's back and it's chow time.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come get some.
not_available You should have your keys already out.
not_available You never know who might be lurking.
not_available Look, the drinking The drinking is the drinking.
not_available You know where I stand on that.
not_available It's just, how far are we gonna go if we keep hiding from each other? I won't hide anymore.
not_available I didn't mean to leave like that.
not_available It just seemed kind of complicated.
not_available And I wanted a little time to figure out where we were.
not_available Here we are.
