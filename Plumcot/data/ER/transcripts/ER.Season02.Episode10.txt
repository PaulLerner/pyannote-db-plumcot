not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available It was my fault that she went sour.
not_available How many young mothers have you killed, Doug? I really wasn't planning on hiring third
not_available years for my studies.
not_available Jen and Rachel.
not_available They're at a hospital.
not_available I gotta catch a train.
not_available She's a terrible driver.
not_available But I was driving.
not_available You fell in love with him? I didn't mean to.
not_available "A Miracle Happens Here" It's freezing out there, babe.
not_available Carol? What are you doing? 
not_available The furnace went out in the night.
not_available I tried to start the pilot, but I think it's shot.
not_available It's below zero in here.
not_available It's not so bad when you start moving.
not_available There's frost on the blankets.
not_available Thought you said we weren't gonna use that fireplace until the chimney sweep checked it out.
not_available No, look.
not_available I just have to pull this thing.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's just go out and get some breakfast.
not_available We'll never get someone to come to open it before Christmas.
not_available Let's just have Christmas at my place.
not_available At least I have heat and plumbing.
not_available I've got plumbing.
not_available Almost.
not_available I wanted to wake up here on Christmas morning.
not_available You know, the tree was gonna look so beautiful.
not_available So it's chilly.
not_available We'll put something under the door to stop the draft.
not_available That's not a draft.
not_available That's a gale
not_available force wind.
not_available We'll get pneumonia.
not_available Put on some socks.
not_available Look, old houses are chilly.
not_available Some Some houses need snow shovels in the parlor? Ladies and gentlemen, from the fourth 
floor The Recovery Room Choraliers.
not_available Recovery has way too much time on their hands.
not_available Well, thanks again.
not_available You guys are great.
not_available We can't wait to hear you folks.
not_available Us folks? 
not_available You promised.
not_available Who promised? 
not_available Carol Hathaway.
not_available See you then.
not_available I'm sorry I'm gonna miss Carol's solo.
not_available Ever heard her sing? She'll need your help.
not_available I'm off at 3 and I got the kids to buy for.
not_available I can't carry a tune.
not_available So who's representing the docs? 
not_available You need a consult, right? I believe the dulcet baritones of Mark Greene would be a fine addition to any ensemble.
not_available That's what he gets for being late.
not_available He's at the attorney's this morning.
not_available Not letting any grass grow under that split
not_available up.
not_available Why didn't they wait till after the holidays? No, the hospital attorney.
not_available It's his deposition on the O'Brien wrongful death suit.
not_available The pregnant woman last winter? In case his holidays weren't cheerful enough.
not_available The important thing is to stay calm and stick to the facts.
not_available I am calm.
not_available Well, then maybe you should take off your coat.
not_available Sure.
not_available Mark, this is gonna be a long process.
not_available It could be another year before we reach a settlement.
not_available Or go to trial.
not_available We'll try to avoid that.
not_available And why is that again? If there's no obvious breach of standard.
not_available If the injuries are inflammatory, like leaving a newborn motherless we'd still prefer to settle.
not_available And if we settle, it goes on my record permanently? Looks better than losing a 
not_available I gotta use the men's room.
not_available Back there.
not_available Whoa, hey, hey, little guy.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Brien.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available He's doing well.
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available Come on, Mark.
not_available They're ready to begin.
not_available What is this? 
not_available "Living Nativity on Ice" vs.
not_available Zamboni.

not_available Pain in legs, rib and head.
not_available Vitals stable.
not_available LOC for two minutes.

not_available Okay, get X
not_available ray down here and do a CT on her head.
not_available Next, Suzie? 
not_available Check out the Lamb.
not_available Put the Virgin Mary in 3.
not_available Looks like partial thickness burns to forearms and hands.
not_available I didn't even wanna be a lamb! Let's get some saline dressing.
not_available How'd she get burned? The Zamboni shoots out hot water.
not_available Lucky she landed flat on the ice.
not_available It hurts! I'll be right back.
not_available Somebody help my son.
not_available Can you feel this? Wiggle your fingers.
not_available Ma'am, did he lose consciousness? No? Come here.
not_available What's your name? I'm a Wiseman.
not_available Did they have names? 
not_available Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
not_available Right you are.
not_available There you go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Tell me you weren't using a real infant.
not_available Jesus was a doll.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Who's this? Zamboni driver.
not_available Fell five feet onto the ice.
not_available LOC on the scene.
not_available Smell that breath! 
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available You wanna observe this morning's clampand
not_available run? Yep.
not_available I missed your last two.
not_available And you didn't finish last night's discharge summaries? I'll catch up after surgery.
not_available Plus, I implied to Macy I'd be in there.
not_available Macy? 
not_available Patient's wife.
not_available They were nervous last night.
not_available He's got a history of thoracic aneurysm but he thought his backache was from putting up Christmas lights.
not_available Which you chatted about instead of finishing the charts.
not_available So this morning you're gonna do what you should've done last night.
not_available But the patient
not_available The patient won't notice you're not there.
not_available Carter, this is not a social hour.
not_available This is surgery.
not_available This is surgery.
not_available Star of the East is heading up for a tooth reimplantation.
not_available You're overreacting.
not_available It's just a couple of Christmas carols.
not_available I don't know any.
not_available Everybody knows Jingle Bells.
not_available Never heard of it.
not_available And I can't sing in public.
not_available Why? 
not_available I hate it when people stare at me.
not_available Oh, I can tell.
not_available Things were pretty wild around here for a while.
not_available It seems under control now.
not_available How about with you? How did your deposition go? Hey, Mark, that's the spirit! How about 4:00? Miracle none of the kids were critically hurt.
not_available You know, the cops are charging the driver right now? They can charge him with a DUl on a Zamboni? No, ZUl.
not_available I gave her a T
not_available bond last Christmas.
not_available She accuses me of not being romantic.
not_available But thinking long term.
not_available That's exactly what I said.
not_available A diamond may be forever but a 10year maturity at six percent is not chopped liver, right? This year I had a brainstorm
not_available Damn.
not_available Bender, could you do me a favor, open me up a new brush? Thanks.
not_available This year on Christmas morning, I'm getting her 10 shares of AT&amp;T.;
not_available It's Benton.
not_available Right.
not_available Next day, she gets 20 shares of General Electric.
not_available On the third day, 30 shares of Dupont.
not_available On the fourth day Wait, you gotta repeat this for Carl.
not_available Later, please.
not_available I'm here to tell you we can all relax.
not_available It seems that our patient has had second thoughts and he has withdrawn his consent for the procedure.
not_available Doesn't he realize he was our last chance to beat the clock before the new year? Can we change his mind back? Well, actually, Dr.
not_available Benton and I are gonna find out right now.
not_available If you'd care to join me.
not_available Sure.
not_available That's a pretty nasty cut you've got there, Mr.
not_available Calus.
not_available Stan.
not_available It's my own fault.
not_available I've been carving the toys by hand for a million years.
not_available Business is so hectic, I went to a power jig and router for some of the more popular items, like the rolling ducks on a stick.
not_available I love those.
not_available What a great job, making toys.
not_available I got rich and fat without even asking for it.
not_available Sometimes, though, I miss the old days.
not_available Just me and my old lady packing up the VW and hitting the craft fairs.
not_available I got a crew working around the clock, still can't keep up with the back orders.
not_available Well, this hand's gonna slow you down.
not_available We're lucky we're down to shipping and handling.
not_available Hate to disappoint any kids.
not_available When was the last time you had a tetanus shot? It's been ages.
not_available Well, the doctor's probably gonna want you to have one.
not_available You would make a great Santa.
not_available I bet you hear that pretty often, huh? 
not_available This time of year.
not_available It goes with the territory.
not_available If you're developing cutting
not_available edge techniques you better learn how to sell it to the masses.
not_available I know it's a pain in the ass, but if you find a simple metaphor for people you can help define the procedure for yourself.
not_available I can imagine.
not_available It was the same with endarterectomies.
not_available Nobody knew of them.
not_available Nobody wanted one.
not_available At first, I shied away from the Roto
not_available Rooter metaphor as too crass.
not_available But in the long run, that's what people can understand.
not_available Why don't you see if you can get the Chamberlains to understand.
not_available I'll do my best.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chamberlain.
not_available I'd like you to meet Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available He works with me.
not_available Pleased to meet you.
not_available Elderly victim of a carjacking coming in.
not_available Head trauma with ALOC.
not_available How nice.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Is this my Christmas bonus? 
not_available Hearty handshake and a "job well done"? No, that's a check for my share of tonight's Christmas party.
not_available I love it when the docs pay.
not_available Especially when we guilt them into booking the Knickerbocker.
not_available Is everybody dressing up? 
not_available I'm gonna wash behind my ears.
not_available They're pulling up now.
not_available Listen, I noticed you signed up for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
not_available I don't mind working then.
not_available Me either.
not_available Kerry Weaver made the same offer, but Jen has got Rachel in Dayton and I won't get her back until Christmas night.
not_available So I'd just as soon work.
not_available If you change your mind Carjack victim? 
not_available Unidentified female.
not_available Pulled from her car at the corner of Roosevelt and Ashland.
not_available Some Salvation Army bell ringer saw the whole thing.
not_available Said she hit her head on the curb pretty hard.
not_available BP is 160/120.
not_available She's awake en route, but disoriented.
not_available We got two IVs of normal saline, O
not_available 215 liters by mask.
not_available All right, let's do it on my count.
not_available Gently.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Crosstable C
not_available spine, and get a head CT.
not_available Gonna be a sore little lady at Christmas Mass.
not_available I don't think this little old lady goes to Mass.
not_available What's that? 
not_available She's a survivor.
not_available Of what? 
not_available Concentration camp.
not_available All right, let's get a CBC, type and hold.
not_available Spin a crit, dip the urine for heme update her tetanus and hang a gram of Ancef.
not_available The technique you gave consent to is
not_available I don't know techniques.
not_available Macy said she wants to wait, and that's fine by me.
not_available Macy is your wife? 
not_available Well, maybe we should talk to Macy.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available I don't blame you.
not_available You have every right to have cold feet.
not_available Carter? Dr.
not_available Benton, Dr.
not_available Vucelich.
not_available I just bumped into Macy in the cafeteria having coffee.
not_available I told her that she's not the first spouse to have second thoughts on a day of major surgery.
not_available I feel like a fool.
not_available You're not.
not_available Flip
not_available flopping this way and that.
not_available I guess I'm pretty much scared to death.
not_available I hope you don't think I'm crazy, honey.
not_available But after talking to Dr.
not_available Carter I know.
not_available You're not a doctor yet.
not_available But I feel so much better.
not_available So if it's not too late, can we get on with the surgery? Yes, ma'am.
not_available We certainly can.
not_available Is Mr.
not_available Carter free to join us? 
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available Do you know where you are? 
not_available Good news for her.
not_available The police have found a car matching the description off the 290 in a snow bank near Berkeley.
not_available If she's Hanna Steiner, she's got her car back.
not_available Hanna? Are you Hanna Steiner? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're in a hospital.
not_available You were pulled from your car at a stoplight.
not_available We're just gonna check you out, make sure everything's all right.
not_available You need to stay calm.
not_available You've been hit in the head.
not_available What about Tirzah? 
not_available Tirzah? The baby.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available The baby.
not_available The baby.
not_available What baby? 
not_available My granddaughter.
not_available She was in the car.
not_available She was in the car seat.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available They didn't say anything a baby.
not_available Is she
not_available Call the police.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Tirzah.
not_available Ms.
not_available Steiner.
not_available Try and stay calm and lie still.
not_available The police will do everything they can.
not_available Get me the police dispatcher again.
not_available Try and relax.
not_available It's about the carjacker.
not_available Breathe easy.
not_available She's refused the Ativan and doesn't wanna go for a CT.
not_available I think she's still hoping to hear some good news.
not_available Me too.
not_available Any news? Not yet.
not_available We're still trying to reach your son.
not_available That won't do any good.
not_available They live too far out.
not_available Are you sure you don't want Ativan? It'll calm you down.
not_available I never should have driven with her.
not_available We need to finish your evaluation.
not_available If you go for a CT, I promise I'll come find you as soon as we hear anything.
not_available You really need a CAT scan.
not_available Like a loch in kop.
not_available No, to make sure you don't have a loch in kop.
not_available Hole in her head.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll go.
not_available Mark, your wife's on the phone.
not_available I'll take it in the lounge.
not_available Please, find me if you hear anything.
not_available I will.
not_available You think they're okay? 
not_available She'll love them.
not_available You sure? I mean, they're 22 carat.
not_available They're beautiful.
not_available They're not real rubies or anything.
not_available Yeah, but they're really, really lovely.
not_available You still here? 
not_available I'm leaving right now.
not_available They're perfect for her.
not_available Red is her color.
not_available No, Jen.
not_available I'm not gonna let you walk all over me on this one.
not_available You should've thought of it before you started screwing your coworker.
not_available Jen had the nerve to suggest that Rachel stay with her in Dayton for two more days.
not_available What for? 
not_available Some skating party with her cousins.
not_available Jen is really pushing it.
not_available She's having an affair and I have to give up my daughter at Christmas.
not_available She really has great timing.
not_available Mid
not_available December kamikaze strike.
not_available Maximize pain and suffering.
not_available And I know you don't wanna take it out on Rachel.
not_available Of course not.
not_available I'm taking Susie over to Cookie and Henry's tomorrow.
not_available It's a dreadful family fare, and we'd love you to join us.
not_available Thanks, but Randi has Mrs.
not_available Steiner's son on the phone.
not_available He's calling from Glen Ellyn.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Later.
not_available Somebody hit fast forward? 
not_available Carl, you're at warp speed.
not_available You should see my mother darn a sock.
not_available Time? 
not_available You're at 55 minutes and 30 seconds.
not_available We're about to make a run for beating the clock.
not_available Personal best still stands at 57.07.
not_available Peter, you're a lucky man.
not_available Am I? Yep.
not_available You have a student who talks to patients.
not_available Must save you a lot of headaches.
not_available Sometimes.
not_available How many of these have you assisted on? 
not_available This is my fifth.
not_available Really? Are you ready to finish this one? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And still have us break the record? Don't say yes unless you can be sure.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available All right.
not_available Carter, do the suctioning.
not_available Simon, watch the clock.
not_available Come on! 
not_available 56.
not_available 14 and counting.
not_available Now, go insideout on the aorta, outside

not_available That's right.
not_available Long bites.
not_available Move along.
not_available Pick up the pace.
not_available Come on.

not_available Release the distal Satinsky.
not_available Shoot.
not_available Proxima clamp.
not_available Looks very good.
not_available Time? 
not_available 57.
not_available 16.
not_available Isn't that too bad? We didn't break the record.
not_available It would've been a nice way to ring out the year.
not_available Randi, Mrs.
not_available Steiner back from CT yet? 
not_available On her way.
not_available Any news on her granddaughter? Must be 20 miles of highway between here and where they found her car.
not_available People are sick.
not_available The parents are on their way in.
not_available In this weather, it'll take them a while.
not_available My poor roof! 
not_available Mlungisi.
not_available Kerry! Mlungisi.
not_available I came straight from the airport.
not_available If you'll have me.
not_available I was just about to go on a break.
not_available Everyone, this is Mlungisi.
not_available Hi.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available I'll be back in half an hour.
not_available Fine.
not_available Mark, Mrs.
not_available Steiner's back.
not_available No? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available They're still searching.
not_available My son and I could use some help here! 
not_available We need a doctor.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? Dr.
not_available Ross! 
not_available Here we go.
not_available Right this way.
not_available He took a bullet in the shoulder.
not_available Can you walk on your own? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hang tough, kiddo.
not_available All right, it's close.
not_available It's Trauma 1! She's only been missing a short time.
not_available Don't give up.
not_available I guess I don't have to tell you that.
not_available It's easier when you're young.
not_available You know nothing else.
not_available They call you "dirty Jew" in school.
not_available You've seen the worst of people.
not_available And the best.
not_available This little baby.
not_available She's so sweet.
not_available They just wanted the car.
not_available I don't think they would hurt her.
not_available But they would.
not_available You know, you go on after you have seen evil.
not_available You laugh.
not_available You work.
not_available You have children.
not_available You don't let it own you.
not_available That's your revenge.
not_available To live.
not_available And then something like this And you know that it can all be taken away.
not_available We still hope for the best.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hope.
not_available You know what I was thinking when I was upstairs in this machine? Lying so still I did something that I stopped doing 50 years ago.
not_available I prayed to God.
not_available You know Yiddish, Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available A little from my grandmother.
not_available But you are a religious man? I'm the son of an agnostic Jew and a lapsed Catholic.
not_available You're no good at all.
not_available I can't ask you to pray for my family.
not_available Well, I can try.
not_available Dreaming of a white Christmas? 
not_available I'm hoping the tarp stays tied on my roof.
not_available I hope the party's not history.
not_available The Drive's already at a standstill.
not_available All the more reason to celebrate, right? So I was thinking, 4:00 up in Recovery.
not_available You've heard me sing.
not_available Poor Susie hears the first line of Rocka
not_available Bye Baby and goes to sleep as a defense mechanism.
not_available Just mouth the words.
not_available That's what I do.
not_available While who sings? 
not_available I'm working on that.
not_available Carter.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Chronic tone
not_available deafness and acute stage fright.

not_available Mark.
not_available Who's in there with him? 
not_available It's his family.
not_available Doesn't he remind you of somebody? What, you kidding? He's the spitting image.
not_available I know it's ridiculous 
not_available No, he looks just like him.
not_available When he was old, right before he died.
not_available Before who died? Jerry Garcia.
not_available That's who we're talking about, isn't it? 
not_available Oh, Carter, she'll love them.
not_available You think? They look just like her.
not_available They're not too much? 
not_available No, they're fun.
not_available I haven't been seeing Harper that long.

not_available They're too much.
not_available No! No, I mean, they're beautiful.
not_available She'll love them.
not_available No, I went overboard.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available You thought of her.
not_available She'll be touched.

not_available We drove him in here ourselves.
not_available We'll take care of him now.
not_available Jeanie, you're on.
not_available You're gonna be okay, man.
not_available They shot a priest? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I am out of here.
not_available Bet I beat you out the door.

not_available Careful on the roads.
not_available I hope it's not too late to withdraw my offer to work the holidays.
not_available No.
not_available Looks like you have a visitor.
not_available Yeah, I think I may skip the party.
not_available I'll be right there, Mlungisi.

not_available " LOL with sudden back pain.
not_available She's diaphoretic, short of breath.
not_available What's her history?

not_available Set up an art line.
not_available Is it a heart attack? No, sir.
not_available Your wife's EKG is normal.

not_available What have we got?

not_available run.
not_available Okay.
not_available Does my wife need an operation? 
not_available She might, sir.

not_available I gotta go.
not_available I'll be back soon.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available It's okay.
not_available This way.
not_available Were we as bad as we thought we'd be?

not_available It was great.
not_available Mr.
not_available Calus, I'm so sorry 
not_available Mark, have you seen Mr.
not_available Calus? 
not_available Yeah, he was just in there.
not_available This shows what Dr.
not_available Benton feared is true.
not_available Your wife has a dissecting aneurysm.
not_available The wall of the aorta is tearing.
not_available With your wife's age and her history of hypertension
not_available But she's very active.
not_available Still.
not_available Surgery is a risk.
not_available What are the odds? About fifty
not_available fifty.
not_available But if your wife's aorta continues ripping, then she has no odds at all.
not_available Well, it sounds like we have no choice here.
not_available Okay, I'll sign.
not_available You have a choice of a new surgical technique.
not_available The clampand
not_available run procedure.
not_available This has the benefit of taking a fraction of the time the standard surgery takes.
not_available Why is that better? You always run a risk of heart attack or paralysis with this operation.
not_available It's new.
not_available Developed by one of the top vascular surgeons in the country.
not_available He works here.
not_available Newer's better? I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's up to you.
not_available But You'd go with the new thing? I would.
not_available You would.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, where do I sign? See if the church wants to stop by to pick these up.
not_available Don't you wanna hand them over to the parishioners? All right, he's dead.
not_available They did it, man.
not_available That guy's gonna pay.
not_available He said it wasn't them.
not_available He was just trying to keep the truce.
not_available I know those cabrones killed him.
not_available He said they didn't.
not_available Did he ever lie to you? Did he? Man, B
not_available Pop? See, he thought one man could change things.
not_available He was wrong.
not_available So you shoot them and they shoot you, and that's what the Father died for? You're right, Diablo.
not_available One man couldn't do it.
not_available Help him now.
not_available Doctor, please.
not_available Will you tell them to go on? They won't listen to me.
not_available Your mother does have to stay for observation.
not_available That's why we're staying too.
not_available You'll spoil the children's Hanukkah.
not_available We brought Hanukkah here.
not_available Is that all right? We brought a menorah 
not_available A menorah? Okay, okay.
not_available I think I can find a place.
not_available James! I haven't seen you in a long time.
not_available How are you? 
not_available She's definitely a candidate.
not_available She's obviously high risk.
not_available Has she consented? 
not_available She's being prepped right now.
not_available Unfortunately, I've had one of these.
not_available Simon will assist, and you will have a chance at breaking the record, Peter.
not_available I'm ready.

not_available "A miracle happened there.
not_available " Yeah.
not_available Today we had our own miracle.
not_available Tirzah came back to us, safe and sound.
not_available And, also, Dr.

not_available Bless you.
not_available And now, who goes first? 
not_available Me! Oh, my little girl.

not_available and saved a life.
not_available Carter Where can I put this? 
not_available In the back room.
not_available What a hero.
not_available They're outrageous.

not_available No! I mean, I think they would.
not_available Look who's drunk.
not_available You're leaving?

not_available Yeah, it's chilly in here.
not_available I thought about you today, Peter.
not_available Your first Christmas without your mother.
not_available I hope it's not too hard.
