not_available Not too bad.
not_available Except tickets to San Francisco are 6OO bucks.
not_available So she has an infection in her gallbladder and we're admitting her to the surgical service.
not_available She needs surgery?.
not_available We'll treat with antibiotics until the infection cools off.
not_available And then we'll remove her gallbladder.
not_available I'm so sorry, baby.
not_available I hate this.
not_available I miss everything.
not_available What do we always say?.
not_available Strongest trees in the forest.
SHElLA That's right.
not_available The strongest trees in the forest can withstand the strongest winds.
not_available One of her grandmother's sayings.
not_available She's got, like, a thousand.
not_available It's nice.
not_available I like it.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Johnson, if you'd like to sign the admission forms, Dawn can take you.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available Right this way.
not_available I'll be back in a flash.
not_available So, uh, do you have any questions?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why did I have to get sickle cell?.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just want to see Yo
not_available Yo Ma, is that asking too much?.
not_available No.
not_available It's not.
not_available He's playing Mozart's cello sonatas.
not_available Mozart barely wrote anything for the cello.
not_available My friends go see the dumb Jonas Brothers and I can't catch a break?.
not_available You know, you have every right to be upset.
not_available I'd be upset too.
not_available I wish there was something I could do.
not_available Huh.
not_available Give me a new gallbladder and get me the heck out of here.
not_available I put some more stuff on your phone.
not_available Thanks.
not_available And you got another text.
not_available From Ray?.
not_available From some other guy named Simon Brenner.
not_available From Australia.
not_available And, girl, he's cute too.
not_available Uh, I thought we agreed no more texts.
not_available We agreed no more texts to Ray.
not_available So does he have an accent?.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I love accents.
not_available You're a total player, huh?.
not_available Catheter's in.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available How's the chest
not_available tube output?.
not_available Less than 1 00.
not_available All right, I think we just got behind on the fluids.
not_available Heart rate's down to 90.
not_available Pressure's coming up, 1 1 2/78.
not_available Put a dressing on this.
not_available Uh, repeat CBC and chest.
not_available What happened?.
not_available What're you guys doing?.
not_available You were sick because you weren't getting enough fluids.
not_available We filled up your tank with two liters.
not_available Detective.
not_available How can I help you?.
not_available Jermaine Bennett.
not_available You should try talking to him.
not_available I got a feeling about him.
not_available A feeling?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You mind elaborating?.
not_available I see a lot of knucklehead kids come through here.
not_available He's, uh, different.
not_available He was pretty clear, he's got nothing to say.
not_available Um, just talk to him again.
not_available It's a waste of time.
not_available Just
not_available Just try.
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn.
not_available Cate, hi.
not_available Glad I caught you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Know what?.
not_available We should talk tomorrow.
not_available I have an appointment, I gotta be back in one hour.
not_available Janet, please.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh.
not_available All right.
not_available The labs, they show that your estradiol and prolactin are fine.
not_available But your FSH is 1 3.5.
not_available lt means your ovaries aren't
not_available Yeah, I know what it means.
not_available So the chances of lVF being successful
not_available No, not good.
not_available With your own egg, the chances are approaching zero.
not_available But they're not actually zero.
not_available Many fertility clinics won't even attempt lVF on someone whose FSH is that high.
not_available It wouldn't be ethical to take your money.
not_available Money's not the problem.
not_available Well, then consider how you spend it.
not_available I mean, adoption, surrogacy, egg donation, those things cost too.
not_available Yeah, well, what if I wanted to try?.
not_available I couldn't recommend it.
not_available But would you help me?.
not_available I wouldn't be comfortable with that.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available I know that it's rough.
not_available But you do have alternatives.
not_available There are other ways to have a family.
not_available Ceftriaxone and metronidazole have been given.
not_available We're headed up.
not_available Not much of a selection at the gift shop.
not_available Oh, my God, Mozart?.
not_available Thanks, Neela.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll be up later to check on you.
not_available Two of morphine when she gets settled.
not_available Hey, you get any texts lately?.
not_available Uh, she's a handful, this one.
not_available Oh, I see you've met my daughter.
MAX She's taking the bus up next week.
not_available Haven't seen her since I shipped out.
not_available Three years.
not_available She's gonna cry.
not_available Yeah, well that's what moms do when they're happy.
not_available Remember, Tuesday, 2:00, right?.
not_available Dr.
not_available Grasso.
not_available Second floor.
not_available Right.
not_available Yeah, she's great.
not_available If you have any problem with your meds get a hold of me, okay?.
not_available I don't know how to thank you.
not_available Not necessary.
not_available I need one more favor.
not_available Hmm.
not_available It's Jake.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I'll drop him off when I have time.
not_available No, they don't allow dogs here.
not_available I was hoping you could hold on to him for a little longer.
not_available Really?.
not_available lf you could.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I could.
not_available I'm sort of, uh
not_available I'm sort of getting used to him.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available Been weird being alone.
not_available I don't mind being on my own but totally alone gets hard.
not_available I can imagine.
not_available This is me.
not_available I want you to have this.
not_available Come on.
not_available Take it.
not_available You deserve it.
not_available Open it later.
not_available I'll see you around.
not_available I'll see you around.
not_available Make sure you give Jake some bacon.
not_available He loves bacon.
not_available And chicken too.
not_available I'll remember that.
not_available How's he doing?.
not_available Hungry.
not_available I'm gonna go upstairs, grab him a sandwich.
not_available He keeps asking to see his brother.
not_available Hello, Quincy.
not_available How are you?.
not_available Fine.
not_available You getting the hang of those crutches?.
not_available Yeah, it's easy.
not_available We're keeping an eye on your brother, he seems to be doing okay.
not_available I'm not leaving until I see him.
not_available You miss him pretty bad, huh?.
not_available You know, I hear you run away a lot.
not_available I ran away once.
not_available You?.
not_available You're a grown
not_available up.
not_available Well, sometimes we get so sad we get angry.

not_available Quincy, Jermaine broke the law, put you in a very dangerous situation.
not_available It's not like that.
not_available He told me to go home, but I didn't.
not_available That doesn't make what he did okay.
not_available You don't get it.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Why don't you explain it to me?.
not_available He doesn't do that stuff.
not_available Well, he did it today.

not_available No.
not_available My parents worked all the time.
not_available It was always just him and me.
not_available He picked me up at school, cooked dinner
not_available Sometimes the truth hurts so bad we don't want to believe certain things.
not_available He's not a drug dealer.
not_available The police say he is.
not_available Whatever.
not_available When do I get to see him?.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you feeling?.
not_available Good.
not_available Why are you whispering?.
not_available No, no.
not_available I'm being inconspicuous.
not_available It's not working.
not_available No?.
not_available All right.
not_available So you've, uh
not_available You've been cleared.
not_available You're healthy as a horse.
not_available Jermaine and his brother?.
not_available Jermaine is stable getting admitted for observation.
not_available Quincy'll be on crutches for a while, but he's going home today.
not_available See?.
not_available It's all good.
