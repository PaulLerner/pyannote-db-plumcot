not_available It's always about you.
not_available What you want.
not_available Never about anybody else.
not_available Just you.
not_available It was business.
not_available I was standing there, Ray.
not_available It was 7:30, and you were supposed to be there.
not_available I was standing there.
not_available Where were you? You were exactly where you have always been your entire life.
not_available Someplace else.
not_available That's where you were! Now, look.
not_available I cannot change what happened to you when you were a kid.
not_available I can't.
not_available You did a good number on me, Ray.
not_available You did a good job.
not_available I've never committed to anything in my entire life.
not_available I've never been with a woman for more than six months.
not_available Most of the time it's six days.
not_available Find a job where I see people for a few minutes.
not_available I fix them as best I can.
not_available I send them on their way.
not_available No mess, no fuss.

not_available That's what you taught me, right? That's your trick.
not_available Well, here I am Dad.
not_available I'm you.
not_available What happened to you as a child, I'm responsible for.
not_available You're 34years
not_available old.
not_available How you live your life is your decision.
not_available I'm going inside.
not_available So the woman is buck
not_available naked, hanging over Shep's shoulder and Raul is running behind her with the damn poodle.
not_available And the drunk husband's chasing them with a butcher knife screaming how he'll kill all of them.
not_available "I'm gonna kill you, you bastards! " 
not_available Shep's afraid of heights.
not_available A fireman afraid of heights? Hey, it's true.
not_available He is.
not_available Raul is always making him go up the fire escape or pull the jumpers off the tops of buildings.
not_available Stuff like that.
not_available Raul gave Shep skydiving lessons for Christmas.
not_available He ever play "La Bamba" for you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I like "La Bamba.
not_available " 
not_available You wouldn't if you worked with him.
not_available When I rode with him years back, he had it on tape.
not_available Played it over and over.
not_available Enough to make you kill yourself.
not_available Or him.
not_available You guys remember that little baby they brought in a year ago? Found it in a garbage bag down on the South Side.
not_available I remember.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Been dead at least three or four hours but those boys brought her in doing CPR and mouthto
not_available mouth.
not_available Child was cold, but they wouldn't give up.
not_available Yelled at us when we told them it was hopeless.
not_available Then they both cried.
not_available Like it was their own kid.
not_available Hell, I cried.
not_available Me too.
not_available Hey, partner.
not_available Hey, partner.
not_available Guess I missed that free breakfast.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available You got to hang in there, okay? 
not_available I can't do it, bro.
not_available You got to! I heard those kids are doing great.
not_available You saved them, buddy.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available You did.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry, buddy.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
