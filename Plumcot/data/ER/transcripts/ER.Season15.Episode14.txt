not_available Hey, Morris.
not_available Okay, I will be back as soon as I can.
not_available Excuse me, my captain wants to know how much longer she's gonna be.
not_available This needs to run in over an hour.
not_available I thought she was ready.
not_available lf I discharge her, she'll bounce back.
not_available I gotta call the station.
not_available You know what sucks?.
not_available There are guys stealing cars, shooting guns.
not_available You're here babysitting a decent lady.
not_available I'm just doing my job.
not_available Where's Brenner?.
MARQUEZ He ran to the lab.
not_available We think this lady has TB.
not_available Yeah, and this guy might have figured it out.
not_available Really?.
not_available How long does an AFB stain take?.
not_available Less than an hour.
MORRlS ""T o O.M.K.
not_available 35 years of service.
not_available "" Oh, my God.
not_available Do you know who this is?.
not_available Yeah, this is Dr.
not_available Oliver Kostin.
not_available As in Kostin 's Textbook of Emergency Medicine? He's a legend.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available The one and only.
not_available Hey, Chuny.
not_available So good to see you.
not_available So good to see you.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Morris and Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern ran this place back in the day.
not_available What are you doing here?.
not_available I got a call from the nursing home.
not_available Ollie, you gotta stop wandering.
not_available Are you his doctor?.
not_available No, his proxy.
not_available His wife died a few years ago.
not_available They never had any children, so I got a durable power of attorney.
not_available You must have been close.
not_available He taught me everything.
not_available Treated me like a son.
not_available He knows you're here.
not_available And he's having a good day.
not_available What's his baseline?.
not_available Multi
not_available infarct dementia and going downhill fast.
not_available Mm.
not_available He had a great mind.
not_available Now, there's nothing left.
not_available Well, something's going on in there.
not_available He thinks that lady has tuberculosis.
not_available Does she?.
not_available We don't know yet.
not_available The swelling behind the right ear.
not_available Could be scrofula.
not_available It's a TB
not_available infected lymph node.
not_available Used to be in the textbooks, it's not anymore.
not_available So if he's right, he's still capable
not_available No.
not_available It's a flash of an old memory.
not_available Every once in a while, a stimulus, a sight or a sound brings up something from the past, but it doesn't last long.
not_available For all intents and purposes, he doesn't interact with the present.
not_available He hardly speaks.
not_available I brought a copy of his DNR order.
not_available So we shouldn't have tubed him?.
not_available He never wanted to end up like this.
not_available Could we take him off the vent?.
not_available Maybe move him into a private room?.
not_available Sure.
not_available What about T rauma 1?.
not_available He might be getting a few visitors.
not_available You know, the ER used to end right here.
not_available He designed your trauma rooms and got them built 4O years ago.
not_available Dr.
not_available Horta cleared his entire schedule to operate on you.
not_available Thanks, doc.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available We'll see you upstairs.
not_available I'll be right behind you, honey.
not_available I'm really looking forward to this.
not_available It's gonna blow your mind.
not_available Oh, Lucien, this is Dr.
not_available Horta from San Diego.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Yeah, I've heard all about you.
not_available So this thing's really gonna happen?.
not_available We're all set to go.
not_available Oh, you should scrub in.
not_available I can't, I've got a couple of cases to check in on.
not_available Let the residents do it.
not_available Go ahead, I'll be in and out, you guys.
not_available Let's take the stairs.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Lucien, I heard about the NOTES appy.
not_available Pretty cool.
not_available Yeah, it is pretty cool.
not_available Excuse me, officer.
not_available How can I stay at home when they're sending you off to jail?.
not_available You need to be on bed rest.
not_available This is crazy, Mom.
not_available This isn't you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, this is April's daughter, Kendra.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello.
not_available Is she okay now?.
not_available Her diabetes is back under control.
not_available Mom, why would you do something like this?.
not_available I don't know, I guess I wasn't thinking.
not_available Your mother was trying to help.
not_available This is between her and me, thank you.
KENDRA Mom, talk to me.
not_available BP's way up, 1 70/1 00.
not_available We should let her rest.
not_available Yeah, I think you're upsetting her.
not_available What do you think she's doing to me?.
not_available Sam, cycle the dynamap.
not_available Ow.
not_available ls that a contraction?.
not_available Kyle, grab a gurney, let's get her up to OB.
not_available No problem.
not_available Slow deep breaths.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I don't need all that.
not_available No, we have to monitor your baby.
not_available Morris, positive AFB.
not_available Whoa.
not_available ER's been exposed.
not_available Everybody needs testing and follow
not_available up.
not_available We assumed it was a tumor but the other hospital cytology was equivocal.
not_available Chuny, we're intubating.
not_available You are?.
not_available Positive TB stain.
not_available She doesn't have cancer, she has a treatable infection.
MARQUEZ All right, GlideScope's ready.
not_available Good call, Oliver.
not_available TB is the great imitator.
not_available That's what he taught us.
BRENNER Twenty of etomidate, 
DOCTOR Dr.
not_available Kostin, are you mad? Dr.
not_available Kostin, you can't give succinylcholine down here.
not_available I just did.
DOCTOR Paralytics and intubation require an anesthesiologist.
not_available I'll keep that in mind.
not_available Your patient's too sick for the emergency ward.
not_available Patients like this die in the elevator when we try to move them up to the lCU without an airway.
not_available Okay, gentlemen, my work is done.
BRENNER Beautiful shot of the cords.
not_available Passing the tube.
not_available Nice.
not_available Sats are fine.
MORRlS Cuff is down.
not_available All right.
not_available Deep breath in, Oliver.
not_available And out.
not_available David.
not_available Where do we start rounds?.
not_available Right here, Ollie.
not_available You're right where you need to be.
not_available Look, I have to get back.
not_available But I'm really glad you got in touch.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, you know, I've been trying for 1 5 years.
not_available Hasn't been easy.
not_available You know, one day, I had a big sister and then the next day, you took off, just pregnant by some dude.
not_available I didn't take off.
not_available Mom kicked me out of the house.
not_available You could've called.
not_available She wouldn't let me talk to you.
not_available Written a letter.
not_available I did.
not_available She must have tore them up.
not_available I never knew that.
not_available I had a baby.
not_available I had to work.
not_available After a while, I just stopped trying.
not_available I figured you probably hated me.
not_available I didn't.
not_available You know, after you left, this is the only guidance that I got.
SAM My diary?.
not_available You must've left in a hurry, found it underneath your mattress.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Are you kidding me?.
not_available What?.
not_available Did you read this?.
not_available Yeah, of course, like, a hundred times.
not_available You taught me how to French kiss, how to pierce my ears how to roll a joint.
not_available Heh.
not_available Six Flags?.
not_available Yeah, when I was 7.
not_available That was the happiest day of my life.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Mom took us home early because you puked your funnel cake all over Shock Wave.
not_available Oh, you are so wrong.
not_available No, she took us home because when she went to the bathroom you went and tried to bum a cigarette.
not_available I did not.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available You were grounded for an entire week.
not_available I was so stupid.
not_available She's really bad, huh?.
not_available Yeah, it won't be long.
FRANK Well, lCU could take Trauma 1.
not_available Okay, let's move Dr.
not_available Kostin.
not_available Dylan, how'd it go?.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Where's my mom at?.
not_available She's in a different room on a breathing machine but something amazing happened.
not_available It turns out your mom doesn't have cancer.
not_available Are you serious?.
not_available It's tuberculosis.
not_available They told us that
not_available Cells from other hospital were suggestive of cancer but they weren't definitive.
not_available So we ran a special stain, and we found TB.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you, that's incredible.
not_available She's not out of the woods yet.
not_available Well, if it's a drug
not_available resistant strain, then she's gonna have very rough course.
not_available But it's better than cancer, right?.
not_available I mean, her prognosis, it's good?.
not_available We're gonna have to keep you in isolation 
not_available till we find out you're not infectious.
not_available Not a problem.
not_available Donna, there's someone here to see you.
not_available Mom, I heard the great news.
not_available I kind of rocked it.
not_available They're not supposed to give feedback, but the head of the woodwind department said, ""See you in September.
not_available "" Sam, I'm gonna be up in the O.R.
not_available for a bit.
not_available Prescription for insulin and an appointment with a diabetes clinic.
not_available Where are you taking her?.
not_available County jail.
not_available Are you okay?.
not_available I got some medicine to stop the contractions.
not_available I've to wait till the baby's ready.
not_available We should be going.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You've got nothing to say?.
not_available You're not gonna explain this to me?.
not_available Maybe later.
not_available She's had a rough day.
not_available I thought I was gonna have some help with this baby, but I'll do it on my own.
not_available I just thought you wanted to be a part of it.
not_available But if this is how you want it, fine! 
not_available Come here.
not_available You know what?.
not_available Come here.
not_available What are you doing?.
not_available Come with me.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available I need you to understand what your mother's doing.
not_available Shoplifting makeup.
not_available T o trade for insulin.
not_available She loves you.
not_available She's made sacrifices for you and your baby.
not_available She almost died today because she ignored her own health to buy you a crib.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Yeah, she's too proud to say it.
not_available I know it's hard, but try to appreciate what you have.
not_available Stump is tied off.
not_available EndoShears.
not_available Nicely done.
HORTA Tension as you pull, Neela.
BRENNER They're still at it.
not_available Yeah, you're just in time for the big finish.
NEELA Appendix is out.
not_available How cool was that?.
not_available Very.
not_available You heard about the TB case?.
not_available Yeah.
HORTA g
not_available Prox, please.
not_available Yeah, we were all guilty of diagnosis momentum.
not_available Despite incomplete evidence, we heard the word cancer and we all ran down the wrong path.
not_available It's a glimpse of the future in there.
not_available Yeah, I wasn't on board at first, but Neela persisted, so.
not_available Well, that's a good quality to have.
not_available Especially in an Attending.
not_available There are a lot of candidates this year, you know.
not_available It's going to be very competitive.
not_available Well, whoever gets her will be lucky.
not_available You think he's really mad at me?.
not_available You did undermine his authority.
not_available But it was in the interest of the patient.
not_available Yeah, I agree.
not_available I think he must be in Trauma 1.
not_available I just hope he doesn't hurt my chances here.
not_available Well, if it does, then they're all crazy.
not_available I can't imagine anyone more brilliant and skilled, and compassionate, and sexy.
not_available And you'd better take a nap, because you're gonna need it for later.
not_available I was pre
not_available med, volunteering at the hospital when they made him chief in '68.
not_available Back then, the ER was a glorified walk
not_available in clinic where you were seen by unsupervised interns and residents with no training.
not_available And the community ERs were even worse.
not_available Staffed by moonlighting dermatologists and psychiatrists or drunks who'd been banned from private practice.
not_available There was no 91 1.
not_available No paramedics.
not_available And if you needed an ambulance, you called a funeral home.
not_available What the hell is that?.
not_available Ollie once 
said ""You stand a better chance of surviving a gunshot wound in Vietnam than a car crash in Chicago.
not_available "" But he changed all that.
not_available He developed the 91 1 system, he trained thousands of paramedics and started one of the finest residency programs in emergency medicine.
not_available You're all here because of this guy.
not_available Gunshot wound to the left chest, dumped from a moving car.
GRADY Lost the pulse.
SAM Starting compressions.
MORRlS Thoracotomy tray.
NEELA Four of O
not_available neg and Betadine.
BRENNER Yankauer.
SAM Rapid infuser is primed.
not_available Prep for a subclavian.
GATES I need a cricoid.
BRENNER Hold compressions.
NEELA Okay, opening the chest now.
not_available Shot in the chest outside of a liquor store.
not_available Ready?.
not_available And lift.
not_available Hold an elevator.
not_available He's gotta go right up to the trauma ward.
not_available Someday we're gonna take care of guys like this down here.
not_available The surgeons will never sign off on that.
not_available You wait and see.
not_available Dream on, Dr.
not_available Kostin.
NEELA Foley's in the heart defect.
BRENNER lnflating to 20 cc's.
SAM Bleeding's slowing down.
not_available He's had six of O
not_available neg, six of FFP.
not_available I got a pulse, strong pulse.
NEELA Cardio
not_available thoracic team's here.
MORRlS Take him away, guys.
SAM Door to O.R., 1 2 minutes.
BRENNER Not bad.
MORRlS Yup.
not_available He could walk out of the hospital.
not_available How are you doing, Ollie?.
not_available Another two of morphine.
not_available Got it.
not_available Let's TKO his fluids.
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Might as well turn off the alarm.
