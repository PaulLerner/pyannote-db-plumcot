not_available You can't do a CT.

not_available She's not competent.
not_available Let's follow with a formal ultrasound.
not_available We'll get a good look at the kidneys.
not_available We cannot do the formal ultrasound that fast.
not_available Why? You're a resourceful guy.
not_available So you expect the radiologist to be at my beck and call Q 15 minutes?

not_available She'll be here later.
not_available Dr.
not_available Shuster was obnoxious, no question " but" you could've been a little more contrite.
not_available You know, played the game.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available How about an eight? Would an eight work here? No.
not_available And I'm not talking about Sudoku.
not_available You know, the game, life.
not_available Playing well with others.
not_available You seem to have a problem with that.
not_available How about a six? Would a six work here? Your evasiveness tells me I'm onto something.
not_available Did your dad hit you when you were a kid? What? Parental abuse.
not_available It's a common root of authority and ego problems in adulthood.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Freud.
not_available I'm more of a Jungian.
not_available You have no idea what I'm talking about.
not_available No, I never watched "Star Trek.
not_available " And you're starting to freak me out, kid.
not_available Yeah, I have that effect on people.
not_available I'm in college now at U of C.
not_available When I raise my hand to ask a question, the whole class stares.
not_available That must be weird, huh? 
not_available Yeah, I kind of stick out at frat parties.
not_available Yeah, well " I'm" having troubles these days trying to figure out where I fit in.
not_available And you were right about me and my dad.
not_available If you wanna impress those stuckup ICU types, three 
words Fazio
not_available Londe disease.
not_available It's very rare.
not_available Who knows how long it'll take them to figure it out? Is that what you think you have? I don't think, I know.
not_available Well, when you were admitted, why didn't your mother tell them? Well, she doesn't know.
not_available I haven't told her.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available I need that ultrasound now, not in 45 minutes.
not_available Pratt, your "alter cocker" in 3 is kvetching about his kishke.
not_available What? 
not_available It's the language of your people.
not_available You want to get in on a detached retina? I have to go back to Waiting.

not_available I don't need to hear this.
not_available Please.
not_available I don't wanna hear it.
not_available He was there to buy milk.
not_available Please, you have to listen.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available That night in the deli, two guys came in and they started making trouble and pulled out guns.
not_available Carlos told you this? He tried to stop them, okay? But they just started shooting.
not_available And he ran so fast, he didn't even realize he was hurt until he got home.
not_available Why didn't you call the police when you saw he was shot? Well, Carlos wanted to, but I didn't let him.
not_available Why? The guys who did this, they are from our neighborhood, okay? They know who we are.
not_available They know where we live.
not_available Well, that bullet is lodged in his spine, and surgery really is the only He won't do it.
not_available Some more fluid in Morison's, but no hematoma.
not_available Renal anatomy's intact.
not_available What of the fact she's peeing blood? 
not_available Probably just parenchymal contusions.
not_available If the urine doesn't clear in an hour, do an IVP like Dr.
not_available Moretti suggested.
not_available She's good.
not_available I'll be back in 15 minutes to repeat the scan.
not_available I knew you'd find a way.
not_available He was 16, a child! 
not_available Hey, hey, hey.

not_available That's why we crashed.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available You're gonna have to stop hating me.
not_available I am having his baby.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available What? Okay, come on.
not_available Come on, you have to leave.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available If they take the bullet, cops will place me at the scene.
not_available Tell them what happened.
not_available They won't believe me.
not_available All they see is another spic.
not_available Hopefully, the owner will come out of his coma and back up your story.
not_available If he doesn't, then Carlos will go to jail.
not_available I got a good job, Elena, the baby.
not_available I mean, I don't wanna lose them.
not_available Look, just get a lawyer The legal system doesn't work for guys like me.
not_available Do you understand that you could be paralyzed? I'll take my chances.
not_available They talked to Carlos.
not_available Now they wanna speak to the surgeon.
not_available He won't consent to the dÃ©bridement? 
not_available He's convinced he's screwed.
not_available And he understands the risks? It's his right to refuse.
not_available Detectives.
not_available The DA just got off the phone with a judge who's issuing a court order compelling Carlos Vega to have surgery.
not_available What? 
not_available It'll be here within the hour.
not_available The state can't dictate treatment.
not_available It just did.
not_available The bullet will tell us if he's guilty.
not_available It doesn't matter if he's guilty.
not_available This patient has rights.
not_available We're not going to do it.
not_available It's not up to you.
not_available Really? What's next? Forced sterilizations? Mandated amputations? Abby, maybe it's for the best.
not_available Carlos needs the surgery.
not_available These guys are only trying to do their job.
not_available We'll get an O.R.
not_available Ready.
not_available Thanks, doc.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available I don't like it, but it's done.
not_available He has the right to refuse.
not_available If we leave the bullet in, he ends up in a wheelchair.
not_available Not immediately.
not_available We can start him on IV antibiotics and then talk to Legal Very high
not_available minded, but naive.
not_available If we refuse, they'll get some other hospital to do it.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available As a matter of fact, I do.
not_available Since a tricky spinal procedure is inevitable, I'd rather I do it How did this become about you? 
not_available Let it go.
not_available You're not even gonna try.
not_available This case is no longer your concern.
not_available Type and cross four units and send him up.
not_available It's called Fazio

not_available That's incredibly rare.
not_available Yeah, only 30
not_available something cases in the literature.
not_available It's a progressive motor disorder.
not_available Pneumonia is from decreased function of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves.
not_available I did an EMG, MRI.
not_available It all fits.
not_available You need to confirm this with a muscle biopsy.
not_available Well, Neuro's on it this afternoon.
not_available Way to be proactive, Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available We'll round again at 3.
not_available Bye.
not_available So it worked.
not_available Yeah, it worked.
not_available What I wanna know is, how did you figure this out? At first it felt like a lump in my throat.
not_available Then it got to where solid food made me throw up.
not_available You didn't go to a doctor? I convinced a grad student in neurophysiology to do a muscle biopsy on the DL.
not_available Confirmed what I already knew.
not_available But your mom, you didn't tell your mother? What's the use in telling her before she absolutely has to know? Because she's your mother.
not_available She wants to help you.
not_available She wants to take care of you.
not_available This news is pretty much gonna ruin her life.
not_available She'll spend everything she has trying to keep me alive which is silly, because this disease is invariably fatal.
not_available Well, there must be some sort of experimental treatments, right? Trials? Yeah.
not_available Well, you know, you have to tell her.
not_available You have to tell her.
not_available You know that, right? Would you like me to be there? It's okay.
not_available I'll tell her tonight.
not_available Did the doctor tell you anything? Okay, what happened here? 
not_available Killer bit me.

not_available He's not a dog, he's a gerbil.
not_available Wow.
not_available That's a good name for him.
not_available Let's just clean him up, give him some antibiotics.
not_available And, ma'am, what brings you here today? I'm here for the air.
not_available County air is very therapeutic.
not_available Okay, so you don't wanna see a doctor or anything? You're just here to 
not_available Breathe.
not_available Right.
not_available Knock yourself out.
not_available Uh, Chuny, the guy in the sunglasses has been in the same position like all day.
not_available Another drunk sleeping it off.
not_available Hey, sir? Sir? Sir? Please don't be dead.
not_available Sir? Hey.
not_available I need a gurney over here, now.
not_available So the drunk isn't drunk, he's bleeding into his head.
not_available Yes, we know that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Systolic's 182.
not_available All right, bolus 50 of mannitol, It's a classic example of availability bias.
not_available I have no idea what that means, but I'm sure you're about to tell us.
not_available The waiting area's full of drunk homeless people 
not_available " so" that's what Chuny saw.
not_available I feel bad enough, all right? All right, I'm in.
not_available Toss me the bag.
not_available Call Respiratory for a vent.
MORETTl Nice pickup anyway.
not_available Stabilize him and get back into the waiting room.
not_available Clearly, we need you out there.
not_available Call CT, let them know we're on our way, and get Neurosurge down here.
not_available There's no ozone in the Tropics.
not_available Our skin will melt off.
not_available Okay, enough.
not_available You don't wanna go.
not_available I'll go without you.
not_available Without me? It's a onceina
not_available lifetime opportunity.
not_available But I'll worry.
not_available I'll miss you, and I want us to be together.
not_available It's only for six months.
not_available Hope.
not_available Morris.
not_available Did you know your gal Hope there descends from a tribe of Gypsy whores? You obviously don't have enough work to do here.
not_available Has anyone seen Sam? 
not_available She's still in with the Mv C mom.
not_available We're going to Ike's early to premedicate before speed dating.
not_available Wow.
not_available I could use a drink.
not_available I'll bring some extra Manischewitz.
not_available Yeah, we know how your tribe loves the fruit of the vine.
not_available Will you knock it off already? You know, you guys can be a real pain in the "tokhes.
not_available " Hey.
not_available Any news yet? 
not_available No.
not_available It's been over two hours.
not_available Well, Carlos is gonna be all right.
not_available They shouldn't have forced him to have an operation.
not_available It isn't right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know you tried to fight this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, the surgery went well.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available He has full function of his extremities.
not_available Well, that's good.
not_available I can take you to him if you'd like.
not_available Yes.
not_available Abby, come walk with us.
not_available Did you get the bullet out? The strangest thing happened.
not_available I removed the bullet, placed it on a stand.
not_available There was a bleeder, things got hectic, stand got knocked over and the bullet somehow went missing.
not_available Went missing? Cops have been looking for it for an hour.
not_available It just sort of vanished.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, can I go in? 
not_available Yeah, absolutely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Vanished? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Weird, right? Kidneys look good, and the blood is clearing from your urine.
not_available So I don't need surgery? 
not_available Doesn't look that way.
not_available And the baby's gonna be okay? No CT, no radiation.
not_available Everything should be fine.
not_available Thank you, doctors, so much.
not_available We'll get you upstairs as soon as the bed's ready.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Moretti.
not_available Kevin.
not_available All right, I just wanted to say that the ultrasound was a good idea " and" it's a good thing that we did it.
not_available So, you know.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available All right.
not_available Maybe you'll think twice before selling me out to Anspaugh and trying to steal my job.
not_available I wasn't trying to steal 
not_available Don't lie.
not_available It belittles us both.
not_available Um, we're gonna get an ETA on your bed.
not_available You think I'm some kind of terrible person, don't you? 
not_available He was a kid.
not_available You were his teacher.
not_available I'm only nine years older.
not_available A few years from now, no one would care.
not_available But now they do.
not_available I just can't believe he's gone.
not_available Ma'am, you need some help.
not_available His mom showed up at my house this morning told me to stay away from her son.
not_available You can't really blame her.
not_available It got heated.
not_available We had a fight.
not_available I hit my head, and she ran off.
not_available That's when I called Casey.
not_available If only she had left us alone.
not_available We were going through a rough time.
not_available He'd shut himself off.
not_available Stayed in his room.
not_available Things were getting better.
not_available He was starting to talk to me again.
not_available I don't understand why this is taking so long.
not_available I thought my case for custody was as strong as Because that's what you said.
not_available Well, that's not good enough.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I know you filed the papers.
not_available You're doing all you can.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You didn't have to do that.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available I know.
not_available Joshua's been raving about you.
not_available I'm Serena, his mom.
not_available He's a great kid.
not_available Yep.
not_available A handful.
not_available Made me go to the library to pick up some books he'd put on hold.
not_available So has he talked about what's going on? Yeah.
not_available It sounds pretty straightforward.
not_available Straightforward? I don't mean to sound cavalier about pneumonia, but he's much better today.
not_available I'm really relieved.
not_available Excuse me, I have to fill out some insurance thing for the clerk.
not_available Okay, nice to meet you.
not_available And don't let my kid run the place.
not_available He's got that kind of personality.
not_available I'll try to keep him in check.
not_available You didn't tell her.
not_available I started to, but I couldn't.
not_available Joshua, she has to know.
not_available So when she comes back later, you and I will tell her together, okay? I just I can't see the look on her face when she realizes I'm gonna die.
not_available You do it.
not_available I'm not really sure I'm in the mood for this.
not_available You're just nervous.
not_available No, it's not that.
not_available Come on, Sam, shake it off.
not_available This is gonna be fun.
not_available Come on.
not_available Ladies, just let me say that we are the hottest girls up in this place.
not_available Wow, a lot of people signed up for this.
not_available It's a numbers game, Sam.
not_available And I like the odds.
not_available You know, wouldn't it be great if tonight we all met our soul mates? Three cosmos, please.
not_available I would just be happy to meet a nice guy and go on a nice date.
not_available We're happy you came with us tonight.
not_available It's about time.
not_available I know, I gotta get out there.
not_available Girl, life is too damn short.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Yeah, I will drink to that.
not_available A toast.
not_available To meeting the nice guys.
not_available To falling in love.
not_available To sex without batteries.
not_available Come on, come on, come on now.
not_available That's it.
not_available I'm gonna go get me some.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I was thinking maybe you should stay at our place until you get better.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Well, at least while Luka's out of town.
not_available I don't want to impose.
not_available Hey, hold that elevator.
not_available Going down.
not_available And I wouldn't want you to think you'd have to wait on me hand and foot.
not_available Believe me, that'll never happen.
not_available Come on, it'll be fun.
not_available You, me and Joe.
not_available You already have a lot on your plate.
not_available Neela, your taxi's out front.
not_available Take care of yourself.
not_available Thanks, Frank.
not_available Yeah, but it's so quiet with Luka away.
not_available And besides, I could use some free babysitting.
not_available I guess Joe needs to get to know his Auntie Neela.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But isn't Luka coming home soon? I hope so, but I don't know.
not_available His trip is taking longer than we thought.
not_available It's gotta be hard for him without you and Joe.
not_available Yeah, I mean, he misses us but you know, on some level, I think he's really happy in Croatia.
not_available You know, he's comfortable there.
not_available I can hear it in his voice.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd love to stay.
not_available Okay, great.
not_available Joe's nanny will let you in.
not_available There's Thai food in the fridge.
not_available I'll be home in a while.
not_available Brilliant.
not_available I'll see you then.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available That waiting room looks like a ghost town.
not_available You did a great job today.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And it was such a pleasure.
not_available Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it, because you'll be doing it again tomorrow.
not_available Good night, Abby.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, you got a minute? It's an all
not_available day bridge tournament.
not_available You'll be bored.
not_available Teach me to play.
not_available I already have a partner.
not_available Yeah, but who's betterlooking? 
not_available It's a tossup.
not_available He is 78, very distinguished, and he knows what a shallot is.
not_available Well, what do you call that thing? 
not_available It's an onion.
not_available Aren't they the same? 
not_available No.
not_available Morris.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look, now I can "challah" at you all through dinner.
not_available Get it? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Where's Hope? 
not_available Oh, she's not coming.
not_available She's sick.
not_available Oh, that's too bad.
not_available Sick of me.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Maybe I should go.
not_available I don't wanna burden you with this.
not_available Oh, no, no, don't be silly.
not_available Stay.
not_available Okay.
not_available But I've completely lost my appetite, though.
not_available I built a time machine in my garage.
not_available I really plan on sticking with women this time.
not_available What's the oldest guy you've ever balled? I hear you'd never date a cop.
not_available How did? I am gonna kill Chuny and Dawn.
not_available I like the new look.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, what's your beef with Chicago's finest? Well, it's just, in my line of work, I see you guys get hurt, shot and killed.
not_available So you'd worry about me.
not_available Yeah, I guess I would.
not_available I'd worry about you too.
not_available Really? I see the people that come into County.
not_available The drunks, the drug seekers.
not_available It's a pretty dangerous place.
not_available On second thought, maybe I shouldn't date a nurse.
not_available You like Italian food? 
not_available I love it.
not_available I know this great place over on State.
not_available Hey, you're holding everybody up.
not_available Time to go.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I think it's great that she wants to go do a medical mission in Caracas I really do.
not_available But I have a job, okay? I have a life here.
not_available Do you have any more of this cake left? 
not_available She'll be back before you know it.
not_available I can't help but think that this trip is an elaborate excuse to break up.
not_available Have you ever considered that it's not about you? I mean, the long
not_available distance thing never ends well, does it? Morris, you're not listening.
not_available This isn't about your relationship.
not_available It's about Hope and her doing something that's important to her.
not_available I mean, you gotta respect that.
not_available I do, I do.
not_available But living in a tent city without running water or a toilet? 
not_available That's not my idea of fun.
not_available All right, I get it, it's not your thing.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I know, but Look, just give her some breathing room.
not_available Hope is smart and independent " and" that's the reason why you like her in the first place, right? But what if she meets somebody else? Some hunky humanitarian type? You're just gonna have to trust her.
not_available Hey, Lucien.
not_available Hey.
not_available The police found a large sum of money and a gun " in" Carlos and Elena's apartment.
not_available A lot of people have guns.
not_available Yeah, $ 1830, the exact amount stolen from the minimart.
not_available You'd think after years of this, you'd start to get a handle on people.
not_available The reality is, everybody lies and manipulates to get what they want.
not_available I believed them too.
not_available Everybody.
not_available It's sad.
not_available Okay, I'll call the "police " let them know somebody found their bullet.
not_available It was lodged into a crevice in the anesthesia cart.
not_available Strangest thing.
not_available Night, Abby.
not_available Good night.
not_available He looks like a little boy when he sleeps.
not_available He's a cool kid.
not_available The antibiotics seem to be working.
not_available You think he'll be coming home soon? Serena, there's something I need to tell you.
not_available What? Joshua has a neuromuscular disease.
not_available What? 
not_available It affects the nerves in the brain
