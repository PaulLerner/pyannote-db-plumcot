not_available It was kind of fun until the chemo kid called me Rudolph's skank.
not_available One of them asked me if you were Sleepy or Sneezy.
not_available What? I'm an elf, I'm not a freaking dwarf.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Nice antlers.

not_available Iooking dwarf you got.
not_available Know what? I'm an elf, damn it.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available As we commemorate the birth of Jesus I find myself contemplating the vices I've been guilty of.
not_available And also the virtues that I, that all of us born in sin and striving for sanctity should aspire to.
not_available Turning our pride to humility.
not_available Our envy to compassion.
not_available Our anger to mercy.
not_available Our laziness to activity.
not_available Our greed to generosity.
not_available Our gluttony to moderation.
not_available And last but not least, our lust must be turned to? Archie? Um Consummation? 
not_available Yeah, no, no, seriously.
not_available Our lust must be turned to purity? Uh Well, I was looking for chastity, but talk about purity a little.
not_available Well, you know, I've always taken it to mean purity of spirit as opposed to a literal, corporal purity.
MAN Go on.
not_available Uh Well, you know, we all live in the modern world.
not_available Right? And our virtuousness shouldn't be locked into some antiquated notion of abstinence.
not_available Should it? Shouldn't it? 
not_available So You're saying that you can be sexually active and still retain moral purity? Not just me, sister, if you know what I'm saying.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, well, no, no.
not_available Because what I'm actually saying is, at the end of the day, it's just It's just us in the mirror and we're the ones who determine our own moral value.
not_available And to me, that's what Christmas is all about.
not_available So you're not mad at me anymore? This is the first time in a week I've seen you smile.
not_available Well, the holiday spirit is just so infectious, I couldn't help myself and I was waiting for you to lighten up.
not_available Really? I was waiting for you.
not_available Don't try to be charming in that ridiculous outfit.
not_available Who, me? Charming? Back off, Rudolph.

MAN It's about Curtis Ames.

not_available A restraining order.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available Yeah, the judge who issued it doesn't think so.
not_available The guy says you threatened to kill him.
not_available What? Look, you should've let it go, doc.
not_available Now you look like the crazy one.

not_available I thought we were rounding.
not_available What? No.
not_available The Surgery Christmas Party is the one time of year when we can forget about disease and death and celebrate goodness, kindness.

not_available I love it.

not_available Would you excuse me a minute? 
not_available You went to where Ames works? 
not_available The police wouldn't do anything.
not_available And you threatened to kill him, and I'm the one who overreacted? You think I made this up? 
not_available I think you got carried away.
not_available I went to his work to stop and scare him.
not_available Mission accomplished.
not_available He's scared.
not_available He can have you arrested if you get near him.
not_available Look, I didn't know what else to do, okay? I did it because I love you, and I love Joe and I wasn't gonna let that asshole keep threatening us, okay? So it wasn't too geeky, was it? Geeky? Lord, no.

not_available You're not taking her until somebody explains what's going on.
not_available A patient ended up in the wrong place.
not_available Let's not blow this out of proportion.
not_available No, you heard the lady.
not_available Turn it around.
not_available How far is this place? 
not_available Just across the bridge.
not_available Hey, watch it, jerk
not_available off.
not_available I heard you needed a ride.
MELIA What does the pancreas do? It makes hormones that help you process sugar in your blood.
not_available What are hormones? 
not_available Well Whoa, whoa.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available You'll find out about that soon enough.
not_available I was thinking Dr.

not_available It's okay.
not_available I like gross stuff.
not_available Honey, Melia, it is so good to see you.

not_available He says there's no such thing as Santa.
not_available No.
not_available He didn't.
not_available He says there's no elves, no reindeer and Christmas is made up so people will spend money.
not_available No, that's crazy.
not_available So I decided I would spend the holiday with my real dad.

not_available We have a nice dinner tonight.
not_available She likes to dress up.

not_available Got any family? Well, my parents are in Gary, Indiana, where I grew up.
not_available But we haven't talked in a long time.
not_available I don't know if they'd even recognize me.
not_available I'll be back to check on you in a little bit, okay? Any word from Mercy? 
SAM Not yet.
not_available Poor lady's all alone in the world.

not_available That's Nice job, Gates.
SAM You from Mercy? Nurse Taggart? Hillary Lerner.
not_available Is it your policy to dump destitute patients on the street? Why would we do that? 
not_available It's bad for your neighborhood.
not_available No, there was a mistake with Miss Simkins? 
not_available Lenore Simkins.
not_available Yes.
not_available That's why I sent my people I'm not gonna release her so you can have a second chance to make her disappear.
not_available I don't know what she told you 
not_available Come with me.
not_available You behaved badly, so here's your lump of coal, okay? You have your boys take Ms.
not_available Simkins to her parents' place in Gary, Indiana.
not_available Gary? That's over an hour away.
not_available You'll pay for the round trip, and this will never happen again.
not_available Because I ever get wind of a patient being dumped by your hospital I will call the cops so fast I'm not sure if you're gonna get fired or arrested first.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hey, Lenore.
not_available This is Hillary.
not_available She's gonna make sure you get to see your parents for Christmas.
not_available We, by which I mean to say Dr.
not_available Gates, promised no foster care.
not_available Well, that would be a mistake.
not_available By law, they need to be placed.
not_available Getting them to give up the life they have that takes a light touch, Ray.
not_available Is that what you call lying? I wasn't gonna take a chance on losing them.
not_available You turned us into every bad adult that these kids were ever screwed by.
not_available That's so sweet and so naive.
not_available I'll send a van to pick up the other children.
not_available Good.
not_available Lf you pick them up today they'll be gone tomorrow.
not_available These kids won't just submit.
not_available Need to be convinced that they'll be safe and protected.
not_available We'll try to keep them together.
not_available I can't promise they won't end up in foster care.
not_available But you'll make sure they're okay, right? 
not_available We always do.
not_available Come on.
not_available These kids are smart.
not_available They know that that's not how it goes.
not_available A social worker will follow up.
not_available It's the best I can do.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available I can't believe you got CPS to agree to that.
not_available Actually, it was Ray's brainstorm.
not_available The trick's getting the kids to accept it.
not_available Teller.
not_available Listen.
not_available Child Protective Services has arranged for all of you to live together in a group home.
not_available You said no foster care.
not_available Hear us out, Teller 
NEELA Wait, Teller, Teller.
TELLER No, I won't go.
not_available You lied! It's not safe out there, all right? We survive.
not_available No one hurts us.
not_available What Lizzie's doing, having sex for money and shelter? 
not_available That's hurting her.
not_available Hurting all of you.
not_available Don't say that! If you weren't sleeping in old abandoned buildings Paulie would have never gotten sick.

not_available Paulie died.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wanted to tell you his His infection was too severe and we couldn't save him but I wanna see him.
not_available I know I lied to you.
not_available I'm not gonna lie anymore.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available It's not working.
not_available The way you're living is not working.
not_available You're a smart kid.
not_available You can see that.
not_available Let go, let go.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You can't go on like this anymore.
RAY Teller Lizzie agreed to go.
not_available It's the only way she can keep her baby.
not_available And the rest of us will just stay with them? That's right.
not_available And Dr.
not_available Gates will come and visit every two weeks and make sure things are okay, all right? You need me for anything at any time, you call me, and I'll be there.
not_available You would do that? Yeah.
not_available Listen.
not_available Now, I need you to take the social workers to where the others are.
not_available And let the kids know that it's okay and safe to come in.
not_available Will you do that? I'll wait with you here, Teller.
not_available Come on.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, that went better than expected, huh? Yeah? That kid may not survive another round of your games.
not_available Come on, I've been trying to help the kid all day.
not_available Gates, you'll say anything to seal the deal.
not_available I understand that.
not_available I've done that.
not_available But these are messed
not_available up kids.
not_available You gotta draw the line somewhere.
not_available And what line is that? If you're making promises you have no intention of keeping just cut loose.
not_available Minimize the damage, okay? This isn't just about the kids, is it? No, it's not.
not_available Hey, how about you give me a few hours to wrap some presents? Can we talk? 
not_available Sure.
not_available This scares me.
not_available What, Ames? What it's doing to you.
not_available To us.
not_available It took us so long to get here.
not_available All of us.
not_available And the way you're acting, how it's taking over our whole lives it makes me scared we're gonna lose this.
not_available When Jasna and the kids died I needed to make a change and I decided to move here.
not_available Made my brother really angry.
not_available He said He said that I was a coward and that I was running away.
not_available And it's only recently that I've come to know that he was wrong.
not_available I wasn't running away from anything.
not_available I was running to you.
not_available And I'll never let anything take this away.
ABBY Did I mention how hot you look in antlers? 
not_available I think she's in here, Santa.
not_available Ho, ho, ho! Has anyone seen a little girl named Melia Simon? That's her right there.
not_available Oh, my reindeer needed a little rest, so I thought I'd come by and say hi.
not_available How do you do? I'm Santa Claus.
not_available Hi, Santa.
not_available Can't stay long, very, very busy.
not_available Gotta deliver presents to the whole western hemisphere tonight.
not_available Nice try, Archie.
not_available I know it's you.
not_available Archie? Who's Archie? I'm 9 years old.
not_available I know there's no Santa, okay? You know, you're a bright girl, Melia.
not_available But you're wrong about that.
not_available It's a fake beard and a dumb suit.
not_available Don't you know that there's a rule that if millions of kids believe in the same thing, it becomes real? 
not_available That's not a rule.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Every time you're generous or thoughtful or help someone who needs help that's a little bit of Santa too.
not_available What are you talking about? Come on.
not_available Santa Claus represents one of the last remaining bits of magic left in this world.
not_available Now, I still believe, so don't spoil it for me, okay? Come on.
MELIA Where we going? Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Wait, it's Santa.
not_available Oh, you were a very, very nice girl this year.
not_available Top of the nice list.
not_available Would it be all right if I signed your cast? Thank you.
not_available To Greta Keep on being nice.
not_available Love, Santa.
not_available How'd you know my name? Come on, I'm Santa Claus, huh? Merry Christmas.
not_available It's the real Santa, isn't it? Yeah.
not_available It is.
not_available You lost almost a third of your blood volume.
not_available Give us a few days to buff you up.
not_available Plus, I have a present for you.
not_available These are for them.
not_available Things were a little touchand
not_available go for a while, so I called them.
not_available How do I explain? 
not_available It's Christmas.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Hey, princess.

not_available You look nice.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Off to your sister's, I take it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's for you.
not_available Merry Christmas, Neela.
not_available I don't normally do this.
not_available Work presents always end up being something edible and bad for you or something impersonal like organic soap.
not_available Who needs that crap cluttering up their bathroom anyway? Oh, loops, wow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's my very first pair.
not_available Bought them for myself in med school.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's a lovely gift.
not_available Listen.
not_available You're an intern and I'm an Attending, and there are certain protocols certain hierarchies that preclude me from Lucien.
not_available Being direct about this, but it's Christmas what the hell, I'm just gonna say it.
not_available You're a really good surgeon, Neela.
not_available A few more years and you could be great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're gonna try them on? I will.
not_available Beautiful.
not_available You repeat this conversation to anyone, and I will deny it.
not_available You know that.
not_available What conversation? Lovely.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Transplant rounds are at 7.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye, sweetheart.
not_available Look out, Kriss Kringle.
not_available What's going on, Morris? Oh, we did okay, Greg.
not_available Just okay? Either you rocked the house or you were closed to patients.
not_available No, we just moved people through.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available Go ahead, you can gloat now.
not_available Tell me all about what a great manager you are.
not_available I saved Jerry, I diagnosed D.I.D., yadda yadda.
MORRIS Know what? I'm gonna go with humility this time.
not_available For real.
not_available Humili
not_available what? Hey.
not_available I learned a lot watching you today.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm full of it, Hope.
not_available I get it, Archie.
not_available I know you don't believe half of what you say but You know what? It doesn't really matter.
not_available Because I saw you today.
not_available And what I saw was a guy who's trying to be good.
not_available And I don't know, that right there is half the battle.
not_available Have a good holiday.
not_available What are you doing? What? Now.
not_available Are you going home? I thought maybe we could Grab a bite, get a drink, see what happens.
not_available Chastity's always been overrated.
not_available Purity of spirit is what it's all about, right? Wait, wait, are you? What are you saying? You know what? I don't think so.
not_available What? I hate that I'm saying this.
not_available It's like some dorky angel has taken control of my mouth.
not_available But No.
not_available What? What? It's Christmas, and people get Ionely on Christmas and we might do something that we'd both regret or could get in the way of a possibly deeper relationship in the future.
not_available So I'm sorry.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You stole my suit.
not_available Well, what about you? Me? Yes, where are you from what are you doing here, what's your damage? I spent a couple of years in the service and managed to spend my time in Okinawa which is a hell of a lot better than being in Iraq or Afghanistan.
not_available Since I've come back, I work as a traveler.
not_available Yeah, I did that for a while, but then I got tired of it.
not_available So wait, you have what, a week or so left? It's supposed to be a week.
not_available But this place seems all right.
not_available It seems like pretty great people.
not_available I mean, like, what we did for that lady today, what you did That was something.
not_available Come on, everyone deserves a little bit of happiness at Christmastime.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So I called the nursing director, and I signed on for another month.
not_available Really? Really.
not_available Well.
not_available Merry Christmas, Ben.
not_available Merry Christmas, Samantha.
not_available Idiot.
not_available Moron.
not_available She was right there.
not_available Right there for the fondling, and you just let her go.
not_available Why? Why? Why'd you have to be such a good Christian, huh? There's no God.
not_available There's no Christmas.
not_available There's no freaking Santa Claus.
MAN Merry Christmas.
not_available Holy
