
not_available E.R.
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available I have never seen such a chain of errors on judgement.
not_available But I did what you said.
not_available In a case where the injuries were inflamatory like, leaving a newborn motherless Mr O'Brian.
not_available He's Carl's newly anointed.
not_available The heir apparent.
not_available It's been the best and hardest work I've ever done.
not_available Good.
not_available That's music to my ears.
not_available You're a candidate for chief resident next year.
not_available But is just that now is not a very good time.
not_available There is never a good time.
not_available The truth is mommy and daddy aren't gonna live together anymore.
not_available "It's Not Easy Being Greene" 
not_available I love it when those endorphins kick in.
not_available You're not on today, are you? I thought I'd drop by, ease up your workload a little bit.
not_available After I take a shower.
not_available It's his day off? 
not_available That's dedication.
not_available Dedication? Man, that's sad.
not_available Don't move, Mrs.
not_available Zarian.
not_available It's a little bit of glass, and it's almost free.
not_available Susan, were your ears burning? David Morgenstern and I were just talking about you.
not_available He feels you're the top contender for Chief Resident next year.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available This year's field was pretty disappointing but we found your work to be consistently solid.
not_available Now, I know you're concerned about taking time away from the baby but that doesn't have to be the case.
not_available Keep the bevel facing out.
not_available By applying timemanagement techniques you can work more efficiently reduce onthe
not_available job stress and get home at a reasonable hour.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Zarian I've got a book on the subject, if you're interested.
not_available No pressure.
not_available I just wanna let you know how we're thinking.
not_available Son of a bitch! 
not_available What? They cut me back to three shifts a week.
not_available They're cutting back on nurses? 
not_available Nurse managers because of our outrageous salaries.
not_available I still need $12,000 worth of work on my house! They bumped me up to six shifts a week.
not_available So much for my weekend.
not_available I know a way to make some quick cash.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available I joined this guy Alvin's investment club.
not_available Put up a $2000 membership fee and in a week to 10 days, you collect 10 to $20,000.
not_available From? 
not_available The fees of the new people who join.
not_available It's called a pyramid scam, it's illegal.
not_available Well, that's not what Alvin says.
not_available Trust me, if you're not in early, you lose your shirt.
not_available When did you get in? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, yourself.
not_available All right, let's see what we got here.
not_available Where'd you learn to do subq sutures? 
not_available From your med student.
not_available I obviously taught him well, didn't I? 
not_available Benton.
not_available See you later.
not_available Listen, I should warn 
you You might want to invest in a new suit and some luggage.
not_available You're going to Paris to present our clampand
not_available run study to the institute.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available Oui.
not_available Simon did an analysis of our result.
not_available Our P
not_available value was.
not_available 06.
not_available We're one successful outcome away from statistical significance.
not_available We can publish? 
not_available Soon.
not_available One more aneurysm and our numbers will blind the most dubious skeptics.
not_available After that, we head to D.C.
not_available to play dogand
not_available pony for the FDA.
not_available Now, Simon doesn't fly, so he stays here which makes you the next choice for Clampand
not_available Run Ambassador to Europe.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available I'm honored.
not_available It's good practice for the future.
not_available You've gotta find another patient soon because the Norwegians are doing a similar study.
not_available And, Peter, we cannot let the Vikings pillage our thunder.
not_available Malik, you seen Carter? 
not_available He called and said he'd be late.
not_available He should be coming any minute.
not_available No, wait! Wait! Wait! Yeah! Oh, God! John! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, baby.
not_available I think we broke my record.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, John.
not_available What? Your control is phenomenal.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know, you may find this hard to believe, but that wasn't always the case.
not_available No? 
not_available It's hard to believe, it's true though.
not_available But I found if I could distract myself and think about mundane things then I could delay the inevitable.
not_available Well, what kind of things do you think about? Let's see.
not_available Sometimes I take a mental inventory of the machines in the O.R.
not_available ThoraSeal, ventilators, auto
not_available infusers.
not_available And then, as the degree of difficulty increases, I run the procedures.
not_available Appendectomies, thyroidectomies, bowel resections.
not_available Yuck! 
not_available What? While we're making love, you're thinking about bowel resections.
not_available Given your earlier testimonial this is a case of the ends justifying the means.
not_available What? Get out! 
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available I'm just kidding.
not_available So last night I get a letter from Jen's lawyer politely informing me that she's suing me for full custody of Rachel.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Yeah, it seems I've been a distant and absent father.
not_available This after commuting from Milwaukee for half a year.
not_available Well, it sounds like a lot of lawyer B.S.
not_available I can't imagine she'd actually go through with it.
not_available I was climbing the walls all night.
not_available Well, that's why you're here.
not_available Tiny prick.
not_available I beg your pardon? I need a TB test too.
not_available So I hear Morgenstern has really turned up the pressure on you becoming Chief Resident.
not_available Yeah, it's a good opportunity, but can I do it and not work killer hours? You know how well I managed to balance work and family.
not_available Guess that answers that.
not_available You'll be able to work it out.
not_available Take your paperwork home, hours won't be that bad.
not_available You have to cut Weaver some slack.
not_available What do you mean? You go out of your way to avoid her.
not_available And if she's gonna be training you you're gonna have to work together hand in hand.
not_available Oh, there's an image.
not_available Why are you here on your day off? 
not_available I went for a jog and ended up here.
not_available Figured I might as well save some lives.
not_available One other good reason not to exercise.
not_available five
not_available minute grand mal seizure.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Start a chart.
not_available On his day off? 
not_available The orders should've been in already.
not_available I forgot.
not_available I thought you wanted a Residency.
not_available I do.
not_available Keep forgetting, you'll be in North Dakota.
not_available We got 300 applications.
not_available When do the interviews start? 
not_available They already have.
not_available Vucelich needs one more aneurysm for his study.
not_available Abdominal pains, chest pains, traumas, call me.
not_available How often do you get dizzy spells, Mrs.
not_available Henry? Oh, I get three or four a day.
not_available Usually when I'm working in the shed.
not_available You garden this time of year? 
not_available I'm a vermiculturist.
not_available I raise earthworms.
not_available Really? Big ones from Belgium.
not_available Finest castings in the world.
not_available And by castings you mean? 
not_available Worm dung.
not_available Black gold.
not_available It's the best fertilizer money can buy.
not_available It fixes the nitrogen in the soil.
not_available And you sell the stuff? 
not_available I sell the worms.
not_available Your blood pressure's a little high.
not_available So it pays well? 
not_available Six figures.
not_available Has he had a seizure before? No, he's a health nut.
not_available He runs every day.
not_available We're gonna have to get a CAT scan of his head to pinpoint the cause.
not_available Alan.
not_available Alan? When's he gonna come back? 
not_available It takes a little time to recover.
not_available Well, how long? 
not_available Usually about 30 minutes.
not_available Multifocal PVCs.
not_available What? His heart rhythm's a little off.
not_available Probably oxygen deprivation from the seizure.
not_available Has he had a murmur before? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, it's probably nothing serious.
not_available Let's get an echo of his heart after the CT, just to be safe.
not_available Lidocaine bolus, 100 milligrams, then start a drip.
not_available No, Carter.
not_available John Carter.
not_available I thought maybe you were trying to get in touch with me to set up an interview for the Residency.
not_available No, huh? Well, I'm available at anyOkay, great
not_available Right.
not_available I hear Vucelich doubled his finder's fee 
not_available for an aneurysm.
not_available Could be.
not_available I made 1000 bucks.
not_available Patient with a history of ulcers, says the pain's different this time.
not_available Rigid belly? 
not_available Hard to tell.
not_available He's so fat.
not_available But see the calcifications on the descending aorta? No, where? 
not_available Here.
not_available It's too lateral.
not_available Probably just schmutz on his lungs.
not_available I shouldn't call Vucelich? 
not_available If you wanna get yelled at.
not_available Harper, I need you to get this guy to CT.
not_available Coming.
not_available Can you return this xray to his room? Which room? 
not_available Six.
not_available Hey, you done with that? Wow, that's a mother of an aneurysm.
not_available How can you tell? 
not_available Calcification on the descending aorta.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're gonna run the CAT scan on his head to rule out lesions that could've caused the seizure.
not_available What's wrong? He's in V
not_available tach.
not_available Let's get him to Trauma.
not_available Haleh? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available What's wrong with him? 
not_available His heart rhythm's worse.
not_available You sure he hasn't taken medication? Any nonprescription drugs? No, never! 
not_available We're gonna get this under control.
not_available Can someone take Mrs.
not_available Wimbur to the waiting room? But I just wanna
not_available It's okay.
not_available Another 50 of lidocaine, IV push.
not_available Heart's racing, 200.
not_available Rhythm is all over the place.
not_available Looks like Torsade de Pointes.
not_available All right, Harper.
not_available Let's get lytes and the tox screen.
not_available And see if we got any records on this guy.
not_available Anything that can give us a clue.
not_available Lido's on board.
not_available What's your gut say, Haleh? 
not_available Low potassium.
not_available Lydia? 
not_available Cocaine.
not_available His wife says he's tox
not_available free.
not_available We'll know soon enough.
not_available Heart rate's up to 210.
not_available Let's try and cardiovert.
not_available Paddles.
not_available Start him at 100.
not_available Hands off! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Faint pulse.
not_available There we go.
not_available Nice rhythm.
not_available He's moved his head.
not_available His rate's down to 160.
not_available One
not_available eighty.
not_available Here we go again.
not_available All right, lidocaine's not working.
not_available Let's try bretylium, 500 IV push.
not_available Prep a transvenous pacemaker.
not_available Charge 200.
not_available Hands off! What makes you think there's an aneurysm? The calcium plaque on the descending aorta.
not_available While you saved his life, you made the Norwegian surgeons very unhappy.
not_available Good work.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where's the patient? 
not_available Room 6.
not_available To Room 6.
not_available Hey, way to go, Carter.
not_available Labs are back.
not_available Lytes are normal, tox screen's negative.
not_available We were both wrong.
not_available What the hell's wrong with this guy? 
not_available Rate's up to 220.
not_available Faint pulse.
not_available All right, pacer's in.
not_available Let's overdrive him to 230.
not_available Maximum gain.
not_available See if I can grab hold of this rhythm.
not_available You've got capture.
not_available Lovely.
not_available Let's take him down slowly.
not_available Two
not_available ten.
not_available Two hundred.
not_available One
not_available eighty.
not_available He's jumping back up.
not_available Lost capture.
not_available Let's start CPR.
not_available Add Pronestyl, Paddles, set them at 360.
not_available What time is it? 
not_available 0845.
not_available Mark that time.
not_available Hands off.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Wide
not_available complex tachycardia.
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available Time? 
not_available 9:05.
not_available How long has he been down? 
not_available Twenty minutes.
not_available Tried the pacer, he went into V
not_available fib.
not_available Shocked him 15
not_available 20 times.
not_available He keeps running these chaotic rhythms.
not_available Could he be hypocalcemic? 
not_available No, lytes are fine.
not_available Cocaine? 
not_available Tox screen's negative.
not_available Acidotic? 
not_available Good question.
not_available Let's get another gas.
not_available How much Pronestyl? 
not_available That makes 900.
not_available Time? 
not_available 0922.
not_available Another hundred of Pronestyl.
not_available Got your blood gases 
here PH 7.24, PO

not_available He's going down.
not_available The antiarrhythmics?

not_available Charging up to 360.
not_available Back up.

not_available Clear! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Time of death 9:55.
not_available Why? There was an electrical disturbance in your husband's heart that caused it to beat in an irregular way.
not_available I wish I could tell you what caused it to happen but the truth is, I don't know.
not_available Well, that's not good enough.
not_available I mean, we came in here, and his heart was okay.
not_available You said it wasn't anything serious, so somebody must have screwed up! How did you let this happen? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Wimbur.
not_available What did you do to him?! Hello, Alvin.
not_available Well, do you have his new number? So, Kerry
not_available One second.
not_available Yes, Susan? I've been thinking about your invitation and I would like to throw my hat in for Chief Resident.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available I look forward to showing you the ropes.
not_available Me too.
not_available Nobody's signed up for the gallbladder in 2 yet.
not_available I've got it.
not_available How long does a CAT scan take? 
not_available Hopefully, not more than an hour but sometimes there's a wait.
not_available I'm a little concerned about my worms in the truck.
not_available You brought them with you? 
not_available Just one bin.
not_available I was making a delivery when the dizziness hit.
not_available Do you think someone'll steal them? 
not_available No, they're locked up.
not_available You don't leave $5000 worth of worms unsecured, but they could freeze.
not_available Listen, if I gave you my keys, could you bring them in out of the cold? 
not_available We can't have animals in the hospital.
not_available Oh, there's no danger.
not_available Worms are the only disease
not_available free organisms on Earth.
not_available It's a fact.
not_available I really shouldn't.
not_available Please, they're my worms.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And could you feed them, please? What do they eat? 
not_available Table scraps, as long as it's vegetarian.
not_available Nothing too greasy because fat doesn't sit well with worms.
not_available Mrs.
not_available D'Angelo, I see you've been with us before.
not_available Gallstones flaring up again? 
not_available They're killing me.
not_available I can't sleep, I can't eat.
not_available And every three weeks, I end up back here.
not_available Pain pills didn't help? I took twice as much.
not_available Didn't do anything.
not_available Yeah, you shouldn't do that.
not_available Please, doctor get a surgeon to take these damn stones out.
not_available It's been going on like this for six months now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get an ultrasound.
not_available Unless your condition is lifethreatening any surgery would be considered elective, and unfortunately There's an 18
not_available month waiting list.
not_available Yeah, I'm afraid so.
not_available My neighbor got hers out the next day.
not_available Does she have private insurance? Is it my fault I'm on Medicaid? Okay, we'll start with the ultrasound and see what we have.
not_available Thank you.
not_available His name is Alan Wimbur.
not_available You guys just picked him up.
not_available I was hoping you could do the autopsy today.
not_available Hey, Jerry, where's the ultrasound? 
not_available You've got me.
not_available Let me know, because I'd like to observe.
not_available Autopsy? I wanna find out what happened to his heart.
not_available You should go home.
not_available His wife accused me of killing him.
not_available She's probably gonna sue.
not_available People get upset and feel they need to blame someone.
not_available I heard a murmur on exam.
not_available Before getting an echo, I wanted to get a CT.
not_available Yeah, guy comes in with a seizure, first thing you want is a CT.
not_available Thanks, I was just checking.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Dr.
not_available Morgenstern's office just called.
not_available He'd like to see you upstairs.
not_available Word travels fast.
not_available You're making excellent time, Peter.
not_available Suction! Let Carter suction.
not_available It's his reward for hunting down an aneurysm like a hound.
not_available I feel privileged for the opportunity.
not_available Well, now, that's what I call suction.
not_available Thank you, thank you.
not_available MacGruder, is this patient warm? Shoot, shoot, shoot! MacGruder! 
not_available Temp is 106.
not_available He has malignant hypothermia.
not_available Is he reacting to anesthesia? Give him dantrolene, get ice packs, cooling blankets.
not_available If we don't get his temp down, he's gonna have scrambled eggs for brains.
not_available Who took this patient's history? He was intolerant to fluoroethane.
not_available Damn it! I lay out a banquet and you crap all over my table! 
not_available He never had an operation.
not_available Cooling blankets! Well, lift him up, get him under.
not_available Peter, come on over here.
not_available Evert the cortex.
not_available Log
not_available roll him over.
not_available Suction, Peter.
not_available Tie that off, Peter.
not_available He never had an operation before? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, you're right, there was no way of knowing.
not_available My apologies.
not_available Metz! Metz! Are you free for lunch? Susan? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Medical records sent down the chart on your gallstone lady.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I took a peek.
not_available I know she's been on cefoxitin.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cefotaxime has better biliary penetration.
not_available I know it's hard memorizing all the antibiotics out there 
not_available but it's well worth the time.
not_available Right.
not_available Who's the ultrasound for? 
not_available Same lady.
not_available Didn't she have one last month? She's complaining of more pain.
not_available I wanna rule out obstruction and cholangitis.
not_available Remember Charcot's triad.
not_available Cholangitis is indicated by pain, fever and jaundice of which she has only one.
not_available You can rule her out without the expense of an ultrasound.
not_available If you're gonna be Chief, you gotta watch the bottom line.
not_available Mark.
not_available I don't believe you've met Kathy Snyder, one of the hospital attorneys.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello.
not_available Is this about this cardiac arrest who died this morning? 
not_available I haven't heard anything.
not_available Have you? 
not_available No.
not_available Kathy wanted to talk about the O'Brien lawsuit.
not_available You get a court date? 
not_available We've worked out a settlement.
not_available I'm not sure I want to settle.
not_available The hospital is sure.
not_available It's a good thing.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Brien gets compensated, and you can put this behind you.
not_available If I settle, this will follow me my entire career.
not_available Every time I apply for a staff job or insurance If we took it to trail, we could lose 2 million easily.
not_available You wanna lug that around your entire career? I've been over this a thousand times.
not_available I didn't do anything wrong.
not_available It was a very complicated delivery.
not_available I did as good a job as any emergency physician could have.
not_available Other emergency physicians would and have disagreed with you.
not_available A pregnant woman comes in with preeclampsia and for whatever reason, you didn't pick up on it.
not_available Her condition was masked by urinary infection! I don't want to argue the details with you, Mark.
not_available You make thousands of diagnoses a year, 99 percent of them are right on.
not_available You made a mistake, as we all do.
not_available I don't accept that.
not_available Mark, please
not_available This is about my reputation as a doctor.
not_available I'm not gonna settle.
not_available Take my name off of it.
not_available You can't separate yourself from the suit.
not_available Well, I'll hire my own lawyer, and I'll fight it myself.
not_available That's a lot of worms.
not_available Hey, big fella.
not_available Woman makes a fortune selling these.
not_available To whom? Landscapers, farmers.
not_available Could be a great sideline.
not_available You're kidding, right? 
not_available No.
not_available This could pay for the hole in my roof.
not_available I took the spoiled food from the fridge.
not_available Veggie? 
not_available That's what you asked for.
not_available They don't like grease.
not_available How do they feel about yogurt? I don't hear any complaining.
not_available Eat up, little worms.
not_available John! 
not_available Hi.
not_available Told you it was an aneurysm.
not_available You were right.
not_available Did Vucelich know who I was? Didn't you tell him about me? That I found it? 
not_available I meant to.
not_available I mean, I should have.
not_available The whole thing happened really fast.
not_available I was gonna say something, and they just assumed that What are you doing in here? The hospital decided to settle the O'Brien suit.
not_available Isn't that good news? Morgenstern thinks I'm at fault for not picking up the preeclampsia.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available He wasn't even there.
not_available You were there.
not_available It was as complicated a case as I've ever seen.
not_available You did everything you could.
not_available You think I should have caught the preeclampsia? It was a difficult diagnosis.
not_available Anyone could have missed it.
not_available If you were called up on the witness stand and 
asked "Did Greene screw up? " What would you say? I'm sorry, Mark.
not_available Come on, dude.
not_available Be bold.
not_available We start our own investment club.
not_available We collect right off the bat.
not_available No, thanks, man.
not_available What's to lose? What'd you lose? Two grand? 
not_available Alvin's gonna come through.
not_available Can you find out why the worm lady isn't back from CT? She had palpitations, so they're doing a cardiac workup.
not_available Call me when she comes down.
not_available Jerry, medical records copy a chart for me? Yeah, O'Brien, right? 
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available Hey! What happened to those worms in Radiology? 
not_available They're doing a consult.
not_available No, those earthworms.
not_available I put a bucket of earthworms in there.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Well, I didn't take them.
not_available Ray, I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available I understand you've been having some headaches and missing school.
not_available Yeah, they're pretty bad.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where in your head does it hurt? 
not_available Here.
not_available How long you been having these? 
not_available About a month.
not_available How often? 
not_available All the time, I guess.
not_available Do you feel dizzy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, pull like that.
not_available Play sports? 
not_available J.V.
not_available football, middle linebacker.
not_available I was a running back.
not_available We used to hate you guys.
not_available Squeeze my hand.
not_available You ever get headaches playing sports? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available We're gonna get you a CAT scan.
not_available You know what that is? No? It's when we take a picture of your brain.
not_available We wanna make sure it's still in there.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be back in a minute.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I'm sorry to say Tradition holds they serve olives and walnuts with the drink.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich, Dr.
not_available Benton, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
not_available I misled you both earlier.
not_available The finder's fee for the aneurysm should go to Harper Tracy.
not_available She's a third
not_available year student.
not_available She caught it.
not_available Taking credit for a colleague's work is a very dangerous precedent, Mr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I can assure you that it will never happen again.
not_available Well, your reassurance rings hollow just now.
not_available One has to wonder if this is a momentary lapse of integrity or a fundamental flaw in your character.
not_available Well, time will tell.
not_available In any event, the patient's secondary condition means he's not an appropriate candidate for the study so there will be no finder's fee.
not_available Is there anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available Strange boy.
not_available The patient is being excluded? 
not_available What's that? Oh, yes.
not_available It seems that he has a history of, excuse me, neurological problems which exceed the parameters of the protocol, so What were we talking about, Peter? Oh, I remember.
not_available George Cinq.
not_available Walnuts, olives.
not_available Actually, I was an habitué of this bistro, called "L'Ami Louis," and there was 
not_available Mrs.
not_available D'Angelo.
not_available Feeling any better? 
not_available No.
not_available Are you going to do that test? I consulted with another doctor, and we feel the ultrasound is unnecessary.
not_available You don't have any new symptoms.
not_available You're not even gonna check? Given that you don't have a fever or any other symptoms there's no way I can justify the expense.
not_available The expense.
not_available I see.
not_available I can take it from here.
not_available I know the routine.
not_available The nurse gives me a few pills that don't work, and I'm pushed out the door.
not_available I checked with the elective surgery waiting list and they can get you in by the end of the year.
not_available It's February 1 st.
not_available Help! 
not_available What happened? They were out by the trash.
not_available Must've been there an hour.
not_available Get some blankets, heat up some saline, we'll do a warm
not_available water lavage.
not_available The lamps they use on newborns.
not_available Great idea.
not_available Go up to OB, see if they'll lend us some.
not_available All right.
not_available Oh, damn it! 
not_available The lid's frozen.
not_available Oh, God! All right.
not_available Rib spreader, rib spreader.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm gonna knock it loose.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available Hypothermia, earthworms.
not_available Five grand worth.
not_available Earthworms? Yeah.
not_available They're Belgian.
not_available They don't take kindly to cold.
not_available Got it, got it! Oh, no! 
not_available It's frozen solid.
not_available Well, maybe they're still alive underneath.
not_available Surgical mallet, reflex hammer.
not_available Thanks.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available What am I gonna tell Mrs.
not_available Henry? Good news, buddy.
not_available Your brain's right were it should be.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's talk about school.
not_available Why? Well, because school can cause stress, and stress can cause headaches.
not_available Do you have any trouble with your classes or students or teachers or anything like that? 
not_available No.
not_available All right, what about your girlfriend? Which one? 
not_available There's a problem right there.
not_available How many girlfriends do you have? 
not_available A few.
not_available I don't know.
not_available All right.
not_available You're not doing drugs, are you? Smoking pot? 
not_available No.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available What's the matter? I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available What? 
not_available There's something wrong with me.
not_available Okay.
not_available All guys who are your age, they think that there's something wrong with them.
not_available No.
not_available I'm different.
not_available How are you different? The girls at school I I don't feel anything when I'm around them.
not_available I think I'm gay.
not_available I know I am.
not_available I mean, what am I supposed to tell my dad, my brothers? I'm just sick of being this fake person.
not_available Haleh, will you call Psych? See if we can get a Resident down to look at the kid in 1.
not_available Preferably someone from adolescent medicine.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available Kid thinks he's gay.
not_available Needs somebody to talk to.
not_available I'm going to lunch.
not_available I'll check the charts.
not_available Try and make yourself useful.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, good catch this morning on the aneurysm.
not_available Harper, Carter, give me a hand.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She collapsed.
not_available Acute shortness of breath, chest pain.
not_available Pulse is high.
not_available Carter, start on an oxygen mask.
not_available Harper, what do we order? EKG, chest film, blood gas Chem
not_available 7, CBC, cardiac enzymes.
not_available And? 
not_available Myoglobin.
not_available Myoglobin.
not_available Do it.
not_available She has neck
not_available vein distention.
not_available Temp's 101.
not_available Susan? Chief complaint? 
not_available Shortness of breath, chest pain.
not_available She has a history of renal failure.
not_available What's the differential? Susan? Harper? Acute MI, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia 
not_available pericarditis, congestive heart failure.
not_available Pleural effusion.
not_available Pleural effusion.
not_available Stop that! Prompting from the peanut gallery? 
not_available Let's get a gas cooking.
not_available Get an EKG, let's see how her heart's doing.
not_available After you.
not_available Hell of a way to spend your day off.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Wish I never would have come in.
not_available Believe me.
not_available What's that? Jody O'Brien? It's the first time I looked at that since the big day.
not_available She had two high BPs, proteinuria.
not_available I missed a preeclampsia.
not_available If I hadn't, she'd be alive.
not_available Could've happened to any of us.
not_available It's not supposed to happen to me.
not_available Well, you are arrogant.
not_available Arrogant? It's like there's you and the Pope.
not_available You guys are infallible.
not_available Then, of course, there's the rest of us.
not_available Yeah? Well, after today, the Pope's on his own.
not_available Good.
not_available I think I might have killed that guy this morning.
not_available Mark.
not_available Hey, Mark! When I first checked his heart, I heard a murmur.
not_available He must've had a congenital defect.
not_available That guy crashed 10 minutes after he got in there.
not_available There's nothing you could have done.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Yes, there is.
not_available Could've gotten an echo, and then I could've gotten him to the O.R.
not_available You're holding yourself to a ridiculous standard, Mark.
not_available I gotta get to an autopsy.
not_available It's your day off.
not_available Go home! Low
not_available voltage EKG.
not_available BP's falling.
not_available She's decompensating.
not_available Where's that blood gas? 
not_available I'll check.
not_available You got it? 
not_available These numbers don't make sense.
not_available What? 
not_available You hit a vein instead of an artery.
not_available Is that the blood gas? 
not_available Yeah, no.
not_available I mean yeah.
not_available But I tapped a vein instead of an artery.
not_available No, I tapped a vein.
not_available Whoever did it, do it again and do it right.
not_available Carter, you do it.
not_available Non
not_available specific ST changes.
not_available Where are we? Susan? I don't know where you are 
not_available I'm at pericardial effusion.
not_available Or pump failure, or an embolism.
not_available Let's get an echo! 
not_available Positive Ewart's sign.
not_available Pressure's down, 50/30.
not_available Pericardiocentesis tray! Shouldn't you confirm your diagnosis before sticking a needle in her heart? 
not_available I've made my diagnosis.
not_available Alligator clamp is on the needle.
not_available The diagnostic gold standard is an echocardiogram.
not_available You wait while Tech comes down.
not_available I'll see if there's any fluid around her heart.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Anything yet? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Here it comes.
not_available What do you know? Looks cloudy.
not_available I wonder if it's transudate or exudate fluid.
not_available Anyone know the gold standard to differentiate the two? Kerry? Measure LDH to protein.
not_available What's the LDH ratio to identify exudate fluid? 
not_available I'd have to look it up.
not_available It's.
not_available 5 to 1.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You guys should come here more often, brush up on your gross anatomy.
not_available You guys find anything conclusive? Why, what are you looking for? 
not_available Something wrong with the heart.
not_available Think you missed something? 
not_available Possibly.
not_available Well, you came at just the right time.
not_available Size and shape normal.
not_available Okay.
not_available Who wants to section this? Bill? I think it's your turn.
not_available Martin, will you hand him a knife? Doug.
not_available It's been an hour, and Psych still hasn't come down for that boy.
not_available All right, I'll call them.
not_available Why don't you talk to him yourself? Because there's nothing physically wrong with him, and I have four other patients.
not_available Is it because the kid's gay? What? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available If you mean, is it because that boy's particular problems fall out of my frame of reference or my area of expertise then the answer is yes.
not_available If you mean, is it because I'm homophobic then the answer is no.
not_available Okay? No congenital or valvular anomalies.
not_available Endocardium normal.
not_available Myocardium of normal thickness and color.
not_available Blood vessels at base, normal.
not_available Coronary ostia are in the usual anatomical position.
not_available Arteries show no sign of plaque.
not_available He's normal.
not_available No sign of anything congenital? 
not_available Were you here a second ago? What was the cause of death? Typical ER thinking.
not_available Gotta be cause and effect.
not_available See, down here we operate on a slightly different gestalt.
not_available Sometimes there are answers, but many times, mystery.
not_available It's not very satisfying.
not_available You think you're a scientist? You want explanations, hard answers, algorithms of care? That's dog crap.
not_available Medicine's an art.
not_available And art is ambiguous.
not_available All right.
not_available Preliminary 
results Idiopathic dysrhythmia.
not_available No known cause of death.
not_available Nurse? 
not_available Hi, how are you feeling? Oh, tired.
not_available They gave me a million
not_available dollar workup and couldn't find anything wrong.
not_available I just want to take my worms and go home.
not_available I have some bad news for you.
not_available Your worms were mistaken for trash and put outside in the snow.
not_available No.
not_available By the time I found out they were already frozen solid.
not_available We brought them in.
not_available We tried to warm them with blankets and water.
not_available We used all our capabilities.
not_available But we couldn't get them back.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available Can I see them? What's that? 
not_available Vucelich's study protocol.
not_available "Parameters for exclusionary status.
not_available " Are you excluding someone? 
not_available Vucelich did.
not_available Anyone I know? The guy we worked on today.
not_available He went bad.
not_available He ever drop people who do well? Why are you reading this now? Has he dropped someone before this? Mrs.
not_available Rubadoux.
not_available He's notI mean Vucelich wouldn't drop bad outcomes just to pretty
not_available up his numbers, would he? I don't know.
not_available I don't need you to hide my mistakes.
not_available If I screw up, let me deal with it.
not_available You're right.
not_available Don't lie on my behalf.
not_available I won't.
not_available It's insulting.
not_available I got it, okay? I gave you the credit.
not_available What do you want? What is with you today? 
not_available Sorry, this Residency thing.
not_available My chances of getting in here are about 1 in 50.
not_available I don't even have an interview set up yet.
not_available I'm gonna end up in North Dakota.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What? I forgot Dr.
not_available Benton's TPN orders.
not_available None of his post
not_available ops are getting their IVs.
not_available Susan? 
not_available One second.
not_available Yes, Kerry? According to The Washington Manual, the determinative LDH ratio isn't .5 to 1, it's .6.
not_available Oh, you got me again.
not_available If you're gonna be Chief, get your facts straight.
not_available You know, if being Chief means having you breathing down my back to hell with it.
not_available I don't want you as my mentor.
not_available Just stay out of my way.
not_available That's the first time I've ever seen you act like a Chief Resident.
not_available Maybe Morgenstern was right.
not_available Where are you going? I was coming to talk to you.
not_available I was telling my dad how good I'm feeling.
not_available It was taking a long time.
not_available The nurse said the CAT scan, it was okay? 
not_available Yeah, it's normal.
not_available No tumors, orI hate to tell you 
not_available what's been going through my head.
not_available He's fine.
not_available Thank God.
not_available It could be migraines.
not_available Yes, it could also be stressrelated, something I wanted to talk to Ray about, if I could
not_available I know what it is.
not_available It's that damn trig.
not_available Every time I have one of those quizzes, I get headaches.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available No, I do.
not_available Could that be what it is? 
not_available It could.
not_available Because if that's it, I mean, I know the prescription.
not_available Applying the seat of your pants to the chair.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Button your coat.
not_available I'm sorry about this.
not_available I spent the whole damn day waiting.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Listen, Ray, if you wanna talk about this or anything else at all you just call me here, okay? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Well, I thought she was still at Beth Israel doing whatever it is she does.
not_available Oh, right, right.
not_available He's on the phone.
not_available Be off in a minute.
not_available I don't need him anyway.
not_available I just wanna get the records on a patient.
not_available Which one? 
not_available Rubadoux, Sylvie.
not_available I believe she was dropped.
not_available Claire, could you come here? I can't find my pocket schedule.
not_available Help yourself.
not_available Yeah, my life is unraveling as we speak.
not_available What jacket did you wear to the lecture? Claire, let's be serious.
not_available How can I possibly know? Why don't you just find my schedule like I asked you to? Who's that? Who's been asking? No, tell me.
not_available Kemper's been asking? Well, you can tell Kemper that I am centimeters away.
not_available With any luck, I'll be in the New England Journal next month 
not_available Damn, man.
not_available Where'd you get all that? 
not_available Alvin came through.
not_available No guts, no glory.
not_available You've gotta be kidding me.
not_available Life ain't fair.
not_available Are you gonna report that to the IRS? I assume that's a rhetorical question.
not_available Well, I'm gonna make my fortune the old
not_available fashioned legal way.
not_available Delivering Chinese food? 
not_available No, raising earthworms.
not_available I got a dozen in there.
not_available I thought they froze to death.
not_available No, most of them moved into the middle of the bin for warmth and survived.
not_available You took that lady's worms.
not_available No, she gave me enough to start my own colony.
not_available It's my ticket out of here.
not_available Come on, guys, let's go home.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Bye.
not_available Didn't mean to scare you.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available I finished your discharge summaries, called in your orders and I rounded the patients upstairs.
not_available Can I go home? 
not_available Bye, Carter.
not_available I'm sorry about what happened earlier.
not_available Good night.
not_available Carter? Yeah? Were the TPN orders called in on time? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available I screwed up again.
not_available They were 45 minutes late.
not_available I know.
not_available I called the pharmacy.
not_available So are we sworn enemies forever? 
not_available No.
not_available Denial's a funny thing.
not_available It keeps you from asking the scary questions.
not_available Which ones? The ones I've been asking myself all day today.
not_available Am I dangerous? Should I be practicing medicine? We all ask those questions.
not_available And the answers are "no" and "yes.
not_available " In that order.
not_available I hope so.
not_available I lost my family for this job.
not_available You're wallowing.
not_available Yes, I am wallowing.
not_available The first good wallow I've had in a while, so don't ruin it.
not_available Well, I'm gonna drive home.
not_available You want a ride? No.
not_available I jogged in, I'm gonna jog out.
not_available Hey, you wanna hear something funny? 
not_available Definitely.
not_available You know that guy who died this morning? It wasn't my fault.
not_available I did everything right, and he died anyway.
not_available So, what's the lesson in that? 
not_available Can't win.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available You are wallowing.
not_available Good night.
not_available Night.
not_available Susan? 
not_available Yeah? Did anybody think it was odd, my coming in today? No.
not_available I was just checking.
not_available Night.
not_available Good night.
