not_available We've been short on Attendings.
not_available Where'd they put the lounge?

not_available Let's see what they say.
not_available No, do it and see if you can get through a shift without pissing off the other departments.

not_available Why don't you step outside for a while? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm not leaving him.

not_available I thought his airway was
not_available I know what you thought.
not_available We were late.
not_available We were in a hurry.

not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Have you had any fever, loss of appetite, dizziness? I mean, all this over a bad plate of shrimp? Pratt asked if you'd check again on his Surgery consult.
not_available Can't someone else do it? Abby's off, the new girl's on Triage 
not_available and no one else speaks English.
not_available Okay.

not_available Digoxin? It's a heart medicine.
not_available Sounds
not_available Sounds familiar.
not_available Okay, we're gonna give you some fluids now.
not_available Glenlivet, I hope.
not_available More like Gatorade.
not_available And we'll need an EKG and a blood test.
not_available Look, is all that necessary? Just humor me.
not_available Keep him on a monitor and get a dig level.
not_available I'd rather go home.
not_available Not until we know you're better.
not_available What do you have, Gallant? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Hernandez twisted his knee.
not_available We're waiting on an x
not_available ray.
not_available I wanna be sure there's not an avulsion fracture.
not_available What kind of work do you do? 
not_available I'm a carpet installer.
not_available Do you like it? 
not_available Makes you appreciate standing up.
not_available It's anserine bursitis.
not_available Cancel the x

not_available How'd you diagnose that? 
not_available Focused history and physical.
not_available No x
not_available rays in the Congo.
not_available I smelled alcohol on Paula Martin's breath, the baby's mom.
not_available She didn't seem drunk, just upset.
not_available I think we should call Social Work.
not_available The baby needs to be admitted overnight.
not_available Let the floor team deal with it.
not_available We've got patients.
not_available It'll fall through the cracks.
not_available So, what, we turn this into a bureaucratic mess? I just don't want the kids to come back with something worse.

not_available Gallant, will you help me in Exam 2 with skater boy? Neela, give me the history.
not_available Epigastric pain, improved with Gl cocktail.

not_available Better than you, in fact.
not_available So, what did you hope to find out from the labs? He was in pain.
not_available I was worried about pancreatitis.
not_available But he improved with the antacids.
not_available Hey, is that Pratt in there with Lewis? No, it's Gallant.
not_available Oh, I always get those two mixed up.
not_available Must be the goatee.
not_available Send him home on an H2 blocker.
not_available We weren't supposed to discharge until the labs were back.
not_available Yeah, that's why Triage looks like a refugee camp.
not_available Get his phone number and call him back in if his labs are abnormal.
not_available But trust me, they won't be.
not_available The whole staff should go to the Dark Continent.
not_available Where is my Surgical consult? 
not_available Your consult? Exactly my question, doctor, and I use that term loosely.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Your upright abdomen shows a few air
not_available fluid levels.
not_available In all likelihood, this patient of yours has an ileus leading you to? 
not_available Admit to Medicine.
not_available Do not pass "Go," do not occupy another bed and stop waiting for Dr.

not_available I'm back in med school.
not_available Really? 
not_available Lovely.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Could you breathe for me, sir? You waited three and a half hours for Abby? I never meant to quit med school, and it seemed like the right time.
not_available I have one year left.
not_available Where'd you get the money? Begged, borrowed, threatened my ex
not_available husband.
not_available Good for you.
not_available As soon as I paid up, they put me on rotation.
not_available And Corday sent you down for a consult.
not_available She was jammed.
not_available She figured I could handle a bowel obstruction.
not_available So no more nursing? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm still gonna be taking a few shifts for a while.
not_available I need the money.
not_available Wow, you must feel great.
not_available I do.
not_available And tired.

not_available You might wanna
not_available Yeah, thank you.
not_available That's enough.
not_available She'll be up with an intubated Surgical patient and her tail between her legs.
not_available Any idiot can see this patient is on his way to the OR.
not_available He needs a Foley and an NG tube, chop, chop.
not_available Where can you find a nurse when you really need one? Hey, how about you? Excuse me? 
not_available That's okay.
not_available I'll get the Foley.
not_available There's nothing sexier than a mute girl covered in blood so keep your head down and your mouth shut.
not_available You sound just like a guy I used to date.
not_available He's dead.
not_available No gag.
not_available Time to go tubular.
not_available Let me take Abby through this.
not_available Why don't you tube this guy and leave the mentoring to me, okay, Tarzan? Okay, get me the end

not_available Either fetch me some urine, or don't let the door hit you on the ass.
not_available Okay, big tongue, big cords.
not_available You're in.
not_available Bag him up.
not_available It's okay, Adam.
not_available You're just tired now.
not_available Don't wake him up, okay, sweetie? How was the CT? Is his brain okay? There are some good signs but we're gonna have to wait to be sure.
not_available Paula, Social Work's coming down to talk to you.
not_available You called them? 
not_available I am concerned about your drinking.
not_available I told you.
not_available You've been under a lot of stress.
not_available I don't need to talk to a social worker.
not_available It doesn't help.
not_available There have been prior incidents? Are you in the CPS database? It was nothing.
not_available Let's go, Kovac.
not_available We're not on Zulu time here.
not_available Pressure's holding, 104 systolic.

not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, Dr.

not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, this lady's waiting a while.
not_available My name's Athena, like the goddess.
not_available I'm getting to her.
not_available How about 72? Seventytwo hours? Rule out epi in Curtain 4? 
not_available Still waiting on CT.
not_available Since 9 a.
not_available m.? I'll do six 12s a week, every week.
not_available You trying to buy yourself a burnout? Hey, in Africa, I did 18 hours a day every day.
not_available This is a piece of pie.
not_available Cake.
not_available Let's pretend CT was down.
not_available What do you do then? Send him to another hospital? 
not_available It's too much.
not_available I want to work.
not_available I need the money.
not_available Does he have rebound tenderness? Obturator and psoas signs? I'll also require four weeks' notice next time you decide to skip town.
not_available Hey, give me the shifts, and I'll do even better.
not_available I'll give you eight.
not_available Because two months from now, I'll be gone again.
not_available Two months? 
not_available I'm going back.
not_available Before you order a $3000 test, you should do a thorough exam.
not_available To Africa? For how long? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'll see when I get there.
not_available Can you sign these? Acute CVA, esophageal impaction.
not_available Fine, but I'll need it in writing.
not_available Yeah, draw up a contract.
not_available Dislocated thumb, urticaria.

not_available Then we should definitely talk about a raise.
not_available Two months ago, Henry burned his hand while left alone? I had a job interview.
not_available There was something on TV.
not_available He tried to make grilled cheese while I was out.
not_available I was only gone an hour.
not_available Our database also turned up an incident at school, no one came to pick him up.
not_available A teacher took him home with her? For a few hours till I could get there.
not_available Kyle, my husband, was supposed to do it.
not_available Unfortunately, based on this pattern and Dr.
not_available Lewis' suspicion of alcohol use we'll need to remove the children from the home pending further investigation.
not_available What? 
not_available Since the father's able to provide care Adam and Henry will be placed with him.
not_available I'm not I'm not a bad mother.

not_available Most cases like this are resolved within six months.
not_available I

not_available Paula, you have a lot of burns over your body, including your throat.
not_available What happened to you? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Take him and get him cleaned up.
not_available Really, I'm fine.
not_available All right, just dress it here.
not_available Am I going to die? We need to put a tube down your throat.
not_available You won't be able to talk.
not_available How long? I'm dead, aren't I? Mrs.
not_available Martin, do you want us to intubate? No, I need to talk to my son.
not_available I want to explain.
not_available Poor chest excursion.
not_available She might need an escharotomy.
not_available Paula, can you feel this? She burned all her nerve endings.
not_available Prep a Betadine 10 blade.
not_available Get ready to intubate.
not_available Step away, Morris.
not_available She has 90 percent surface
not_available area burns? Ten percent chance of survival.
not_available For what, a few days in a burn unit till she gets septic and dies from the infection? The lady doesn't wanna be tubed.
not_available She's suicidal.
not_available That overrides her right to refuse care.
not_available I thought she was that baby's mother.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Hey, loose lips.
not_available Corday around? I have some postop films for her.
not_available Why don't you leave them here? I'll make sure she sees them.
not_available I'm in no mood for a demonstration of female solidarity.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Can you slow down, please? She's doing an elective at Boston.
not_available She's a student? Things have been very, very strained between us.
not_available I haven't slept with her.
not_available It's been, like, weeks.
not_available Months, I meant months.
not_available So, what did you do, hide her pictures in a drawer? It was a cabinet, actually.
not_available You're not gonna call her, are you? Come on.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available Coffee.
not_available Is it too bloody much to ask? We had a shot.
not_available It says here that most blunt abdominal injuries die at the scene.
not_available That's blunt aortic injury.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Still, he probably would've thrombosed in postop anyway.
not_available Well, it's a complicated procedure.
not_available Yes, more so today than usual.
not_available And to think that I was worried about it being too soon when the real problem was I was allowing myself to feel something for an absolute Bastard? Jerk? Wanker? I knew it.
not_available I knew it.
not_available There's no shame in that.
not_available Sats 97 on 100 percent.
not_available Urine output? Over 100 cc's per hour.
not_available We'll wait to intubate her until she's seen her kids.
not_available Henry? I'm gonna go see him right now.
not_available I'll be back in a minute.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Get back to work.
not_available Want me to talk to the father? 
not_available No.
not_available You seem a little
not_available No, I'll do it, Luka.
not_available I don't know if that kid should go in, it could traumatize him further.
not_available So could never seeing her again.
not_available I shouldn't have called Children's Services.
not_available You were looking out for those kids.
not_available The fact that she did this proves you were right.
not_available Yeah, all it did was cost them their mother.
not_available Can you take Henry to the family room? No, I don't wanna go.
not_available We have a TV and candy in there.
not_available Dad? You know what, buddy? Do me a favor.
not_available Come over here.
not_available Watch over Adam for me, okay? Call the Burn Unit and make sure they have a bed ready.
not_available God what the hell happened here? I knew she was messed up, but I
not_available I never imagined anything like this.
not_available How is she? 
not_available She's not doing well.
not_available She told him to lie.
not_available They didn't go back for hot dogs.
not_available She wanted to pick up some beer.
not_available Adam's gonna be all right.
not_available He's responding well.
not_available I should never have filed for custody.
not_available I should've grabbed these kids and run away somewhere.
not_available She wants to see Henry.
not_available Look, Mr.
not_available Martin, I know this is a very difficult time and you're angry but she's going to die and you need to think about what's best in the long run.
not_available She wants him to see her like that? She wants to say goodbye.
not_available No.
not_available I won't.
not_available Well, no one's gonna make you do anything you don't wanna do.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available Please.
not_available I heard she was nuts.
not_available I heard we were taking her kids away.
not_available That'd make anybody nuts.
not_available To do a kamikaze in front of your own son? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Never been there.
not_available Where? I'll take you.
not_available Yeah, I bet you would.
not_available New girl's kind of intense, huh? 
not_available I wish this shift was over.
not_available Why don't you call it a night? I don't want everybody to think I'm a wuss.
not_available It's too late for that.
not_available Some Kind of Wuss? Isn't that a movie? So they move that psycho
not_available mobile yet? The bay's clear.
not_available They'll be towing it out in a little while.
not_available She couldn't park around the corner, huh? You sure you should be doing that? 
not_available You said you were a doctor.
not_available I am a doctor.
not_available Then what are you? That's a good question.
not_available How's that for wound approximation? Utah Arm's working for you, huh? 
not_available Better than you are.
not_available Finish this for me.
not_available Hey, what are you doing? Scar control.
not_available Hey, Chuny, can you get me some 
not_available I thought Romano was doing that.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available He was.
not_available Would you get Dr.
not_available Lewis for me? She's in with another patient.
not_available She said it would be three hours.
not_available I've been here four.
not_available The counselor's on his way, sir.
not_available Just a little longer.
not_available I promise.
not_available This patient is one of ours from today?

not_available No.
not_available Asystole.
not_available How about dopamine? It's almost an hour.
not_available We're done.
not_available A five
not_available minute physical exam could've picked up the bleed.
not_available We would've had time to operate.
not_available Instead, she waited 11 hours and left without being seen.
not_available This woman had nowhere else to go.
not_available And if we can't find a way to take care of people like her, nobody will.
not_available Get me out of here! Why are you experimenting on me? Please, somebody! Somebody, help! Honey, I need you! He's taking me away! He's getting me out of here! Take me away! Can you get that guy back in here? Hey, Morris.
