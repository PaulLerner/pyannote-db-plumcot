not_available Well, repeat the head CT.
not_available I think he's still altered.
not_available I didn't know you were here.
RAY Yeah, just got here.
not_available There's lots of trauma today.
not_available I heard.
not_available Hey, the guys from my old band are playing this Saturday night at Exit.
not_available I might be on call.
not_available So we're still waiting? 
not_available It's only been a week.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna go clear some of these beds, all right? 
not_available Okay.
not_available See you.
not_available Sarah? Have you seen Tony? 
not_available Well, I can look around.
not_available No, I'll wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available Or maybe you can help me.
not_available Sure.
not_available It's kind of personal.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available I need a vaccine.
NEELA Which one? 
not_available HPV.
not_available It prevents cervical cancer.
not_available Right.
not_available But the school nurse gives it and you need your parents' permission or your grandparents' permission.
not_available They wouldn't understand.
not_available Does Tony know about this? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Are you gonna tell him? 
not_available No.
not_available It's private.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I mean, you can tell him.
not_available If you want to.
not_available Why didn't you go to your pediatrician? He only takes care of little kids.
not_available Besides, I think I need a new doctor anyway.
not_available Do you know a good G YN? 
KOVAC So you can't place him? Best I can hope for is a crappy nursing home that'll accept $ 100 a day from Medicaid.
not_available Not sick enough for a nursing home.
not_available He needs assisted living.
not_available Medicaid nor Medicare will cover that, he can't afford it.
not_available The son's assets? 
not_available They'll be tied up in probate for a year.
not_available I've tried three boardand
not_available cares.
not_available They want cash, today.
not_available Greedy bastards.
not_available But we got a bigger problem.
not_available I'm not sure he's competent to consent to nursing
not_available home placement.
not_available Didn't seem that altered.
DADE His Alzheimer's gets worse as the day goes on.
KOVAC Sundowning.
not_available We need someone with durable power for his health
not_available care decisions.
not_available The son had it.
not_available Lot of good that does us now.
not_available We're scrambling to get an emergency State Guardian.
not_available Hey, any luck finding a foster home for TomÃ¡s? 
not_available Piece of cake compared to this.
BETINA Dr.
not_available Pratt? You called for a wet read? Yes, I did.
not_available A possible pneumo.
not_available Excuse me, please.
not_available Haven't seen you in a few weeks.
not_available I was doing an invasive fellowship in Dallas.
not_available For six months.
not_available Really? Well, I sent you a few e
not_available mails.
not_available Never got any of them.
not_available You must've changed your address.
not_available I've had the same address for years.
not_available So you think there's some pathology here? Palpitations.
not_available Like your heart's skipping a beat? 
not_available More like it races.
not_available Every now and then.
not_available Ray, can I get you to look at a knee? 
not_available Yeah, excuse me.
not_available It's happening.
not_available I'll get the crash cart.
not_available My chest is gonna explode.
not_available Got a pulse, a hundred of lido.
not_available Anything surgical? Stable V
not_available tach.
not_available Responding to lidocaine.
not_available Ahh.
not_available That's better.
not_available I guess you won't be needing me.
not_available Milligram a minute.
not_available Titrate up, p.r.n.
not_available Ectopy.
NEELA Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I left a consult on your asthma guy.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Did you know Sarah's here? Huh? 
not_available She's asking for the HPV vaccine.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available Does that mean? 
not_available No, we didn't get that far.
not_available She wants the world to know how grown up she is.
NEELA I wouldn't worry about it.
not_available It's just a phase that girls go through.
KOVAC Gates.
not_available Coming.
NEELA Good luck.
not_available Thanks for your help.
not_available I'll hold.
not_available We got a Guardian assigned and two nursing homes to choose from.
not_available Great, thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Think he'll be able to decide which one? Well, let's hope so.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Rutley.
not_available Hello.
not_available When am I leaving? Well, that's what we're here to talk to you about.

not_available He ought to be home by now.
not_available Wayne, you know, Danny was in this hospital today.
not_available What, Danny? No.
not_available Danny's not sick.
KOVAC He had a heart problem.
not_available L Nobody told me anything about that.
not_available His heart stopped beating.
GATES We worked on him for over an hour.
not_available Where is he? Uh He's better now? He died, Wayne.
KOVAC Danny's dead.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No, I don't believe it.
not_available It's not possible.
not_available Where is he? I wanna see him, where is he? 
not_available He's in the morgue, Mr.
not_available Rutley.
not_available What? Take me there.
not_available Take me there.
not_available Take me to my son.
not_available Please? Please, I wanna see him, I need to see him.
not_available I wanna say goodbye.
not_available The CDC recommends starting the HPV vaccine when you're 11.
not_available All right, we need to talk about this.
not_available Okay, let's talk.
not_available HPV is a sexually transmitted 
not_available I'm not having sex, okay? But when I do, I wanna be responsible.
not_available Even if I said yes, your grand Okay, do you realize how stupid this is, though? I'm old enough to go and get birth control on my own.
not_available But you won't let me go and get a vaccine that could save my life.
not_available Sarah, you're 12 years old.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available What's the rush? 
not_available I'm not rushing.
not_available But I can't help it if I'm growing up now, can I? Need you to fill out transfer papers for Mr.
not_available Rutley.
not_available I'll be there in a second.
not_available Can we continue this at home? Please? So I can't get it now? 
not_available Not today.
SARAH That's so unfair.

not_available Sam, have you lost your mind? 
not_available Come on, it was only 10 joules.
not_available Really? Oh! Huh.
not_available Yeah, I guess that's not so bad.
not_available It's called a negative Mach band.
not_available Looks like something's there, but it's not.
not_available It doesn't even exist.
not_available Wow.
not_available It's a retinal phenomenon.
