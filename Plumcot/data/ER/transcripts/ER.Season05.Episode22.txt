not_available 2 mask on him, CBC, lytes, tox screen, EIKG and bag a urine.
not_available So you think he was just lost? 
not_available And neglected.
not_available With the decreased resps and contracted pupils I'd say he might have been given opiates.
not_available We need to give him Narcan, .10 milligram.
not_available Stand by with an intubation tray.
not_available He's dehydrated.

not_available Okay.
not_available "McLucas has to cancel.
not_available Call to reschedule." Okay, I'll tell her.
not_available Anyone see Carol? 
not_available She's in Curtain 3.
not_available Her appointment's canceled.
not_available She needs to call McLucas.
not_available Oh, I know her.
not_available She was Conni's OB when she had her baby.
not_available Did you say baby? You think 
not_available Pop Tart in the toaster? That empathetic woman did ask about her due date.
not_available You hear anything about Carol being pregnant? By Doug Ross? 
not_available I'm sure it would be Doug.
not_available McLucas is also a GYN.

not_available What is it? 
not_available Jerry.
not_available They think Carol's knocked up.
not_available Is she happy? 
not_available She hasn't told anyone.
not_available She must've told someone.
not_available What? How's he doing? He's doing great.
not_available I can't get him to tell me his name.
not_available He's not a talker.
not_available The police haven't come up with anything yet.
not_available How can you not know where your child is? Labs came back.
not_available He tested positive for opiates.
not_available Great.
not_available Drugs lying around the house.
not_available I mean, if he was crying a lot, maybe they gave him something to quiet him down.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'll look in on him later, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available He's all right now.
not_available But there's still something inside of him.
not_available I just don't know what.
not_available Well, he has an infection.
not_available Cellulitis.
not_available No, that's not it.
not_available So anyway, have you started thinking about names? That's the hard part.
not_available Everybody's got an opinion.
not_available You are in a family way? As my grandmother used to say.
not_available How could you tell? Like I said, I'm sensitive to what's going on with people.
not_available Like that gentleman over there, I'm sad to say has leukemia.
not_available You could have looked at his chart.
not_available That's right.
not_available I could have.
not_available The odd thing is, I can't tell if you're having a boy or a girl.
not_available Oh, well, I'm just beginning my second trimester, so No.
not_available I can usually tell long before that.
not_available So you've had this gift your whole life? Well, it doesn't seem like much of a gift when I see a gentleman like that.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available Carla.
not_available I'm sorry I'm late.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm glad you called.

not_available But I know you know the more anybody works with him the quicker he's gonna learn.
not_available So it's okay.
not_available Peter Roger and I got married last weekend.
not_available Wow! There's a lot you haven't told me.
not_available His company is transferring him to Germany.
not_available Hamburg.
not_available I'm gonna sell the restaurant.
not_available And we're going.
not_available And I'm taking Reece with us.
not_available Carla, what are you? We're not gonna even have this conversation.
not_available There's no way I'll let that happen.
not_available He'll have to be with one of us, and I'm his mother.
not_available This will happen! Do you have a minute? 
not_available You wanted to talk.
not_available I've moved Mr.
not_available Bengossi and Sarah into Exam 4.
not_available That's what you wanted to talk about? No time like the present.
not_available All right.
not_available I want to talk about, you know what's been going on between us lately.
not_available Something been going on? Come on, we'll talk in here.
not_available It's no big deal or anything.
not_available It's just that Carol? 
not_available Damn! I thought I locked that door.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available An ultrasound.
not_available On yourself? 
not_available Yes, Mark.
not_available My doctor's appointment canceled, and no one was using the equipment.
not_available Well, why don't you let us do it? 
not_available Lf you must.
not_available Let me get it.
not_available Is it too early to tell if it's a girl or a boy? It's never too early to be inaccurate.
not_available There's the heartbeat.
not_available Any turtle sign? Looking.
not_available Okay.
not_available There's the Mark? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available What? Mark, what? Heartbeat.
not_available Yes, Mark.
not_available Elizabeth already said that.
not_available What? What he means is, there's another heartbeat.
not_available Twins? What's up with Malik? He's got a big grin.
not_available He knows nothing.
not_available I mean, he's just a naturally happy person.
not_available That's Malik.
not_available Downright inspiring.
not_available And infectious.
not_available I'm happy too.
not_available Could somebody please tell me what the hell's going on with these phones? Dr.
not_available Romano instituted a code system so people don't make so many personal calls.
not_available A code system? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available IKid ditched school only to ride his bike into a bus.
not_available Life is not fair.
not_available Lucy? X
not_available ray shows a fractured ankle.

not_available Carol, did you? Did you notice this before? Here.
not_available Looks like a scar from surgery.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We're just looking you over.
not_available Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's just look you over.
not_available He's got a shunt.
not_available From the ventricles in his brain to his peritoneum.
not_available He was probably born with hydrocephalus.
not_available What's a shunt? It's like a small tube that runs through the body.
not_available It drains excess fluid.
not_available That must be what I've been feeling inside him then.
not_available Carol, please.
not_available Would you? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's no problem.
not_available Mystery solved.
not_available He could have a shunt infection.
not_available We need to do a tap.
not_available Go byebye? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You want to go byebye, don't you? Where's the officer? The cop? 
not_available Another unit took him to Mercy.

not_available Agonal rhythm on the scope.
not_available I'm checking on an officer Lucy, I'll show you how to put in an atrial line.
not_available Thoracotomy tray.
not_available Sorry to barge in.
not_available Lucy, I got a call from Psych.
not_available You were to see a kid 20 minutes ago? 
not_available Seth Willows.
not_available You'd better go.
not_available They said Mercy.
not_available Please check again.
not_available Asystole on the monitor! 
not_available I'll take over bagging.
not_available Squeeze in that O
not_available neg as fast as you can.
not_available Rib spreader.
not_available I need suction.

not_available Second shot transected the ascending aorta.
not_available Two units in.
not_available Still asystole.
not_available That's it.
not_available There's nothing we can do here.
not_available I'm calling it.
not_available Time of death, 1509.
not_available Reggie! He didn't make it? Not even close.
not_available We heard that an officer was shot.
not_available Bullet grazed his shoulder.
not_available He'll be okay.
not_available Well, it could've been much worse.
not_available Carter, let's go talk about your student.
not_available So it was you who shot him? Hey, Seth.
not_available I'm so sorry I'm late.
not_available A trauma came into the ER and I got delayed.
not_available Okay, that's not true.
not_available I forgot.
not_available And I'm really sorry.
not_available Seth? Seth? 
not_available What?! What?! What?! What?! What?! Please! Can we just talk about this? I don't feel like talking right now.
not_available I know you're angry.
not_available You have every right to be.
not_available I do need to get on there soon.
not_available In a minute, Jer.
not_available Don't we have a lostandnowit'sours box? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Right here.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available The police find anything on the boy? I hear he has a shunt.
not_available No.
not_available I'm emailing his info and photo to all board
not_available certified neurosurgeons.
not_available All of them? There's only 380 that specialize in pediatrics.
not_available Hopefully, someone will recognize him.
not_available Three hundred and eighty? Which one are you on? You ready to take a break? I wish.
not_available I've got a vegetectomy and a valvuloplasty with Romano.
not_available How are you taking the news? 
not_available I'm in denial, but thanks for asking.
not_available Mark, what are you doing? I have a woman who has arthritis.
not_available I had to cut her wedding ring off.
not_available I glued it back together and I'm putting it on a chain so she can still wear it.
not_available That's very sweet.
not_available I thought she'd like it.
not_available I'll catch you later.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Mark, what's that movie called where all the people turn into some kind of a pod? What? His life was in his own hands, not yours.
not_available There must've been 20 cops out there.
not_available I don't know.
not_available My patrol car was closest? It was just random, I guess.
not_available Well, I don't think I believe in "random" anymore.
not_available When I told you that I was seeing someone else that wasn't the complete truth.
not_available I had just found out that I have hepatitis C.
not_available I'm responding to medication.
not_available It's under control.
not_available You didn't think I could handle that? I couldn't handle it.
not_available I kept thinking, "Why me? Why this on top of everything else?" But after a while, I came to see that I wasn't sick.
not_available I was healed.
not_available I don't think I'm getting this.
not_available God kept throwing things at me until I realized it's not about what happens to us.
not_available It's about how we deal with what happens to us.
not_available We have choices.
not_available Our lives are in our own hands.
not_available So you think what happened was some kind of message for me? Maybe what happened today didn't happen to you.
not_available Maybe it happened "for" you.
not_available Yeah, I understand what you're saying.
not_available I'm not sure it makes me feel any better.
not_available Sitting here feels pretty good.
not_available Yeah, it does.
not_available You're awfully quiet, Peter.
not_available Bad mood? Just working.
not_available A surgeon's nimble fingers toiling away.
not_available Suction, please.
not_available I know you didn't expect to assist today.
not_available Hope you don't mind.
not_available Of course not.
not_available This might well be Dr.
not_available Benton's last cardiothoracic surgery.
not_available Vegetation removed.
not_available 6
not_available O Prolene.
not_available It's a shame you can't use all that hard
not_available earned knowledge while you're doing trauma scut.
not_available Lizzie, you've actually been spared.
not_available Peter was chosen fairly.
not_available I've made my peace.
not_available An excellent attitude.
not_available Which is why we should keep you on here at County.
not_available Either with cardiothoracic or something else.
not_available That's something you're still thinking about, and you should.
not_available After all that's what any good candidate would do.
not_available Someone's calling about that little boy.
not_available Chuny, can you stay with him? I need you to look at that patient.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Antoine, the same kid jump you again? 
not_available No.
not_available Was it somebody else from school? 
not_available It's the same dude.
not_available I jumped him.
not_available The kid from this morning? You went after him? He took my wallet, man! I can't be letting that go down.
not_available Why not? What did you lose? Ten, 15 bucks? He sounds like my mom.
not_available BP's 128/74.
not_available Pulse 96.
not_available Got any pain in your belly? Get hit in the stomach? No, he only got me in the face.
not_available Colles with dorsal angulation.
not_available He'll need a closed reduction.
not_available What's that? 
not_available You broke your left wrist.
not_available Can you feel this? Yeah.
not_available What kind of sutures do you want? 5O Vicryl, 6
not_available O nylon.
not_available I gotta have stitches? Fifth metacarpal fracture with rotational deformity.
not_available You broke both your hands.
not_available Let's get an orbital series.
not_available Call Ortho because that one's gonna have to be pinned in the O.R.
not_available I gotta have an operation? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Well, you wanted to blow off your interview.
not_available I can go in a few days.
not_available You're not getting into any summer science lab.
not_available Not now.
not_available You have to go to surgery, have a pin put into your right hand.
not_available You'll get a cast that goes from elbow to fingers.
not_available I can still go to class.
not_available It's a hands
not_available on program.
not_available You won't have use of your hands.
not_available You won't be able to dress yourself tie your own shoe or blow your own nose for the next six weeks.
not_available Well, it's not your problem.
not_available No?! I'm the one that's spent time showing you around for the last month, trying to teach you something.
not_available So you can go and screw it up by having to go beat down some punk.
not_available You don't know! 
not_available I know it dragged you away from the best opportunity you've ever had.
not_available No one gave me anything.
not_available I earned that chance myself! You just blew it, all by yourself.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter! 
not_available Yes, Chuny? Don't forget to call Ortho.
not_available Jerry, any word on the kid? 
not_available Just one call for Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available It was the grocer I met this morning.
not_available He called to see what had happened.
not_available Labs came back.
not_available The shunt's not causing the infection.
not_available Maybe it's the cellulitis.
not_available Do you think his parents left him because of the shunt? What? 
not_available I mean, you know, because he wasn't normal.
not_available Something was wrong with him.
not_available I hate to think so, but anything's possible.
not_available I'm gonna go check on him.
not_available Seth, we'll see you next week.
not_available Is your mom here? She's my foster mom.
not_available Okay, see you.
not_available Bye, Seth.
not_available I'm sorry I had to call you.
not_available I'm glad you recognized it was over your head.
not_available A lot of students can't admit that.
not_available I really blew it.
not_available A kid like Seth, alcoholic father, been bounced around a lot.
not_available You can expect a lot of setbacks.
not_available I caused this setback.
not_available I was 20 minutes late for our meeting today.
not_available Well, that is something that cannot happen again.
not_available It won't.
not_available I won't let it.
not_available Now from the sublime to the utterly mundane.
not_available But then, the appendectomy is our bread and butter, no? Maybe not, if I do cardiothoracic.
not_available Yeah? So, what do you think? You're a bastard for mentioning it in front of Peter.
not_available He's a big boy.
not_available It was mean.
not_available Well, he was mean to me first.
not_available He led me on to think he wanted cardiothoracic and then took trauma.
not_available It was bad form to speak to one colleague in front of another about a sensitive matter.
not_available Jeez, talk about being sensitive.
not_available Robert.
not_available Donald! How was your Whipple, you lucky dog? 
not_available A long six hours, that's how.
not_available Which is why I couldn't find you earlier.
not_available You initiated this code phone system down in the ER? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available For what purpose? So patients' families can't sneak in calls to Hoboken.
not_available Which is not a big problem.
not_available Want to know what is? Employee personal calls.
not_available This allows us to track outgoing calls.
not_available That way we don't have to wait for the phone bills.
not_available I see.
not_available "Big Brother is watching" kind of thing.
not_available "Monitoring" is a better word.
not_available Have you no respect for those who work here for long hours and not much pay? 
not_available I don't see it that way.
not_available I do.
not_available If you'd be so kind as to take your code phone system and put it where the sun 
not_available Got it.
not_available Good.
not_available Point taken.
not_available That's really exciting.
not_available A new little voice in the world.
not_available Carol hasn't told anyone, so pretend like you don't know.
not_available Okay.
not_available I won't say anything.
not_available Sorry! Oh, man! Carter 
not_available Look! I'm sorry.
not_available I think it's great that you went off the Ritalin.
not_available I really do.
not_available But I can't hold your hand through this.
not_available I wouldn't ask you to.
not_available I know you're not capable of it.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available You don't like me.
not_available I've never been up to your standards.
not_available I want you to be a better student and to succeed.
not_available That's what you think.
not_available You're the one who wants to succeed as a teacher.
not_available And in order for that to happen I would have to be the perfect reflection of you.
not_available I have a patient.
not_available I'm dropping these off for Dr.
not_available Weintraub.
not_available Peter, I think Rocket was a complete ass for doing what he did in the O.R.
not_available He can do whatever he wants.
not_available Well, not entirely, but It doesn't matter, Elizabeth.
not_available Cardiothoracic, trauma.
not_available I don't care about any of it anymore.
not_available Hang on.
not_available What do you mean? Carla came to see me today.
not_available She married Roger.
not_available She wants to take Reece and move to Germany.
not_available Something about Roger's job.
not_available Well, she can't.
not_available I mean, legally she can't do that, can she? Yeah, well, she won't get the chance to.
not_available Hey, Carol? This fax just came in for you.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available By the way, I know you know.
not_available IKnow what? I know nothing.
not_available I'm a complete walking lack of information.
not_available Oh, man! Carol, it's for you.
not_available This is Carol Hathaway.
not_available Yeah! You're doing so much better, huh? IKind of a big day.
not_available You want some juice? I got some apple juice here.
not_available My name is IKerry.
not_available Can you tell me your name? Jack.
not_available Jack Toberen.
not_available So that's your name, little guy? Jack? Wow! What a great name, Jack, huh? You got a response? 
not_available A pediatric neurosurgeon.
not_available He recognized the photo.
not_available He put the shunt in.
not_available He saw Jack about two months ago.
not_available He called the parents.
not_available They coming in? Oh, yeah, in a big hurry.
not_available I just spoke to the mother on the phone.
not_available Jack was kidnapped three weeks ago.
not_available What? Unreal, huh? By the nanny and the drugged
not_available out boyfriend.
not_available They must've been the ones who abandoned him.
not_available I guess so.
not_available There you go.
not_available The police are on their way in.
not_available So now we know who you are, Jack.
not_available Your mom and dad are coming in, and you get to go home.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Lizette.
not_available Carla won't be home until 7:30.
not_available Actually, it might even be later.
not_available Maybe not until 10.
not_available Hey, man! 
not_available She didn't tell me she'd be late.
not_available I told her I'd tell you.
not_available I don't have to take Reece.
not_available Carla was sure you would have plans tonight.
not_available I was planning to go to the Quartz Lounge.
not_available I've been seeing this trumpet player.
not_available Oh, a musician, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You'd better watch yourself.
not_available Say "bye," Reece.
not_available Bye, Reece.
not_available Say "bye." Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available So is your mom more or less pissed off than I imagine she is? More or less than you? That's fair.
not_available She acts like I'll never play the violin again.
not_available That's pretty funny.
not_available I heard it in a stupid TV movie.
not_available Why are you watching TV when you got homework? Oh, man! You are my mom.
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available I think I want the best for you.
not_available I suspect that she does a better job of appreciating you for who you are.
not_available As long as I grow up to be just like her.
not_available I know that routine.
not_available My family wanted me to grow up to be a rich, white guy.
not_available Damn, they must be dancing! You don't make money in the ER.
not_available They figure they'd settle on two out of three.
not_available I'm sorry I blew the summer thing.
not_available You'll get another chance.
not_available I mean now I'll be spending my time bagging groceries.
not_available Actually, I'm not even sure you'll be doing that.
not_available I'll be here when you get out.
not_available We'll still make it.
not_available This is worth staying for.
not_available Carol! 
not_available Wow, you two look great.
not_available I'll walk out with you.
not_available I have to check on a chart.
not_available Return a phone call.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available Surprise! 
not_available We got you.
not_available She got us.
not_available What are you doing? You haven't told us about the baby 
not_available We couldn't sit on it another minute.
not_available We wanted you to know we're so happy.
not_available We'll get you something better But for now Oh, man! Carol, you need a Lamaze coach? 
not_available You're it, Malik.
not_available This is amazing.
not_available I've just been overwhelmed with this news myself.
not_available Today I found out I'm having twins.
not_available I didn't know when or how to tell people.
not_available And I'm really glad that I can share this with you now.
not_available So thank you.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Congratulations! You've reached Peter.
not_available Please leave a message after the tone.
not_available Peter, are you there? Is Reece there with you? Peter? Peter, what are you doing? You know darn well Reece is supposed to be here tonight.
not_available If you're there, please pick up.
not_available So we missed the boat.
not_available Oh, well, cruises are overrated anyway.
not_available Shall we? So, what's been going on? The thing is, I'm not exactly sure what has been going on.
not_available What do you mean? Look, Peter and I jumped into something rather quickly.
not_available And when it wasn't working, we both jumped out.
not_available Is it still unresolved? No, no, no.
not_available It is.
not_available The thing is, you and I have been seeing a lot of each other.
not_available And it's been great.
not_available But it's not anything that I was looking for.
not_available And it's caught me off balance, rather, which I'm not used to.
not_available It makes me rather nervous.
not_available Elizabeth, I don't I don't know what's going to happen.
not_available But I do know how I feel.
not_available And I feel like I've found something amazing.
not_available And I want to be here.
not_available I want to get to know you and not be scared.
not_available I would hate to miss another boat.
