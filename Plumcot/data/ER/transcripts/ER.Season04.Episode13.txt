not_available " I've been meaning to talk to her about it.
not_available Would I look good in that cut? Honestly? No.
not_available What is the best approach with Weaver? Contrition, indignation? 
not_available Begging.
not_available I think I would just appeal to her innate sense of fairness.
not_available She has a sense of fairness? Remind her you've been on nights for 
not_available Four months.
not_available and that you think your exemplary work history and your years of loyal service, marred by only one incident Blowing up the ambulance bay.

not_available Time of death? Son of a bitch! Don.
not_available Good morning, Kerry.
not_available Morning.
not_available You're in early.
not_available I was anxious to hear the outcome of last night's SPG vote.
not_available After careful consideration and due in no small part to your glowing recommendation the board will begin negotiations with SPG for an emergency department management contract.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available You have placed me in a very awkward position, Kerry.
not_available I went to the board at your urging.
not_available Any misgivings you had about SPG should've been aired weeks ago.
not_available If we reverse our position now we are going to look very foolish indeed.
not_available I take it you have misgivings.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available The board was anxious to know if the senior ER staff was supportive of the idea.
not_available You assured me they were.
not_available If you were incorrect in that assessment and wish to admit that before the board that might carry some weight.
not_available You want me to fall on my sword in front of the board of directors.
not_available It is your sword, Kerry.
not_available So my lease is up February 1 stAre you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks, Mark.
not_available Jerry, get some mud mats here before someone slips and kills themselves.

not_available Yeah, all those sick people sitting at home waiting to rush in and ruin our perfectly good slow day.

not_available Jerry, get mud mats down before somebody slips and kills themselves.
not_available Can I talk to you a little later? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available How much is your rent? raise it to $500.

not_available Nothing.
not_available Randi called.
not_available She's snowed in.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, can I talk to you for a minute? I've been working nights for months now.
not_available And while I appreciate that the accidental damage that I inflicted on the ER cannot be dismissed as inconsequential nor insignificant I do, however, believe that my eight years of loyal service along with my sterling attendance record and my seniority all demand that I get my old day shift back.
not_available Is that it? I'm also appealing to your innate sense of fairness.
not_available Can you work Randi's shift today? Pull a double? I'd love to.
not_available Fine.
not_available You're on days again.

not_available He went over to Doc's a while ago.

not_available He just keeps giving me these mixed signals.
not_available Well, I meanWe haveHave you
not_available ? Have you talked to him? Yeah, I talk about it to him lots of times, but he just avoids it.
not_available We usually end up having sex instead, though.
not_available Is it me? Does he think that maybe I'm not good enough for him? Is that it? Or is he just? Is he just scared because he cares so much? Okay, let's bag her.
not_available Babinski's down
not_available going.
not_available Pulse ox is coming up.
not_available X
not_available rays.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available It's getting crowded in here.

not_available Send a blood gas from CT.
not_available And repeat a chest x
not_available ray when she gets back here.
not_available How's she doing? Well, her vitals are normal.
not_available They put her hip back in.

not_available Dr.

not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available See you later.
not_available Doug.
not_available Doug, come on.
not_available Is that the guy? We were talking.
not_available He was upset.
not_available Another elderly rape victim came in.
not_available I was trying to calm him down.
not_available Was that the guy? Yes.
not_available That's the guy.
not_available But I'm not seeing him or anything.
not_available You can't commit, fine.
not_available You want to screw firemen, fine.
not_available Don't humiliate me in front of my friends.
not_available Humiliate you? What about the surgical tech in the oncall room? The Pedes nurse? 
not_available Ancient history.
not_available How about the drug rep with fake breasts and big hair? 
not_available Ancient history.
not_available I'd have to do the entire Bulls lineup before I equaled you.
not_available Is this about getting even for things I did a long time ago? This is about me needing some time and you being pissed that things aren't working out as planned.
not_available I have spent years, years of my life changing to fit your needs, working around your schedules your insecurities, your inabilities to commit.
not_available Well, you know what? It's not all about you.
not_available I know that may come as a shock.
not_available But a relationship is give and take.
not_available Two people as equals, and right now I need something.
not_available So you can grow up and accept it, or you can go on being the same self
not_available centered bastard you've always been and refuse to give me the one thing I've ever asked you for.
not_available Mark, we're precariously short of blood.
not_available I'm gonna ask the staff to volunteer, rotate our people upstairs to donate.
not_available We don't have many patients anyway.
not_available Sounds smart.
not_available The board voted yesterday to begin negotiations with Synergix to take over management of the ER.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available It's what you wanted, right? Yes and no.
not_available I've had disturbing reports from other hospitals about their cross
not_available control techniques.
not_available Did you talk to Anspaugh? He felt that if all the ER Attendings opposed the decision that would help scuttle the deal.
not_available But won't that make us look ridiculous? We recommended it.
not_available But the heat doesn't fall on any one person if we all go to the board together.
not_available I've started contacting the other Attendings.
not_available And I was hoping that I could count on your support.
not_available Show me the statistics and I'll let you know.
not_available Great, thanks.
not_available Mark, cops caught that rapist.
not_available GSW to the chest.
not_available Paramedics are bringing him.
not_available Here? 
not_available That's what they said.
not_available Tell them we don't want him.
not_available Let Mercy take him.
not_available Or Rush.
not_available Malik, prep Trauma 2 and alert Surgery.
not_available Come on, people.
not_available There's no evidence of penetration.
not_available Thank God for small favors.
not_available Who does something like this? I don't know.
not_available I hope they find the guy that did this.
not_available They should shoot him and toss his body in the dumpster.
not_available How's it going? Great.
not_available Really? Cynthia cried on my shoulder for an hour.
not_available What's that all about? 
not_available Her lease is up.
not_available You want my opinion? 
not_available Not particularly.
not_available Fine.
not_available How's Carol? She talk to you about it? About what? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available We have a nasty MVA on the Kennedy.
not_available And a family in a minivan hit an overpass.
not_available And that rapist is here.
not_available You should talk.
not_available Two IVs in no pulse, large
not_available caliber GSW to the chest.
not_available Multiple contusions, canine bites and open fracture to the left femur.
not_available Damn! He's just a kid.
not_available Nineteen.
not_available Name is Jack Miller.
not_available We'll leave him on the paramedic gurney.
not_available Who's up? Carter.
not_available No breath sounds.
not_available The rapist? 
not_available One of you get him? He was hiding.
not_available The dogs found him.
not_available Too bad they called the dogs off.
not_available Another 20 minutes would've saved us the trouble.
not_available Got a rhythm.
not_available Should I set up another drip? 
not_available Nope.
not_available What's going on, Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available PEA.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's the differential? Hypovolemia, hypoxia, tension pneumo pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, tamponade.
not_available How's the old lady? 
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available Chuny? 
not_available Bradycardic, 48.
not_available What do you want to do? 
not_available Let the bastard die.
not_available Like every other patient, he gets our best effort.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Amp of epi, IV push and a milligram of atropine.
not_available You heard him.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What about an airway? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He needs one.
not_available Let's put one in.
not_available Mark, that MVA is here.
not_available The mother's in trouble.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Malik, you're with me.
not_available Thank God! Call me if you need anything.
not_available She threw up last night.
not_available No.
not_available Only a little bit.
not_available I ate some Saltines like my sister told me to.
not_available That usually works.
not_available Do you throw up often? I always eat the Saltines and then it goes away.
not_available Last night she ate a whole thing of Cherry Garcia.
not_available Cherry Garcia is my favorite too.
not_available Are you having them again? Have you had these pains before? Sometimes I hurt a little bit, but it goes away.
not_available They just keep coming back.
not_available Coming back how often? When? How many? Eight? During Kathie Lee about eight or nine times.
not_available Okay.
not_available I want you to just lie back and I'm gonna take a quick look.
not_available Am I okay? 
not_available You just relax.
not_available Legs apart.
not_available Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available She's seven centimeters.
not_available I'll get the fetal monitor.
not_available Just keep breathing.
not_available Weak pulse.
not_available No breath sounds on the left.
not_available Neck veins are dilated.
not_available Tension pneumo? 
not_available Sounds about right.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Central line.
not_available He'll need volume.
not_available The victim's coming to.
not_available You guys want to talk to her? Damn it! He's losing a lot of blood here.
not_available You want me to go get Mark? 
not_available Nope.
not_available He's bleeding out.
not_available He's already lost a liter.
not_available He needs blood.
not_available How many units Oneg do we have? 
not_available This is it.
not_available Four units.
not_available Let's autotransfuse him.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Use his own blood? 
not_available Hook up the cell saver.
not_available He needs a transfusion.
not_available He'll get one.
not_available There's not enough.
not_available It's all over the floor.
not_available This'll be fine.
not_available He needs blood.
not_available And he'll get it! Hook it up to the central line.
not_available Wide open.
not_available Shooting.
not_available AP pelvis next.
not_available Call me when you're ready.
not_available I'll be next door.
not_available How's he doing? He has a massive hemothorax from the gunshot wound.
not_available Possibly to the pulmonary artery.
not_available We autotransfused him from the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available BP's at 80 palp.
not_available No kidding, you autotransfused? Alerted the O.R.
not_available I think he's stable enough to travel.
not_available Then let's send him up.
not_available Anna, you coming? 
not_available No.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Carter's got it.
not_available Overweight 62year
not_available old shoveling 2 feet of wet snow.
not_available I wonder why he's having an Ml.
not_available Word is you're mustering opposition to SPG among the ER Attendings.
not_available I have to do what is right.
not_available The board approved the deal.
not_available Maybe they can be dissuaded.
not_available Come back here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Now, I've put months of work into this already.
not_available You should've addressed concerns weeks ago.
not_available You should've been more forthcoming about your cost
not_available containment strategies.
not_available We're a public company.
not_available Whatever we do is spelled out in our literature.
not_available Did you read that? I couldn't find it in all the rosy profit predictions and glossy photos of satisfied patients.
not_available You're the one that wants to turn this ER into a cost
not_available effective operation.
not_available You couldn't anticipate what would be needed to make it profitable? I'm willing to make hard choices, Ellis.
not_available I'm not willing to endanger patients.
not_available You're questioning my ethics as a physician? I'm not sure.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Hang on, Carol.
not_available You used me.
not_available That's what we've been about.
not_available You used me to get this deal.
not_available I don't like being used! You underestimated me once.
not_available And you were right to.
not_available But don't underestimate me again.
not_available I'll see you at the board.
not_available Are you okay? The patient, Carol.
not_available Seven centimeters dilated.
not_available Fully effaced.
not_available Get her up to OB.
not_available She won't go.
not_available She's scared they'll take her baby away.
not_available What? She's retarded.
not_available She wants to leave.
not_available I treated her at the clinic.
not_available I think she'll stay if we keep her down here.
not_available I'm going home.
not_available You can't go home.
not_available You're having a baby.
not_available Robert, where are my shoes? Mary, hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Where are you going? Mary, sit down here and let Dr.
not_available Weaver examine you, okay? If you go home it could be very bad for your baby.
not_available You love your baby and you don't want anything bad to happen, right? So let me look, and we can talk about what we should do.
not_available Please? For your baby? Good.
not_available Jeanie, let's
not_available Here we go.
not_available get her on a fetal monitor.
not_available And that's so we can check your baby's heart.
not_available Is it a boy or a girl? 
not_available A girl.
not_available How exciting.
not_available And why are you afraid to go upstairs to have your baby? They'll take her.
not_available Why will they take her? That's what Judy said.
not_available Who's Judy? 
not_available Her sister.
not_available Nine centimeters.
not_available Do you live with your sister? 
not_available No.
not_available We live at 5214 East Chestnut.
not_available We don't take babies with such nice parents.
not_available So why don't you stay here with us? And we'll make sure everything's going okay.
not_available When did it stop snowing? I didn't know that it had.
not_available Only the finest culinary offerings from the 3rd floor vending machine.
not_available Tuna or cheese? I didn't know if you were a truly fanatical vegan or whether seafood's allowed to pass your lips every so often.
not_available Cheese, please.
not_available A true believer.
not_available I must say I do enjoy a good hunk of rare meat every so often.
not_available How long's it been since you've had something really juicy? I don't know.
not_available Six years.
not_available I thought as much.
not_available Egg? 
not_available No.
not_available Pity.
not_available No.
not_available I eat eggs.
not_available I just I just I've had a thought.
not_available I have no family here.
not_available No ties.
not_available No time.
not_available You have the baby, but not much else.
not_available And with our schedules, it makes it almost impossible to date or even really meet someone much less anything approaching a real relationship.
not_available So I was thinking.
not_available We're both adults attractive we enjoy each other.
not_available Why not? I won't disappoint.
not_available I've made you blush.
not_available I don't think I'd be comfortable with that.
not_available That's a pity.
not_available I heard the rapist made it.
not_available Good job, Carter.
not_available Anybody seen Doug? I'll need a pediatrician to check out a newborn.
not_available He's up at Pedes.
not_available I'll page him.
not_available I'm around if you can't find him.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You ever get anything to eat? 
not_available I lost my appetite, thanks.
not_available I'm looking for my sister, Mary Cochran.
not_available She's having a baby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Yes, she sure is.
not_available I'm Carol Hathaway.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Is she all right? 
not_available She's doing great.
not_available Not long now.
not_available Can I see her? Sure.
not_available I have to ask her first.
not_available Hi, Mary.
not_available How you doing? I'm back.
not_available She's crowning.
not_available Keep pushing.
not_available Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
not_available Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Now don't push.
not_available This is hard.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available She's ROA.
not_available How you doing, Robert? You're not gonna faint, are you? I'm okay.
not_available Somebody get Robert a chair just in case he feels like sitting down.
not_available Your sister's outside, Mary.
not_available Judy? 
not_available She wants to know if she can come in.
not_available Yes.
not_available Carol, can you give me a hand? 
not_available Yep.
not_available All right, Mary.
not_available Just one more time.
not_available I'm here, honey.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's give it everything you got, okay? One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nineThere she is! 
not_available I see the head! Look at that hair! Oh, wow! Looks like you need someone with pediatric experience.
not_available Oh, look.
not_available She's beautiful.
not_available Okay, Mary, this is just the last little bit.
not_available She's out! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Welcome to the world, Madison.
not_available Is she okay? Yeah, 10 fingers and 10 toes.
not_available Okay, Dad, get in here and cut the cord.
not_available Come on, Robert, you can do it.
not_available There? 
not_available That's the spot there.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available She's so small.
not_available Hello, baby.
not_available Hello, little baby.
not_available Ten units Pitocin IV.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Is the baby okay mentally? Well, it's too soon to tell.
not_available But she seems fine, alert.
not_available There's no reason to think she won't be perfectly normal.
not_available When do the social workers come? They don't.
not_available We don't call Social Services when there are two loving adult parents.
not_available You seem nice, so I hope you won't think me rude.
not_available Do you have the training to assess that? They're doing fine with the baby.
not_available They have their own apartment.
not_available Robert works.
not_available Robert is the janitor at his uncle's muffler repair shop.
not_available They don't drive because they don't read well enough to pass the test.
not_available They have a place, but I do their bills and remind them to do their laundry.
not_available They are sweet, loving people, but they can't care for an infant.
not_available Do you think you're qualified to make that assessment? You know, I wish that I weren't.
not_available I can't tell you how much I wish that I weren't.
not_available Did you get a chance to look over those Synergix reports? 
not_available Not very encouraging.
not_available You're with me? Whatever you think's best.
not_available Would somebody please answer the phone? 
not_available ER.
not_available The board meets next Tuesday.
not_available Can I count on you to be there? If I don't have to speak.
not_available Why isn't anybody answering the phone? Where is Cynthia? Cynthia left hours ago.
not_available She seemed upset.
not_available She left? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jerry? Jerry? Jerry! What? 
not_available Answer the damn phone! The blood's here from O'Hare.
not_available The blood bank's restocked.
not_available I was looking for you upstairs.
not_available I had a hot appendix turn out to be unrefrigerated 3day
not_available old pizza.
not_available Do you have the forms? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Where's Reece? 
not_available In the car.
not_available You left him in the car? He's with a friend.
not_available Dafina? Carla, she better not be smoking.
not_available Peter, did you sign the forms? I'm sorry.
not_available I've been working all day.
not_available I need those forms so Reece can start on Monday.
not_available Monday? 
not_available Yes! Are you gonna sign them? I don't know.
not_available I was checking out other alternatives.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Just forget it.
not_available What? Look, I'm not convinced this is the best thing for the baby.
not_available Thanks for the vote of confidence.
not_available I deserve more than one day to decide.
not_available Fine.
not_available Take a week, a month.
not_available Hell, take six.
not_available Just tell me what's right for my life.
not_available It's not just your decision to make.
not_available Peter.
not_available Wait! Where do you think you're going? To see my son.
not_available He's in the car.
not_available Peter, get back inside.
not_available What? Is Dafina in here smoking again? Come by later.
not_available You can see him then.
not_available Peter Benton, Roger McGrath.
not_available Roger McGrath, Peter Benton.
not_available Roger, will you put Reece in the car seat, please? Peter, I've been meaning to talk to you about this.
not_available He works with Chandra over at the CTA.
not_available He's steady.
not_available I mean, he's smart and Reece loves him.
not_available All in.
not_available You take care now.
not_available If you want to talk about this later, give me a call, okay? Hey, Scoot.
not_available Hey, Chase.
not_available You asked me to drop by today.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Right.
not_available Right.
not_available How are you feeling? I've been better.
not_available Nothing some crank and a half gallon of Stoli's wouldn't fix.
not_available It was a joke.
not_available That's not very funny.
not_available Hang out for a sec.
not_available There's a patient I don't want to miss.
not_available Hey, Anna.
not_available Hi there, Chase.
not_available How are you? Oh, great.
not_available Never better, thanks to you.
not_available Your cousin did all the work.
not_available When do you get off work? I could take you and Anna to dinner.
not_available Actually, I've gotta run.
not_available Maybe some other time.
not_available Take care.
not_available Trouble in paradise? Something like that.
not_available Are you gonna go after her? If you don't, I will.
not_available Have you seen Carol? 
not_available She's down the hall.
not_available A retarded couple had a baby this afternoon.
not_available She's teaching them how to change diapers.
not_available No kidding? A little girl.
not_available Six pounds, seven ounces.
not_available Name's Madison.
not_available Seems fine.
not_available Good for her.
not_available Listen, Cynthia left early.
not_available Chuny said she was upset.
not_available I'm going to talk to her.
not_available I know what I'm doing, Doug.
not_available If you say so.
not_available We saved that rapist today.
not_available Hell of a world, huh? Yeah.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Anna.
not_available Anna! What the hell's the matter with you? Go back inside.
not_available You'll freeze your ass off out here.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available This morning everything was great.
not_available I'm tired.
not_available I was on all night.
not_available Let's just call it a day, okay? Is this about that rapist? 
not_available You know what this is about.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Why didn't you use the blood on hand? 
not_available It's all we had.
not_available So?! We used six units on that guard.
not_available We were short and you didn't even blink.
not_available Why not use the blood on the kid? Autotransfusion was the best course of action.
not_available Oh, please! We could've done a thoracotomy.
not_available We could've pumped in blood on the rapid infuser.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, he lived.
not_available He's in Recovery.
not_available Dumb luck! You are one of the most aggressive physicians I have ever seen in Trauma.
not_available And you autotransfuse him? You didn't want to waste the blood.
not_available You didn't care if he lived or died.
not_available It's my trauma.
not_available It's my call.
not_available Would you do it differently if he wasn't a rapist? Come on.
not_available Every case is different.
not_available Did you withhold treatment from that kid? No.
not_available John, did you withhold treatment? No.
not_available Fancy meeting you here.
not_available Listen you feel like hitting darts? Just darts? Yeah.
not_available Just darts.
not_available I mean, if that's okay.
not_available Don't know what you're missing.
not_available I've got a pretty good idea.
not_available As long as I'm not being unappreciated.
not_available You know, darts usually involves wagering of a rather substantial nature.
not_available All right.
not_available A penny a point.
not_available I'm withdrawing the contract.
not_available I told Anspaugh that Synergix is no longer interested in managing County's ER.
not_available Why'd you do that? I only wanted the contract if it meant working closely with you, Kerry.
not_available Apparently, that's not possible anymore.
not_available You are a smart beautiful, sexy woman.
not_available I don't want you believing that I used you, because I didn't.
not_available And I never underestimated you.
not_available Never once.
not_available You underestimate yourself.
not_available Take care.
not_available So you fold under you fold up and you fold over just like that, okay? Now you try.
not_available Fold up.
not_available Fold over.
not_available That's good.
not_available Try it again.
not_available Looks like they're doing great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So why is it so hard for us? I don't know.
not_available I didn't mean to push.
not_available Take as much time as you need.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available How long you been sitting here? About an hour give or take.
not_available I wanted him to die.
not_available I saw what he did to that old lady and the others before, and I wanted him to die.
not_available I didn't think he should have that blood.
not_available I mean, if somebody'd come in and they really needed it If some little kid had been hit by a car or some guy had been shot if someone like that had died because we wasted the blood on that guy I don't know.
not_available It was my decision.
not_available And I made it.
not_available If he'd died, I don't know how I'd feel.
not_available But I can't say that I'm sorry.
not_available I mean, was it wrong? Anna, are you sure? No.
not_available I'm not sure.
