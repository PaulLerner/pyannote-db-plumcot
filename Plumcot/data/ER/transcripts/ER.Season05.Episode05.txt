Previously on ER That was a great save.
not_available Actually, I meant being your full
not_available time P.A.
not_available Great.
not_available I'd love that.
not_available This is more of a formality than anything else.
not_available For you, but you're my only intern.
not_available I admire your fortitude, taking orders from a weasel like Dale.
not_available Your presentation was everything we expected.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available Everyone thinks you can.
not_available I'll talk to Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I can't start an IV.
not_available I don't know how, never have.
not_available If you ever lie to me again, look for another rotation.
not_available Watch yourself.
not_available Sorry.
not_available She's in active labor.
not_available Water broke in the rig.
not_available Got to play catch.
not_available Jerry, scarfing a little early dinner back there? What? Oh, no.
not_available Good one, Chuny.
not_available Baby, baby! Our motherto
not_available be? Good guess.

not_available You got it.
not_available Dude, the eagle has landed.
not_available Oh, Lydia.
not_available I guess you didn't get my memo.
not_available The p.m.
not_available Shift is not wearing costumes this year.
not_available It scares the patients.
not_available Things have been said about this set of gams, but scary isn't one of them.
not_available It isn't very professional, so if you wouldn't mind changing I actually got some of these little jacko'
not_available lantern pins if you want to signify the holiday.
not_available Fun.
not_available I'm glad my "no costume" memo made it to some people.
not_available This is my costume.
not_available I'm dressed as a total stiff.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, I guess I can make an exception.
not_available Fouryear
not_available old child with puncture wounds.
not_available He's not in Trauma? 
not_available You wanted the children Get me an intubation tray now.
not_available And I want four units of your blood.
not_available What? Come on, this is funny.
not_available You, of all people, should be able to joke.
not_available I didn't think it was appropriate.
not_available Surgilube on every phone in the ER, that's okay? I'm not in charge of the whole ER, just the Pedes ER.
not_available The joke was on you, Doug, not on the Pedes ER.
not_available But that seems to be one and the same.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? 
not_available The memo in my box this morning.
not_available Yeah? I thought it was your Halloween prank.
not_available What's wrong with this? What? Doug.
not_available "All pediatric patients must be seen by Dr.
not_available Ross prior to discharge.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross will conduct a daily review on all pediatric patients." What's wrong with that? It means you sign off on Kerry Weaver's charts? 
not_available Yeah, and Mark.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So you're psyched.
not_available It's time for a change.
not_available Like me.
not_available I was a Transylvanian bat.
not_available All right.
not_available Enough.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Carol, could you come in here? What's up? Coco here claims to be Try for fetal heart tones.

not_available Look in the Lost and Found.
not_available Cervix isn't dilated.
not_available No adnexal masses.
not_available She sure looks pregnant.
not_available I'm having a baby.
not_available I appreciate a normal uterus and two liters of urine in her bladder.
not_available Coco, we'll give you a bedpan.
not_available Can you try and relax and relieve yourself? Shallow breath.
not_available Nature's way.
not_available Want a Foley? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And a urine tox screen.
not_available Call Psych while you're at it.
not_available I can't believe you're wearing that.
not_available It has got itchy.
not_available But it's my first Halloween.
not_available You were here last year.
not_available I was stuck in the O.R.
not_available So no trickortreating apple
not_available bobbing, hayrides.
not_available Hayrides? Isn't that how you celebrate Halloween? Riding in a cart full of hay with your sweetie, under the stars? Elizabeth, there are no hay carts in Chicago.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available Celebrating the night.
not_available Celebrating what? Kids rotting their teeth, getting stomachaches.
not_available People wearing stupid I have a thing against costumes, you know? There must have been someone you wanted to be.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available That's who I wanted to be.
not_available Yes, but as a child.
not_available You must have wanted to be a spaceman or a footballer? Nope.
not_available You really are extraordinary, Peter.
not_available How about a knight in shining armor? 
not_available No.
not_available A cowboy? No.
not_available Listen, let's go to Dempsey's.
not_available They've got great food, and what is that? Swing dancing.
not_available Elizabeth, there you are.
not_available My sigmoid volvulus is red
not_available lined and the labs aren't on the chart.
not_available I checked the computer.
not_available All but the electrolytes.
not_available Checking isn't good enough.
not_available The lab said the specimen was hemolyzed.
not_available I'll call Phlebotomy.
not_available Takes too long.
not_available Redraw yourself and hand
not_available carry it to the lab.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You'll have to wait.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Oh, damn! I needed to save that.
not_available So I can find Dr.
not_available Greene, where? You're gonna have to wait in Chairs.
not_available Okey

not_available Jerry, has the systems guy taken a look at this yet? He looked, but he didn't touch.

not_available Really? You sure? 
not_available No worries.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, Jerry.
not_available Hi.
not_available You can't blow it off? Don't get me wrong.
not_available I would love to attend your shindig but this is a Teamster party.
not_available Your eyes are aglow with disability policies.
not_available It's rare that a policy underwriter has an opportunity with a roomful of drunken manual laborers.
not_available Sounds better than chaperoning a dorm party.
not_available Everybody knows the best part of a bad party is sneaking out.
not_available Preferably not alone.
not_available So I might see you later? Or I'll make it up to you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, hi.
not_available I got the elbow films back on Mr Lucy, can you give us a second, please? Sure.
not_available What did you say? I got the elbow films back on Mr.
not_available Cahan and the CBC and chem panel on Ms.
not_available Nicolara.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Looks good.
not_available I thought about you and realized I left this in my car.
not_available For the party? No.
not_available You should start practicing your IVs.
not_available I have been practicing.
not_available Then this should be old hat.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, good.
not_available These suckers are heavy.
not_available What are these? 
not_available Tomorrow's 
conference "The Acute Abdomen in the Elderly." I pulled an ischemic bowel you had a few months ago.
not_available I was hoping you'd present.
not_available Never done that.
not_available It's great experience if you're serious about being Chief Resident.
not_available Oh, I'm serious.
not_available I look forward to your presentation.
not_available Chief Resident.

not_available Yeah, pretty cool.
not_available Incoming.

not_available Drink every day, Mr.
not_available Chattarowski? Yeah.
not_available But I want to quit.
not_available Are you serious? I'm dead serious.
not_available Not just looking for a place to sleep? 
not_available On my mother's eyes.
not_available Can you admit me for detox, please? I think Miss Knight can help you out with that.
not_available See if you can find him a detox bed.
not_available Then practice on that arm.
not_available Let's transfer him.
not_available Ready? One, two, three.
not_available Average daily census is 150.
not_available We see 275 a day at Bellevue.
not_available Impressive.
not_available We're the second largest emergency department in the world.
not_available I'll show you the trauma rooms.
not_available Hey, Jerry? Who's that? 
not_available With Dr.
not_available Greene? That is Dr.
not_available Litvak from New York.
not_available Dan Litvak? Yeah.
not_available He's here interviewing to be ER Chief.
not_available Oh, my God! Dan Litvak.
not_available He's national chair of the ACEP Panel for Practice Guidelines.
not_available Lead article in last month's annals.
not_available That's good, right? Hey, buddy.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Jared.
not_available Pruritic rash from his makeup.
not_available He's covered with hives.
not_available Has he had hives before? 
not_available No.
not_available All right, any swelling in your mouth? Are you having trouble breathing? 
not_available My tongue feels big.
not_available Okay.
not_available BP's 90/60.
not_available Pulse 72.
not_available Let's give him.2 of sub
not_available q epi, Benadryl 25 IV.
not_available Is he going to be okay? He has a bad allergic reaction.
not_available We'll treat him with IV medication, and watch him for a few hours.
not_available Can I still go trickor
not_available treating? I don't think so, sweetie.
not_available We'll find some fun stuff to do.
not_available Fun stuff around here sucks.
not_available What did you do with my baby? What did you? Where is my baby? Should I ask? Twentytwo
not_available hundred cc's out so far.
not_available Belly's flat.
not_available I lost my baby.
not_available Haldol, five milligrams I.M.
not_available Mark, I'm looking for your charts on last month's unscheduled returns.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I put them in your box.
not_available Kerry, this is Dr.
not_available Dan Litvak.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Kerry Weaver, Interim Chief.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Where are you from, Dr.
not_available Litvak? New York.
not_available Bellevue.
not_available Just here to get a few tips? No, I just had my second interview for the Chief position.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene is being kind enough to show me around.
not_available Second interview? They want to meet with Dr.
not_available Litvak one more time before tonight's vote.
not_available I thought the vote wasn't until next Wednesday.
not_available I have to hop a plane tonight.
not_available They thought it would be best to know beforehand.
not_available That's great.
not_available The sooner the better.
not_available I guess I'll just check my mailbox.
not_available That's the competition, huh? Did you get that detox bed? No one called me back yet.
not_available Got a flash and I am in.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available I'm ready for the real thing.
not_available Let's find out.
not_available I'll talk you through Mr.
not_available Chattarowski.
not_available Okay.
not_available Make sure we don't repeat our last IV fiasco.
not_available Definitely won't happen again.
not_available It was my fault as much as yours.
not_available I wouldn't say that.
not_available I should've supervised you and not let you get to that place.
not_available From now on, we'll just take it one step at a time.
not_available Carter, your drunk eloped.
not_available Chattarowski? Does that mean he left? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Does anyone else need an IV? I've got it.
not_available You wanted to be a superhero.
not_available Tights, cape.
not_available Yeah, wrong.
not_available There was someone, wasn't there? Hey, look who's here.
not_available Byebye, cutie
not_available pie.
not_available Hey, little bee.
not_available Gosh, he's getting so big.
not_available I know.
not_available Eating me out of house and home.
not_available I didn't expect you.
not_available Just left Walt and Jackie's.
not_available The annual blowout? I told Walt he should just put on one of his super
not_available duper fly outfits he wore in the '70s.
not_available That brother thinks polyester's gonna make a comeback.
not_available Speaking of costumes, do you have any film left? Yes.
not_available We should have one with his daddy.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Would you do it? Sure.
not_available Okay, ready? Feeling any better? All right, I guess.
not_available What did you? What did you give me? Haldol, to calm you down.
not_available I can't take that.
not_available It's not good for my baby.
not_available Coco, you don't have a baby.
not_available But I will, really.
not_available I'm in my first trimester.
not_available Coco, you're not pregnant.
not_available You were just retaining urine.
not_available Carol.
not_available You did a pregnancy test, didn't you? I'm starting to wish I had.
not_available I'm schizophrenic and I had been taking respiradone.
not_available But when I found out I was pregnant, I went off the medication so that the baby would be okay.
not_available What will the Haldol do to the baby? If in fact you are pregnant there are reports of limb malformation.
not_available Oh, my God! I'm so sorry, baby.
not_available Aorta's clamped, pericardium's dry.
not_available It looks like the heart is still empty.
not_available Get two more units.
not_available Chest tube's gushing.
not_available It's over two liters.
not_available Could be a hilar injury.
not_available Let's set up for a right
not_available sided thoracotomy.
not_available Move! Ten blade.
not_available We'll do a clamshell.
not_available Call the blood bank for Oneg, and type
not_available specific.
not_available Rib
not_available spreader.
not_available Peter, cut across the sternum.
not_available I need a Lebsche knife.
not_available A what? A Lebsche and a mallet.
not_available Move! Look.
not_available Top drawer by the sink.
not_available What you really need is a sternal saw.
not_available A sternal saw is a tool for the O.R., not the ER.
not_available You know that.
not_available Chest is full of blood.
not_available Vascular clamp, more suction.
not_available All right.
not_available Can you locate the source? Move your hand.
not_available Four units in.
not_available Come on, Peter.
not_available He's losing it faster than we can put it in.
not_available Damn! Type
not_available specific's here.
not_available Hang it on rapid infuser.
not_available I'm almost there.
not_available Looks like right atrium.
not_available Vicryl now! Move! There were faster ways to do that.
not_available I am pregnant.
not_available The test confirmed it.
not_available We don't know if the Haldol affected the fetus.
not_available We'll monitor the pregnancy with ultrasound.
not_available Maybe I shouldn't have a baby.
not_available Because of the Haldol? I didn't even tell my mom, you know? It was like she was so proud that I was in a halfway house.
not_available I thought it would be okay.
not_available I thought I could go off my meds, but I can't, can I? You'll probably have more incidents like this one.
not_available I shouldn't go through with this.
not_available You've been through a lot in a short amount of time.
not_available Maybe you should just wait.
not_available I shouldn't do this.
not_available I shouldn't do this.
not_available Think she'll terminate her pregnancy? That's the impression I got.
not_available Probably be the best for her, and for you.
not_available Yeah, it gets me off the hook.
not_available Do you want to have a drink later? Decompress? I would, but Jen's back in town, and we have to have one of our "talks." It's not your day, Mark.
not_available You can go now, Lucy.
not_available We're caught up around here.
not_available What about the Pedes ER? It's standing room only.
not_available Doug Ross is in the groove, huh? No, you'd probably just slow him down.
not_available Great.
not_available It gives me more time to prepare for the party.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to upset the officer.
not_available Found him back with a bottle of Night Train at Lucky's.
not_available You need a revolving door here.
not_available Well, well, well.
not_available Long time no see, Mr.
not_available Chattarowski.
not_available So you know this guy? Yeah, had him in earlier.
not_available Came in to get detoxed then left before we were finished.
not_available Next time I'll call the cops.
not_available We can take it from here.
not_available You're off anyway.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Curtain Area 2.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chattarowski, I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available This is Nurse Hathaway.
not_available We'd like to welcome you back.
not_available I know I screwed up, doc.
not_available I'm a screwup by nature.
not_available I want to make a clean start.
not_available I really do.
not_available You won't make a very clean start with booze in your hand.
not_available That was my last drink.
not_available I'm not gonna poison myself no more.
not_available I promise.
not_available Other than bloodshot, the eyes look okay.
not_available Lean forward.
not_available I'm gonna get clean and sober, doc.
not_available You gotta be quiet so I can hear your lungs.
not_available BP's 130 palp.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chattarowski, I'm gonna try and get you a detox bed.
not_available But promise me you'll stay.
not_available I promise.
not_available I really do.
not_available I'm gonna get clean and sober.
not_available If you could just scoot over to this bed for me.
not_available You think he'll stay? I was a cynic with Miss Coco and we saw how that worked out.
not_available So karmically, I have to believe this guy.
not_available Okay, Dr.
not_available Karma.
not_available But I'm gonna lock up his clothes so it's harder for him to escape this time.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Amanda, you have to stay still.
not_available It'll only hurt for a second.
not_available No, Daddy! 
not_available I'll give you some stickers.
not_available I don't want stickers, Daddy! Is this really necessary? 
not_available Unfortunately, it is.
not_available We have to take blood to do the test.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available Everything all right? 
not_available Yes, fine.
not_available My little girl's afraid of needles.
not_available Is there a way to test her without all this? Yes, there is.
not_available What have we got? Barbie Kligman, 11 year
not_available old, MVA.
not_available Back
not_available seat passenger with a lap belt.
not_available complains of abdominal pain.
not_available BP 105/70.
not_available Pulse 95.
not_available Let's get a CBC, Chem
not_available 20, type and hold and dip a urine.
not_available Barbie, does your neck hurt? No.
not_available Just my stomach.
not_available Pulse ox is 98 on room air.
not_available Chest is clear.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dale okay with this? Shouldn't be a problem.
not_available Pupils are 5 mm and react to light.
not_available Will she be okay? We're taking care of her.
not_available Pretty good seat
not_available belt contusion.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bowel sounds are absent.
not_available Hemoglobin's 14.1.
not_available Listen, does this hurt? Ow! What? 
not_available She has a bruise that's often associated with small bowel injuries.
not_available We'll do a CAT scan of the belly, but she may need exploratory surgery.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You'll be okay, Barbie.
not_available Mommy and Daddy are here for you, okay? That's all it takes? The machine delivers lidocaine to the skin by iontophoresis.
not_available No needles.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, we meet again.
not_available I thought you had a plane to catch.
not_available Flight delay.
not_available Hanging out here beats watered
not_available down airport cocktails.
not_available Can I play fly on the wall? Dr.
not_available Ross' Pedes room.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hang out.
not_available Here we go, sweetheart.
not_available How are you, Amanda? 
not_available Okay.
not_available You're okay? Now this pad puts your skin to sleep.
not_available You're not gonna feel anything.
not_available Now, close your eyes, sweetheart.
not_available You feel anything? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's amazing.
not_available We tried numbing it with cream but it takes an hour.
not_available This is great.
not_available It really is.
not_available What's it called again? Numby.
not_available We did the phase
not_available three clinical trials at Bellevue.
not_available We've been using it for over a year now.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Nice costume.
not_available I feel kind of lame.
not_available Nobody dressed up.
not_available Well, it's early yet.
not_available People may still show.
not_available The flier said 8.
not_available Remember, these are med students.
not_available They're busy.
not_available Want me to get you some punch? Oh, later.
not_available I gotta pull articles at the library for this conference tomorrow.
not_available Think this party can chaperone itself? 
not_available I'll look after things for you.
not_available Why don't you do that? How old is this girl? 
not_available 11.
not_available What's the glitter on her face? 
not_available She's a princess.
not_available Dale, get a clamp on that.
not_available Babcock, please.
not_available There's a little bleeding around the duodenum.
not_available Let's cauterize and explore the retroperitoneum.
not_available Bovie.
not_available What are you doing for Halloween? 
not_available Nothing special.
not_available I know a motel on Route 22.
not_available Jungle
not_available theme rooms.
not_available Metz.
not_available Ask for room 14.
not_available Hanging vines.
not_available You Tarzan, she Jane.
not_available Know what I mean? I think we'll just stay in town.
not_available The pancreas looks good.
not_available No renal injuries here.
not_available Hold on.
not_available There's infrarenal mass.
not_available Looks like a lumbar node.
not_available Doesn't feel right.
not_available Too rubbery.
not_available There's one on this side too.
not_available Could be lymphoma.
not_available All right, let's send for a biopsy.
not_available Number 15.
not_available Everything okay on the wards? 
not_available Yes.
not_available May I scrub in? 
not_available We could use your help.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available We just biopsied an abnormal lymph node on Barbie.
not_available Why don't you take this specimen to Pathology and wait on the results.
not_available Signed in three more kids.
not_available We're stacked.
not_available We're getting to them.
not_available We need the main ER for the overflow.
not_available I have to see these kids.
not_available You saw Kerry.
not_available It's a busy night, Doug.
not_available You can't see them all by yourself.
not_available Send the overflow to the main ER, but send me the kids' charts.
not_available Of course.
not_available The sickest ones, send them to me.
not_available I wouldn't do it any other way.
not_available What are you doing back so early? Me and Ariel are sick of trickor
not_available treating and Mom's running late.
not_available What are you watching? 
not_available Family Love Triangles.
not_available Educational TV, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mom says when we move to St.
not_available Louis she's only gonna let me watch an hour of television a day.
not_available When you move to St.
not_available Louis? You didn't know? I think that's why Mom wanted to see you.
not_available So it's a done deal then? My room will be twice as big.
not_available And there's a park across the street for the dogs.
not_available Sounds nice.
not_available It's really pretty there.
not_available Please don't tell her I told you, okay? Hey, my lips are sealed.
not_available Repair transversely with running Vicryl 3
not_available 0.
not_available Gentlemen, I have the results of your biopsy.
not_available Guess what we saw under the microscope.
not_available Gotta be Hodgkin's.
not_available No.
not_available Metastatic adeno? 
not_available Wrong again.
not_available Seminiferous tubules.
not_available What? 
not_available You're kidding? You biopsied two testicles.
not_available It seems that Barbie is a boy.
not_available Who knew there were so many texts on the bowel? This is just what I could get my hands on.
not_available I suppose with all this intense interest that means our bowels are in good hands for many years to come, right? That's a nice thought.
not_available Hey, sounds like the party's up and running.
not_available Yeah! Dr.
not_available Carter, the party picked up.
not_available The beers are right there.
not_available Nice aim, dude.
not_available You almost put out the fire with that one.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Thanks, dude.
not_available Okay, kids, that's it.
not_available Party's over.
not_available You can't stay here.
not_available What's up? Were we too loud? 
not_available No, the furniture was too on fire.
not_available Oh, really? I'm sorry.
not_available I'll be in my room studying.
not_available Happy Halloween! She did it to me again.
not_available She's in escrow and I heard about it from Rachel.
not_available Maybe she was gonna tell you tonight? Maybe.
not_available Or maybe she was just going to send me a postcard from St.
not_available Louis.
not_available You really had a good time with Rachel? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available How's Chattarowski's detox search? They're all out of beds on Four East but I stood my ground and insisted that he was a good detox candidate.
not_available They finally gave him a place on Four West.
not_available You must owe them some favors.
not_available A couple.
not_available But it was worth it.
not_available Well, you tried, you know? When we explored the retroperitoneum we discovered two small masses.
not_available Masses? What kind of masses? We were concerned, so we sent down a frozen section of the biopsy that revealed testicular tissue.
not_available What does that mean? Barbie has a condition called testicular feminization.
not_available Genetically, she's a male with XY chromosomes.
not_available During development, the fetal tissue was resistant to testosterone and the external genitalia developed as female.
not_available There's gotta be a mistake.
not_available No mistake.
not_available The vagina's nothing but a blind pouch.
not_available No uterus or ovaries.
not_available She'll need to be on estrogen replacement therapy.
not_available My little girl has testicles? We removed them because of the high incidence of malignant transformation.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I changed her diapers.
not_available I know every inch of her.
not_available She's a boy? The genetics don't matter.
not_available You've raised Barbie as a girl.
not_available It's what she looks like.
not_available It's her identity.
not_available Nothing will change that.
not_available But you have to understand that she'll never menstruate or bear children.
not_available Obviously this has come as a shock.
not_available You'll need time to adjust.
not_available Barbie's recovering.
not_available We'll refer you to a genetic counselor.
not_available They'll help you decide when and how to tell her.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Nice job.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You forgot to mention they'll have to change Barbie's name to Ken.
not_available After the day I've had, just line them up.
not_available Word.
not_available That's how you gotta do it.
not_available Work hard, play hard.
not_available I deserve to play hard.
not_available I had to check all the stool samples for fecal leukocytes, dude.
not_available You think that's bad? My Resident had me give physical exams to these homeless shelter guys.
not_available One had maggots crawling all over an abscess.
not_available At least your Residents acknowledge you.
not_available Mine don't even know I'm here.
not_available I get more respect from this rubber arm.
not_available We might have saved this guy with the saw.
not_available We could've cut the sternum in two seconds instead of chiseling for a minute.
not_available The guy was dead.
not_available A few seconds wouldn't have saved him.
not_available It would've given him a chance.
not_available We are not going to waste time training ER docs on equipment they'll use once a year.
not_available If we had the saw, we could give midline thoracotomies for all penetrating chest traumas.
not_available That's not the standard of care.
not_available The standard of care gives miserable results.
not_available If they arrest in the ambulance, If they arrest in the ER, Midline thoracotomy gives us better exposure to repair cardiac injuries.
not_available If you're so damned interested in this, do a study.
not_available I will.
not_available Good.
not_available I know the guy from Surgery to help you.
not_available Peter? Kerry and I were discussing a study between ER and Surgery.
not_available A study? 
not_available Midline thoracotomy for chest trauma.
not_available Is this because of today? Draw up a proposal with a budget and give it to me in two weeks.
not_available I will.
not_available Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't think ER docs should play with a sternal saw.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Then why support her? I'm not.
not_available She'll spin her wheels, write a proposal and it won't pass the Human Subjects Committee in a million years.
not_available M&amp;M;? 
not_available Oh, no, no.
not_available Listen, I made reservations at Dempsey's for 10.
not_available Peter, I don't know.
not_available I'm pretty swamped.
not_available What? It's Halloween.
not_available Yeah, but Dempsey's isn't really Halloween
not_available y.
not_available No, it'll keep.
not_available Walt, what's up, man? It's me.
not_available Listen, I need to ask you a favor.
not_available See this one? That's the bull rider.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available The cute cowboy.
not_available Dad! Rach, did I hear your order right? You hate rhubarb and walnuts.
not_available I like it now.
not_available Dad makes good pie.
not_available He always did.
not_available Jen, you trying to butter me up? No.
not_available I just remember your mom's famous rhubarb pie recipe.
not_available Sorry you're working with a cold.
not_available Are you holding up? Yeah, it's just my sinuses.
not_available Why don't you go wash your hands? Okay.
not_available St.
not_available Louis, huh? She told you? 
not_available Slipped out.
not_available It's a great job, Mark.
not_available The schools are top
not_available rate and It sounds good.
not_available I was ready for a fight.
not_available I think we've done enough fighting for a lifetime, don't you? Yeah.
not_available In a perfect world we could both spend 365 days a year with her.
not_available But we can't.
not_available St.
not_available Louis isn't very far.
not_available No.
not_available And I'll have holidays and summers.
not_available Spending time with her this summer has made me think about how we've spent way too much time thinking about ourselves.
not_available She told me you guys got along really well.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it was It was a lot of fun.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is it still Halloween? Yes.
not_available You have a few more hours left.
not_available I guess I won't be able to go trickor
not_available treating.
not_available Not this year.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Some day, huh? That's okay.
not_available The best part was making the costume anyway.
not_available Me and my mom made it together.
not_available Do you still have my tiara? Yes.
not_available Yes, right here.
not_available Wait.
not_available Let me do that.
not_available There.
not_available How do I look? Like a beautiful fairy princess.
not_available No! Drink up, Bernie.
not_available Some people cannot hold their liquor! We should mess with his mind.
not_available You mean the hand in the warm water trick? Not on the couch, Lucy.
not_available Come on.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Come on, stop it.
not_available Do you think he's okay? Yeah.
not_available He's just a lightweight, that's all.
not_available He has a strong pulse and he's still breathing.
not_available You've been in the ER way too long.
not_available Let's get this party started right! Willie? Willie? Shaving his head? That would be cruel and unusual.
not_available This is mean.
not_available This is mean! You ain't seen nothing yet.
not_available Even drunk, that should still work.
not_available No.
not_available Stop, stop.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Willie? Willie? 
not_available Willie, wake up! Someone needs to call 911, and go get Carter.
not_available Get real.
not_available If we call Carter, he'll narc.
not_available Willie's in trouble.
not_available We need to do something.
not_available Bernie's right.
not_available We can handle this.
not_available This is not class, this is our friend.
not_available You guys call 911.
not_available I'm gonna go get Carter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Wake up, Dr.
not_available Carter! Wake up! Okay, everybody back off.
not_available Give him some air.
not_available Anybody call 911? 
not_available I did, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Come on, Willie, wake up.
not_available Wake up! A weak pulse, but he's not breathing.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Gross! Can I do anything? What can I do? He vomited.
not_available That's good, right? No, that's bad.
not_available If he vomits and it gets in his lungs, he'll die of aspiration pneumonia.
not_available His parents live in Downers Grove.
not_available Give them a call.
not_available We're up here! Second floor! "X"? What's that? 
not_available It's liquid Ecstasy.
not_available What is that? It's a narcotic.

not_available Branch took some earlier.
not_available I can't leave Willie.

not_available It was clean.
not_available They showed the replay a million times.
not_available It was a joke how offsides they were! 
not_available Dreamer.
not_available Pay up.
not_available That was Lucky Liquor.
not_available A vagrant's best friend? They have a guy in a county patient gown trying to buy beer.
not_available Whatever happened to "No shirt, no shoes, no service"? They'll stall him until someone comes for him but they won't hang on all day.
not_available Tell you what Hey, Grabarsky.
not_available You go and pick this guy up and we're even.
not_available How's that? 
not_available This drunk a friend? No, but he owes me more than you.
not_available Consider him admitted.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available He went to take a shower.
not_available How's Willie? 
not_available Paramedics intubated him.
not_available Liquid Ecstasy.
not_available You'd think med students would know better.
not_available Yeah, you would.
not_available Branch! Branch! Branch, wake up! Let's get him out of here.
not_available He's not moving air.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available I'll start chest compressions.

not_available It's my tambourine! That's a tambourine? Come on, come on, come on.
