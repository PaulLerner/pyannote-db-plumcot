not_available Work equals force times distance.
not_available Work equals one half of m

not_available It's both.
not_available I'm never going to pass.
not_available It's just a midterm.
not_available It's one half of our grade.
not_available You can study all day.
not_available No, William, I have to go to work now.

not_available It's a perfed ulcer.
not_available Dr.
not_available Grady was going to assist, but his wife's gone into labor.
not_available You can't argue with Mother Nature.
not_available I'm not prepped for that.
not_available You could do it in your sleep.
not_available Go ahead, Peter.
not_available John can take over the camera.
not_available Since we're short one Resident, things will be a bit tight.
not_available We have a kind of controlled chaos.
not_available Not that controlled.
not_available We're going to fix that with teamwork and a new schedule.
not_available I've made up a chart to illustrate how it's going to work.
not_available Every doctor has been designated a color.
not_available Green is obviously taken.
not_available Weaver is yellow, Gant red, Sanders orange, Ross is blue.
not_available Doug, you have a problem? 
not_available No, just call me "Mr.
not_available Blue." It'll be up in the Admit area today.
not_available Learn it, know it, do it.
not_available Excellent starting point, Mark.
not_available I'd like to bring up food at the Admit desk.
not_available Someone spilled guava juice on my labs.
not_available No uncovered, free
not_available standing liquids in the Admit area.
not_available Let's get busy.
not_available Did I miss something? It's going to be a long day.
not_available Who drinks guava juice? Mark, wait up! Your chart was nice.
not_available Very colorful.
not_available But "freestanding liquids"? 
not_available Well, if they're spilling liquids You're heart is broken, and you're overreacting.
not_available No, I'm doing my job.
not_available The last few months I've been distracted.
not_available And despite what's going on with Susan, you get the job done.
not_available No, I'm letting Kerry Weaver do my job, and that's going to stop.
not_available I'm the Senior Attending.
not_available It's time for me to take control.

not_available Simple patch closure should do here.
not_available What did I pull you away from? 
not_available Meckel's.
not_available Goodness! Baptism by fire.
not_available I was holding my own.
not_available Still, it's tough, isn't it? What do you mean? You've chosen the most difficult elective.
not_available "Many are called, but few are chosen." Did Keaton say something? 
not_available Retract, please.
not_available I mean, did she say how I was doing? 
not_available Lf you're concerned, ask her.
not_available I'm not concerned.
not_available I'm not perfect, but Keaton knows I could have handled that Meckel's.
not_available "A man's reach should exceed his grasp, else what's a heaven for?" Browning.
not_available Or was it Keats? They're all a bunch of hopheads anyway.

not_available Good.
not_available How late are you on, Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Not late.
not_available Seven.
not_available Big plans? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe just dinner, eating.
not_available I was thinking of Indian food myself.
not_available You've got a problem, Shirley? I'm sure she doesn't.
not_available It's good for the sinuses.
not_available It's the spice.
not_available Hold still, please.
not_available Good.
not_available Maybe I'll order in and rent a movie.
not_available My VCR's broken.
not_available Which is probably why I'm not going to, myself.
not_available Rent a movie, that is.

not_available Medrol, IV.
not_available And let's admit Mr.
not_available Boulet to Medicine.
not_available So when did you get divorced? Separated about a year.
not_available Divorce just came through.
not_available The new float system's working well.
not_available ER and ICU both had some adjustment problems but altogether, things are settling down.
not_available Risk Management is fine.
not_available Incident reports haven't increased.
not_available How long is this floating going to last? Indefinitely.
not_available It's not a band
not_available aid, it's the cure.
not_available It's being negotiated into the contracts? Financial Affairs is pleased, but we must cut nonphysician
not_available related care.
not_available Meaning the nurses? 
not_available Nurses don't generate the revenue.
not_available What about saving lives? 
not_available They don't do that either.
not_available The dean is just talking statistics.
not_available Averages, numbers, whatever.
not_available In the ER, nurses are in trauma situations every day.
not_available It's going to hurt patients if floor nurses set up the wrong lavage kit.
not_available You want a lawsuit over that one? We're here to iron out these problems before your contract's up.
not_available Have you got a suggestion? 
not_available Stop floating them.
not_available ER nurses are not interchangeable.
not_available They work differently, longer and the stakes are higher.
not_available Should they get preferential treatment? You should give the patients nurses trained in handling crisis.
not_available What do we say to Pedes or OB/G YN when they complain? Tell them it's like triage.
not_available Critical cases come first.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available I just treated your husband, Al.
not_available Ex
not_available husband.
not_available I didn't know you had been going through all this.
not_available It's Al who's going through it.
not_available I'm doing what I can to help.
not_available I guess you've been separated for a while.
not_available The marriage was over long before that.
not_available I guess you didn't get tested.
not_available I did, but I was negative.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gant needs this suture kit.
not_available That's a central
not_available line kit.
not_available You're right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When did the chest pains start? 
not_available This morning right after breakfast.
not_available What did you eat? 
not_available Toast with raspberry jam.
not_available Jams can be pretty acidic.
not_available I've had raspberry jam for 40 years.
not_available It doesn't give me heartburn.
not_available I know heartburn.
not_available I'm sure you do.
not_available Get a 12
not_available lead, pulse ox and chest film.
not_available And maybe cardiac enzymes? 
not_available Are you on any medication? Of course I am, I'm 73.
not_available Digoxin for my heart, and Allopurinol for my gout.
not_available Glipizide for diabetes, and Simvastatin for I never can remember this one.
not_available Why am I taking this one? 
not_available High cholesterol.
not_available That one's very important.
not_available Yes, I And Famotidine You got a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What's up? I think we might have a problem with Jeanie Boulet.
not_available This morning I treated her husband Al.
not_available He has AIDS.
not_available Did she mention it to you? Why would she? 
not_available She claims she tested negative.
not_available We'll have to take her word for it.
not_available Doesn't this make you uncomfortable? 
not_available Not especially.
not_available She says she's negative.
not_available What else can we do? I'm surprised at your lack of concern.
not_available It's a lack of alarm, Mark.
not_available There's a difference.
not_available I'm in the tall grass, so I take the 5
not_available iron and I sail that puppy but 2 inches from the cup.
not_available It was poetry.
not_available It was a sonnet.
not_available It was practically a haiku.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available Are we done? Looks good to me.
not_available Thank you, Peter.
not_available What happened to pelvic pain in 2? 
not_available A ruptured ectopic.
not_available She's in surgery.
not_available Why didn't you erase the name? 
not_available I called up the chart on Al Boulet.
not_available He was Kerry Weaver's patient? 
not_available Lf that's what it says.
not_available So the Indian food has a purpose? 
not_available I'm preparing for Pakistan.
not_available Why didn't you tell me sooner? 
not_available I haven't told anyone but Anspaugh.
not_available You're not sleeping with Anspaugh.
not_available Are you? Maybe 
not_available We got it.
not_available We'll take it.
not_available Listen.
not_available It's a great opportunity.
not_available We'll teach surgical techniques to Pakistani surgeons.
not_available We'll help them.
not_available Don't they need help in Indianapolis? 
not_available It's only four months.
not_available Didn't you say six? 
not_available It could be.
not_available Then it can be a year or five.
not_available Next thing you know, you're Mother Teresa.
not_available Did you have long
not_available term plans for us, John? Well You know Neither did I, so why don't we go on having fun for the next few weeks.
not_available Same kind of fun, though, right? 
not_available Yes, the same kind of fun.
not_available I had a patient present with PCP pneumonia and tested positive for HIV six months ago.
not_available I'm worried he didn't tell his wife.
not_available I need to see if she was tested.
not_available Those are private files.
not_available In the case of spousal report, I'm allowed to check.
not_available You're allowed to tell the other spouse, not to look into private files.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available I don't think this guy is telling her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Name? 
not_available Jeanie Boulet.
not_available BOULE
not_available T.
not_available The Re
not_available engineering Committee's a joke.
not_available I should have spent my time studying.
not_available I don't know iodine from cosine.
not_available One is an element that you find in an antiseptic and the other has to do with right angles or hypotenuse.
not_available How did you manage to get through it? 
not_available We could bring one sheet to the exam.
not_available I had all the formulas written on it.
not_available I brought a really big sheet.
not_available Have you seen Weaver? 
not_available What color was she? Never mind.
not_available I've been waiting for two hours, and I have a luncheon in 20 minutes.
not_available We'll be right there, Mrs? 
not_available Murison.
not_available If I don't get my B
not_available 12 shot, I might as well resign from my job.
not_available Gant, can you? Yes! You give Mrs.
not_available Murison a B
not_available 12 shot.
not_available I've got 17 surgical patients, she's not one of them.
not_available I'm sorry, you have to wait.
not_available Natalie, do you get a lot of ear infections? Just give me the amoxicillin.
not_available I have a play date.
not_available You don't need to look! Just give me the antibiotic! Augmentin will be fine, if you're worried about resistance.
not_available You know a lot about a lot of things.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available So you want to tell Nurse Hathaway about Coulomb's Law? That's the law of electrostatics.
not_available The force between two charged particles is proportional to the product of their charges.
not_available And inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
not_available You can't give me another shot? 
not_available You've had two already.
not_available Jeanie? I've got a patient in sickle crisis.
not_available She's in a lot of pain.
not_available Can you evaluate her? She needs more narcotics, maybe an admission.
not_available Right now I need you to cover the Waiting Room.
not_available About 12 people need to be triaged.
not_available I'm going to handle this from here, understand? So what kind of movie do you want to get? I was thinking maybe a comedy.
not_available Or maybe a comedy.
not_available No.
not_available Tonight you're going to participate in a Carter family tradition.
not_available Every year at this time, the intrepid Carter male goes out into the woods.
not_available He picks out a fir tree, and with his Protestant hands, he cuts it down.
not_available We're going to cut down a tree? 
not_available The Carter family Christmas tree.
not_available I don't saw after hours.
not_available Don't worry, that's my job.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available How was the ulcer? 
not_available Fine.
not_available I saw the thyroglossal duct on the board and was hoping to assist.
not_available I haven't done a lot of neck surgery, and since I missed the Meckel's I already called in Wallace to assist.
not_available Is there any possibility of rescheduling, considering? There'll be plenty of other opportunities, Peter.
not_available Carter, don't you have something to do? No, I'm all caught up.
not_available What about postop notes? 
not_available On the charts.
not_available I'm done.
not_available That's it, I'm done.
not_available I'm going to lunch.
not_available Earache in 4.
not_available I'm not going to lunch.
not_available Carter! Otitis media in 4.
not_available Sorry, I beeped him.
not_available You might want to check on your friend Gant.
not_available Surgical admits are piling up.
not_available You've got four patients, he's got 20.
not_available And give him these labs on lung cancer.
not_available You heard I was here? I'm better now, must be the Jell
not_available O.
not_available Why did you tell Dr.
not_available Greene about me? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available How does he know I'm positive? 
not_available I guess he just assumed.
not_available He's not assuming, he knows.
not_available It didn't come from me.
not_available Couldn't you have gone to a different hospital? 
not_available I know the doctors here.
not_available I know the doctors here! Even if they found out, they couldn't fire you, could they? Think about what I'm going through.
not_available This is not just about you.
not_available I know it's not just about me 
not_available Then act like it.
not_available Jeanie! I know how mad you are at me, and you have a right to be.
not_available Living with AIDS, that's nothing, but knowing I gave it to you there's no pill for that.
not_available I just have to face it every day.
not_available Hating me might feel good, but it won't change anything.
not_available It doesn't feel good, Al.
not_available Nothing about this feels good.
not_available I don't see Weaver as yellow, but more in the red family.
not_available Something in burnt sienna.
not_available Lavender is too pastel for Doyle.
not_available She's more like an eggplant.
not_available Are you redecorating my board? 
not_available It's constructive criticism.
not_available Mark, I need to speak with you.
not_available Just a second.
not_available I'll wait outside.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I should ask you the same.
not_available Why is Jeanie checking vital signs? She's not a health risk.
not_available Maybe you know that, but I've never assessed her condition.
not_available Why didn't you tell me you treated her husband? 
not_available You lied to me.
not_available It wasn't your business.
not_available If someone in my ER is HIV
not_available positive, it's my business.
not_available Our ER! You don't know if she's positive.
not_available I checked with Medical Records.
not_available Her confidential file? 
not_available You wouldn't tell me the truth.
not_available Nice try, but there's no excuse for what you did, and you know it.
not_available Hey! I heard you could use a hand, that you're getting buried.
not_available I don't mind, you've bailed me out when I was under.
not_available Benton wants me to pull my weight.
not_available He'll not get another shot at me.
not_available Lower abdominal pain.
not_available Ruled out small bowel obstruction.
not_available We may have a problem in the ER.
not_available I thought you should know about it.
not_available Is this going to give me acid reflux? If so, save it til I'm done.
not_available We may have a worker that's HIV
not_available positive.
not_available I've removed the person from direct patient care.
not_available I hope you didn't say why, or else we'll get sued for discrimination.
not_available No.
not_available What's the hospital policy? 
not_available We'll deal with it not race at it like a herd of buffalo.
not_available First thing I want to do is talk to Legal.
not_available Does Kerry know? That's part of the problem.
not_available Kerry may have known for six months without informing anyone.
not_available Good.
not_available I want you to be equally discreet.
not_available By keeping it to herself, Kerry might have left us open for litigation.
not_available I know that, but right now it's just suspicion.
not_available And please don't correct me if I'm wrong.
not_available I had a dream like this once.
not_available Now it's come true.
not_available We were on a winter nature hike identifying perennials, moss.
not_available One of the boys found a sick bat and brought it to the van and started passing it around.
not_available Did they get scratched or bitten? 
not_available Maybe, we don't know.
not_available Their stories changed when they found out they're going to get a shot.
not_available Let's see if the bat's rabid.
not_available We don't have a bat.
not_available I threw it out the car window.
not_available I'll start some charts.
not_available It was flopping, drooling.
not_available And you panicked.
not_available Yes, I suppose I did.
not_available Anyone seen Randi? 
not_available Went for a sandwich.
not_available This must be a mistake.
not_available "All ER nurses will be exempt from the floatation schedule." What about my honeymoon? 
not_available You must be dreaming, girl.
not_available What did you say to them? No more floating.
not_available You must be kidding! 
not_available No wonder management wanted you.
not_available Paramedics! Got a live one coming in.
not_available Bring these to Doug.
not_available Order a series of RIG and rabies vaccines.
not_available How many? 
not_available Nine.
not_available What happened? 10year
not_available old male.
not_available BP 100 over 70.
not_available Throat pain with bleeding.
not_available He tried to be a sword swallower.
not_available He tried with a carving knife.
not_available Get him into Trauma 1.
not_available Who's covering Surgery? 
not_available Gant, but he's in Radiology.
not_available You have to wait out here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton, I see you have a trisegmentectomy for a heptoblastoma.
not_available No, the child needs a course of pre
not_available op chemo.
not_available It's on the board.
not_available It shouldn't be.
not_available I canceled it.
not_available You were unlucky today, but you've seen a lot in a single rotation.
not_available If I get more experience, I'll be better prepared for the future.
not_available That's not how you should be looking at it.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Focus on what's in front of you.
not_available Your Residency is five years long.
not_available It's a marathon, not a sprint.
not_available I feel crepitation.
not_available He's got subcutaneous air in his neck.
not_available Probably perfed his esophagus.
not_available You want a chest film? 
not_available And a soft tissue neck.
not_available Probable perforation.
not_available Temp's 100.
not_available Get a gram of Unasyn.
not_available Are you going to scope him? 
not_available I wouldn't, he's perfed.
not_available Carol, set up for an endoscopy.
not_available Medica/ Records.
not_available This is Jeanie Boulet.
not_available I'd like to know if anyone inquired about my file today.
not_available Around noon? All right, thank you.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available It's so damned swollen in here.
not_available Can you visualize the cords? What have we got? 
not_available Boy trying to be a sword swallower.
not_available Vitals are stable.
not_available Gave him a gram of Unasyn.
not_available We're trying to see if there's a perf.
not_available Carter, isn't Gant covering the ER? 
not_available Gant's jammed.
not_available I paged Carter.
not_available The kid is slow, and we don't help him by picking up his slack.
not_available The patient is more important.
not_available Carol made the right call.
not_available They're Peter's interns.
not_available It's his decision.
not_available He's perfed his esophagus.
not_available We all knew that one.
not_available Should I drop an NG? 
not_available No, we'll do that in the O.R.
not_available I'll page Dr.
not_available Keaton.
not_available Stay here and help your friend.
not_available All right.
not_available Next time you see a bat, what are you going to do? Leave it alone! Good! Now hop out of the way.
not_available Let's send instructions home with them.
not_available We'll follow up injections on days 3, 7, 14 and 28.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wilbourne, time for your shot.
not_available I barely touched the thing.
not_available Rabies is not to fool around with.
not_available Can we watch? Mark, do you have a minute? I wanted to talk about the memo about floating the nurses.
not_available You have to handle it yourself.
not_available I am handling it.
not_available You want me to put a word in? 
not_available No.
not_available I'd like one 24
not_available hour period where no one complains about their job.
not_available One person could appreciate the fact that they have one.
not_available They agreed to my request and are going to stop floating the nurses.
not_available I thought you might want some good news.
not_available Poor kid.
not_available Trying to swallow a knife.
not_available I've seen worse.
not_available Mobilize the esophagus.
not_available D Ábride the wound.
not_available Okay.
not_available And I'm there.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton.
not_available I need to ask you something.
not_available Suction.
not_available I'm a little concerned about how Carter's doing.
not_available How do you think he's doing? 
not_available He had to scramble this rotation.
not_available We both did, but 
not_available I think he's doing fine.
not_available So do I.
not_available He had a rough bit in the beginning, but he listened.
not_available He learned.
not_available He's very, very good with kids.
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available If that's the way you feel about Carter, tell him.
not_available It's important for the teacher to keep his intern informed.
not_available You think so? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available That way he knows he's on the right track.
not_available It's easy to get discouraged.
not_available I yeah, I agree.
not_available I, yeah, agree.
not_available It looks like snow.
not_available It smells like snow.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available You can smell snow coming.
not_available It smells like burritos.
not_available What are we going to do about Mark? 
not_available Put him on a plane or kill him.
not_available Maybe you should talk to him.
not_available I talked to him once.
not_available To ask him again would be weird.
not_available Oh, you'd be violating the guy code.
not_available Of noncommunication.
not_available Don't you have a test to study for? You can't let him self
not_available destruct.
not_available Let him get it out of his system.
not_available He acts like a jerk, and then he's back.
not_available But will he have any friends left? Didn't you get more morphine? 
not_available He never came back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available I don't remember.
not_available I can't take it.
not_available I know.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available What are you doing in here? Can I speak to you? I'm treating a patient that you've neglected.
not_available Go to the area I've assigned.
not_available So you make the rules? And you break them by going into my file.
not_available I requested that information under the Spousal Report Law.
not_available You wanted to know, and you found out.
not_available It was unethical.
not_available You were lying to me.
not_available I guess the truth is out now.
not_available You should have come to me.
not_available So I could lose my job sooner? So I could have dealt with the situation appropriately.
not_available No, it's better this way.
not_available You know about me, and I know a hell of a lot more about you.
not_available Excuse me, I have to attend to a patient.
not_available It's not the flu.
not_available It's allergies.
not_available I didn't say a thing.
not_available I'm gone.
not_available Break a leg! 
not_available We're going to celebrate.
not_available It's happy hour.
not_available No more floating.
not_available First pitcher of margaritas is on us.
not_available I can't.
not_available I have an appointment.
not_available What can be that important? 
not_available You're our guest of honor.
not_available Hey, are you done? 
not_available Benton just ripped me a new one.
not_available About what? Not being in Trauma for the perfed esophagus.
not_available Why didn't you come and get me? 
not_available They paged me.
not_available I know you're trying to help, but you didn't.
not_available You made it worse.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available The best thing you can do is to leave me alone.
not_available Anything good? 
not_available Just surfing.
not_available Done for the day? 
not_available Almost.
not_available AI, about this afternoon 
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm sorry that I jumped to conclusions.
not_available It's just I get up every morning wondering how it's going to get worse.
not_available What I'm going to do to ruin your life? 
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I do want to blame you.
not_available I know things happen for no good reason.
not_available I see it every day but when it's happening to you, you want it to be somebody's fault.
not_available I haven't told anybody at work.
not_available I still play poker on Tuesdays, shoot hoops on Saturdays.
not_available Some guys I could tell, some I couldn't.
not_available But None of them would treat me the same again.
not_available You don't deserve this.
not_available Neither do you.
not_available What's in store for tonight? Karate class, a couple of laps? Actually, my goal is to stay awake til the 10:00 news.
not_available How's Susan's apartment working? 
not_available I'm never there.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available Today I was What was I today? Vicious, humorless, pain in the ass.
not_available You want to talk? 
not_available I want to sleep.
not_available Nothing's the same.
not_available It's just not fun in there anymore.
not_available It was fun once? 
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available Sometimes I'm up to my ears in administrative problems.
not_available Kerry Weaver and I are constantly butting heads.
not_available The whole staff is lying to me.
not_available I used to think of this as a family.
not_available You've got to remember that my idea of a family is a little screwed up.
not_available It's okay to miss her.
not_available No, it's more than that.
not_available Whatever you do, you should keep it separate.
not_available My mom used to work in an office, and she never put a picture of me out.
not_available She said, "Never confuse where you work with where you live." She didn't work in the ER.
not_available I just shared with you a profound childhood moment.
not_available It's moving, and your mother is a very wise woman.
not_available I can't face another frozen dinner.
not_available Do you want to get a burger? I can't, but if you want to talk, you know where I'll be.
not_available I don't know where you are.
not_available At home after 10.
not_available Alone.

not_available Anspaugh has set a time for Mark and I to discuss hospital policy.
not_available It'll remain confidential.
not_available I don't put much faith in that.
