not_available 6x13 "BE STILL MY HEART" Dad, what are you doing? Going through your mother's record collection.
not_available The one from San Diego with that old turntable, now you can throw it out? She did go through some strange musical phases.
not_available Bless her heart.
not_available The dance phase.
not_available Chacha
not_available cha! Tango.
not_available And the lounge lizard phase, Tom Jones.
not_available I like a good show tune myself.
not_available Remember "Oklahoma! "? "Oklahoma! "? How could I not? You played it for me when I was a kid.

not_available As long as it means no more "chacha
not_available cha.
not_available " 
not_available I gotta shave.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Don't want to be late.
not_available I thought surgeons were supposed to have horrible hours.

not_available We do.
not_available I was up very late.
not_available I see your father's been here.
not_available What? Crown Essential Bouquet.
not_available Over a year ago.
not_available I don't think I've even used it.
not_available Well, I must be off.
not_available What time is your angioplasty? 
not_available What? You mentioned a laser angioplasty.
not_available I thought I would observe.
not_available Why would you want to do that? Well, my work with lasers is so Esoteric? 
not_available Romantic.
not_available Wandering through the atmosphere, watching the stars twinkle.
not_available I thought I'd come and see the practical approach.
not_available I don't think it's even allowed.
not_available I'm sure as associate chief of surgery you could make arrangements.
not_available Anyway, I'll call and check.
not_available Perhaps I'll just drop by.
not_available Wait! Mother, I don't think that's such a good idea! I wanted to get by a pharmacy to pick up some refills on those prescriptions.
not_available I'm not gonna give you any scripts.
not_available I need the Combivent and the Vanceril.
not_available I still got the Theo
not_available Dur.
not_available You have emphysema.
not_available I haven't needed O
not_available 2 for two months.
not_available You haven't seen the doctor in six.
not_available You need to see a pulmonologist.
not_available Damn doctors.
not_available Ask a million questions when all you need is the medicine.
not_available It's not good medicine
not_available For one family member to look after another.
not_available Why have a son for a doctor when he can't give a prescription? 
not_available It's not that I can't.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's just that you won't.
not_available Give these charts to Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available She's off today.
not_available Hold this.

not_available Happy Valentine's Day! 
not_available Thank you.
not_available That is so sweet.
not_available Don't they have Valentine's Day in Croatia? Yes, we do.
not_available We even have these little hearts."Be mine." 
not_available Don't eat them.
not_available "Dear one." 
not_available I gotta get to Radiology.
not_available "Cuttie pie." That's "cutie pie." 
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available I'm Abby Lockheart.
not_available We'll help you.
not_available Could you find that young doctor? He took care of my husband after the fire.
not_available What was his name? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Malucci? 
not_available No.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Yes, that's it.
not_available We'll find him for you.
not_available Do you have a cough, Mrs.
not_available Connelly? 
not_available No.
not_available Pulse is thready.
not_available Any pain in your belly? 
not_available No.
not_available Any aching? I'm 81 years old, dear.
not_available I ache all over.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available There you go.
not_available Any pain when you urinate? 
not_available I seem to go all the time.
not_available We'll run some tests.
not_available BP's 80/50.
not_available I'll find Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's probably urosepsis.
not_available Start her on a liter of saline, send her to CBC, a chem panel blood cultures and a urine culture.
not_available What about antibiotics? Confirm the diagnosis.
not_available I'll see what Carter wants to start her on.
not_available Mark! Hi.
not_available We have to stop meeting like this.
not_available Tell me we're going out to dinner alone.
not_available Valentine's Day? I wouldn't miss it.
not_available Fun morning with your mother? She's threatening to visit me at work.
not_available I'll finally get to meet her.
not_available Don't hold your breath.
not_available This is the woman who didn't even phone me when she got into town.
not_available Remind me again why you invited her to stay with you.
not_available Don't go there or I'll throw you into the snow.
not_available Could you remind me again? I can't believeYou! You asked for it! You asked for it! Paul Sobriki? Watch out! 
not_available Truce.
not_available You promise? 
not_available I promise.
not_available You promise? 
not_available I promise.
not_available Scout's honor? Scout's honor.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Promise? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just the snowballs, I guess, huh? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available So you've got a bad headache? Have you had them before? 
not_available I took aspirin.
not_available Where is the pain? 
not_available It's around my right eye.
not_available Are you nauseated? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Does light bother your eyes? Why don't we find a room and get you checked out? Did you hit your head? Let him answer.
not_available He's my patient.
not_available You weren't around.
not_available I'm here now, okay? 
not_available This collar's pretty tight.
not_available Good morning, one and all.
not_available Who's running this? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen, give me the bullet.
not_available George Hudson, 55, rearended
not_available Complains of mild headache.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hudson, I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Actually, it's Dr.
not_available Hudson.
not_available Did anybody ask Dr.
not_available Hudson what his specialty is? Family medicine.
not_available I'm from Philadelphia.
not_available I'm here a couple days taking a CME course.
not_available I've landed myself some eager Residents.
not_available You have.
not_available They ask the right questions.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available They don't wait to hear the answers.
not_available My apologies.
not_available Let them continue.
not_available You don't mind? 
not_available No, it's kind of amusing.
not_available I was a house officer once myself.
not_available Continue your evaluation.
not_available I'll be back to go over your workup.
not_available Scream if you need me.
not_available June Connelly? You saw her husband a few months ago.
not_available I saw hundreds of patients since then.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available I'm going to see a patient.
not_available This won't take long.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available I have a 23year
not_available old student with right periorbital headache associated with nausea.
not_available No fever, no history of migraines.
not_available This one is classic.
not_available I'm thinking six of Imitrex, subq? 
not_available Sounds good.
not_available You won't examine him? I trust you.
not_available Let me know how he does.
not_available Is that a little more comfortable? 
not_available Yes, thank you.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Connelly.
not_available Yes.
not_available Here you are.
not_available You probably don't remember me.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available How are you feeling? Well, not too bad.
not_available They're taking very good care of me.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available You're in very good hands.
not_available Pressure's up to 85, systolic.
not_available Dipped 4
not_available plus positive for nitrates and leukocytes.
not_available Which antibiotic do you want? 
not_available Amp and gent.
not_available Try 500 milligrams of Levaquin, IV piggyback.
not_available It's oncea
not_available day dosing, a little less nephrotoxic.
not_available Could I talk to you for a second? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Connelly? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll see you later, okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're very welcome.
not_available Bye.
not_available Pressure's low.
not_available She has bacteria in her bloodstream.
not_available We need to get her pressure up using fluids and inotropic support.
not_available Are you sure she wants all that? We should do everything we can.
not_available We'll do what she wants.
not_available That may not include machines and tubes.
not_available In OB, doing everything was pretty much automatic.
not_available This isn't OB.
not_available Talk to her.
not_available Following Lucy's patient? 
not_available She presented it.
not_available If you're gonna supervise, do it more closely.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I was coming to get you.
not_available Name? 
not_available Paul Sobriki.
not_available How are you feeling? My wife doesn't like the diner either, and I 
not_available He suddenly started babbling.
not_available He's puking.
not_available He's altered.
not_available Why didn't you get me? 
not_available I was on my way.
not_available You can meet me there.
not_available Don't tell them.
not_available It could be encephalitis or meningitis.
not_available You should've told me this.
not_available He seemed fine.
not_available And I was coming to get you.
not_available Give him two of Ativan, IV push.
not_available Check his calcium thyroid panel and tox screen.
not_available I'll get an LP kit.
not_available What have we got? 
not_available Insulinoma.
not_available Gretel had seizures.
not_available Gretel? The patient? The workup was negative, except for low blood glucose.
not_available Which suggested an insulin
not_available producing adenoma.
not_available CT showed a nodule in the pancreas.
not_available I hope it's not malignant.
not_available That's very caring of you.
not_available I am capable of that on occasion.
not_available This is one of them.
not_available I want to see herI haven't even
not_available You can finish up later.
not_available She's ready for you, Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available There, Gretel.
not_available There, there.
not_available There, there.
not_available Good girl.
not_available Robert, this is a dog.
not_available Correction.
not_available This is my dog.
not_available Ativan put him right out.
not_available Draw the lidocaine.
not_available One and four for cell count.
not_available Protein and glucose in 2, and Gram's stain and culture in 3.
not_available You got it.
not_available Change over to a 27
not_available gauge needle.
not_available I always do.
not_available Very good.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Hold him! What do I do? Hold him! 
not_available Stop! Paul, relax! It's okay! Just calm down! Calm down! What's in my back? Give him two of Ativan.
not_available Lucy, keep going.
not_available We'll get blood in the spinal fluid.
not_available It's not gonna get any easier.
not_available I feel some resistance.
not_available Just keep advancing.
not_available I'm not getting any fluid.
not_available Do you feel a pop? 
not_available No.
not_available Keep going.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Stop, please.
not_available You're hurting me.
not_available Stop.
not_available Check the stylet.
not_available All right.
not_available We got it.
not_available Great.
not_available Paul, just relax.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Hey, crystal clear.
not_available Good job.
not_available I have my breeds mixed up.
not_available I thought they were wiry little runts, like that Australian silky thing.
not_available No, the Bouvier is robust, squarely built, well
not_available muscled.
not_available A hearty dog, you could say, Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Except for the pancreas.
not_available Lizzie, Alex, how's Gretel's BP? I don't know.
not_available We don't have a dog cuff.
not_available Then start an arterial line and hook her to a monitor.
not_available An arterial line? 
not_available Pretend you're in dog lab.
not_available That's what I'm doing.
not_available Lizzie! It's not proper to be operating on your dog.
not_available I'm chief of staff.
not_available Is that proper enough? Would you have me leave her to some poodle surgeon? Curved Crile to clamp off that bleeder.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hudson has oat cell carcinoma.
not_available We asked him about previous hospitalizations.
not_available Had chemotherapy, now in remission.
not_available Now presents with a mediastinal mass, which is why he's flushed.
not_available Superior Vena Cava Syndrome.
not_available The prognosis
not_available Which is why we should blast him with radiation to shrink the tumor.
not_available Recent literature shows chemotherapy can reduce the tumor in two days.
not_available We should treat him with platinum and VP
not_available 16.
not_available Which does Dr.
not_available Hudson want? Did you even ask him? I was about to, when Malucci
not_available Stop it, both of you.
not_available I'll check in on another patient.
not_available Then I'll see Dr.
not_available Hudson.
not_available I'll present him with his options.
not_available What will we do? You are going to watch me and say nothing.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Pretty darn good here.
not_available Pressure's 100/70.
not_available The fluids are making you feel better.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I think it's this young man here who is making me feel better.
not_available He gave me a Valentine's Day card.
not_available That's very thoughtful of Yosh.
not_available Could we get you anything? 
not_available I am a little thirsty.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll get some ice chips.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm a bit chilly.
not_available Maybe you could help me get my sweater.
not_available Sure.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's down there.
not_available I didn't expect a card this year.
not_available With Barry gone.
not_available I'm sorry about your husband.
not_available He was awfully sweet about these little celebrations and anniversaries and things.
not_available He always remembered.
not_available Some of my lady friends had to remind their husbands.
not_available I had to remind mine he was married.
not_available That's not good.
not_available No.
not_available It definitely wasn't.
not_available Well did you see this pin? Barry gave that to me last year.
not_available I didn't bother to tell him that he had given me the exact same pin the year before.
not_available That was very kind of you.
not_available It's lovely, isn't it? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Yes.
not_available "Be still my heart." That's what Barry would say.
not_available And I I still am.
not_available I tried calling your wife again.
not_available I got the machine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available When she goes shopping with her friends I think she's getting me something for Valentine's Day.
not_available Your spinal tap was negative.
not_available You stuck me for nothing? 
not_available We had to rule out meningitis.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have to go back to the diner.
not_available What diner? 
not_available Where I study.
not_available My books are there.
not_available Do other students study there? 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Usually they go to the library.
not_available We had those muggings.
not_available I read about that.
not_available It could happen again.
not_available Someone tried to mug you? Could've.
not_available It's a long way from where I park, and there are lot of bushes.
not_available I'd like to go soon.
not_available We have to do a CAT scan of your head.
not_available That's an xray, right? Isn't that bad? They shoot radiation through you
not_available It's not enough to do any harm.
not_available CT's ready.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We'll be right there.
not_available I did a hernia on a gorilla once.
not_available Med school.
not_available Dear God! 
not_available Gretel's brother had a hernia.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Hansel? I'm sure you find it amusing that I'd care so much about a dog.
not_available There's so much about you that we don't know, Robert.
not_available What's going on? She's tachycardic.
not_available It's a seizure.
not_available We've lost her IV.
not_available It's making her hypoglycemic.
not_available I can't get the line in.
not_available Get me an amp of 50% glucose! Get out of the way! ET tube's come out.
not_available She's hypoxic.
not_available Tube her again! She's in V
not_available fib.
not_available Get me the paddles.
not_available Stand back.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I said, stand back.
not_available Clear! Superior Vena Cava Syndrome.
not_available That gives me what? A year? Radiation therapy is the standard of care.
not_available No.
not_available Chemotherapy is an option.
not_available It could take two days to resolve your symptoms.
not_available I'm worried the headache could indicate elevated intracranial pressure.
not_available I think it's more likely a product of listening to your Residents argue.
not_available That was a joke.
not_available We can begin the radiation therapy right away.
not_available I had a patient who went with radiation and developed a terrible esophagitis.
not_available Pain, bleeding, couldn't eat for two months.
not_available If I've only got a year, I at least want to be able to eat.
not_available I'll go with the chemotherapy, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available He told the waitress at the diner he was coming here.
not_available Is that where you study? 
not_available We meet at the library.
not_available But the last couple months 
not_available Did something happen? He's gotten so weird.
not_available He's wearing the same clothes.
not_available What about his grades? We went to college together.
not_available He did well.
not_available But he's been cutting classes.
not_available You socialize with him and his wife? 
not_available Not much anymore.
not_available He keeps picking fights with me about nothing.
not_available Keeps accusing me of stealing his parking place.
not_available Stupid stuff like that.
not_available Is it something serious? 
not_available We don't know enough yet.
not_available Should I go in? 
not_available Let him sleep.
not_available You can see him later.
not_available What is it? Pressure's down to 75.
not_available I paged Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Connelly? Mrs.
not_available Connelly? What do you want to do? Abby, what do you want to do? Carter? 
not_available Not now.
not_available Paul Sobriki
not_available It might be psychiatric.
not_available Not now, okay? What happened? 
not_available Her pressure's 75, systolic.
not_available She's on dopamine, 
not_available She's still not making urine.
not_available She didn't want any heroic measures.
not_available I had to get her pressure up.
not_available Dopamine's a resuscitation drug.
not_available She said no tubes or machines.
not_available Dopamine's okay.
not_available What if it's not enough? 
not_available We give more fluids.
not_available You'll put her into congestive heart failure, flood her lungs.
not_available Then what? Will you intubate? Will you? 
not_available I'll stop the fluids if I have to.
not_available She'll have to be admitted to the ICU.
not_available Pressure's 90 on 10 mics of dopamine.
not_available She's making some urine.
not_available Good, good, good.
not_available It's working.
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available I don't know what you want! Don't follow me anymore! What's going on? 
not_available Paul's going off.
not_available He's trying to mess with me! Is this your patient? 
not_available He's Lucy's patient.
not_available You're supervisor.
not_available He followed me down here.
not_available I was concerned.
not_available Why's he up? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I wanted a drink of water.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene! Dr.
not_available Hudson's going south.
not_available I'll take care of this.
not_available Get Paul settled back into his bed.
not_available I don't want him to come! 
not_available He's not coming.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got to get back.
not_available You'll tell that other doctor? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hudson? He's altered.
not_available Unarousable.
not_available Elevated ICP.
not_available Get a Radiation Oncology fellow down here right away.
not_available I'll call them.
not_available He wanted chemotherapy.
not_available He won't make it to chemo.
not_available We need to intubate.
not_available I'll do it! Why don't I do it? Feeling better? 
not_available I'm kind of tired.
not_available Lucy? 
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What's with your patient? Dr.
not_available Greene pulled him out of a fight with his friend.
not_available Abby's looking for you.
not_available He might be schizophrenic.
not_available He meets the DSM
not_available IV criteria.
not_available Did you page a psych consult? I was waiting to present him to you.
not_available Get them down here, hand this guy off.
not_available Patients are waiting.
not_available It's so hard to breathe.
not_available How's she doing? Pressure's down, 85/55 on maximum dopamine.
not_available She's got rales all the way up to the apices.
not_available Pulmonary edema from all the fluid.
not_available She was hypotensive.
not_available Still is.
not_available Her BP's too low for nitroglycerine or morphine.
not_available You could try 40 of Lasix.
not_available Pulse ox is down, 79 on 100% oxygen.
not_available I'm going to intubate.
not_available No.
not_available She has an infection we can treat.
not_available She only needs to be intubated for a day until it clears up.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available She has multiple organ failure.
not_available You may never be able to extubate.
not_available Then what? She spends two months hooked up to every machine known to man? I know.
not_available I just want to make sure that I
not_available It's not about what you want.
not_available What happened when she stopped breathing? It's called Cheyne
not_available Stokes respiration.
not_available It's associated with heart failure.
not_available You change your shirt? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I saw four 6year
not_available olds.
not_available I think they ate too many of those little hearts you warned me about.
not_available All over me.
not_available Welcome to the ER Valentine's Day.
not_available Multiple trauma coming in.
not_available Five minutes out.
not_available Prep the Trauma Room.
not_available Meet you there.
not_available Watch out for the rebound phenomenon with the glucose.
not_available We'll monitor her closely.
not_available Does Gretel have insurance? We've had enough jokes for one day.
not_available I wasn't joking.
not_available Certain vets offer
not_available My God! Elizabeth.
not_available There you are.
not_available I've visited every department looking for you.
not_available Good heavens! Mother, this is Dr.
not_available Robert Romano.
not_available This is my mother, Isabelle Corday.
not_available She's visiting from London briefly.
not_available Lizzie never mentioned a thing.
not_available Pleasure.
not_available Likewise.
not_available This, I take it, is not the laser angioplasty.
not_available This is Gretel, who's been suffering from an insulinoma.
not_available Thanks to a brilliant assist, she'll be fine.
not_available Yes.
not_available I know how hard Elizabeth trained.
not_available We should
not_available How are you enjoying Chicago? I'm here for a series of lectures.
not_available Adaptive Optics, Wave
not_available Particle Duality.
not_available I don't know why you'd want to tax your mind with that.
not_available We have a wonderful city.
not_available I'm giving the lectures.
not_available I should get Gretel settled in Recovery.
not_available It was nice meeting you.
not_available And you.
not_available Please don't ask about the dog.
not_available Was it an Old English? Bouvier.
not_available I'm being paged to the ER.

not_available I was sitting behind Mommy.
not_available I hit my face on a broken window.
not_available We'll clean those scrapes.
not_available Hit your head or pass out? 
not_available No.

not_available I guess I owe you my thanks for going against my wishes.
not_available It did set a bad example for my Residents.
not_available But you're welcome.
not_available Radiation was the right call after all.
not_available Chemo would've worked if he hadn't had increased ICP.
not_available Do you know why I only had one child? I didn't want to listen to them arguing in the car.
not_available You don't know what she looks like, but have you seen my mother? I do know what she looks like.
not_available I met her.
not_available She's delightful.
not_available We're going out to dinner tonight.
not_available We? 
not_available You, me, your mother and my father.

not_available I don't mind.
not_available By the way, Elizabeth, I had no idea.
not_available About what? 
not_available About what you do.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available This coffee's weak.
not_available You can have some more after dinner.
not_available I'm sure by then I'll be on to the gin.
not_available What are you doing in here? 
not_available I wanted coffee.
not_available That nurse wasn't around.
not_available Let's get back.
not_available You're having a party here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Shouldn't it be bigger? 
not_available Shouldn't it be red? Come on, Dad.
not_available They are waiting.
not_available I don't like being set up.
not_available You're not being set up.
not_available It's freezing.
not_available I imagine this was Elizabeth's idea.
not_available Not that I don't like her.
not_available It's just dinner.
not_available This is not my first barbecue.
not_available Your mother hasn't been gone but for five months.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available You stay here.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available She's a Brit too, huh? Yeah, Dad, she's British.

not_available Would you rather just go home? Lucy.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What happened to Psych? 
not_available They're backed up.
not_available Pick up some other patients.
not_available Have you sutured the leg lac yet? 
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Let Malik stay with this guy.
not_available Just forget it, Carter! 
not_available My father thinks this was your idea.
not_available Mom thinks it was yours.
not_available She was straddling the patient, pumping on his chest.
not_available That's nothing.
not_available Mark saved this chopper pilot in San Diego.
not_available Kid had a tension pneumatic something.
not_available Shoved a tube in the side of his chest.
not_available Elizabeth put a tube down a man's throat.
not_available That's more difficult than putting it into his chest.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available We're talking about many pilots.
not_available She was saving a family.
not_available You're getting on well? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Couldn't be better.
not_available What the hell? 
not_available It's a place where people sing along.
not_available You mean, like a karaoke thing? Well, not really.
not_available It's too bad they couldn't get someone good.
not_available She is doing well.
not_available She's already chasing rabbits in her sleep.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Does everyone think I'm completely nuts? Of course not.
not_available Only those of us who were in the surgery.
not_available I live alone.
not_available When I come home, it's just Gretel.
not_available Right? If you showed the same compassion for people that you show for.
not_available Never mind.
not_available She's NPO.
not_available No food until she's passed gas.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available She's a dog.
not_available Has she passed gas? Dr.
not_available Romano, the biscuit.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available He has a really lovely voice.
not_available Can you sing, Mark? Nope.
not_available It's rather brave.
not_available When I was a kid, he used to do this to embarrass me.
not_available Parents don't try to embarrass their children.
not_available It's too easy to do it by accident.
not_available He is pretty fearless.
not_available She's not in any pain.
not_available I know.
not_available And I know you were right.
not_available She was right.
not_available Let me know if you need anything.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Asystole.
not_available Time of death, 
19 19.
not_available Be still my heart.
not_available I can't believe your mother knows all the words.
not_available We watched this movie 100 times when I was a girl.
not_available You liked it that much? 
not_available No.
not_available She saw it as an object lesson.
not_available That women shouldn't define themselves through men.
not_available Sorry? Well, Gigi was in love with Gaston.
not_available But Gaston only wanted her to be his courtesan.
not_available She agreed, and her great aunt and her grandmother gave her lessons.
not_available Then Gigi was unhappy.
not_available So she told Gaston
not_available Please stop, okay? I can't handle this evening getting any more bizarre.
not_available All right, then.
not_available There's warmer places to be alone.
not_available The furnace room in the basement and the incubators up in the NICU.
not_available I'd like to see you in an incubator.
not_available I'm happy to try.
not_available Well You know, all those years as an OB nurse 98% of what you see is just pure joy.
not_available It's the happiest day of most people's lives.
not_available And the tragedy is horrible.
not_available Because it's a life cut short.
not_available A mom, a baby Sure.
not_available Today was the first day I saw an old person die.
not_available I'm not used to it.
not_available You want the good news or the bad? Give me the bad.
not_available You never get used to it.
not_available The good news is, you never get used to it.
not_available At least I haven't.
not_available So you may have come up here to be alone, but you're not.
not_available You think they started the party without us? I certainly hope not.
not_available Heads will roll.
not_available So this is your Valentine's Day party? Don't ask me.
not_available It's my first one.
not_available We have a bigger knife in the lounge.
not_available Couldn't find it.
not_available A lot more fun than OB.
not_available We really like to party down here in the ER.
not_available Lucy didn't suture that leg lac? He's been here for four hours.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available Waiting on a psych consult.
not_available Her patient in Curtain 3.
not_available I wasn't sure you'd make it.
not_available Who can resist blue cake? Yuck! The patients don't mind this music? 
not_available What? Somebody! Lucy.
