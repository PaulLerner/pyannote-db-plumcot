not_available We're gonna clean up the cuts on your face and then I'm gonna stitch you up.
not_available Will I have scars? Well, maybe some discoloration, but it should all fade with time.
not_available So it looks like you broke your ulna.
not_available Which is the bone right in here.
not_available We like to call this a nightstick fracture.
not_available We often see it in people who try to protect themselves.
not_available So do you wanna tell me what really happened? I told you, I fell.
not_available I was running to catch the bus, I tripped on the curb.

not_available Dr.

not_available Yeah, Penny.
not_available Take it easy, relax.

not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Well, are you gonna help me out or not? 
not_available You need professional help.
not_available You sure you're gonna be all right? We got in this fight a few days ago.
not_available He hit me so I took off.
not_available I was staying at my friend Laura's house and he was waiting for me outside my school and he made me come back home.
not_available Then he did this.
not_available It's not the first time.
not_available Is there anyone else I can call? Like an aunt or an uncle or something? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, what about your sister? Jen lives in San Francisco.
not_available My dad doesn't know about it, though.
not_available I swore I'd never tell him where she is.
not_available He beat her so bad one time, she missed her midterms.
not_available I think
not_available Ow.
not_available I think there's something really wrong with him.
not_available Like he can't help himself.
not_available Well, he's not gonna be beating anyone else up once the cops get through with him.
not_available Oh, no, no.
not_available You can't call the police.
not_available I came here because I knew you wouldn't.
not_available He assaulted you, Zoe.
not_available I have to call them.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available It just makes it worse.
not_available I called them once and they didn't arrest him.
not_available It just made him madder.
not_available Trust me.
not_available They'll arrest him this time.
not_available Well, then what? What happens when he gets out? He'll come looking for me.
not_available Zoe Can I move in with you? I have nowhere else to go.
not_available We got an open fracture in 4.
not_available Some sort of parasitic infection in 1 and a foreign
not_available body inhalation.
not_available It looks like a roach clip, according to one of the nurses.
not_available I'm a little busy here.
not_available And we're a lot backed up out there.
not_available It's gonna get worse unless you start signing these and a half dozen discharges waiting for your John Hancock.
not_available All right, I'll be there in a minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available No.
not_available Urine looks like pea soup.
not_available Bingo.
not_available Send off a culture.
not_available Heard you had a good one for Penny.
not_available Urosepsis.
not_available What's the antibiotic of choice? 
not_available Levaquin.
not_available Ceftriaxone.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available In vitro, ceftriaxone might give you a better gram negative coverage.
not_available I'll mix up a gram.
not_available Ma'am, how you doing? Ma'am? 
not_available She had a subarachnoid three years ago.
not_available So this is her baseline? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Penny, what do you know about early goal
not_available directed therapy of sepsis? Attempts to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand.
not_available And decreases mortality through a multi
not_available pronged approach.
not_available She doesn't seem like a candidate for therapy.
not_available We need to review her chart.
not_available Talk to her primary physician.
not_available If we pursue goaldirected therapy, where will we start? Get her BP up? 
not_available Right, tip of the iceberg.
not_available We want MAP above 65, the CVP over 10, urine output over 5 cc an hour.
not_available most importantly the SVC O2 above 70.
not_available You'll need a central line.
not_available With an oxygen
not_available sensing tip.
not_available Okay, hold up.
not_available She can be a DNR for all we know.
not_available I mean, look at her.
not_available Well, what are you suggesting, Dr.
not_available Pratt? I'm suggesting that we treat her conservatively.
not_available We give her a couple of liters of saline antibiotics, oxygen, and see how she does.
not_available Well, okay, fine.
not_available And dopamine for pressure support.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dopamine? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dopamine.
not_available Low dose.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna see if I can pull an old chart.
not_available You don't have to stay here for this.
not_available Does that go for me too? Are you awake? Barely.
not_available I can't sleep.
not_available It's difficult to sleep when you talk.
not_available I keep thinking about stuff.
not_available Then stop thinking about stuff.
not_available Don't you wanna know what I'm thinking about? Mm? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm thinking about what everybody's gonna say when they find out.
not_available I think they'll be happy for you.
not_available Us.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available But still, I don't think we should tell anybody for a couple of weeks.
not_available I might have mentioned something to my father.
not_available You might have mentioned something to your father? He's in Croatia.
not_available Who's he gonna tell? You mention something to your mother? 
not_available Oh, God, no.
not_available I need to build up to that one.
not_available Ah.
not_available I'd like to wait at least until he's in high school.
not_available He? 
not_available Or she.
not_available Except I think I'd be better with a boy because the mother
not_available daughter dynamic really just scares the hell out of me.
not_available We're gonna have a baby.
not_available I know.
not_available It's so crazy.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available I can't sleep.
not_available You should sleep.
not_available You need your rest.
not_available I'm too wired.
not_available And I want something to eat.
not_available Again? Just something little like a Pop
not_available Tart.
not_available No.
not_available No more Pop
not_available Tarts.
not_available I'll get you something.
not_available I'll make you some breakfast or something.
not_available Okay, I'm coming.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available Sats 91 on five liters.
not_available Change her to a non
not_available rebreather.
not_available At what point would you intubate? 
not_available Never.
not_available Where's Clemente? 
not_available Good question.
not_available Hasn't shown up.
not_available Okay, who's the Attending? 
not_available You're looking at him.
not_available What? What do you want? I got a battered teen who doesn't want me to call the cops on her abusive father.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, call social work.
not_available I don't think that's a good idea either.
not_available Reporting is mandatory.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko, migraine mom is banging her head against the wall.
not_available The Alzheimer lady is missing.
not_available There's a homeless guy in Triage that just puked up something that looks like a human finger.
not_available And her husband is here.
not_available Okay, okay, I'll be there in a minute.

not_available How is she? How is she doing? 
not_available Not so good.
not_available How long has she been like this? 
not_available Almost three years now.
not_available We were on the Amalfi Coast in Italy.
not_available She got a bad headache.
not_available I thought it was too much wine.
not_available By the time we found a hospital ahem, she couldn't talk and she couldn't move.
not_available She bled into her brain from an aneurysm.
not_available A subarachnoid hemorrhage.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I thought when we got her to the hospital, she'd be all right but she never woke up.
not_available Does she ever open her eyes and look at you? No, not really.
not_available But she knows I'm here.
not_available It's a shame too.
not_available Beautiful blue eyes.
not_available That's what got me the first time.
not_available She caught me staring at her in math class.
not_available You've know each other a long time.
not_available Yeah, we started dating in '49.
not_available Fifty

not_available I know she's sick.
not_available But I'm not ready to lose her.
not_available Um, I understand, Mr.
not_available Venema.
not_available We'll do everything we can.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Any word on Clemente? Dude's a no
not_available show.
not_available Okay, set me up with a cordis introducer an art line and type and cross for four units.
not_available Excuse me? Set me up with a cordis introducer
not_available No, I heard the orders.
not_available I justAre you sure you wanna do that? We're pursuing early goal
not_available directed therapy of sepsis.
not_available Ever put in a subclavian line? 
not_available No, I'd like to learn.
not_available Prep the collarbone, we'll do it.
not_available Number 8 gloves.
not_available You should run it by Pratt.
not_available Attendings don't run things by residents.
not_available Generally, you're not the ER Attending.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need to identify the junction of the median and middle third of the clavicle.
not_available What's up? How's her pressure? What are you doing? Subclavian line.
not_available Call the ICU for an SVC O2 catheter.
not_available We agreed not to do invasive procedures.
not_available That's her husband out there.
not_available All right, look.
not_available You're a surgeon and you like to cut and paste everything together.
not_available But sometimes the best thing is not what we do, but what we don't do.
not_available You know, she's not a DNR.
not_available He wants everything.
not_available Did you explain to him that she's never gonna get better? Hm? Did you explain that she has no quality of life and that this bacterial infection may be nature's way of saying it's time to let go? Did he use anything to hit you with? Just his fists.
not_available Did he, at any point, threaten to kill you? Uh, maybe.
not_available I don't really remember.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna take a couple Polaroids of your injuries, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi, I'm Liz.

not_available Like I said, I'm working on it.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Work fast.
not_available I'm not leaving today until she's placed somewhere.

not_available Don't look at me.
not_available Or me.
not_available I am just trying to give her the best chance of recovery.
not_available Did you read her chart? What's her condition, Dr.
not_available Pratt? Chronic vegetative state with no chance of meaningful recovery.
not_available She can't go to the medicine floor with an art line.
not_available So pull it.
not_available Do it, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Iris scissors.
not_available Wait.
not_available I said pull it.
not_available I said wait.
not_available She's not going upstairs, Dubenko.
not_available We have limited resources in the ICU.
not_available We treat the sickest patients who have a chance for recovery.
not_available We don't flog people who are going to die.
not_available I never have enough beds as it is.
not_available All right, all right, fine.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, the cops brought in some guy who is asking for you.
not_available Yo, Greg.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Said I ran a red, but it was yellow.
not_available He almost ran over a traffic cop and he smells like a brewery.
not_available A bag of groceries fell off the front seat and beer bottles broke.
not_available I can't get the smell out of my floor mats.
not_available I need you to draw a blood alcohol for a suspected DUl.
not_available DUI? ComeWould you talk to him? 
not_available Look, I can vouch for this guy.
not_available That's great.
not_available But I don't need you to vouch for him.
not_available I need you to draw a BA.
not_available Is K.J.
not_available around? I can't let him see me like this.
not_available Should've thought before you started drinking and driving.
not_available I only had two beers, I swear to God.
not_available But what if I don't pass this? They'll bust me.
not_available I'll lose my license.
not_available I'll lose my job.

not_available What's that? A list of things I need to do before the baby comes.
not_available What have you got to list? 
not_available There's a lot of stuff to do.
not_available There's a ton of things to get.
not_available Baby monitor? Yeah, so you can hear the baby when you're not in the same room.
not_available I know what it is.
not_available This apartment isn't that big.
not_available If that baby's awake, you'll know it.
not_available Maybe it's not for this apartment.
not_available Well, yours is even smaller.
not_available Sorry, but it is.
not_available How's your breakfast? Thank God the human species has a nine
not_available month gestation period.
not_available Can you imagine if we were rats, and I was gonna pump this out in six weeks? Isn't that scary? 
not_available No.
not_available But you're scaring me.
not_available Really? 
not_available No, come on, don't you dare.
not_available Don't I dare? Are you daring me? What is it with you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's like a hormonal surge.
not_available I can't sleep, I can't stop eating, I Maybe I'm nesting.
not_available Do you think I'm? No, I just think I need to get ready.
not_available We still have plenty of time.
not_available You say that, but it's gonna go fast.
not_available I think, I don't want to jinx anything, but maybe we should look at some things.
not_available Not to buy, but to do some comparison shopping.
not_available Wanna go shop? 
not_available I wanna go looking.
not_available Baby monitors? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Monitors, cribs, car seats.

not_available It's a joke.
not_available Stat D
not_available 5.
not_available Half at 125 an hour.
not_available You took out her tubes.
not_available Yes.

not_available We pulled out the invasive monitoring lines because she's not going to the Intensive Care Unit.
not_available She's getting better? The medicine must
not_available No, no.
not_available She is not getting better.
not_available Why'd you unhook her? If she's not getting better
not_available The hospital has limited resources for our sickest patients.
not_available Resources.
not_available Beds, doctors, nurses
not_available You're talking about money.
not_available It can cost up to $20,000 a day to keep a patient in the ICU.
not_available The most difficult decision we make as doctors is deciding who will benefit from critical care and who will not.
not_available And you've decided my wife won't? No, we will continue to care for your wife
not_available She's not worth $20,000 a day.
not_available She will be admitted and given antibiotics.
not_available Even though she needs a lot more than that? We will provide your wife with the care that's best for her.
not_available But not the best care, huh? Hey, doc.
not_available Are you playing me here? 
not_available What? You stalling so your buddy's BA drops low enough to squeeze by? Because I can demand another doctor.
not_available Hell, I could get a nurse to do this.
not_available It's nothing like that.
not_available Like I told you, I know this guy.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available We've established that.
not_available Okay, look.
not_available His son works here as a volunteer.
not_available He's a good kid, trying to make something of himself.
not_available How many teenage boys you know volunteer at the hospital? I don't want him seeing his father like this.
not_available Give me a few minutes to get rid of him, then I'll do the blood draw myself.
not_available Now, you got five minutes before I grab a nurse.
not_available All right, deal.
not_available All right, let's do this.
not_available Hey, thanks for waiting, man.
not_available I really appreciate it.
not_available Did you see K.J.? 
not_available Yeah, I sent him on a run.

not_available Could you hand me my pen? Thanks.
not_available I think you're gonna like Rogan.

not_available Talks a mile a minute and knows more dirty jokes than anybody.
not_available What happened to him? 
not_available A little roadside bomb.
not_available Took some shrapnel.
not_available He was one of our supply
not_available truck drivers.
not_available Although he'd tell the female nurses that he was a terrain transport pilot.
not_available And what did you tell the nurses? 
not_available I told them I had a girl back at home.
not_available Good answer.
not_available Take it up to 3.
not_available So where's the party, man? Mike.

not_available Can you believe it? And what, we did it in a day? They won't let me go back.

not_available More like the basement.
not_available I'll stick with the ice cream.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now, I got you vanilla because the chocolate dispenser is broken so That's okay.

not_available mails.

not_available Do you think you could stay with her? 
not_available I have no way of getting out there.
not_available You let me deal with that.
not_available Now, let's call Jen and ask her if you can live with her, okay? You probably wish you never met me, right? No.
not_available Although it would have been easier if I met you four or five years from now.
not_available So crib, cradle, changing table.
not_available Do you really need a special table for changing a baby? Why can't we change him in the crib? What? 
not_available Stroller, we need two car seats.
not_available Two? 
not_available Yes, one for your car, one for mine.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Oh, wait.
not_available We need two of everything.
not_available We need a crib for your place and a crib for my place.
not_available And a changing table for your place
not_available I can still change him in the crib.
not_available Yes, but what if she pees while you're changing her and soaks the mattress? Okay.
not_available So if we have twins, we're gonna need to have four of everything? I'm not having twins.
not_available Uh, identical twins run in my family.
not_available Are you kidding me? 
not_available Well, I mean, chances are really small.
not_available If your mutant Croatian seed causes me to have twins
not_available Look at the sunny side.
not_available If we have a custody fight each one of us is gonna take a kid.
not_available Identical twins.
not_available Hey, exactly the same? Got it, yeah.
not_available Morris says he needs help with an LP.
not_available Disimpaction is still waiting in 3.
not_available I swear the kid in Curtain 2 looks like measles.
not_available My dislocated shoulder is still in the
not_available Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.
not_available At the very least, you have to prioritize for me when it's this insane in here.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available It's dead in here.
not_available We haven't had a single trauma.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko.
not_available Mr.
not_available Venema? What's this? 
not_available It's for my wife.
not_available We'll see if Morris can do some of this.
not_available But he's not an Attending.
not_available No, Mr.
not_available Venema.
not_available This isn't exactly what I meant.
not_available You said $20,000 a day for the ICU, right? That's a check for $87,000.
not_available It's all I have, but it'll buy my wife four days, right? 
not_available I can't take this.
not_available Why not? It's a cashier's check.
not_available It's not just about the money.
not_available We can't put your wife in the ICU.
not_available There are patients who need the ICU more than she does.
not_available What are you saying? There's not enough money to save my wife? I'm terribly sorry, I can't take your money and there's nothing more I can do.
not_available I need you to sign off on a diverticular abscess.
not_available What was that all about? Nothing.
not_available So, what's the verdict? 
not_available His blood alcohol came back negative.
not_available That's what I've been telling you.
not_available I've been doing this a long time.
not_available I'm not usually wrong about these things.
not_available Make sure you pay that ticket.
not_available Thanks, man, I owe you.
not_available You need some help.
not_available You did help me, man.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available It won't happen again, I promise.
not_available It won't because you're gonna stop drinking and get yourself in a program.
not_available A program? 
not_available You need some help, D.
not_available Look, you almost hit a cop.
not_available Hey, I got your truffles.
not_available What you doing here? 
not_available I was in the neighborhood.
not_available Doing what? 
not_available I asked him to stop by.
not_available You get something while you were out? 
not_available Yeah, I stopped by the food court.
not_available Check in at the Admit desk.
not_available See if they need you to make any lab runs.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available I'll pick you up after work, okay? All right.
not_available There's an AA meeting every night at the community center where Olivia works.
not_available Just go down there, okay? Promise me.
not_available All right, I will.
not_available All right? All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yo, Pratt.
not_available Please, man, I need this.
not_available I haven't been with a woman in months.
not_available I'm not giving you tips on dating black chicks.
not_available I'm not asking you because you're black.
not_available You're the coolest guy I know.
not_available And you're my friend and
not_available And what? It's just not easy for me when it comes to women.
not_available Especially once it gets going, because of my condition.
not_available What condition? Stupidity? 
not_available I have supernumerary thelium.
not_available What? Morris Wait.
not_available What are you doing, man? 
not_available You got extra nipples.
not_available Yes.
not_available Shh.
not_available Red hair, porcelain skin and four nipples.
not_available You know what gym class was like for me growing up? "Hey, Nipple Boy.
not_available Here, here, little piggy.
not_available Look, it's the Ugly Suckling.
not_available " I heard them all.
not_available What, we don't knock? On a curtain? What are you doing with my patient? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Morris was showing me his extra nipples.
not_available Oh, my God, I can't believe you just violated my doctor
not_available patient privilege.
not_available I'm not your doctor and you sure as hell ain't my patient.
not_available Whoa, look at those.
not_available That is freaky.
not_available You should get them all pierced.
not_available Wear them like chain mail.
not_available Guys, I need your help.
not_available I need some money.
not_available How much? 
not_available Whatever you got.
not_available I'll cover it.
not_available I walk into the supply tent one night, right? And he's filling an inflatable sex doll with helium.
not_available I look up and there's a bunch of them already floating on the ceiling.
not_available How or where he got them into the country, I don't even know.
not_available But in true Rogan fashion, he recruits me and we let them launch at the first light.
not_available A dozen naked sex dolls floating out over the desert at dawn.
not_available We're supposed to be at the apartment at 3.
not_available Hey, man, listen.
not_available I gotta get going, okay? Okay, Rogan? I'll swing by in a couple of days.
not_available Why do I have to do this? Why can't you try it yourself? Here, turn around.
not_available Just play with your toy.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Oh, no, we're just looking.
not_available That's really cute, isn't it? Yeah.
not_available So are you looking for a gift, or is this for you? It's for me.
not_available Us.
not_available We're having a baby.
not_available Together.
not_available Is this going to be your first? Yeah.
not_available It's got two bedrooms, two underground parking spaces washer
not_available dryer, storage facilities, and there's a workout room in the building.
not_available You don't like it? How can I not like it? I haven't even seen it yet.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you don't think Rogan's getting the best care maybe you could arrange for one of the county neurologists to see him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Um It's not Rogan.
not_available It's me.
not_available I wanna go back.
not_available To the hospital? To Iraq.
not_available What? You're joking, right? Michael, I know it's difficult seeing your friend and those soldiers like that but going back is not gonna change what happened to them.
not_available No, but I can help prevent other guys from ending up like that.
not_available Or worse.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll talk about this after you think about it.
not_available I've already been thinking about it for weeks, Neela.
not_available Well, without bothering to tell me? Listen, I left people over there, okay? People who need me.
not_available Well, I need you.
not_available Not like they do.
not_available Oh, my God, Michael, I can't believe we're having this conversation.
not_available Mr.

not_available Yep.
not_available I'm Dorothy.

not_available That's exciting.
not_available What do you do? 
not_available I'm a doctor as well.
not_available In the Army.
not_available The Army? Really? This place won't last long.
not_available So, what do you think? Why don't you kids take your time and call me after you've talked it over? Just close the door behind you when you leave.
not_available Wow, look at these.
not_available If I get this big, I think I'm gonna, like, kill myself.
not_available Women look their most beautiful when they're pregnant.
not_available You're such a liar.
not_available No, I'm serious.
not_available Crap.
not_available What? It's Debbie Dockins from the pharmacy.
not_available Who? 
not_available Don't look.
not_available If she spots the two of us in a baby store holding bags, she's gonna tell everybody.
not_available I don't know who she is.
not_available She knows you.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Every woman that works in the hospital knows who you are, trust me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm trying these on.
not_available Her back is bothering her.
not_available How long are we gonna stay in here? 
not_available Just until she leaves.
not_available When will that be? I don't know.

not_available It's a private hospital.
not_available They've agreed to treat her sepsis.
not_available In the ICU? 
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available They have an excellent reputation and I've spoken with the Attending there.
not_available Who do I give my check to? 
not_available They'll bill you.
not_available Really? Ahem.
not_available How can I thank you? Enjoy the time you have left with your wife.

not_available A tour would be nice.
not_available Great.
not_available Yeah but, Archie, I mean, what about your supernumerary thelium? Sounds serious.

not_available What about my clothes? What about my school? You have the keys to your house? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Give them to me.
not_available I'll pack up and send them to your sister.
not_available Once you get to San Francisco contact your school so they can transfer your grades and stuff.
not_available But won't my dad be able to find me? Have everything sent to me and I'll forward it.
not_available Here's some cash for the cab and something to get you started.
not_available Ray, I can't take your money.
not_available Sure, you can.
not_available Besides, it's nothing.
not_available Not all of it's mine.
not_available I convinced some of the richer docs to pitch in.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, it's gonna be okay.
not_available You're going to live with your sister, and Frisco is a great city.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Zoe, you know I can't do that.

not_available I'm gonna kill you.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available The first one was free, pal.
not_available Your daughter's gone and she ain't ever coming back.
not_available If you bother me or her again I'll have to use my extensive medical knowledge to mess you up real bad.
not_available You got that? I thought you joined the Army so that they'd pay for medical school.
not_available I did.
not_available I did.
not_available And you put your time in.
not_available Yes, I put my time in, but there's more to it.
not_available More to what? Look, Neela, I don't expect you to understand
not_available Then explain it to me, Michael, because I really want to understand this.
not_available Something happens over there.
not_available I just
not_available I had a purpose over there.
not_available My life had some clarity.
not_available I just cannot abandon those guys.
not_available But you can abandon me? Look, I understand there's a camaraderie with those you serve with.
not_available And I respect that, I do.
not_available If you still feel the need to experience that you can volunteer at the VA hospital.
not_available It's not the same thing.
not_available Neela, there is a war going on.
not_available People might like to forget that, but I can't.
not_available And I can't live with myself if I don't go back.
not_available Well, then we'll both go.
not_available I'll volunteer with an NGO or something.
not_available Neela, it is too dangerous over there.
not_available It's too dangerous for me, but it's okay for you? 
not_available What a load of crap.
not_available I am a soldier, remember? And you're also a husband, remember that? You asked me to marry you.
not_available You looked into my eyes and asked me to be your wife and to share a life together.
not_available We took vows, Michael.
not_available I mean, what the hell was all that? A whim? That was not a whim.
not_available I thought I could do this, Neela.
not_available I thought of nothing else but coming home and making a life with you.
not_available And I have tried to make it work, but I just I just can't stay here, knowing what's going on over there.
not_available Neela, I am sorry.
not_available And you You know how much that I love you.
not_available You know, if you did you wouldn't do this.
not_available And if you loved me, you would understand that I have to.
not_available Yeah, well, maybe that's the problem.
not_available I love you, but I still don't know you.
