not_available Eat something in a couple of hours.
not_available Your blood sugar mustn't be too low.

not_available I thought you took one.
not_available Don't give me that crap.
not_available Anspaugh told you to do it.
not_available I took a full history.
not_available The patient never mentioned any allergies.
not_available Then why is this space under allergies blank? You'd better think up an answer.
not_available Anspaugh's going to want one.

not_available Just a little bit further.
not_available There we go! We've an excellent faculty.
not_available Two Nobel laureates and the best attendings.

not_available Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 
not_available I thought he was going to make it.
not_available I feel awful.
not_available I promised not to let him die alone.
not_available There was no way of knowing.
not_available I should have been there.
not_available Instead, I was off appreciating a cyst.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? Kid with a fever in 5.
not_available Do you want to do this? No, I'm not done yet.
not_available Andrea, I'm so sorry.
not_available I called the mortuary.
not_available They're on the their way.
not_available What am I going to do with all his clothes? I can give them to my sister.
not_available Would you like to see him? Hold him one last time? 
not_available The doctor closed his wound.
not_available I have to make a call.
not_available The call can wait.
not_available Andrea, I know this is hard but I've learned that parents need to say goodbye.
not_available Come on.

not_available McCollum.
not_available Leg hurts like hell.
not_available I'll get some lidocaine.
not_available Hey, what kind of dump is this? It's a rat! 
not_available That's Jerry's mouse.
not_available Tomorrow I'm bringing my cat.
not_available This place should be closed down.
not_available I could use the time off.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available My foot! Damn it! It's one of Jerry's traps.
not_available Wendy, grab hold.

not_available Can I take a look? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available A thorough history, the best defense against malpractice.
not_available Good work.
not_available I thought this would be more comfortable.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Do you want to hold him? You take all the time you need.
not_available You're back.
not_available He got a button stuck up his nose.
not_available Unusual.
not_available How did it get there? I was wiping my nose on my cuff when I had to sneeze and I inhaled the button.
not_available The button's still on his cuff.
not_available He changed his shirt.
not_available Perhaps an ear, nose and throat specialist is in order? Why don't you lie back? 
not_available What are you doing, doctor? Hold the unblocked nostril closed while I put this mask over your mouth.
not_available Haleh, hold the basin under his chin.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Very impressive.
not_available May I keep the button? 
not_available Sure.

not_available Is she all right? 
not_available She just needs to stay off her feet.
not_available Boy, are you in trouble! 
not_available It's just for today.
not_available A pregnant woman needs a lot of help.
not_available When I was pregnant with Steven, Walt did the cooking and the laundry.
not_available It's crazy.
not_available It's like she's a different woman.
not_available It's just the hormones.
not_available One time, Walt switched the channel in the middle of Oprah.
not_available I chased him out of the house with a croquet mallet.
not_available Well, I'm losing it.
not_available I'm so proud of you, taking a day off to help her out like this.
not_available Will you be able to take more time off? I don't know.
not_available I hadn't thought about that.
not_available Who's Carla going to depend on if you're not around? Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go down to the baby section.
not_available You've got a lot to learn.
not_available Looks like he got him with an ice pick.
not_available I'll undress him.
not_available Let Chuny do that.
not_available I want you to assess the patient.
not_available Start with the ABCs, Dr.
not_available Hathaway.
not_available His airway is patent.
not_available He's breathing shallow, appearance dusky.
not_available I'll get the intubation tray.
not_available Chuny can do it.
not_available You're going to intubate.
not_available Take a breath and hold it.
not_available If you run out of breath, you're taking too long.
not_available Enter laterally, sweeping the tongue out of the way.
not_available Don't rock back.
not_available Can you see the epiglottis? Good.
not_available Now visualize the cords.
not_available Can you see them? 
not_available Pulse ox is falling, 89.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Make sure you lift the scope Good job.
not_available Let's get him to X
not_available ray.
not_available Looks like Kerry's got a new pet.
not_available Stop it, Chuny.

not_available And she had a bucket on her butt.
not_available What's wrong with them? 
not_available Sounds like they're nuts.
not_available Buttonextraction response time? 
not_available 7.5 minutes.
not_available This is Dr.

not_available What are you? 
not_available John Smythe and Brenda Wilkerson.
not_available Clinical researchers.
not_available We're doing a study on problem solving in emergency departments and foreign
not_available body extractions elicit the greatest range of responses.
not_available And you came up with the most innovative solutions we've ever seen.
not_available At Mercy, the button in the nose took five hours and two consults.
not_available They wanted to operate.
not_available Just who is sponsoring this study? An independent consortium of health care professionals and the government.
not_available The highest levels of government.
not_available No promises, but you might be contacted by H.R.C.
not_available Hillary.
not_available If she gets her ass stuck in a bucket, she'll know who to call.
not_available I'll tell her you said so.
not_available What are you doing down here? 
not_available Hiding.
not_available Me too.
not_available You're a smoker! 
not_available A secret smoker.
not_available Don't tell anyone.
not_available Who died? 
not_available What? Why the long face? Edson falsified a chart to cover his ass.
not_available He forgot to take a patient's history.
not_available Anspaugh must have roasted his butt.
not_available I didn't tell him.
not_available You didn't? Would you have? 
not_available Hell, yeah! Changing a chart's unethical, not to mention illegal.
not_available Surgeons don't rat on each other.
not_available It's like the 
Marines "All for one, and one for all." 
not_available That's the Three Musketeers.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available You've got to be a team player.
not_available Anspaugh gave me that lecture last week.
not_available I think you're scared.
not_available Well, we'll be in touch.
not_available Bye, Super Doc.
not_available What a couple of kooks! 
not_available They could make you famous.
not_available You could be known as the most innovative doctor in the country.
not_available Tell that to my daughter.
not_available I stood up her Brownie troop.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available I just can't seem to get it together.
