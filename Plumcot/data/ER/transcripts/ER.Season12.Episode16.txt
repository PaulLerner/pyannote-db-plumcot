not_available Practically had to stand on the guy to pop it back in place.
not_available But you gotta get it right the first time otherwise the patient's in a lot of pain.
not_available That would be bad.

not_available Lockhart.
not_available I leave you in her capable hands.
not_available Hello.
not_available How'd you hurt your head? 
not_available Trying to stop an epidemic.
not_available An epidemic? Of antisocial behavior.
not_available Why do some parents think it's okay for their kid to yell "doody" over and over again in public? 
not_available I've often wondered about that myself.
not_available Or that it's good manners if little Emma or Julian sprawls on the floor or hurls themselves at display cases while you try to enjoy a latte.
not_available So a latte led to your skull fracture? When I told Doody Boy to use his inside voice his mom threatened to call the cops.
not_available I tripped over a double stroller on my way out.
not_available Thank you for being on my side.
not_available No.
not_available It's not that.
not_available It's my baby, I
not_available I just felt it move.
not_available You did? 
not_available Yeah, it's the first time.

not_available He is gonna be bugging me about that ride for weeks.
not_available I meant it.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available I got something else for you to think about.
not_available I was in a real firing mood today.
not_available I fired my primary care doctor.
not_available I fired the home
not_available care nurse.
not_available Why'd you do that? I don't know.
not_available I saw you in action today.
not_available It got me thinking.
not_available I could do better.
not_available Well, it's too bad that I'm not available.
not_available You're not? That's a shame.
not_available I was offering you the job.
not_available It's very flattering, but I already have a job.
not_available Which you can keep.
not_available It's a part
not_available time job.
not_available Flexible hours, good pay.
not_available Just check my crit, give me the transfusions when I need them.
not_available The overnight chelation therapy that's gotta be done five times a week.
not_available Wait, did you say overnight? No, I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available I have Alex.
not_available I can't be running back and forth to your house in the middle of the night.
not_available That's why you and Alex would be more than welcome to come live with me.
not_available Move in.
not_available Excuse me? Listen, you could take a whole section of my house right now and have it all to yourselves.
not_available My live
not_available in housekeeper, Mrs.
not_available Harrison, has been with me 15 years.
not_available The place is so big, I hardly see the woman.
not_available She can even watch Alex after school.
not_available What, is it you feel sorry for me, because I'm a single
not_available mom nurse? We're not a charity case.
not_available It's no charity, it's an opportunity.
not_available This is just weird.
not_available Think about it, Samantha.
not_available I look forward to hearing from you.
not_available So how's Michael doing back in the saddle again? Bless him, volunteering to go back? 
not_available He's fine, doing well.
not_available Says he's very busy.
not_available He misses me.
not_available Of course.
not_available He'll be home again soon.
not_available Is Joe gonna be home in time for the birth? I don't think so.
not_available He'd pass out in the delivery room anyway.
not_available I did.
not_available Seriously.
not_available Of course I want him home.
not_available I knew what I was getting when I married a soldier.
not_available The long absences, the moving for the umpteenth time, the pay.
not_available It's sad he's not gonna be here.
not_available It's hard sometimes but that's why I'm so glad I have Spouse Club and all of you.
not_available Our loved ones are serving our country, it's a small price to pay.
not_available I think it's a huge price to pay, especially under the circumstances.
not_available What circumstances? 
not_available The way the whole thing's been handled.
not_available How we got into it, how it's being managed.
not_available What exactly do you mean? 
not_available Never mind, I'm sorry.
not_available No, no, go on.
not_available Well, I still haven't seen any weapons of mass destruction, have you? Who's thirsty? If you don't support the war, how do you justify what Michael's doing there? I don't justify it.
not_available And I don't support any war but I do support our troops and I am proud of my husband.
not_available Doesn't sound that way.
not_available You can't tell me that you believe 100 percent in your heart that we should be in Iraq, can you? 
not_available I don't think it helps to talk that way.
not_available Our duty is to support their duty.
not_available My duty is to be a good doctor and to be a good wife.
not_available Not to be brainwashed into falling in line with some pseudo
not_available patriotic delusion.
not_available I got your page.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They'll be in for you soon.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I thought you cancelled this.
not_available I un
not_available cancelled.
not_available My surgeon was afraid I'd change my mind again tomorrow.
not_available There's something I need to ask you.
not_available Want me to hang around, check on you in Recovery? No, that's not it.
not_available If something were to happen in surgery, I'd need someone to look after Henry.
not_available Nothing's gonna happen in surgery.
not_available But if it does.
not_available Would you be Henry's legal guardian? Well, what about Sandy's parents? They'reThey're wonderful with him, but they're getting older and I
not_available I just need to know that he'd be okay.
not_available And you know that it's
not_available It's not just me now.
not_available That Luka's in my life.
not_available He's a good man.
not_available He's gonna be a great father.
not_available Look, is this even possible to do now? I mean, isn't there something I have to do? Sign a legal thing? Something? I had these drawn up the first time that I scheduled the surgery.
not_available Can you just give us a second, please? You know, sometimes it's hard being alone.
not_available But I've always felt like I could depend on you.
not_available You can.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Ray? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Were you watching Ghost? What? No, no, it's the
not_available It's the game.
not_available Where's your date? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Something happened.
not_available She stood you up.
not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available You know, if that's what you wanna hear, she stood me up, okay? Well, you are a mere mortal after all.
not_available Rough night? Is it possible to kick yourself out of a club? Well, to better times, huh? Yeah.
not_available You know, I feel very proud of Michael but sometimes when I'm with those other wives I start to get so angry, frustrated and I talk too much.
not_available You? Talk too much? It's only because I miss him.
not_available This is utterly pathetic.
not_available What? This.
not_available A married woman living like a college student crying next to her roommate on his sofa.
not_available Okay, well, I have something that'll make you feel better.
not_available You recorded it for me.
not_available Anything for my roomie.
not_available It's lights, camera, action, tonight on the World Poker Tour.
not_available They play until one player wins all the chips on the table.
not_available Take some deep breaths.
not_available You'll start feeling sleepy.
not_available Count backwards from 100, Kerry.
not_available One hundred, 99 98, 97 96, 95
