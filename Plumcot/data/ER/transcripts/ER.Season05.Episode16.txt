Previously on ER Doug! The results don't have anything to do with the accident.
not_available All this time I'm worrying about HIV, and I get hepatitis C? Why not apply to a Locum Tenens program, filling in for vacationing surgeons? 
not_available They pay you a bundle to step in.
not_available What's that? Eight, ten grand, for a couple weeks.
not_available Can you say, "father"? Can you say, "daddy"? Yeah! Hey, Peter! 
not_available Good morning.

not_available Have you ever practiced medicine? I can handle it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available All right, suit yourself.
not_available Weather like this, folks sit out here and you can see them inside.
not_available I expect you'll find everything where it should be and Everybody, this is Dr.
not_available Benton, from Chicago.
not_available He'll take care of y'all.
not_available All right.
not_available Who's next? Bentons? I don't recollect any Bentons.
not_available My family's not from around here.
not_available So, what can I do for you today? Might have been some Bentons over near Hattiesburg.
not_available I believe it's so.
not_available There was the schoolteacher, Benton, over to Winona.
not_available She was a white lady.
not_available Died of consumption.
not_available Coughed herself to the grave.
not_available Ms.

not_available Complaining make it worse, what they say.
not_available Do you have a medical problem? 
not_available No.
not_available Just a burn.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where's the burn? I believe there are some Bentons up off the riverfront.
not_available Maybe "Benders." Maybe they was Benders.
not_available Benders.
not_available Mr.
not_available McCoy? Ruth Blalock? They left? 
not_available It appears so.
not_available Jesse Morgan? 
not_available That's me.
not_available I figured I'd let you look at my leg.
not_available That's okay, Mr.
not_available Morgan.
not_available You can stay seated.
not_available Sorry it took so long.
not_available Pretty nasty looking ulcer.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I tried mustard seed on it.
not_available That usually stops my leg from aching.
not_available No, you're gonna need some antibiotics.
not_available Stay off this foot and soak it three times a day in warm water, okay? Stay off it? And soak it? Where do I put this, doctor? 
not_available Excuse me? I'm sorry.
not_available Put it on the counter.
not_available We'll send it out to the lab or however it's done.
not_available Do you have a phone number? Oh, Maureen tells me on the spot.
not_available You take this in the backroom and you do your test.
not_available Mr.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Miss Pearl.
not_available How about the greens? You can pick out the hamhocks.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I'll have another biscuit.
not_available After Dr.
not_available Rajiv he lasted about a month we sort of gave up.
not_available It's hard to keep a doctor here.
not_available Well, I can see why.
not_available No offense.
not_available None taken.
not_available We was fine until you tried being more stubborn than the mare.
not_available Fractured your leg? 
not_available My knee ligaments and a herniated cervical disc.
not_available Guess it's lucky you don't mind lard.
not_available I'm sorry you missed your son.
not_available Well, had he gone to bed? I heard you send your love.
not_available No.
not_available My son is deaf.
not_available So the phone is of no use to us.
not_available I'd arranged for a video
not_available phone hookup at the hospital in Minnesota.
not_available I guess you don't have one here, huh? 
not_available Maybe, in Green Cove.
not_available Now, did Sonny get you settled in the trailer? I don't work for him.
not_available Maybe you saw the motor home behind the clinic.
not_available I'm afraid it's a little cozy for a man your size but 
not_available It'll be fine.
not_available And take care when you open the door.
not_available Or did you get it grounded, Sonny? Damn! Oh, shit! Take the temperature every four hours.
not_available Call me if Or see Dr.
not_available Benton at the clinic, if it doesn't drop below 100 by tomorrow.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Busy day? 
not_available No, not at all.
not_available Since half my patients come here.
not_available It'll take time for some of them to accept you.
not_available No, it won't.
not_available I'm not staying.
not_available You don't need a surgeon.
not_available If you're gonna get any rest, you need a doctor that everyone can accept.
not_available This isn't just about race.
not_available I don't care what it's about.
not_available So you only came for the money? You can get by with a nurse.
not_available Sonny hasn't even fixed your car yet.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll find a ride.
not_available So, thanks for the ride.
not_available Best reason we've had to go to work all year.
not_available When we get to the dock, you make sure every woman sees you getting out our truck! All right! Your Jake hears this, he won't go out on no boat no time soon.
not_available Amen to that.
not_available Now tell me something.
not_available Now, is you really a doctor? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take a look at Annie hand then.
not_available Becca, I'm driving.
not_available Go on, show the man your hand.
not_available Has you ever seen the likes of that? 
not_available It's a pretty bad infection.
not_available The shrimps.
not_available They got poisons in their head.
not_available If I were you, I'd take antibiotics and rest, give it time to heal.
not_available Stop working? Unless you gonna stow me up to Chicago.
not_available I don't think I could afford to keep a woman like you.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What's that? Oh, hell! Help! Help me! Help me! 
not_available Help him.

not_available I'll take over.
not_available Somebody's waiting for you.
not_available Sally? I'm Sally Mannon.
not_available We didn't get a chance to meet last night.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I saw you.
not_available She told me about the accident.
not_available So how's your husband and son?

not_available I'll dig in right now.
not_available He gave my boy oxygen all the way to Green Cove.
not_available You bagged him for 80 miles? In the back of a pickup.
not_available This is delicious.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's the best thing I've had here.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available God bless you.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available You gonna stay, then? It's not that busy.
not_available That's because I make rounds on Tuesdays.
not_available Rounds? 
not_available House calls.
not_available I heard one of the Ebee girls is pregnant.
not_available They live far out.
not_available I'm sure she hasn't had any prenatal care.
not_available I haven't done OB since med school.
not_available Well, never mind.
not_available I'll go.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Look.
not_available I'm not saying no.
not_available I'll go if I can use your truck.
not_available Sonny hasn't fixed my car yet.
not_available You can't get there by car.
not_available What y'all want? I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Miss Chapman sent me to check on your daughter.
not_available She don't need checking.
not_available That it? All right.
not_available Hurry up before your pa gets back.
not_available You know how he is.
not_available Go on.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Sir? Doctor? Sir? If you don't mind I was feeling faint yesterday.
not_available Want me to examine you? Ma says you can check me out here.
not_available Believe me.
not_available You don't want to go in.
not_available I'm concerned about your blood pressure.
not_available It's a little high.
not_available Have you had other problems besides dizziness? A little bit of blood came out last week.
not_available Well, I'm no specialist.
not_available But I think you should get an ultrasound and blood tests in Green Cove.
not_available What's going on? Papa, Dr.
not_available Benton is looking after me.
not_available This would be the doctor for you, wouldn't it? 
not_available Sir, your daughter needs some tests.
not_available She don't need nothing from you.
not_available Her blood pressure is elevated.
not_available Melanie Irene, get in.
not_available Get this man off my property.
not_available Melanie's had enough help from his kind already.
not_available See what the authorities say.
not_available You can call the president as far as I'm concerned.
not_available Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to do for my kid.
not_available Reece.
not_available The "A" hand knuckles rub against one another in circles.
not_available Wash.
not_available The prone right hand is drawn Wash your hands, Reece.
not_available Reece, wash your hands.
not_available Mr.
not_available Morgan? Oh, morning, doctor.
not_available I told you to stay off that foot.
not_available And wash it three times a day.
not_available Why are you walking on it? I can't wash my foot without water, now, can I? Have a good day, doctor.
not_available Your glucose level is too high.
not_available What do you want it to be? Adelina, answer the doctor.
not_available Between 70 and 120, sir.
not_available Nurse Maureen diagnosed you a month ago.
not_available You should have better control over your diabetes.
not_available You checking your glucose level three times a day? You check it after you drank that soda? Adelina! 
not_available I only took a sip.
not_available That's one sip too many.
not_available If her glucose isn't under control she'll damage her kidneys, heart, even go blind.
not_available She could have another seizure.
not_available It was my fault for not bringing her in.
not_available I don't think highly of doctors since we lost her mama.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, you gonna show me how to inject this? No, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available Well, I'll show you.
not_available Been shopping? Yeah.
not_available Thought I'd cook some vegetables, if you don't mind.
not_available Be fine.
not_available How'd the clinic go? Adelina Young came in with a glucose level of 280.
not_available Grandmother claims they haven't gotten insulin or glucose strips.
not_available Oh, Lord! 
not_available She doesn't understand the routine.
not_available Adelina should've received diabetic teaching.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Try a sub
not_available Q insulin pump.
not_available Heard of those? 
not_available Something newer than leeches? Look I'm just trying to raise the standard of care.
not_available We should expect 100o/o.
not_available I do.
not_available But I've learned to settle for 60o/o.
not_available 60o/o is failure.
not_available It takes time for 
not_available They've had a month! Adelina is an athlete.
not_available She's probably scared that this will end that.
not_available She could go into a coma! Don't you think I know that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maureen! Maureen, you gotta come! Something's wrong with Melanie! She's been laboring and the baby won't come! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available No, I want you, Maureen.
not_available You're a damn fool, Eli.
not_available I can't move that fast.
not_available Just think of Melanie.
not_available Well, come on.
not_available Oh, sweet Jesus! 
not_available I need more light! The generator's busted! Get on outside! Go on! Oh, Mama, help me! Melanie, I need you to relax.
not_available Okay? I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Come on.
not_available I don't think the head is engaged.
not_available Damn it! I feel the foot! What does that mean? The baby's upside
not_available down.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Looking up how to deliver this baby.
not_available You don't know? 
not_available I'm a surgeon, not an OB.
not_available Any flashlights? 
not_available A couple.
not_available Get them! And blow out these candles! I'm gonna use ether if I find it.
not_available Okay, I need you to breathe nice and easy.
not_available I can't! 
not_available You're gonna have to try.
not_available What are you doing to her? 
not_available She has to be sedated.
not_available A uterus rupture could kill her.
not_available I might, once I see the bastard.
not_available You hush! 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Ebee hold this over her face, letting it drip onto the mask like this.
not_available All right.
not_available She brought this on herself.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ebee, can you read? 
not_available Of course I can.
not_available Go! I need you to read off this computer screen now.
not_available You do it, Mama.
not_available "Insert the right hand into the ker ker" 
not_available Cervix.
not_available Cervix.
not_available Okay, that's it, come on, go on.
not_available "Push the head and with the left hand external bring the rump down." "Rump." 
not_available Stop.
not_available Okay, go on.
not_available "Lift the feet up and push the head over the pelvis rim." Oh, damn it! All right.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right.
not_available I got one foot out.
not_available All right there's the other one.
not_available Damn it! Head's stuck.
not_available Oh, please, Jesus! Okay, okay, come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right, we're almost there.
not_available Okay, stop the drip.
not_available Hey.
not_available Okay, you got a granddaughter.
not_available She looks just like an Ebee.
not_available See, Eli? I see.
not_available Melanie's damn lucky.
not_available How are you feeling? Happy.
not_available Is my baby okay? 
not_available Yeah, she's fine.
not_available You know, from what your father said, I have to 
ask Is there any chance the baby's father is black? 
not_available You see her baby.
not_available She's white.
not_available I know.
not_available So you know, a lot of African
not_available American babies don't get full pigmentation until a few days later.
not_available So if there's any chance of that, for both your safety you need to let me know.
not_available Okay? I got worried.
not_available It was a breech.
not_available Mother and baby are fine.
not_available But I have to take them to LaVerne.
not_available Not in my boat.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available Don't take off just yet.
not_available Here.
not_available There's no charge.
not_available Maureen? Much obliged, Eli.
not_available That took a lot for him to offer.
not_available I don't want his money.
not_available The baby's jaundiced.
not_available I hope they can stay at your house.
not_available Jaundice usually goes away.
not_available No.
not_available Tell them that the mother and baby have to be taken in.
not_available How you doing? I don't want to talk about it.
not_available Good.
not_available I didn't come here to talk.
not_available Come on.
not_available Morning, doctor.
not_available How are you doing, Mr.
not_available Morgan? Did you drop that big jug of water off on my porch? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I sure want to thank you.
not_available But I had to come to town anyway.
not_available If I don't sit in this chair, who's gonna do it? Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available You're on your feet again.
not_available I only got your help for a few more days.
not_available Thought we could hold down the fort here, and send you to the pharmacy.
not_available How's the baby? Her jaundice doesn't appear any worse.
not_available Melanie's itching to go home.
not_available Sonny go get Dr.
not_available Benton his keys.
not_available It's only been three days.
not_available If the baby's pigment were gonna darken, it would've started.
not_available Probably.
not_available It was smart, the way you handled Ebee.
not_available You know, you may have a flair for country medicine after all.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Oh, I don't either.
not_available I don't feel like driving 80 miles.
not_available Adelina and her grandma are willing to keep you company.
not_available She says she doesn't trust hospitals.
not_available Well, she must be sweet on you.
not_available And I heard they have the video phone hooked up.
not_available Might could see your son.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton said the pump is better.
not_available I'll consider giving you one if you learn to control your glucose by the time we get them.
not_available How's that? I'm a little more concerned about another finding, though.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, did you detect a pansystolic murmur in Adelina? A murmur? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I thought I appreciated a slight murmur along the left sternal border.
not_available The echo shows a VSD.
not_available What's that? No.
not_available I didn't listen to her chest.
not_available She was in for her diabetes.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Adelina's heart has a small hole.
not_available A hole? From the diabetes? 
not_available No, it's unrelated.
not_available She's probably had it since birth.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available It should be repaired before it gets worse.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What does he mean by repaired? 
not_available It's a simple surgery.
not_available I'm having surgery? 
not_available I don't want her cut.
not_available You never said I needed surgery.
not_available I missed it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, call is ready.
not_available Excuse me, please.
not_available Reece, what are you laughing at? Reece, come on.
not_available Come on, wash your hands.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available Okay.
not_available They're actually saying that we've got to go now.
not_available Thanks, Elizabeth.
not_available Four more days.
not_available Right.
not_available I'll be home on Friday.
not_available He'll be thrilled to see you.
not_available Okay, Reece.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Byebye! Come on, Reece, say bye
not_available bye.
not_available You going home this Friday? Yeah.
not_available But Dr.
not_available Brookes will find you a good surgeon.
not_available And what else is he gonna find wrong with her? Mrs.
not_available Deane, I know it's hard to plan ahead, but if we could set the date I'll think it over.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available You shouldn't put this thing off.
not_available What about next week? 
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available But you will call Dr.
not_available Brookes, right? 
not_available As soon as I can.
not_available That took a while.
not_available Ignorance, just ignorance.
not_available There's no reason why a kid in this century couldn't What happened? 
not_available They found Jesse dead.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available In front of Sugg's Store after you left.
not_available Was it MI? Why didn't you page me? 
not_available It could've been his heart, a stroke.
not_available Or an embolism.
not_available He said his leg ached and l 
not_available I should have checked him out.
not_available He was an old man.
not_available There was nothing we could do.
not_available God rest his soul.
not_available Funeral's Friday.
not_available I've been saying Jesse wanted to lay with his wife in our churchyard.
not_available But he born a Catholic.
not_available And I know he'd want the sister to offer a prayer.
not_available What sister? May the angels lead you into paradise.
not_available And may the martyrs come to welcome you and take you to the Holy City the new and eternal Jerusalem.
not_available And may the choir of angels welcome you.
not_available Where Lazarus is poor no longer, may you have eternal rest.
not_available Eternal rest, grant unto him, O Lord.
not_available And let perpetual life shine upon him.
not_available And may he rest in peace.
not_available Goodbye, Jesse.
not_available Amen.
