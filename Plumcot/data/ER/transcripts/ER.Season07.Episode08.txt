not_available It's just irrigation solution.
not_available It's 10 to 6.
not_available I know.
not_available I thought the procedure had gone smoothly.
not_available Well, it was a screaming success if your desired outcome was paralysis.
not_available Oh my God I'm being sued for malpractice.
not_available Get out! I don't want you here! You stay away from my son! What's my prognosis? You need to talk to a neurosurgeon right away.

not_available You don't believe me? Can you do me a favor? 
not_available Anything.
not_available Come to the hospital with me.
not_available What for? 
not_available A blood test.
not_available A blood test? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Would you do that for me? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Sure, I'd do anything for you.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available There was no epidural.
not_available I was the only one remotely close to the dura.
not_available Answer the questions.
not_available You'll do fine.
not_available I had to have punctured it.
not_available It's a known risk.
not_available It does not constitute negligence.
not_available Mark, missing a leak does.
not_available I don't even remember looking before I removed the endoscope.
not_available You've done 100 of these.
not_available You know the procedure.
not_available There was a bad outcome.
not_available They're looking for someone to blame.
not_available It doesn't mean you did anything wrong.
not_available Do you want me to ride with you? 
not_available No, go to work.
not_available You sure? Hey.
not_available Don't go jogging into any more street signs.
not_available Hard as a rock.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available How long do these depositions last? 
not_available Call me if it goes past midnight.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm just kidding.
not_available I hate to go on an interview with a big Band
not_available Aid on my arm.
not_available What will they think? 
not_available You have a suit jacket.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hope I don't have to take it off if the room gets warm or something.
not_available Tell them you gave blood.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't wanna be late, though.
not_available Rule number one is, do not be late for an interview.
not_available This will just take a minute.
not_available I'd like to be early.
not_available What if I go and come back? Then if you want to do this Okay.
not_available Hold still.
not_available I just don't understand, Abby.
not_available I mean, you've let me in your home.
not_available We're getting along so well.
not_available This is an absolute gift.
not_available I mean, what will taking my blood accomplish? 
not_available Nothing, hopefully.
not_available Wait, stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available Listen to me, honey.
not_available Listen.
not_available When this test comes back negative or positive or whatever it's supposed to be, then you're gonna feel foolish and I'm gonna be hurt.
not_available And then you're gonna feel bad.
not_available You can't touch the vein after it's clean.
not_available That can't be what you want! 
not_available It's not.
not_available Then, honey, let's just not do this! Need some help in here? 
not_available No, we're fine.

not_available Actually, you look great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You look good too.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's the draw for? I'm giving blood.
not_available What? That's what you told me to say.
not_available Go.
not_available Just go.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available What? 
not_available Just go.
not_available I don't want you to be late.

not_available I don't get it.
not_available He had some other girl looking for him yesterday.
not_available Fire enough shots, eventually you hit something.
not_available Or catch something.
not_available Don't knock it until you try it.
not_available What? Abby! A girl out here needs help! She's bleeding! Some kids, they just threw her from a car.
not_available Honey? Honey, here you are.
not_available Take this.
not_available What happened? 
not_available They hardly stopped the car.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Step back.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's sit down.
not_available Come on.
not_available Careful.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Kynesha.
not_available Okay, Kynesha.
not_available Lean back.
not_available Let me take a look.
not_available Did someone beat you up? 
not_available I fell.
not_available Nonsense.
not_available Honey, who did this? 
not_available Mom, go to your interview.
not_available I'm trying to help.
not_available We don't need your help.
not_available Go.
not_available Did you have a loss of consciousness? Any trouble breathing? Get a gurney and page X
not_available ray.
not_available Abby? Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Resnik called from the garage.
not_available He's on his way up now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We'll wait five minutes, and then we'll leave.
not_available I can stay.
not_available I've taken the whole day off.
not_available We shouldn't have to play these kind of games.
not_available Gordy, good to see you.
not_available Bruce.
not_available Sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available There was a pileup on the expressway.
not_available Real mess.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available You must be Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Bruce Resnik.
not_available Pleasure to meet you.
not_available And you.
not_available They didn't tell me you were so stunning.
not_available That's okay.
not_available You don't have to respond.
not_available Has the court reporter set up? 
not_available In the library.
not_available Let's get going.
not_available After you.
not_available Hey, Irene.
not_available How are you this morning? 
not_available Fine, Mr.
not_available Resnik.
not_available Yourself? 
not_available Can't complain.
not_available Hey, how are you? 
not_available Fine, thank you.
not_available Please have a seat.
not_available Ignore the camera.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Everyone was rubbernecking past this accident.
not_available I waited my turn.
not_available So, of course, I take a look.
not_available You know, human nature.
not_available And these firemen are using one of those big steel things to cut.
not_available What do you call them? 
not_available Jaws of Life.
not_available Jaws of Life! Right.
not_available I mean, it looked pretty dangerous to me.
not_available You ever use one of those? 
not_available No, not personally.
not_available It was cutting into the car like a can opener.
not_available Anyway, shall we start? Certainly.
not_available Please raise your right hand.
not_available There's no Bible? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you swear to tell the truth in this matter, so help you God? Yes.
not_available We are on the record in a deposition on the behalf of the plaintiff, Al Patterson.
not_available Plaintiff's attorney's Bruce Resnik.
not_available Gordon Price for defense.
not_available Doctor, state and spell your name for the record.
not_available Elizabeth Corday.
not_available CORDA
not_available Y.
not_available Doctor, how long have you been a surgeon? Including Residency? Ten years.
not_available Have you ever had a deposition taken before? 
not_available No, this is the first.
not_available After 10 years, that's pretty good.
not_available Well, only three have been in America.
not_available Touché.
not_available Extraocular movements are intact.
not_available Okay, Kynesha.
not_available We need to remove your pants so I can check for injuries, okay? 
not_available It's just my face.
not_available I know, but we still need to check.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hey, Peter.
not_available Hey.
not_available There's an inguinal hernia in Curtain 3.
not_available Could you look? Yeah, after the assault victim.
not_available We've got it.
not_available Probably just a facial fracture.
not_available Well, I'll clear the belly.
not_available She's stable.
not_available There's blood in her underwear.
not_available She says it's her period.
not_available Get a rape kit.
not_available Peter, wait.
not_available You shouldn't take this one.
not_available Why? It's Jesse's girlfriend.
not_available I can take care of her.
not_available I'm gonna come in close and check the back of your eyes.
not_available Let's take a look in your ears now.
not_available Peter! Good.
not_available No hemotympanum.
not_available What's that? 
not_available That means you didn't crack your skull.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I know.
not_available Is there anyone you want us to call? Mother, father? She won't be home.
not_available The re
not_available enhancing lesion and central necrosis on MRI was suspicious.
not_available The biopsy confirms it.
not_available Another pathologist should take a look.
not_available Could be an astrocytoma.
not_available Two neuro specialists have reviewed the slides independently.
not_available They concur.
not_available It's a GBM.
not_available What's the survival rate? Untreated, eight weeks.
not_available With radiation therapy, the average increases six to nine months.
not_available So you need to go see a radiation oncologist today.
not_available What about surgery? I'm afraid the tumor is inoperable.
not_available Why? 
not_available It looks like it invaded Broca's area.
not_available The speech arrest you were experiencing was probably the result of a focal seizure.
not_available Even if we removed the entire tumor, you'd most likely be left with the inability to speak and understand language.
not_available Communication.
not_available More than communication.
not_available You'd lose all ability to comprehend, interact with the world around you.
not_available Essentially, what makes you human.
not_available Even if you consented, I wouldn't even consider operating.
not_available We'll keep you on Dilantin, Do you have disability insurance? Dr.
not_available Greene? Yeah.
not_available What's going on, Carter? Why are we so backed up? I just got here.
not_available Weaver's not on till tonight.
not_available This happens when she's off.
not_available Hey, what happened to your head? 
not_available Jogging.
not_available I ran into a street sign.
not_available She left you a note.
not_available Take the shoulder pain and the vertigo.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, guy with palpitations.
not_available Tachycardic at 300.
not_available BP is 100/70.
not_available Normal mentation.
not_available Six of adenosine.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Did you say heart rate was 300? If it's WolffParkinsonWhite, adenosine could put him into V
not_available fib.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available 100 milligrams procainamide.
not_available IV every 10 minutes.
not_available Thanks, Carter.
not_available Sure.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available It's been a long morning.
not_available Listen, we have to do a blood and urine test on you.
not_available It's your three
not_available month mark.
not_available Right now? 
not_available Sometime in the next six hours.
not_available Whenever.
not_available Listen, if you want privacy, I'll do the stick.
not_available Otherwise, you can ask a nurse.
not_available Yeah, I'll ask Abby.
not_available Randi, what's open? 
not_available Exam 1.
not_available Meet you there.
not_available Liver and spleen are good.
not_available No peritoneal free fluid.
not_available No lacerations or contusions.
not_available Kynesha, when's the last time you had intercourse? I don't remember.
not_available Woods lamp.
not_available I'll get the lights.
not_available What's that do? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available There's no semen.
not_available What? We got some abrasions, but no stridor.
not_available I need to do a pelvic exam, Kynesha.
not_available Do you know what that is? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm on my period.
not_available I told you.
not_available I still need to check.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Let me go! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Kynesha, it's important we give you an exam.
not_available Not down there.
not_available Just fix my face.
not_available Look, we know it's hard, but if someone sexually assaulted you, we have to check.
not_available I didn't get raped.
not_available I got beat up.
not_available That's all.
not_available Who beat you up? 
not_available I got jumped out.
not_available No big thing.
not_available Of a gang? 
not_available I did okay.
not_available Some girls get real messed up.
not_available I did okay.
not_available So you concede Mr.
not_available Patterson's surgery started at 
5 17 p.
not_available m.
not_available According to the chart, yes.
not_available And you sent Mr.
not_available Patterson to Pre
not_available Op at 
2 15 p.
not_available m.? 
not_available Approximately, yes.
not_available Expecting to operate within the hour? 
not_available Expecting to operate immediately.
not_available But you didn't.
not_available You didn't start the operation for another three hours, did you? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? I'm on emergency call.
not_available A lifethreatening gunshot wound to a 14year
not_available old boy came in.
not_available I had to respond.
not_available And were you able to save this boy? 
not_available No.
not_available And this Jesse Robbins Did you know him? 
not_available By association, yes.
not_available And that association was through a colleague, Dr.
not_available Peter Benton? 
not_available He was Dr.
not_available Benton's nephew.
not_available And Dr.
not_available Benton is your former lover? Don't answer that.
not_available Was the boy you weren't able to save the nephew of your former lover? Move it along, Bruce.
not_available That has no probative value, and she's not answering.
not_available Are you refusing to answer that? 
not_available She's not answering.
not_available Fine.
not_available She'll answer in front of the judge.
not_available So the death of his nephew was upsetting to you.
not_available Of course.
not_available How long did it upset you? I'm not sure.
not_available Losing a young boy, a boy you knew, a boy close to someone you cared about it must have been quite overwhelming.
not_available Is that a question? Was it overwhelming? 
not_available At that moment.
not_available So overwhelming and tragic that it was still on your mind while you operated on my client.
not_available Wasn't it, Dr.
not_available Corday? Guess I should have had that blood transfusion this morning, huh? Come on.
not_available That was funny.
not_available This is kind of ironic, isn't it? Check my cholesterol while you're at it? Hey, you! You're supposed to be watching this.
not_available You think I want to be doing this, Carter? I don't have better things to do? 
not_available Okay.
not_available What should I do with this? 
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Are we done? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abby, paramedics called.
not_available Your mom's hurt.
not_available She's asking for you.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She's outside a clothing store on Oak Street.
not_available If she wants to give names, I'll check it out.
not_available She's afraid.
not_available She's not going to give names.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? She wants to talk to you.
not_available If she changes her mind, give me a call.
not_available Peter, I said I'd take care of her.
not_available I got it.
not_available Looks like you broke your cheekbone.
not_available Gonna have to do a CAT scan of your face.
not_available So you're really gonna protect the girls who did this? I'm protecting myself.
not_available If they find out I said something, they gonna kill me.
not_available Like they did Jesse? You don't know that.
not_available I know he wasn't a gang member and you are.
not_available Was.
not_available The only reason he was in that neighborhood is because of you.
not_available He only came there twice.
not_available Said he didn't like me banging.
not_available Kept telling me that I was better than all that.
not_available That he loved me.
not_available He was gonna get me out.
not_available You're telling me that's why they killed him? He ditched school.
not_available Tried to get me to come over.
not_available Told me that his mom was gonna figure things out.
not_available We had a fight.
not_available I was walking away when it happened.
not_available You saw who shot him? That's why I don't want to be a part of it no more.
not_available I loved him too.
not_available Who shot him, Kynesha? You just said you loved him.
not_available You'll tell the cops if I told you.
not_available No.
not_available Why you asking? 
not_available Because I gotta know.
not_available You swear you ain't gonna say nothing? Kynesha Who murdered my nephew? 
not_available You need to hold still.
not_available My daughter is a doctor.
not_available I don't need you to do any of this.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available She's a doctor.
not_available She will be here.
not_available She can do this.
not_available Abby, this wasn't my fault.
not_available This man came after me.
not_available You her daughter? 
not_available She was shoplifting.
not_available I was not! Why would I shoplift a $10 scarf? 
not_available It's a $300 scarf.
not_available Well, it looks like a $10 scarf! She ran straight into my door.
not_available Shattered glass everywhere.
not_available You don't want to arrest her.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available I'm a nurseWhat's wrong with her? Nothing's wrong with me! What's wrong with you? 
not_available She has a mood disorder.
not_available She was stealing.
not_available She wasn't stealing, she was confused.
not_available You weren't there.
not_available She walked into the store, demanded a job.
not_available I explainedLet me tell you something, dearie, I have better retail skills than you! Be quiet, Mom! Common courtesy and politeness being two of them! Can I give you my phone number, and then I'll pay for the glass? Is that cool? What if she comes back? 
not_available I have customers in there.
not_available She won't come back.
not_available You'll take care of it? 
not_available Yes, I promise.
not_available Fine! Just get her out of here! Up to 5 of Haldol, p.
not_available r.n.
not_available You got it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What? You wanted to see me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Your naltrexone level was nondetectable.
not_available My naltrexone level? 
not_available You're supposed to be on 50 mgs a day.
not_available I thought it was a drug screen.
not_available I didn't know you were screening for naltrexone.
not_available It's in your contract.
not_available My prescription ran out, and I haven't had time to refill it.
not_available You know that it's part of the agreement.
not_available And I'm taking it.
not_available I don't need it, and I'm taking it.
not_available What? You're not the only one with something at stake here.
not_available We put ourselves on the line to give you a fresh start.
not_available In any other circumstance, you'd either be dead or in jail.
not_available Fresh start, huh? You really think this has been a fresh start? I think that I've done absolutely everything that you've asked of me.
not_available And I've done it without complaint.
not_available I think that I've obeyed these arbitrary and arcane rules and regulations about what patients I can treat and what patients I can't.
not_available I think I've peed into cups.
not_available I think you've taken my blood.
not_available And I think at some point, it's gonna have to be enough.
not_available I think at some point, you're actually gonna have to trust me.
not_available Hey, Mark! I need some help in here! Chuny, get in here and get me some Ativan! Mark! Oh, my God! What happened? 
not_available Get the Ativan.
not_available How much? Four milligrams now.
not_available Mark.
not_available Did he hit his head? 
not_available No.
not_available Does he have a fever? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available He just started seizing.
not_available Hold him still.
not_available All right.
not_available Start him on 15 liters of O
not_available 2.
not_available Get a line going.
not_available And then I need a pulse ox and a set of vitals.
not_available Get a tox screen.
not_available Finger stick of glucose.
not_available What do you want for labs? CBC and a Chem
not_available 20.
not_available Carter? Dr.
not_available Greene? Hey, hey, Mark! Can you hear me? 
not_available Squeeze my hands.
not_available Right and left.
not_available What happened? You had a seizure.
not_available Your vitals have been stable.
not_available You didn't drop your sats.
not_available We're gonna take you for a head CT.
not_available See if you can follow my finger with your eyes.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just lay back.
not_available No.
not_available We need to work this up.
not_available I don't want to work it up.
not_available Neuro is coming for a consult.
not_available It's not necessary.
not_available You had a new onset seizure.
not_available I just need a Dilantin level.
not_available I can go to the outpatient lab.
not_available Relax.
not_available I called Kovac in to cover.
not_available You've got a Hep
not_available Lock on your arm.
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available I'll handle it! 
not_available Mark.
not_available Mark.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Hey, boss, what are you doing? I heard you had a seizure.
not_available Yeah? You heard wrong.
not_available Mr.
not_available Patterson's condition needed immediate surgical attention, did it not? It depends on what you mean by "immediate.
not_available " 
not_available You had to operate that day.
not_available Within the next 24 hours.
not_available The endoscopic surgery is certainly the fastest procedure, correct? 
not_available Among other benefits.
not_available So it was more convenient for you.
not_available I base my surgical opinions on what I perceive to be in the best interests of the patient.
not_available The recovery, how
not_available Let me try again.
not_available Perhaps you didn't hear the question.
not_available The endoscopic surgery was faster and easier on your schedule than the alternate open procedure.
not_available Of course, but
not_available Thank you.
not_available How long does the endoscopic procedure take? My schedule had nothing whatsoever to do with my advice to Mr.
not_available Patterson.
not_available Please strike that as nonresponsive.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, how long does the endoscopic procedure take to perform? About an hour.
not_available But you performed Mr.
not_available Patterson's endoscopic discectomy in 42 minutes.
not_available Correct? I don't know.
not_available I'd have to check the operative report.
not_available If the operative report stated that you were in the O.R less than 43 minutes, would you say that's correct? It could be.
not_available Do you have any reason to doubt the veracity of the operative report? No.
not_available Would it surprise you that of the 87 endoscopic discectomies you performed before November 16, your fastest time was 54 minutes? Twelve minutes slower than Mr.
not_available Patterson.
not_available Objection.
not_available You're testifying, Bruce.
not_available It's a question.
not_available She can count.
not_available Would that surprise you? Let's move on.
not_available Did you know the fastest you performed this procedure was 12 minutes slower than Mr.
not_available Patterson's surgery? I do now.
not_available You don't time yourself? 
not_available It's not a race.
not_available Then why did the circulating nurse remind you it was 10 to 6? Objection.
not_available Assumes facts not in evidence.
not_available Do you recall the circulating nurse reminding you that it was 10 to 6 while you were operating on Mr.
not_available Patterson? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Why did you need to be reminded? To keep me on schedule.
not_available What did you have scheduled after Mr.
not_available Patterson's surgery? I had an engagement.
not_available Someplace more important you had to be? No, and I resent the inference.
not_available What inference is that? That I rushed Mr.
not_available Patterson's surgery 
not_available to satisfy a personal obligation.
not_available That's it.
not_available We're taking a break.
not_available Did you rush? 
not_available Don't answer that.
not_available Did the nurse remind you of the time because you needed to leave by 6? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We're taking a break.
not_available Did you get that? 
not_available We're off the record.
not_available Stop typing.
not_available Now, I said we're taking a break.
not_available Let's go.
not_available All I wanted to do was talk to the owner.
not_available If I talked to him, I knew he'd hire me.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene had a seizure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've never understood people who make themselves feel big by making other people feel small.
not_available Let me tell you.
not_available I've got experience.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available You know what? She was threatened.
not_available She knew I could outsell her.
not_available She knew it.
not_available So she sent that Neanderthal in on me.
not_available You know why? She was threatened.
not_available Did you even have an interview? Of course I had an interview.
not_available Until she chased me into the window.
not_available God, this is bad! This is bad.
not_available You need stitches.
not_available Here.
not_available Sit down.
not_available We'll get an x
not_available ray and make sure there's no glass in it.
not_available Keep pressure on it.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available All right.
not_available Abby.
not_available Abby.
not_available You're mad at me.
not_available No, Mom, I'm not mad at you.
not_available I thought you would be mad.
not_available Sit down.
not_available I have plenty of experience.
not_available Plenty of experience.
not_available Do you think I'm gonna put up with that? Well, I'm not.
not_available I'm not gonna put up with that.
not_available See if I don't.
not_available I hate people like that.
not_available I have so much more experience than you.
not_available I don't think she's gonna say anything.
not_available It seems like she wants us to get this girl.
not_available I gave you the name.
not_available Why don't you pick the girl up? We have to get it from her.
not_available What if she doesn't say anything? Depends.
not_available We can bring in the D.A., maybe a judge.
not_available There's fluid in the maxillary sinus.
not_available No depressed fracture.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Kynesha, there are a couple of guys out here that need to talk to you.
not_available No! No way! I told you I don't know nothing! 
not_available Looks like you're feeling better.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got my prescription refilled.
not_available Do you want to see me take it? Thanks for helping me out.
not_available Sure.
not_available You want to tell me what happened? Not particularly.
not_available You know, I did treat you.
not_available Technically, I am your doctor.
not_available Anything you tell me is confidential.
not_available Okay, doctor.
not_available It's quite simple.
not_available I have a brain tumor.
not_available What? 
not_available Glioblastoma multiforme.
not_available Bummer, huh? Gets better.
not_available I found out that it's inoperable.
not_available Mark.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well You're up.
not_available What are you gonna do? Die, I guess.
not_available After today, I probably won't be able to work anymore, so Did you get a second opinion? They double
not_available checked the biopsy.
not_available No, by another neurosurgeon.
not_available There's gotta be a clinical trial going on someplace.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Looking into it.
not_available Looks like they need you.
not_available Are you gonna be okay? Stupid question, Carter.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Try and keep the rumors from spreading before I get a chance to talk to Elizabeth.
not_available Sure.
not_available Do you know what time it is? 
not_available 2:47.
not_available Correct, but it's not the right answer.
not_available It's not? No, the right answer is "yes" or "no.
not_available " Yes or no when possible.
not_available Don't elaborate.
not_available Not all questions have a yes or no answer.
not_available I understand.
not_available Yes or no when possible.
not_available Don't elaborate.
not_available We don't win cases in deposition, but we can lose them.
not_available At best, this stain follows you for the rest of your career.
not_available At worst, you lose your license.
not_available We're not here to win an argument.
not_available This is about information.
not_available He's looking to gain information to use against you in court.
not_available We're looking to limit that information.
not_available You mean hide the truth.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available How many do you think? Stitches? 
not_available Four.
not_available Five.
not_available Five? You're so good at this.
not_available You're so gentle.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's hard to believe because you have such great, big, masculine hands.
not_available Sit still.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Eyelash.
not_available See? Okay, now you have to make a wish and blow.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll blow for you.
not_available What did you wish for? Don't tell me.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're sorry for what? It's part of the disease.
not_available Yes.
not_available We're going to now apologize for your diseased mother, are we? Are we? She's always misbehaving.
not_available Abby never wanted me around her friends.
not_available She was always ashamed.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Ashamed and embarrassed.
not_available You think I don't know? 
not_available Let him finish your hand.
not_available You would walk right by me and pretend you didn't know me.
not_available You'd pretend I didn't exist.
not_available Let him finish your hand and shut up! Don't sass me! I'm your mother! 
not_available Not by choice.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay! Do you want a 5 of Haldol? 
not_available No! Abby, I'm sorry! Abby, I'm sorry.
not_available Do you want 5 of Haldol? I don't want Haldol! 
not_available Behave, and we won't give you anything.
not_available Don't! You let me go! I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I am leaving! No! No! You want a 5 of Haldol? Get restraints, stat! Start an IV! Abby! Abby! Abby, no! Don't let them do this to me! Abby! Don't let them 
not_available Starting a line with saline.
not_available Here! Arm restraints! Okay, call Psych.
not_available Put her on the monitor.
not_available Please! Please don't let them do this, Abby! 
not_available Come on, Maggie.
not_available Calm down.
not_available No! Maggie! Maggie! 
not_available Don't! Don't! You're my daughter, you little bitch! Make them stop! They're ready to start again.
not_available You okay? You look a little peaked.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available We're getting to the critical stage.
not_available If you don't feel you can maintain your composure
not_available No.
not_available No, I want to get this over with.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's he doing here? 
not_available It's his deposition.
not_available He has a right to be here, like you have a right to be at our depositions.
not_available Don't they have to tell us? 
not_available He's here to rattle you.
not_available Just stay calm.
not_available Pretend he's not there.
not_available Pretend he's not there.
not_available Don't let it affect your testimony.
not_available Ready to start? Yes.
not_available Okay? You removed the restraints? I can admit her voluntarily, but she doesn't meet the criteria for a hold.
not_available She ran through a plate
not_available glass window.
not_available An accident.
not_available She's not gravely disabled.
not_available Not a danger to herself or others.
not_available That's debatable.
not_available She's rapid
not_available cycling.
not_available Probably experiencing a drug
not_available induced mania.
not_available Blood alcohol's 0.092.
not_available Well, that'll do it.
not_available So do you want me to admit her? 
not_available I don't care.
not_available Okay, I'll do it.
not_available She wants to talk to you.
not_available She's remorseful.
not_available She wants to apologize.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Abby, I'm sorry.
not_available Hey, Maggie 
not_available I'll go in the hospital.
not_available I'll get better.
not_available Go back inside.
not_available Back to bed.
not_available I'll get better.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'll get better.
not_available I'll get better.
not_available Get some frozen peas.
not_available Reuse them every four hours on your face for 20 minutes.
not_available You can take some ibuprofen for the pain.
not_available I want you to come back for a recheck.
not_available Hey, he was my nephew.
not_available You knew I had to do something.
not_available LOL, complains of weakness 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good luck.
not_available while under a hair dryer.
not_available Ma'am, were you having any chest pain or shortness of breath? No, dear.
not_available The dryer was just set too high.
not_available Okay.
not_available EKG, CBC, Chem
not_available 7 and get a chest.
not_available I'll be right with you, Mrs.
not_available Fruhman.
not_available Thank you, dear.
not_available They think they're gonna find the shooters who killed Jesse.
not_available Good.
not_available I hope it helps.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cleo I got angry, you know? And I got you angry.
not_available You're the only thing in my life that makes sense right now.
not_available You know, I'm trying to say I'm, you know, sorry.
not_available Buy me some dinner.
not_available I'll consider your apology.
not_available Well, then in your medical opinion, what caused the meningocele that cut off the blood supply to Mr.
not_available Patterson's spinal cord? A leak of CSF, cerebrospinal fluid from the dura, which covers the spinal canal.
not_available Which means you must have punctured the dura during the procedure.
not_available That seems evident now, yes.
not_available It wasn't evident during the procedure? 
not_available No.
not_available It was evident to the anesthesiologist.
not_available Objection.
not_available Argumentative.
not_available According to the operative report, Dr.
not_available Babcock, the anesthesiologist drew your attention to spinal fluid in the surgical field at 10 to 6.
not_available Correct? 
not_available No.
not_available The note says 10 to 6, doesn't it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So the report is wrong? 
not_available No.
not_available He did draw my attention to fluid.
not_available Fluid we now know to be spinal fluid.
not_available No.
not_available What could it have been, doctor? 
not_available Saline.
not_available But you understood the anesthesiologist was concerned it might be spinal fluid? Yes.
not_available How did you satisfy yourself that it wasn't? I suctioned the irrigation saline and did not see any persistent CSF.
not_available Did you look? I can't operate without looking.
not_available Well, given that it was 10 to 6, that you were in a hurry the nurse simultaneously reminding you of your date
not_available Objection.
not_available Can we get to a question, Bruce? Did you perform a complete and competent inspection of the field to ensure there were no CSF leaks? Sometimes leaks are so small you cannot detect them visually.
not_available Nevertheless, did you perform a thorough inspection? That's procedure.
not_available And you followed procedure by performing a thorough inspection? Objection.
not_available Asked and answered.
not_available It's been asked.
not_available It has not been answered.
not_available What was the question? Did you perform a thorough and competent inspection specifically looking for possible CSF leaks before you closed? Yes.
not_available Where did you go? I was looking for you.
not_available I took a walk.
not_available Got a cup of coffee.
not_available You didn't get my page? 
not_available I knew what it was about.
not_available Legaspi was trying to find a bed for your mom, and she just took off.
not_available I figured.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thought you'd want to check your apartment
not_available She's not there.
not_available You checked? 
not_available No.
not_available This is the end of the cycle.
not_available Our cycle.
not_available She disappears.
not_available And for months, I don't know where she is or what she's doing or if she's alive.
not_available And then eventually, she'll turn up somewhere, and I'll have to deal with it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available I knew how it would end when she showed up.
not_available It's the dance we do.
not_available You get lost in it for a little while, but it always ends the same.
not_available Do you? 
not_available You ready? Yeah.
not_available Carter, I forgot to tell Weaver enzymes are pending on Mr.
not_available Albe in 4.
not_available I'll tell her.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good night, Carter.
not_available You coming in? 
not_available I don't want to intrude.
not_available They're probably just eating.
not_available Jackie makes so much food anyway.
not_available They need some time to themselves.
not_available I'll wait for an invitation.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll just grab some stuff for tomorrow.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I went to the store, like you said.
not_available Jackie see you? 
not_available No.
not_available You can't be here.
not_available The cops was hooking up the cousins.
not_available They gonna think it was me! Have you been home yet? 
not_available No.
not_available They're gonna kill me! I'm dead! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available I talked to the cops.
not_available I can't go home.
not_available I told you this was gonna happen.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available I'll figure out something.
not_available Mark? I'm up here.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Just thinking.
not_available How did it go? Terribly.
not_available What happened? What? What is it? I lied.
not_available I lied.
not_available The fact is, I rushed.
not_available I rushed through and didn't inspect the entire surgical field.
not_available That man will never walk again because I wanted to get out early for the weekend.
not_available And I couldn't even claim responsibility.
not_available I sat there, and I swore to God, and I lied to save myself.
not_available God owes us one.
not_available I think you're allowed to be selfish for a while.
not_available I didn't run into a street sign.
not_available I had a biopsy.
not_available Those headaches weren't from hockey.
