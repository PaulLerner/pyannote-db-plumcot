not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Does she really need to be here for this? Actually, I have a patient.
not_available Well, that was elegant.
not_available Look, you can't expect me to do low
not_available priority administrative work while I'm clocking more clinical shifts than anybody in my department.
not_available You're overburdened.
not_available That's why I asked Dr.
not_available Lewis to pitch in.
not_available How? Covering meetings, overseeing teaching in your absence.
not_available Which is what Chief Resident does.
not_available Carter's not an Attending.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis is.
not_available Why are you doing this? 
not_available I'm feeling unappreciated here.
not_available I'm trying to lighten your load.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available You're jerking my chain.
not_available Why would I do that? 
not_available Because you can.
not_available Well, for the time being, consider Dr.
not_available Lewis your unofficial assistant.
not_available No, I don't need any help! And try to keep the public displays of affection to a minimum.
not_available This is a workplace, not a parade.
not_available I have messages for you, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So you're gay, huh? Yeah, Frank.

not_available Was she embarrassed? Kind of hard not to be when you're puking your guts out.
not_available Know what the worst part about it was? You had to put her to bed? It was a 40year
not_available old bottle of Bordeaux! Is this a new thing? She's been taking them for years.

not_available I guess.

not_available Great.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen, if you change your mind, call me, okay? And hang in there.
not_available Love you.
not_available She's been on the toilet all night.
not_available I'm not sure, but that may be more than I need to know.
not_available So Romano conned you into picking up the slack, huh? Oh, God! I agreed to help.
not_available Was that stupid? A little bit around the edges.
not_available Kerry's lucky to have you.
not_available I don't think she sees it that way.
not_available She's never liked me.
not_available She doesn't like anyone.
not_available Don't people work around here? Glutton for punishment, huh?

not_available I'm not stupid.
not_available I do okay.
not_available It's not easy to get someone to measure my insulin.
not_available But that's life.
not_available Look, you know, I'm just here for the toenails, right? Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You know, they're getting worse all week.
not_available I think it was the new shoes.
not_available When did you have them clipped? 
not_available Oh, April maybe.
not_available They're pretty overgrown.
not_available Well, listen.
not_available You think it's hard to get someone to give you a sugar shot just try asking them to clip these puppies.
not_available Well, you know, I can do that for you.
not_available Of course you can.
not_available You're a gifted doctor.
not_available Or at least you will be.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Someone smells beautiful.
not_available Bless you.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available I've heard a lot about you.
not_available I mean, good things.
not_available And the bad things aren't really your fault.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Manny has a sixth sense about people.
not_available Or so he says.
not_available Well, with my eyes I had to get something out of the deal.
not_available What is this? It's Mr.
not_available Kindlevich's Seeing Eye dog.
not_available Well, where's his harness? 
not_available He isn't official.
not_available But trust me.
not_available He's my eyes.
not_available I need him.
not_available All right.
not_available Just keep him on a leash, a short one.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Dr.
not_available Chen, can I speak with you privately? What do you want? You know, eventually this has to stop.
not_available This attitude, this resentment you have towards me.
not_available Does it? 
not_available We have to work together.
not_available I can't allow patient care to be compromised because you dislike me.
not_available I wouldn't let that happen.
not_available Good.
not_available Because the last thing I need is a divisive medical staff.
not_available Then maybe you should quit.
not_available The police want to talk to you.
not_available I told them to wait until after your daughter's surgery.
not_available Has it started? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I should have told him about the threats.
not_available We're trying to create stem cells.
not_available Using embryos? DNA.
not_available Cloning.
not_available This was meant for me, not him.
not_available Not Jessica.
not_available Could I observe the surgery? 
not_available It's probably not a good idea.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available You're also a mother.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Easy, kid.
not_available Easy.
not_available Almost there.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available Damn medical students! He's all bark.
not_available You know, you remind him of his son.
not_available I'm black, sir.
not_available I can't see.
not_available Did you want two sets of cultures? 
not_available My best friend Eddie has the flu.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's a lot of that going around.
not_available We were shooting outside.
not_available It's freezing.
not_available I tried to tell the photographer.
not_available He wouldn't listen.
not_available Abby is gonna draw some of your blood.
not_available I have a good vein here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available Exhale.
not_available You don't have to watch.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Just a couple more vials and we'll be all done.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available I have other patients.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's the head.
not_available You want to play with it? Hi! 
not_available Are you feeling any better? Hardly.
not_available Is she keeping you busy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I tried to get her down for a nap earlier, but she wouldn't do it.
not_available Sometimes stroking her earlobes helps lull her to sleep.
not_available Can I get you anything to eat? Oh, Rachel, I don't think I can keep anything down.
not_available How about some tea? Sure.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hello, sweetie pie.
not_available Careful.
not_available You don't want to get her sick.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why did I wear these shoes? Because you forgot that around here
not_available Comfort first.
not_available Yes.
not_available No, I didn't forget.
not_available It's just I'm not ready to go back to ugly, sensible shoes.
not_available I heard that you did some really nice work in that trauma today.
not_available Doesn't count if they don't make it.
not_available Why did you treat pyelo with Bactrim? Because the PMD sent a culture two days ago.
not_available I have the sensitivities.
not_available There's been resistance to Bactrim.
not_available Not for her.
not_available Well, if you don't have a culture, you start with Levaquin or an aminoglycoside.
not_available Hey, looks like you made a friend.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey, knock it off.
not_available Gallant, get this dog out of here.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available This is a hospital, not a kennel.
not_available What'd I do? Tried to let her off the hook.
not_available Whose side are you on? I'm not on anybody's side.
not_available I'm trying to play this very neutral.
not_available No.
not_available You have to be on someone's side.
not_available It better be mine.
not_available Deb, she's my boss.
not_available You like her, don't you? I don't dislike her.
not_available That makes a lot of sense.
not_available What makes a lot of sense? 
not_available Oh, your taste.
not_available Excuse me? John, it's obvious.
not_available You have a thing for older women.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Weaver, Lewis and, oh, that pediatric surgeon.
not_available What was her name? Oh, come on! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Younger women just too much for you? I can handle myself either way.
not_available Yeah, sure you can.
not_available Your mom's asking for you.
not_available What do you want to tell her? Where's my kid? 
not_available I'm with a patient.
not_available What'd you do with my kid? How's the leg? 
not_available Much better.
not_available What you got? 
not_available Leslie, unrestrained driver.
not_available Slow
not_available speed MVA.
not_available Drove her car into some bushes.
not_available Found her and daughter on the curb.
not_available Only injury's a scalp lac.
not_available Where's the daughter? 
not_available Behind us.
not_available Hey, Leslie.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Oh, I just bet you are, sweet face.
not_available BP, 130/80, no LOC.
not_available And enough alcohol 
not_available on her breath to start a fire.
not_available Hey, I resent 
not_available Hi.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Stacy Miller.
not_available Thirteen years old.
not_available No LOC.

not_available You feeling pain anywhere? 
not_available Yeah, a big one.
not_available You guys a bunch of frigging perverts or something? In my ass.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available That looks pretty superficial.
not_available What? The cut on your head.
not_available There's a cut on my head? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just kidding.
not_available You know
not_available Softer hands, honey.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But I ain't "honey. Why is everybody so serious around here? A pretty serious thing happened to you.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available See, this is a bump.
not_available What's seriously wrong is what's in here.
not_available You having chest pain? I have a broken heart.
not_available Two great weeks, and he leaves me without a word.
not_available What the hell kind of fiancé is that? Trauma panel, urine tox and a dip.
not_available B.A.L.
not_available and hang a banana bag.
not_available Suture kit? 
not_available I'll get it.
not_available "Banana bag"? Is that the daughter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Lucky me, huh? Stacy, we need to get you into a gown so I can examine your chest and belly.
not_available I said I wasn't hurt.
not_available You want to get out of here, right? Go home, clean the house.
not_available Get your homework done.
not_available How did you know? 
not_available I'm very smart.
not_available Besides, the quicker you get into this, the quicker you get out.
not_available At least you were being responsible.
not_available Mom says seat belts are too confining.
not_available Nice example to set, driving drunk and beltless.
not_available She wasn't driving.
not_available I was.
not_available You're 13.
not_available Almost 14.
not_available You don't have a driver's license.
not_available Neither does my mom.
not_available She still drives.
not_available I just take over when she's had too much to drink.
not_available You been doing this for a while now? Three years.
not_available Not one accident.
not_available Till now.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be right back.
not_available We just need to get some more supplies.
not_available That is completely nuts.
not_available Or brilliant, depending on your point of view.
not_available A 13year
not_available old driving her lush mom is good? No.
not_available But neither is a lush mom driving her 13year
not_available old around.
not_available Somebody's gotta be the adult.
not_available Everything was going along fine Elizabeth, you awake? What's wrong? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She's sweaty.
not_available And she just started crying.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Did you give her milk? 
not_available No.
not_available Just mashed bananas.
not_available Here, just take her a moment.
not_available I'll just get the thermometer.
not_available Oh, sweetie.
not_available How long's she been crying? Elizabeth, she just threw up.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available Oh, come here, sweetie.
not_available Maybe she caught what you have.
not_available Oh, it's okay.
not_available What's this? What? 
not_available Get the phone.
not_available What is it? It's a pill fragment.
not_available She swallowed something.
not_available Oh, my God! Her heart's pounding.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Rachel! It's okay, sweetie pie.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.

not_available What's your address? 
not_available Yes.
not_available 1211 Dupont Drive.
not_available Please hurry.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available DUI's a pretty serious offense.
not_available Yeah, but letting her sober daughter drive was worse? I don't know if it's worse.
not_available It's child endangerment.
not_available You gotta get Social Services involved.
not_available Stacy goes into foster care? That may not be such a bad thing.
not_available So you want to call the cops, or should I? Abby, we need to find Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Okay.
not_available Abby? 
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I got a little busy there.
not_available Has his fever broke? No.
not_available And he's very uncomfortable.
not_available No one's given him anything to eat.
not_available I'll make sure he gets something.
not_available I talked to the Pedes Oncology fellow.
not_available He's gonna come see him.
not_available Aren't you going to do something? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I sent off his labs.
not_available No, I mean in terms of treating him.
not_available There's no obvious infection.
not_available The oncologist can take it from here.
not_available It may be a while, if you want to go home.
not_available I can't leave.
not_available His foster parents still can't get here? No.
not_available Somebody from the center can relieve you.
not_available I'm from the center.
not_available Are you sure that you want to do this? I mean, stay involved? Do you think she'll remember him? When my daughter was 6 she broke her arm in two places riding her bike.
not_available And the only thing she remembers from that year is seeing Muppets on Ice.
not_available They remember the good things.
not_available She won't forget her father.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Brower.
not_available Yes? I'm Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available I finished my part of the surgery, which went well.
not_available Will they need to amputate? She's a doctor.
not_available There's stable bone on the remaining digits blood supply and enough skin to cover grafts.

not_available But kids can adapt.
not_available Corday and the paramedics are on their way with your daughter.

not_available They didn't say.
not_available Who didn't say? 
not_available I didn't take the call.
not_available Haleh did.
not_available What are her vitals? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available I knew she was doing this.
not_available I knew it.
not_available I should have trusted my instincts.
not_available I gotta take the stairs.
not_available Move! Move! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I got the charcoal! We need a Pedes ICU bed! Where are they?

not_available Oh, God! 
not_available She's diaphoretic.
not_available Let's get a rectal temp.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy.
not_available What? I'm not sure how.
not_available She's sympathomimetic toxidrome.
not_available And we couldn't get a line in the rig.
not_available Where was it? 
not_available What? It was in her backpack! She had four pills.
not_available Two have disappeared.
not_available And Ella vomited a fragment of one.
not_available Bolus 100 of IV saline.
not_available Ten milligrams of charcoal by NG.
not_available Prep a milligram of Ativan.

not_available I'm gonna try an interosseous.
not_available No! No! She's got a good antecubital! Oh, God! 
not_available Heart rate's 250.
not_available Looks like a narrow
not_available complex SVT.
not_available I need a glove full of ice.
not_available And prep one of adenosine.

not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available Come on, sweetheart.

not_available We need to break tachycardia! The CHF is raterelated! Could somebody get me a stool, please? 
not_available Still in SVT.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yes, I'm fine.
not_available Worry about my daughter! 
not_available We're gonna need the crash cart.
not_available What? 
not_available She's hypoxic with pulmonary edema in SVT.
not_available The protocol is to synch cardiovert at half a joule per kilo.
not_available No! No, we're not shocking her.
not_available She's hemodynamically stable.
not_available Maybe we should get Dr.
not_available Weaver in here.
not_available No.
not_available Let's try two of adenosine.
not_available Abby, get Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kindlevich, you still being treated? No, discharged.
not_available Just waiting for the van to pick us up.
not_available Stinky! 
not_available Why don't you have a seat? Here we go.

not_available He never leaves.
not_available Well, I'm sure he'll be back soon.
not_available Stinky! Stinky? Is that you? Stinky? Stinky? Oh, Stinky! Oh, Stinky.
not_available He needed to take care of business.
not_available Gallant, you're a student, not a dog walker.
not_available Bless you.
not_available I think I'm allergic to dogs.
not_available Apparently.
not_available Next time use a plastic bag.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver! They need you in Trauma 1.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's daughter's in trouble.
not_available Second round's onboard.
not_available Stats down to 90.
not_available Put her up to 50 litres of O

not_available Yes.
not_available Have? 
not_available Push 3 adenosine.
not_available Mark, we both know how difficult it can be working on a family member.
not_available Okay, get ready with diltiazem.
not_available And your own child in particular.
not_available I got it, Kerry.
not_available No.
not_available No, you need to step aside.
not_available I said I've got it, Kerry.
not_available Calcium channel blockers can cause cardiovascular collapse and death in kids under 1.
not_available Mark.
not_available Push one milligram of Inderal.
not_available You're soaking wet.
not_available Please.
not_available Your pulse's thready.
not_available You have a fever.
not_available It's just gastroenteritis.
not_available Sinus rhythm.
not_available Thank God! 
not_available Number 8 French NG for the charcoal.
not_available Let's get Elizabeth to bed.
not_available And run in two litres of saline.
not_available I'm not leaving! If you don't, you're gonna pass out.
not_available That won't help anyone, least of all Ella.
not_available She's okay.
not_available She's stable now, okay? Go lie down.
not_available I want to be able to see her.
not_available I'll set you up in Exam 2.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available Pulse ox is down to 88.
not_available Lungs are full of fluid.

not_available Think about intubation.
not_available I can get her out of failure.
not_available She's retracting.
not_available Using accessory muscles.
not_available She's in respiratory distress.
not_available Give the diuretics a chance to work.
not_available Put her in the Broselow tape.
not_available Bag her on 100 percent.
not_available No.
not_available You'll hyperinflate the stomach! 
not_available Mark, your baby is hypoxic.
not_available You want to avoid unnecessary procedures.
not_available But if we don't intubate, you're making a big mistake.
not_available Now, step aside.
not_available RateThe failure was rate
not_available related.
not_available We broke the SVT.
not_available But now she's in pulmonary edema.
not_available If this wasn't your baby, we would have intubated her a long time ago.
not_available I'm trying to save her life.
not_available Pre
not_available medicate with.
not_available 2 of atropine, Induce with 3.2 of etomidate and paralyze with 22 of sux.

not_available A number
not_available one straight blade.
not_available Call for a Pedes vent.
not_available Tidal volume of 100 cc's.
not_available We should be doing something.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available They got three doctors.
not_available I think we'd just be in the way.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you hear how it happened? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It is amazing the drugs that kids can get ahold of.
not_available Oh, my God! Is that Rachel? Yeah.
not_available John? Mickey's been upstairs an hour.
not_available He hasn't been seen by a doctor.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's not uncommon.
not_available Well, it's unacceptable.
not_available I was gonna get coffee.
not_available You want some? Yes.
not_available I'd love some.
not_available I was hoping you could tell me what all this means.
not_available You stole his lab slips? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I heard that they were back but no one gave us the results.
not_available What is it? He's in blast crisis.
not_available He's had a recurrence.
not_available His bone marrow's full of leukemia cells.
not_available He's not gonna be able to fight infection.
not_available Is there something we can do? 
not_available I'm sure they're giving him antibiotics.
not_available The oncologist will know exactly what to do.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available But he's just a number to them.
not_available Maybe if you spoke to the doctors, they'd take him more personally.
not_available Why are you doing this? You've been here all day.
not_available You've been holding his hand, clipping his chart, bugging the staff.
not_available I'm trying to help a sick child.
not_available Mom, he has leukemia.
not_available I know that.
not_available And he may not survive.
not_available If you've got some kind of twisted need to relive this, that's fine.
not_available I'm not gonna do it again.
not_available I made my peace a long time ago.
not_available Let's pull the tube back five millimeters.

not_available At the carina.
not_available You should be in bed.
not_available Heart rate's down to 100.
not_available Pulse ox is 99.
not_available When can we extubate? They'll probably keep her sedated in the PICU rest her overnight in the vent and extubate her first thing in the morning.
not_available Mark, we need them to get a rollaway in the room.
not_available I'm staying the night.
not_available Elizabeth, you're sick.
not_available Well, you're not leaving, are you? 
not_available No.
not_available Mark? 
not_available I found her wandering the hallway.

not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're sorry? Mark? 
not_available Stay out of this.
not_available You bring drugs into our house and leave them out for a baby? 
not_available It wasn't mine.
not_available Stop lying! They were for a party.
not_available I wasn't sure I was gonna take them.
not_available Your sister did.
not_available But she's gonna be okay, right? It was one pill.
not_available Are you really that stupid? Ella is 9 months old! 
not_available I know.
not_available She almost died.
not_available Dad, don't
not_available Don't what? What? Don't call you a liar? Because that's what you are! You promised you weren't doing drugs! I'm sorry.

not_available She could still die! 
not_available I know, Dad! Please, please, Dad.
not_available I'm sorry! Dad, I'm
not_available Daddy, I'm sorry.
not_available Dad, I'm 
not_available She still seems a little warm.
not_available We'll get a repeat temp.
not_available She can have ibuprofen by NG.
not_available I'll check the orders.
not_available Is this the overdose? Do we have a post

not_available Let's see how she's satting on 70 percent.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You're not touching her.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available Page me another doctor.
not_available There's no one else on service.
not_available If we're going to control toxicity 
not_available we need to wean down the oxygen.
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, I want my own pediatrician.
not_available Is this your daughter? 
not_available You are not touching her! I have to.
not_available I'm the Critical Care Attending.

not_available Kerry? Yeah.
not_available How's she doing? Vitals are stable.
not_available Satting well on 50 percent.

not_available Yeah, we've got a long ways to go.
not_available My prayers are with you all.
not_available Kerry thank you.
not_available Taking off? 
not_available Yep.
not_available If I hang around here much longer, I'm gonna start to cry.
not_available Is your mom still upstairs? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Don't care? Hi.
not_available Hey, I thought you left.
not_available I wanted to say thanks.
not_available The officer said that they'd book her for the DUI but that I could post bail in a couple hours.
not_available Wait.
not_available They're charging your mother with the DUI? And I made an appointment at that treatment center.
not_available Great.
not_available But you were driving.
not_available No, I wasn't.
not_available I thought you said she was driving.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available What? Anyway, I gotta catch a bus.
not_available Good luck.
not_available You said you were gonna call the police.
not_available You said I was gonna call.
not_available I asked, "Will you take care of this?" She's her mother's best chance for recovery.
not_available I think you know that.
not_available Good night, Carter.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey, Gallant.
not_available Your guy's dead.
not_available Hey.

not_available Good night.
not_available Stinky! What are you doing here? I've been trying to catch him.

not_available And I don't like your name.

not_available Well, of course it is.
not_available But
not_available Joyce? Joyce, you in there? No, no, no, no.
not_available Don't go.
not_available He's probably just looking anyplace he can think of.
not_available Open up, damn it! 
not_available I'm calling the police.
not_available No.
not_available It'll just make it worse.
not_available He just needs to calm down.
