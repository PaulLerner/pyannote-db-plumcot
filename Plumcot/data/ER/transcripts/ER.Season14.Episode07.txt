
not_available "A third straight day" of unseasonably hot weather reaching into triple figures has resulted in sporadic power failures.
not_available Soon they'll be blaming this on global warming.
MORETTl All those years of plastic cups and Styrofoam are coming home to roost.
not_available So because I've used spraycan deodorant my whole life " now" I'm supposed to feel guilty about the resurgence of the malaria in Kenya? You talk so crazy, Frank.
not_available I read it in the paper.
not_available I read that cow farts are gonna be the death of us.
not_available Cow farts? We eat too much livestock, which release gases into the atmosphere killing the ozone.
not_available Thank you, Al Gore.
not_available I would rather drop dead right now over a bone
not_available in rib eye than live forever on organic spinach.
not_available The truth is very inconvenient.
not_available I don't know about the rest of you, but I have gotten smart.
not_available I hooked up with a tight, little sex machine.
not_available Energyefficient to the tune of 40
not_available plus miles per gallon and draws babes to Archie like bees to honey.
not_available Oh, that made me throw up in my mouth a little.
not_available Me too.
not_available What about Hope? Didn't you take an oath of fidelity or something? She's saving starving kids in v enezuela, you're out here cruising for chicks? Hope, Hope, Hope? Oh, that Hope.
not_available Yeah, we broke up.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available You did? I'm sorry.
not_available No, no big deal, it was very mutual.
not_available That's good.
not_available Except it was her idea, I begged her not to do it.
not_available But I'm fine with it now, it's all good.

not_available Oh, don't forget the clutch, dummy.
not_available You said I could teach him to drive your car today.
not_available I did? 
not_available Yeah, you did.
not_available No, that was before I hooked up my new wheels.
not_available But 
not_available You have new wheels? Cool.
not_available No, no, not cool.
not_available I'm not gonna let some prepubescent intern ding up my chick magnet.
not_available Is it? For reals? This car makes a statement.
not_available And that statement is "I am bringing sexy back.
not_available " 
not_available Sweet.
not_available Hello? He's got his homecoming.
not_available He wants to drive his date.
not_available Give the kid a break.

not_available I heard she was in the circus.
not_available She does look flexible.
not_available All right.

not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Now, let's run down a few things here.
not_available Harold, the brake.
not_available Hey, wait a minute.
not_available Harold, Harold.
not_available Be careful, Harold.
not_available Stay aware of your surroundings.
not_available It's all about peripheral Uh! What we're talking about here is pain.
not_available Proactively treating it right here in Triage with you guys, all right? Most of you know how to use the Wong
not_available Baker scale.
not_available Any kid coming in, we assess the pain from zero to 10.
not_available Any score above zero, we give them analgesia.
not_available Put it on your charts.
not_available Docs will be checking.
not_available Someone's been Moretti
not_available sized.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Gates drank Kool
not_available Aid.
not_available How old? 
not_available Three months.
not_available She's been like this for hours.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fussy, crying.
not_available Probably the heat.
not_available Chuny, you take her back? 
not_available I got this.
not_available Come on, follow me.
not_available It's never been this bad before.
not_available All right, here, check this out.
not_available Guys, stop goofing around.
not_available Victim of auto versus pedestrian.
not_available Possible blunt head trauma.
not_available The car didn't hit me, I walked into it.
not_available I told them that.
not_available What's with the backboard? 
not_available Patient resisted treatment.
not_available I don't meet trauma center criteria.
not_available What do we have here? 
not_available Combative on scene.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available Little bit, little bit.
not_available Because I don't need any of this.
not_available He might need a head CT.
not_available Definite possibility.
not_available What? No, no, and I don't need spinal immobilization.
not_available No, you need an x
not_available ray, sir, before you take this off.
not_available No, the hell you do, and stop calling me sir.
not_available Could be a distracting injury.
not_available I'm gonna distract your face with my foot.
not_available Look.
not_available Huh? Huh? I'm fine.
not_available All this wasted energy is seriously inflating my carbon footprint.
not_available So are you refusing medical care, sir? 
not_available Yes, yes, I am.
not_available You're gonna sign a form indicating you're leaving ER against medical advice? You're wasting valuable time and resources on this silly, little comedy routine.
not_available Stupid doors.
not_available Next time that happens, give him a Foley in the field.
not_available Make sure your grandma follows up with the clinic visits, okay, Jeffrey? And a happy "L 'shanah tova" to you.
not_available Oh, nice try.
not_available Jewish New Year was two months ago.

not_available Oh, hello, thanks for having us.
not_available This is our first time in the ER.
not_available We're super excited.
not_available We mostly perform in Pedes.
not_available Love bringing joy to the little people.
not_available But this gives us a chance to dig a bit deeper into the old set list.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available All right, well, make yourself at home.
not_available Where'd you find them, God Camp? Oh, man, I almost forgot.
not_available Is it? It is.
not_available Today is the day.
not_available What day? D
not_available day or Independence Day.
not_available Starting to sound like Stupid Day.
not_available Don't push me, Sam.
not_available It's hot, I don't know where my smart car is.
not_available Greg and I get our board results today.
not_available I'm worried about him.
not_available I'm not sure he hit the books hard enough.
not_available Hey, vin Diesel, where's my car? 
not_available Parked around the corner.
not_available Gotta go to a laparotomy.
not_available Zelinsky, did you damage that vehicle? 
not_available No, not that I know of.
not_available Well, yeah, a little.
not_available What? Tiny ding on the fender.
not_available Miniscule.
not_available Gives it character.
not_available Personality.
not_available You'll hardly notice it, I gotta go.
not_available Air conditioner broke down at nursing home.
not_available Victims with hyperthermia and dehydration.
not_available Another five coming in the van.
not_available It turned our place into Kentucky Fried Old Folks.
not_available How you doing, sir? I did not survive a pogrom, a gulag and a bris in a back alley just so I could be baked like a strudel.
not_available This is J.J.
not_available Perkins, 80 years old.
not_available ALOC, history of hypertension.
not_available Previous MI, temp high of 104.
not_available Mr.
not_available Perkins.
not_available Thirsty.
not_available Positive O sign.
not_available Not good.
not_available Is he okay? We're roommates.
not_available Hey, Grady, get some more wheelchairs.
not_available Power shortage, my ass.
not_available The engineers are selling off the energy to the highest bidder just like they did in California.
not_available You know who's getting it all? The Pakis.
not_available Hey, where'd they put my buddy? Do you think our apartment's too hot for her? I can't say yet.
not_available Any vomiting or diarrhea? No, none of that.
not_available Does anything help to calm her down, car rides or noise machines? She doesn't like any noise, really.
not_available Even music.
not_available Well, I can't say I blame her for that right now.
not_available Our doctor thought it might be reflux, so she ordered the scope test.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available And? 
not_available Everything came out normal.
not_available Do you think it could be colic? Well, we have to rule out some other stuff first.
not_available How are you guys holding up? 
not_available Um It's been kind of hard.
not_available With the heat and the brownouts.
not_available She just seems so unhappy all the time.
not_available It gets easier.
not_available It does.
not_available I'm gonna run this by my supervisor.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Now, the next time that the power goes out don't go using jumper cables to juice up the a.
not_available c.
not_available Where I went wrong was I had the widescreen and massage chair hooked up to the same battery.
not_available See you.
not_available Threemonth
not_available old, intermittently crying times three months.
not_available The kid's whole life? If it's been that long, it's not an emergency.
not_available The kid looks okay, no signs of injury, and the exam's benign.
not_available Of course it is.
not_available Exam's always normal with babies like this.
not_available I'll check it out as soon as I can.
not_available I got to take care of this.
not_available Where is Gates? No, more importantly, where are our board results? Oh, they're not in yet.
not_available But the Vegas odds are 10to
not_available 1 you both failed.
not_available Tell Gates get rid of Captain &amp; Tenille.
not_available We're healing people, not driving them to suicide.
not_available Are you nervous about the results? No.
not_available Are you? No.
not_available You get those old folks all fixed up? 
not_available Moretti ordered evaporative cooling.
not_available I got Javier babysitting.
not_available All right, let me know if you need any help.
not_available Patient was in his usual state of excellent health until 1 p.
not_available m.
not_available Today when he got up from the living room Okay, stop.
not_available I'm bored and lost.
not_available You're gonna put him to sleep.
not_available But that's the history.
not_available Yes, presented in the most obtuse way.
not_available What do you think is wrong? 
not_available Dehydration.
not_available Okay, spit it out, so Mussolini doesn't eat you alive.
not_available And can you please shoot me or shoot them? I really don't care which.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available It's weird.
not_available Hi.
not_available This music seems to be soothing her.
not_available That is weird.
not_available My supervisor's on his way over.
not_available Okay, Grady, one more time.
not_available Sixtyfiveyear
not_available old man, syncopal episode after skipping breakfast and lunch.
not_available I know what you're thinking.
not_available No chest pains, palpitation, headache.
not_available That's what I'm talking about.
not_available Please, make them go away.
not_available I'm with her.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Get rid of them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Guys, what they're doing is a nice thing, okay? And some people actually like it.
not_available Oh, yeah, what people? Frank's not people.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Grady, break room.
not_available It's time to present, come on.
not_available Hey, here's an update, folks.
not_available Green Line is down.
not_available Scattered looting on the West Side.
not_available We got two x
not_available ray machines out.
not_available The temperature in the O.R.
not_available Is 84 degrees.
not_available And Oh, that's right, boys, the test scores are in.
not_available What? What? Why didn't you say so? Stop playing games, Frank.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Hey.
not_available You got us waiting like this.
not_available So did the Medical Board make another deadly error in judgment? 
not_available Yes, they have, Frank, I passed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Morris? Come on, baby.
not_available Yeah, it's good, it's all good.
not_available They passed, Morris and Pratt passed.
not_available My man, good stuff.
not_available All right, after work, drinks on me and Morris.
not_available You stole her, didn't you? "What?" 
not_available She's mine.
not_available "Says who?" 
not_available Says me.
not_available "Yeah, well, she came to me.
not_available " 
not_available Damn power.
not_available I keep telling you, it's the Pakis.
not_available Oh, that's not nice, honey.
not_available Chuny, how's Mrs.
not_available Lidner? Down to 99.
not_available She's perking up.
not_available Chest x
not_available ray clear, no hypernatremia.
not_available Hey, you should see this, J.J.
not_available It's very good.
not_available What's it called again? Grumpy Old Men.
not_available How's Mr.
not_available Perkins doing? 
not_available Oh, he's fine.
not_available Hey, he's better.
not_available Leave him alone.
not_available Minimally responsive.
not_available Tachy to 130, having some ectopy on the monitor.
not_available Hey, we were hot and thirsty.
not_available We don't need any more witchy medicine.
not_available Shh.
not_available Temp? The cooling blanket didn't help.
not_available He's still at 103.
not_available Mr.
not_available Perkins? Don't do that.
not_available What are you doing to him? Neck's stiff, are we missing meningitis? 
not_available Increased muscle tone.
not_available Let's go, Trauma 2.
not_available Blood cultures, two milligrams Ceftriaxone.
not_available Get head a CT.
not_available You're not a doctor.
not_available I want a real doctor.
not_available You're just some quack.
not_available Calm down.
not_available He's gonna be all right, right? Of course.
not_available Relax.
not_available Is that it? Worse when I press? Or let go? 
not_available The same.
not_available CT? White count is 11.2.
not_available Mildly inflamed appendix that doesn't fill with oral contrast.
not_available Looks like early appendicitis.
not_available Oh, jeez, I need surgery? Take it out laparoscopically, you'll be back home.
not_available Might we be jumping the gun here? An alternate diagnosis to consider.
not_available It could be epiploic appendagitis.
not_available Rather unlikely, doctor.
not_available So in terms of the laparoscopic 
not_available He hasn't been vomiting.
not_available He's got a normal white count.
not_available No single sign, symptom or test confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, okay? As I was saying 
not_available Just hold the phone.
not_available CT isn't impressive.
not_available Dr.
not_available Zelinsky.
not_available Harold.
not_available Dr.
not_available Zelinsky.
not_available I'm onto something, he'll get better with rest, nonsteroidals.
not_available He won't need surgery.
not_available So I don't need surgery? That's not what we're saying.
not_available His CT lacks all of the predictable findings to support your theory, okay? I don't want an unnecessary operation.
not_available Are you sure? Very sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra will be back to consent for surgery.
not_available I'll see you in the O.R.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks, Mary.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko, I'm interested in why you think that the CT shows no signs of an ovoid pericolic Shut up now.
not_available Go round.
not_available Drinks at Ike's on Morris and Pratt.
not_available They passed.
not_available Wow, great.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available I'd like to discuss Zelinsky's progress.
not_available Yeah, about that 
not_available Tomorrow, not now.
not_available Tomorrow? I don't wanna say anything cruel, which I'm at risk of doing at this moment.
not_available So we'll talk about Dr.
not_available Rain Man tomorrow.
not_available Can you help me out here, please, a little? You want me to fire the volunteers? Yes, in a nice way.
not_available Look, they love them in Pedes.
not_available They're a hit in Oncology.
not_available Why do you ER types have to be such snobs? Just do what God would do.
not_available Cast these people out.
not_available Nice, the mocking use of religious imagery always works with me.
not_available I'm just trying to speak to you in a language you understand.
not_available Bye.
not_available Still having ectopy.
not_available Three hundred amiodarone IV.
not_available So chest pain in 3 should've had an EKG and troponin.
not_available But the resident canceled the orders.
not_available He's breathing.
not_available Sats okay.
not_available Hey, Dawn, bring them in.
not_available What resident? 
not_available Lockhart, did you sign off on it? Must've been Pratt.
not_available I'm sure there was a good reason.
not_available What are you doing to J.
not_available J? Shh.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lefkowitz, did Mr.
not_available Perkins have any new pills at the home? Always giving us pills.
not_available You can't poop, they give you a pill.
not_available Complain about the government, you get a pill.
not_available Can you be more specific? Try to get people to vote for Obama, they got a pill for that too.
not_available "Papi," listen.
not_available Did they give J.J.
not_available Anything today? He got feisty, because it was so hot in there.
not_available Does this look familiar? How about this? Maybe this, it was yellow.
not_available Bingo, Haloperidol.
not_available I bet he's got neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
not_available Interesting theory.
not_available Dantrolene, a hundred milligrams IV.
not_available I'm pretty sure what we have here is a beautiful, healthy little girl with a bad case of colic.
not_available That's what the pediatrician said.
not_available Is there nothing you can do? No medicines you can give her? No, you just have to wait it out.
not_available But it's too hot to keep her all wrapped up like that.
not_available A book said to do that when she gets fussy.
not_available Not in this weather.
not_available Feel the blanket, she sweated right through it.
not_available That's normal.
not_available She gets all worked up when she feeds.
not_available Well, just hang in there.
not_available A nurse will be back with your discharge paperwork.
not_available Abby? Do me a favor.
not_available Get some kind of referral for new parenting group or something.
not_available That's it? You don't wanna do any more workup? For colic? No, why? 
not_available There's no need, it's classic.
not_available Well, it's not classic, actually.
not_available When I worked in OB, we did a lot of anticipatory guidance about this.
not_available Colic doesn't usually start until six weeks of life.
not_available Baby's been fussy since birth.
not_available Hasn't killed her.
not_available But the sweating when she feeds could be an It's a million degrees outside.
not_available Her parents keep her wrapped up.
not_available I have a feeling Look, this is a long
not_available term preexisting condition with no signs of abuse.
not_available Let them follow up with the pediatrician.
not_available And, Abby, relax, okay? You're now talking to a board
not_available certified attending.
not_available You still have to take the oral boards.
not_available Nothing but a mere technicality.
not_available See you at Ike's? So we done with them? The Birk baby? 
not_available Um, yeah.
not_available Hey, wait, no.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hold on, I just wanna check one more thing.
not_available Hey, you coming out tonight? It's Brownout Thursday at Ike's.
not_available Drinks half price if you bring a candle.
not_available I thought Pratt and Morris were buying.
not_available Only a round.
not_available Cheap bastards.
not_available Come on, let loose for a night.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available Your a.
not_available c.
not_available Is putting out air at 77 degrees through this duct.
not_available You mean, it's working? But it's 62 degrees at the compressor.
not_available That's a lot of waste.
not_available Hey, Frank, what's going on? Oh, the green Nazis are here.
not_available Oh, you must be the energy manager.
not_available Ethan Mackiner.
not_available And you are? Sam Taggart, charge nurse.
not_available I spoke to your office.
not_available We made sure to change all the incandescents for compact fluorescents.
not_available We're down to 30
not_available foot candles.
not_available That's very green of you.
not_available Just doing our part.
not_available Maybe you can show me where the utility access is.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come with me.
not_available I'm going out back and burn some tires with kerosene.
not_available You good with that? I'm leaving these for Sam.
not_available You're out of here already? What about the party? God, it's like junior high around here.
not_available Hi.
not_available Bye.
not_available Shift over already? Pratt's up to speed on my stuff.
not_available Your intern presented to me.
not_available Did he forget to kiss the ring? No, in fact, Grady was letter
not_available perfect.
not_available Which I'm sure had absolutely nothing to do with you.
not_available Absolutely nothing.
MORETTl Doctor.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I understand you've been canceling my preemptive orders.
not_available In selected cases, I have, yes.
not_available On what criteria? A 20year
not_available old with epigastric pain from ibuprofen doesn't need CBC, chem panel, UA.
not_available He needs to be sent home with some antacid.
not_available That's an exception.
not_available I mean, the system is the system, and the system is working.
not_available Yeah, not for me.
not_available I didn't go to med school to check boxes and push paper.
not_available When are you gonna stop with the end
not_available runs, huh? Huh? I mean, what is it? Feel comfortable with Dr.
not_available Pratt because you've worked with him? Or is this just like the path of least resistance? Or is it simply you just don't like me? What? You know, it doesn't matter.
not_available What, if I like you or not? 
not_available No, forget it.
not_available No, I don't like you.
not_available You know what? You do whatever the hell you want, okay? And I hope it all works out for you.
not_available Folks, local power grid might be going down.
not_available But don't worry, we're prepared.
not_available Somebody gonna make a toast or something? Nobody's saying anything until my partner in crime gets here.
not_available Oh, and by the way, I know I'm still on, so this is 7 and 7.
not_available Minus one of the sevens.
not_available Can you guess which one? 
not_available Hey, here he is.
not_available Hey.
not_available I can't stay long.
not_available Somebody's gotta mind the store.
not_available Well, then allow me.
not_available We are gonna talk later.
not_available I saw what you did to my car.
not_available Is he mad at me? 
not_available No.
not_available He is.
MORETTl fair amount of failures as well.
not_available But I think it's important that we all reflect and appreciate the milestones.
not_available So I would like to be the first to congratulate Dr.
not_available Pratt and Dr.
not_available Morris who will become newlyminted, soon to be board
not_available certified Attending emergency physicians.
not_available This chaplain thing is really more of a hobby.
not_available My true passion is hustling pool.
not_available I see.
not_available You know, I gotta tell you.
not_available To be honest with you, you don't really strike me as the chaplain type.
not_available And why is that? I don't know, you don't look the part.
not_available The way you dress, your vibe, your tat.
not_available Oh, I have lots of tats.
not_available Oh, yeah? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available What is that one? It's a labyrinth.
not_available It's a pretty common symbol, actually.
not_available In the Native American culture and the Vedas.
not_available The Minoans use it too.
not_available It represents life's real journey.
not_available The spiritual journey to the inner self.
not_available Reminds me every day that I have to constantly be seeking.
not_available And how easy it is to get lost.
not_available Have you been lost? Haven't you? So, what other tats you got? 
not_available Harold was just trying to impress you.
not_available I thought we weren't gonna talk now.
not_available I don't understand why you don't like him.
not_available He's unshaped, he's immature 
not_available Smart.
not_available That's not enough.
not_available He's a little rough around the edges.
not_available But instead of getting hung up about the presentation we should start commending him on the insight.
not_available And by we, I, of course, mean you.
not_available He's not ready to be a surgeon on my team, Neela.
not_available Lucien, he wants to be here so badly.
not_available And I believe he can do it.
not_available You really wanna mentor this kid? Well, if you agree not to kick him out.
not_available Give me a month? It's not just about turning him into a doctor, Neela.
not_available It's about turning him into an adult.
not_available Do you understand that? Oh, hey, guys, looks like I'm getting kicked out.
not_available Check you on the flip side.
not_available Okay, you got a month.
not_available It's weird to think of Morris and Pratt as the top of the heap.
not_available I still remember when Mark Greene and Doug Ross were running the place.
not_available Who? Hey, Sam.
not_available Hey.
not_available I came over as soon as I was done with my evaluation.
not_available This is Chuny.
not_available Hi.
not_available And Dawn.
not_available Hey.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Need anything from the bar? 
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available Apple martini.
not_available Coming up.
not_available Hello? What? What's up with the fine brother? He wanted to see if I wanted to have a drink after work What about your hunky beat cop? 
not_available You sly dog.
not_available No, no, no, it's not like that.
not_available Just You know that time in your life when you're in your teens or your early 20s? You know, when you get to look around see what you like and what you don't like? You mean, like positions? No, like, well, I never had that.
not_available And I think I should.
not_available So now is my chance.
not_available You know what I mean? 
not_available Oh, yeah, we know what you mean.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available The boy in the blue wasn't hitting that buzzer.
not_available Guys, that's not true.
not_available Apple martini.
not_available I miss something? Let's hope you don't.

not_available She's been drinking.
not_available Why'd you have to be bitchy? Okay, you can't call me a bitch.
not_available I didn't.
not_available You did.
not_available I said bitchy, not the same thing.
not_available Okay, here's how this is gonna go.
not_available You won't be getting a "ticket " or boarding a flight as long as you keep behaving like this.
not_available I want you to sit over there, get yourself together " so" I don't have to call security.
not_available Got me? Keep the urine alkaline and recheck labs in another six hours.
not_available I'll let the ICU know.
not_available You'll have your roommate back tomorrow.

not_available But he appreciates what you did.

not_available So thanks.
not_available Hey, just got back from the cath lab.
not_available Baby was born with an anomalous left main coronary.
not_available Blood was getting diverted into the GI tract.

not_available I failed, Greg.
not_available What? Oh Why didn't you say something? 
not_available I was ashamed.
not_available It happened so fast.
not_available Everybody was so psyched for us.
not_available Look, man, the only thing that this test measures is how well you take the test.
not_available It doesn't mean you can't keep working.
not_available You just have to take it again, come on.
not_available Well, in the meantime, maybe we can keep this between us? Not tell anybody? 
not_available Yeah, if that's what you want.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Especially Abby.
not_available She coached me a little on the side.
not_available I had some family stuff a while back.
not_available I kind of feel like I let her down.
not_available I'm sure she wouldn't see it that way.
not_available But, okay, we won't tell anyone.
not_available Thank God for Abby, huh? She saved that kid's life.
not_available Yeah, thank God for Abby.
