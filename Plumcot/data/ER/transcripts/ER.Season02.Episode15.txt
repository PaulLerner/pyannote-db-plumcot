not_available Kid took a charge, broke his collarbone.
not_available Nice try, Jerry.
not_available A lot of details, almost believable.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available Look.
not_available I got his autograph.
not_available You know what that's worth? It's IN, not E
not_available N.
not_available No, it's E
not_available N.
not_available It was him.
not_available Who else was on? 
not_available Kid's mom showed up, so Scottie split.
not_available So nobody else saw him? 
not_available I'm heading upstairs.
not_available Can we watch? 
not_available My God, haven't you had that baby yet? You won't have me to make fun of after today.
not_available I thought you'd work up to your due date.
not_available I have, and then some.
not_available Doc's gonna induce if nothing happens by Monday.

not_available I won't beg, I'll be dignified.
not_available I won't have a fair shot at this internship unless he rewrites my recommendation.
not_available Ninety applicants for six slots.
not_available How did you see it? 
not_available It was on his desk.
not_available "Has put forth a consistent effort.
not_available " That's what he says about me.
not_available "Has acquired solid technical skills.
not_available " I told you that.
not_available Several times.
not_available We've had our differences.
not_available But I've worked my butt off for him.
not_available Where the hell's our train? How soon after intercourse can you get a pregnancy result by blood test? Seven days.
not_available The other applicants are from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Hopkins.
not_available I've got the homecourt advantage, but still Wait a second, did you say pregnancy? You think you're pregnant? 
not_available We've been really careful.
not_available I know.
not_available Did you miss your period? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available I'm just obsessing.
not_available You don't need this.
not_available The interview is nerve
not_available racking.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Want to draw some blood? It can wait.
not_available I'm just being paranoid.
not_available You worry about your interview.
not_available Hey, we need some help! What happened? 
not_available Hey, we need some help here.

not_available Is there any time between your contractions?

not_available All right.

not_available Somebody call Mark.
not_available Coming through! 
not_available ICP's 14.
not_available Final ligature.
not_available Spleen's out.
not_available Suction! So if you're looking to kill yourself, the El tracks'll do the job.
not_available We're dry.
not_available BP's 100 Send it to Pathology.
not_available What do you wanna tackle next? 
not_available Run a small bowel for perforations.
not_available How does the arm look? 
not_available As bad as the rest of him.
not_available Think you can save this guy? 
not_available We're chasing our tails here.
not_available Damn, he's hemorrhaging! 
not_available It looks arterial.
not_available Let's open him up! It's your party, but this is a teaching exercise now.
not_available What do you mean, teaching exercise? 
not_available There's not a life to save.
not_available You wanna bet? Sternal saw! Run up to Delivery.
not_available Take galoshes and an umbrella if you have to.
not_available But find me an extra stash of preemie and termsized ambu
not_available bags and infant ET tubes.
not_available Get some bulb syringes.
not_available You got it! Your baby's head is engaged in the canal.
not_available The membrane isn't ruptured yet, so we'll do an amniotomy to rupture it.
not_available What's the presentation? 
not_available Station two plus, effaced and dilated.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He went to buy film.
not_available He won't even know where I am! We'll find him.

not_available Who's attending? Good.
not_available Push, push.
not_available That's it! You know Mark Greene? 
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Membrane ruptured? We had to do it for her.
not_available Was the head engaged? 
not_available Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available Don't want a cord prolapse.
not_available Okay, when you get the urge, I want you to push.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available Seeing a head here.
not_available Here it comes.
not_available Take a deep breath.

not_available Placenta's coming.
not_available Activity, two.
not_available Pulse, two.
not_available Grimace, two.
not_available One laceration.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, will you suture? I think I can handle that.
not_available Apgar is nine.
not_available Check again in five.
not_available Use 20 chromic, interrupted suture for the muscularis layer 
not_available interlocking for the mucosa.
not_available We can manage from here, Janet.
not_available You got other fish to fry.
not_available Just don't take any chances.
not_available You run into trouble, run them to us.
not_available Six East for all Csections, understood? 
not_available We'll need another bassinet.
not_available They'll send them down.
not_available No, we need another one now.
not_available She's having contractions again.
not_available What? Why? 
not_available I hope you're ready for an encore.
not_available You're having another.
not_available I don't believe it! Came in before the sprinklers went.
not_available Nobody monitored her.
not_available I had an ultrasound months ago.
not_available I've got ahold of the head.
not_available No, make that the tush.
not_available This is a breech? I'll deliver.
not_available No, I'm okay.
not_available I've got a good hold here.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Your second baby wants to be different.
not_available So he's gonna come out butt
not_available first.
not_available Now, just push.
not_available Keep the feet out! Good, Christy.
not_available Good, good.
not_available Push.
not_available Good! That's good.
not_available That's really good.
not_available Keep going! Push! Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Those are the shoulders.
not_available Relax, because I gotta get the head.
not_available Flex the head! 
not_available Push gently.
not_available Good.
not_available Good! Excellent! Nice, nice! Nice work, Mom! There.
not_available Oh, my God! Two of them! Smooth, Mark.
not_available You'd think you delivered a breech every day.
not_available Page me if you need me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Suction.
not_available Mom, relax.
not_available The place was a pigsty.
not_available Susie had a bruise from pulling the highchair over.
not_available The more I explained, the phonier it sounded.
not_available I'm sure you're the best adoption candidate they've had all month.
not_available They're sending this guy over this week for work
not_available site interviews.
not_available Please lie.
not_available Can you take this girl in 3? 
not_available We prefer to be called "women.
not_available " Judge for yourself.
not_available With my last two, I had Pitocin and epidural with no complications.
not_available I'd love to pit you
not_available With the monitor shortage, we don't know if the baby's having distress.
not_available I'm in distress.
not_available If I wanted a natural birth, I'd have stayed home.
not_available What's next? Natural dentistry? Okay, Ms.
not_available Amayo.
not_available Tina.
not_available How are you doing? It hurts.
not_available I'll put these on you for a reading.
not_available Did they tell you about the monitors? I don't know.
not_available There was a lot of stuff.
not_available Oh, good, a doctor's here.
not_available Sorry, Tina, they didn't have X
not_available Men.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available I was just explaining the monitors.
not_available It's been a crazy day for her.
not_available Your daughter's 13? 
not_available She's not our daughter.
not_available We've only known Tina for a few months.
not_available We're adopting her baby.
not_available She called us when the contractions began.
not_available Her mother was out.
not_available Did you find my momma? 
not_available She's still not home.
not_available We'll try again.
not_available Who examines that? 
not_available Your urine specimen? We send it to the lab.
not_available You'll tell them about my abduction? Well
not_available Not that I expect them to have tests to identify alien life.
not_available No, probably not.
not_available If they find anything unusual, maybe the FBl or NASA will listen to them.
not_available They don't take phone calls from victims of extraterrestrial insemination.
not_available You're pregnant by aliens? 
not_available It was so humiliating.
not_available I bet.
not_available Here's one more to go, and this goes with it.
not_available For a pregnancy test.
not_available Ready for another look? Could we do two laps? 
not_available I want to be at least four centimeters.
not_available She's very goal
not_available oriented.
not_available Walk on.
not_available I hate men like that.
not_available It gives you false hope.
not_available It's safer to believe that guys like that don't exist.
not_available Finally, fresh recruits.
not_available I thought this shift would never end.
not_available What's the EBL? 
not_available Five liters.
not_available Carter, wanna scrub in? I would, but I have to give a tour of the hospital to the candidates.
not_available Stiff competition.
not_available Had a couple of hours to kill before my interview at 4, so I came by.
not_available I was hoping you managed to get a final draft of my letter of rec out.
not_available One draft, sent it last week.
not_available Great, great.
not_available Great.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Nice work.
not_available Peter, word's gotten around this is where the resurrection is.
not_available I have some students who wanna see you raise the dead.
not_available They'll have a good view there.
not_available They'll benefit from learning how and why you decided to pursue this hopeless case.
not_available How and why? I saw the guy.
not_available I knew I could fix him.
not_available I went to work.
not_available Pressure's 110/75.
not_available Good call.
not_available She's abrupted.
not_available Anytime.
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available He said he was gonna send some tickets.
not_available Are you still telling that Scottie Pippen story? It's not a story.
not_available Here she comes.
not_available Conni! Beet soup? 
not_available That's what they say.
not_available Crazy.
not_available It's put a lot of women in labor.
not_available It was in the papers.
not_available What has? 
not_available The beet soup at Doc Magoo's.
not_available Induces labor.
not_available Come on.
not_available I read that.
not_available It's not that far
not_available fetched.
not_available A lot of plants have ergot alkaloid derivatives.
not_available What do those do? 
not_available Make the uterus contract.
not_available Susan? 
not_available Yeah? I've been monitoring Leah Russell.
not_available A few things don't add up.
not_available She hasn't been able to give us a urine sample.
not_available Her chart shows she's had two previous births, but she lives alone.
not_available She's nervous, underweight 
not_available You're thinking drugs? I checked with the hospitals.
not_available As a teen she had two crack babies.
not_available One she lost at six months.
not_available One was taken away at birth.
not_available Lead the way.
not_available Here we go again.
not_available Hi, Dad.
not_available I hate this part! 
not_available Try to save your breath.
not_available If you don't get a vasectomy, I swear you're having the next one! How big is this kid? Ease up on the pushing, okay? There's the head.
not_available Would you please shut up? 
not_available She has to go through this herself soon.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available That's it! 
not_available Look at that one.
not_available She's a 10
not_available pounder! I take it back.
not_available You scream all you want! 
not_available Suction.
not_available The baby's lethargic.
not_available Apgar, three.
not_available Hold it! No, no.
not_available All right, let's bag her.
not_available Is something wrong? Did you test positive for diabetes during your prenatal care? What's wrong? Start CPR.
not_available I'm gonna intubate.
not_available Prep an umbilical line and heel
not_available stick a glucose.
not_available Please? 
not_available What is it? This didn't happen before.
not_available You may have developed gestational diabetes during your pregnancy.
not_available Bolus, two cc's per kilo.
not_available Is she breathing? Weak respiratory effort.
not_available Give her a 10 cc infusion of D10.
not_available Stick her for another glucose.
not_available Why isn't she crying? 
not_available Your baby's been intubated.
not_available Try and lie back.
not_available Lie back and relax.
not_available Jeanie said that you can't give us a urine sample.
not_available Yeah, I tried.
not_available I suggest you try again because if you can't produce a sample we'll have to put a catheter in to get one.
not_available Why do you need it? 
not_available So we can do a tox screen.
not_available You do them on white women? We do them on everyone who has a history of drug or alcohol abuse.
not_available I suggest you cooperate.
not_available Let me know the results.
not_available You looked me up.
not_available Shall we? You had to tell her? 
not_available She's the doctor.
not_available I was just tripping because I was busted before.
not_available I was a kid then, but now I'm clean.
not_available Let's find out.
not_available Pulse ox, 98.
not_available That's what I want to hear.
not_available Come here, you.
not_available Look at that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, thank you.
not_available Thank you! 
not_available Wait, I didn't get it! Do that again.
not_available Thank you! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Get over here! Come on! 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available This is the doctor that saved our little Renee! 
not_available I love you.
not_available All right.
not_available Me too, doc.
not_available I love you! You know what? I love this doctor too! I want a copy of that one.
not_available I'm taking Renee up to ICU to have them check her.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Yeah, get it on tape.
not_available Pleased to meet you.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Pleased to meet you.
not_available Ken Matsumitsu.
not_available You're from? 
not_available I'm the local guy.
not_available You're? 
not_available From Boston.
not_available Ken's the Howard Hughes Fellow at Harvard.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Andrea Zucker, Stanford.
not_available California.
not_available Explains the tan.
not_available No, I just did 10 months in a clinic in Senegal.
not_available Oh.
not_available This is Martin Fisher.
not_available How are you? Martin Fisher? 
not_available Published in Nature last month.
not_available That's me.
not_available Okay, guys.
not_available We can all go home.
not_available Did you read it? He cloned tyrosine kinase receptors.
not_available Wow.
not_available Well, shall we, with the tour? Her back is killing her.
not_available What can I do? Roll on your side.
not_available When the contractions start press down on her back to give relief.
not_available Like this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Is she doing okay? 
not_available Yeah, thanks to the two of you.
not_available I hope she's not depending on us too much.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available She needs a mother herself.
not_available We can only adopt a baby.
not_available We can't take her too.
not_available Give me the bullet.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Castiglioni, Internal Medicine.
not_available I'm in my 34th week.
not_available I have a scheduled induction for Monday.
not_available My membrane ruptured 40 minutes ago.
not_available I'm fully dilated.
not_available I'll take the express elevator to Labor and Delivery.
not_available I'm sorry, but L and D has maintenance problems.
not_available We're taking all admits in here today.
not_available You have your hands full.
not_available Yeah, but we can handle one more.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Sorry, I think you left this behind.
not_available Stage three carcinoma of the breast.
not_available I had a mastectomy six years ago.
not_available Cancer flared up again last spring.
not_available I was started on a CMF chemo regimen and slated for radiation when I found out I was pregnant.
not_available Any implications for the fetus? 
not_available Ultrasounds looked fine.
not_available But methotrexate is contraindicated in the first trimester.
not_available I won't rest easy till I see this baby.
not_available It shouldn't be long.
not_available The angels were watching over her.
not_available If I'd had the radiation, she would have gotten a toxic dose.
not_available You suspended your treatment? 
not_available For the first trimester.
not_available I've been on a modified regimen since then.
not_available It wasn't a hard choice.
not_available I've got a matter of months left.
not_available My baby has her whole life ahead.
not_available You were right, doctor.
not_available You are fully dilated.
not_available Call Coburn, tell her we've got one coming up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn? No, please.
not_available I've worked too hard for this delivery to have Coburn anywhere near it.
not_available You're old friends, huh? Still, all the high
not_available risks have to go up.
not_available I'm not considered high
not_available risk.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lopez was going to induce me in the birthing center.
not_available Is Ferdie there? I hope you're calling your husband.
not_available The baby is on her way.
not_available My husband's already driving in.
not_available Fernando, you'll never guess where I am.
not_available Let me hand you over to Dr.
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available It's my OB.
not_available Break it to him gently.
not_available He's gonna be jealous.
not_available Look at this, standing room only.
not_available So you got Humpty Dumpty back together again? Getting there.
not_available Marathon surgery.
not_available You run the 20K too? Not since med school.
not_available How does it look? Massive crush injury.
not_available We should amputate.
not_available He'll live.
not_available Might as well keep his arm.
not_available It's longer than a long shot.
not_available It won't hurt to try.
not_available She'll thank you.
not_available Patient's mom, she works over in Recovery.
not_available Said to tell you, "God bless.
not_available " Okay, spectators, no intermission.
not_available We're going straight into the next act.
not_available Pulse ox, 97.
not_available I owe you an apology.
not_available Your tox screen came back negative.
not_available I told you I kicked it.
not_available People don't think you can, but I did.
not_available You must be a strong lady.
not_available Not enough to take much more of this.
not_available There she is! 
not_available Don't look at me.
not_available I'm a wreck! 
not_available This baby's giving you a real workout.
not_available That's for sure.
not_available I bought you some candy.
not_available We're pretty crowded.
not_available We have to limit visitors.
not_available But I'm her sister! 
not_available Birthing coach and sister.
not_available Okay, just don't stay too long.
not_available Let me look at you.
not_available Jeanie, have you seen Harper? 
not_available Not recently.
not_available She sent a blood test for the woman in Exam 2.
not_available The alien abduction.
not_available Yeah, this is so odd.
not_available I want my mama! 
not_available We're with you, Tina.
not_available Blow! Blow! Go on! 
not_available It hurts! That's because your baby's coming.
not_available Whoa, next door! 
not_available Got it! Doing great, doctor.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Meconium in the fluid.
not_available Amnioinfuse 500 cc's normal saline.
not_available You push.
not_available I'll run the procedure.
not_available Do exactly what she said.
not_available Since then, I've had the most awful nosebleeds.
not_available Harper, there you are.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available What possessed you to run a pregnancy test on this visibly gestational woman? I had a lapse.
not_available I don't know what I was thinking.

not_available Benton.
not_available But to have him use words like "solid" in connection with surgical technique High praise from Benton.
not_available Not to mention "full knowledge of anatomy and diagnostic tools.
not_available " That's tantamount to gushing.
not_available Are you sure he wrote this?

not_available Well, you're a most impressive candidate.
not_available But we have many impressive candidates.
not_available One last thing.
not_available Tell us why you want to be a surgeon.
