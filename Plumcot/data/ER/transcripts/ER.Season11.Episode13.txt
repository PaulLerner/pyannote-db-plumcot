
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available Yes, I believe the drug ruined her kidney.
not_available You're alleging potential slander that could cost the hospital millions in support.
not_available Abby, he's all yours today.
not_available Who? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Nothing's gonna happen.
not_available Why is that? 
not_available You're my student.
not_available Welcome, roomie.
not_available God, I'm gonna regret this.
not_available If we wanna make our patients happier, we need to teach our residents 
not_available to connect with them better.
not_available You might wanna start with Pratt.
not_available I'm not an intern, okay? 
not_available So stop acting like one.
not_available E.R.
not_available 11x13 "MIDDLEMAN" No more hot water.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available I should have warned you.
not_available Building needs a bigger water heater.
not_available God, I'm freezing.
not_available Let me see what I can do about that.
not_available Come on in here.
not_available How about we call in sick? I'm arguing a motion today.
not_available It's my first time in front of this judge.
not_available Well, let's just try to hook up after my shift, then.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm going to a friend's birthday dinner at Dandelion.
not_available Dandelion.
not_available Pretty swank.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're splurging.
not_available It's girls' night out.
not_available She's turning 30.
not_available Well, you know, after today, I'm on nights for a week, so Yeah.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll make it up to you.
not_available Greg I
not_available I like you.
not_available I really do.
not_available But I just don't think there's a future.
not_available What? I'm looking for a guy who's a little further along in his life.
not_available You're a student.
not_available You live like a student.
not_available I'm not a student.
not_available I'm a Resident.
not_available Listen, Greg, you're great.
not_available But I'm looking for a guy I can get serious with.
not_available An adult.
not_available Hamster bite, itchy eyes.
not_available For Abby, twisted ankle.
not_available Med students, how do you know when to order a film? Ottawa rules? 
not_available Which are? Point tenderness over the lateral or medial malleolus.
not_available What else? Interns, help him out.
not_available Inability to walk on the scene.
not_available Or take four steps in the ER.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Vomiting diabetic for you.
not_available Saved the best for you.
not_available Vertigo times six hours.
not_available Morning.
not_available This board's a mess.
not_available Sam, the diabetic in Exam 3 needs a Dstick, Chem
not_available 7, and an IV.
not_available How will you learn to put in a line with somebody else doing it? Aren't IV's a nurses' thing? If you're R2 or below 
not_available do your own.
not_available I can get an IV into a scalp vein.
not_available Good.
not_available Keep your skills up then.
not_available Man has a point.
not_available Today, everybody does their own lines.
not_available I will take this.
not_available I need the practice.
not_available I'm moving on to Surgery.
not_available Why make up arbitrary rules if it's gonna slow us? 
not_available Because I can.
not_available You woke on the wrong side 
not_available of the waterbed this morning.
not_available Yeah, me.
not_available Oh, you have a waterbed? I can't make this schedule.
not_available We don't have enough Attendings.
not_available Hire a few part
not_available timers.
not_available We can barely afford to pay the doctors we already have.
not_available Call CT.
not_available Vertigo guy's gonna need a head with contrast.
not_available You need an Attending to sign off.
not_available What? 
not_available Residents can't order CT's.
not_available Since when? We have to cut down on unnecessary CT's 
not_available or we have to buy another scanner.
not_available Well, this is a necessary scan.
not_available You were in there two seconds.
not_available You do a neuro exam? 
not_available There could be a cerebellar mass.
not_available Or an inner
not_available ear infection.
not_available Do the exam and we'll see about your CT.
not_available I've been ordering my own scans since I've been here.
not_available What's that about? 
not_available It's about me making the rules.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available That's stupid.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Back me up.
not_available It's her ER.
not_available Sorry, Pratt.
not_available It sucks to be you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Turner, I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available How can I help? Where are my pain meds? 
not_available What seems to be the problem? What do you think? I am in pain.
not_available I need pain meds.
not_available Now.
not_available Mr.
not_available Turner, I can't help you until you tell me
not_available Vicodin, morphine, go! Oh, Pratt, you gotta help me.
not_available I've been stuck with a homeless woman named Rocky who says she knows you.
not_available A frequent flyer with a positive review of systems.
Complaints headache times two years tingling feet, cough, insomnia, intractable emesis, pruritusAm I supposed to work this up? 
not_available She comes in for company.
not_available Knows what to say to guarantee she'll be here hours.
not_available I can't spend any more time in there.
not_available Her breath is killing me.
not_available Call Social Work.
not_available Have them hold her hand.
not_available Half an hour with Wendall, she'll be cured.
not_available Half hour with Wendall, I'd be cured, know what I mean? Pratt, I'm applying for a Robert Wood Johnson grant to look at the effects of Prevnar on occult bacteremia.
not_available Good luck with that.
not_available Hey, do we have a handout for the local rehab programs? We need to pull charts on kids under 2 who've had a septic workup and record the demographic data on these.
not_available We? 
not_available Fill out my chart review I'll put your name on the paper.
not_available Not into research, don't care about publishing.
not_available You'll be out looking for a job in a couple years staring at a blank page where articles should be listed.
not_available When they hire the guy from Harvard who's got a five
not_available page CV and published three books during his Residency you'll look back and wish you'd stepped up.
not_available Actually, I'm writing something right now.
not_available It's about the abuse of power by Attendings in a county hospital system.
not_available I need these back in a week.
not_available I use the ABCD 
mnemonic Airway, bones, cardiac, diaphragm.
not_available And then you look at the lung fields.
not_available Is the problem that I'm a student? Or that I'm your student? Looking for infiltrates, opacity, vascularity, pneumothorax.
not_available I'm just trying to isolate the issue here.
not_available We've covered this.
not_available I'm your supervisor.
not_available Temporarily.
not_available Your evaluation form is sitting in my box right now.
not_available Okay, 72year
not_available old female with nausea.
not_available Are you gonna let some false sense of hierarchy get in the way of this? One more word, and I'll flunk you.
not_available Hi, Mrs.
not_available McDow.
not_available Feeling a little queasy? 
not_available A little.
not_available Chest bothering you? I think I'm having heart pangs.
not_available Ever had anything like this before? Sometimes, when I'm walking Ferdinand.
not_available He's a mutt, and I love him.
not_available Pulse is racing.
not_available My husband brought him home from the pound just a few months before he passed away.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available What's your plan? O2, aspirin, nitropatch, morphine, Lopressor.
not_available Okay, we'll get you some medication.
not_available That should help with pain.
not_available My student here is going to get you an EKG and check out your heart.
not_available You're the boss.
not_available Yes, she is.
not_available Okay.
Say He's only been at this school a month, already missed five days.
not_available You can close now.
not_available You have a sore throat? How about a stuffy nose? He's quiet.
not_available Said he didn't feel well enough to go to school.
not_available Okay.
not_available Wanna open your ears for me, young man? How long has he had ear tubes? I'm not sure.
not_available He's my husband's kid.
not_available Been living in Detroit with his mom till a month ago.
not_available Mom's doing six months for selling meth.
not_available He had nowhere else to go.
not_available Work.
not_available What's this? 
not_available How'd you do that? Does it hurt? No.
not_available Culture you asked for.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thomas, how'd you get that scratch? Hey, it's okay.
not_available You can tell me what happened.
not_available I don't remember.
not_available Oh, Jane.
not_available I'm applying for a Pharmyxia educational grant.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need to give them a current inventory of textbooks and computers.
not_available It'd be a perfect job for a medical student.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take stock of all computers, educational CD's, textbooks anything used for educational purposes, and record them on these.
not_available You poaching my student? Attending scut comes before intern scut.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I missed so much work, I got fired.
not_available So then I'm home sulking all the time, and my boyfriend bailed.
not_available Chronic pain can put a strain on relationships.
not_available Have you considered? 
not_available Counseling? We've been down that road.
not_available Ms.
not_available Slattery, here's your note for work.
not_available I've signed your discharge.
not_available You are all set.
not_available I don't know why I bother.
not_available There are pain clinics, support groups
not_available You people always give the same useless advice.
not_available Therapy, support groups.
not_available I've tried that.
not_available I've tried everything.
not_available Nothing helps.
not_available I told you I didn't need Social Work.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available We're all done here.
not_available Good luck.
not_available What was that about? 
not_available It's back pain.
not_available You heard her.
not_available You called me to see a patient who doesn't want my help? She needed someone to complain to, I needed to do work.
not_available I'm not a babysitter.
not_available Need you to talk to a kid in Exam 3.
not_available Has a gash on his chest 
not_available won't tell me how it got there.
not_available See? A real consult.
not_available Thirtysevenyear
not_available old GSW to chest.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Just get started.
not_available We should go together.
not_available His name's Thomas.
not_available Tachy at 114, BP, 135/80, sats, 92 on a high
not_available flow mask.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lysander, I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Ly
not_available Lysander's my first name.
not_available Lysander Martin.
not_available Interesting name.
not_available It's from Shakespeare.
not_available My mom wanted to name me after a romantic hero.
not_available Okay.
not_available She got it wrong.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Decreased breath sounds on the right.
not_available Always wanted to ride in an ambulance.
not_available He needs a tube.
not_available Got the Trauma page.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Dubenko, Trauma surgeon.
not_available So many doctors.
not_available You all here for me? Thirtysevenyear
not_available old with single GSW to the chest.
not_available Lysander Martin was shot.
not_available Lysander Martin was gunned down.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available This guy's a talker.
not_available No kidding.
not_available Wound looks through and through.
not_available I don't even feel the pain.
not_available Is that like the endorphins or something? Hello, doctors.
not_available He's decreased on the right, needs a chest tube.
not_available Is this Lysander Martin? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Need to put that mask on.
not_available What's that for? He's being charged with assault.
not_available Nobody's gonna be mad at you.
not_available Right? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available All done.
not_available You can talk to us, you know? It's okay.
not_available You're safe here.
not_available I was climbing a fence at school.
not_available I slipped on the top.
not_available So you got this cut from a fence? It's the wire kind with the sharp things sticking out.
not_available I didn't wanna say because I ripped my shirt.
not_available It was Casey's.
not_available Great, Thomas.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I'd like a couple minutes with Thomas alone if that's all right.
not_available It's just a scratch.
not_available Is that absolutely necessary? They'll kill me at work if I don't show up.
not_available You can't go until his rapid strep's back.
not_available Cardiac unit.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available She's got right bundle branch.
not_available That's pretty common.
not_available I have that too.
not_available I also have an aberrant reentrant conductance pathway.
not_available That explains a lot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My EKG's kind of wild.
not_available I assume you want another 12
not_available lead? Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There are a few findings on your EKG that are consistent with ischemia which means that your heart muscle isn't getting enough blood.
not_available That can't be good.
not_available We'll
not_available We'll check another EKG.
not_available We'll see if they've progressed.
not_available Thank you, dear.
not_available And I'll be back.
not_available Abby, I'm asking all Residents to keep a tally of time spent on paper charting.
not_available You switching to an automated system? If we get the money.
not_available Keep track of start and stop times on your documentation.
not_available Could you ask the house staff to fill out forms, and collect surveys when you're done? Thank you.
not_available What's the time survey about? I'm applying for an informatics grant from Genadon.
not_available Genadon Pharmaceuticals? Yes.
not_available Why? Residents should be treating patients not doing free research for drug companies.
not_available Maybe they'd be able to if someone hadn't spilled their guts on television.
not_available I was right.
not_available You know, the makers of Zarictal give this hospital over $50,000 in educational grants.
not_available That's money for computers, conferences, support staff.
not_available I can't count on that now.
not_available Gonna go to another drug company? Can't we be more creative than that? The county health system's bleeding.
not_available Unrestricted grants from pharmaceutical companies pay.
not_available There's no such thing as unrestricted grants from pharmaceutical companies.
not_available The fact that we rely on that money is a serious conflict of interest.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I never thought I'd be kissing corporate ass when I went to school.
not_available Welcome to adulthood.
not_available We owe our patients.
not_available To keep our doors open.
not_available It compromises independence.
not_available Know what? Most of us had to make compromises to get through med school and Residency.
not_available That's probably a foreign concept to someone who's never had to worry about money in their life.
not_available It must be nice.
not_available Little pressure here.
not_available And I'm in.
not_available Sats up to 98.
not_available Nice, Pratt.
not_available Morrison's looks good.
not_available No fluid.
not_available You haven't told us how you got shot, Mr.
not_available Martin.
not_available Lysander, please.
not_available Call me Lysander.
not_available Midsummer Night's Dream.
not_available Spends the play being pushed around by Puck.
not_available Puck is evil.
not_available O silk.
not_available Why are you looking in the abdomen? 
not_available Injury's in the chest.
not_available Bullet could have ricocheted.
not_available Nipples to navel, no man's land.
not_available I've always hated those ER truisms.
not_available Wounds are aligned, bullet went through man needs a chest tube.
not_available Leave it at that.
not_available It's done.
not_available Good.
not_available Oxygen, pain control, ICU next.
not_available Do I need an operation? 
not_available No.
not_available It's not clear yet.
not_available How can you be so sure without looking? Want to scan the belly? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Call them down.
not_available Why do ER docs radiate the hell out of people instead of trusting your own clinical judgment? I trust my clinical judgment, and I want a CT.
not_available CT.
not_available That's a cat scan, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Scanner's down.
not_available Could be a couple of hours.
not_available Good.
not_available If the bullet nicked the bowel he doesn't have hours.
not_available Needs an ex
not_available lap.
not_available Let the surgeons decide who needs the surgery.
not_available Are these guys fighting over me? 
not_available Come on, Kovac.
not_available Let it go.
not_available He's my patient.
not_available Okay.
not_available Vitals Q hour, chest tube to suction, morphine, PRN.
not_available There.
not_available He's admitted to the Trauma service.
not_available Board him until the bed's ready.
not_available Okay? Now he's my patient.
not_available You can go.
not_available Two small coffees.
not_available I hate when they don't leave room for the milk.
not_available If we missed that intestinal injury, he will get septic and die.
not_available Why does Dubenko think he can act like that to the ER staff? Hubris? I love that word.
not_available And one more sugar, please.
not_available Sure.
not_available He doesn't get to you? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Hair? I think he's kind of cute.
not_available What? Surgery and ER have these battles in every hospital I've ever worked in.
not_available It's not personal.
not_available Surgeons have to believe they're better and smarter than everyone else.
not_available It's a defense mechanism to make up for their terrible lifestyle.
not_available The guy needs an ex
not_available lap.
not_available It's a pissing match, Luka.
not_available Let it go.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're taller and sexier.
not_available And you already got the girl.
not_available This isn't about ego.
not_available Oh, it's not? Nineteenyear
not_available old.
not_available Arrow to abdomen.
not_available It hurts! What's your name? 
not_available His name's Dan.
not_available Airway's fine, tachy to 130.
not_available BP, 99/50.
not_available Four of MS.
not_available Need a little help.
not_available I need more of that stuff.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available We're gonna fix you up.
not_available What happened? 
not_available They made me balance an apple on my head while they took shots.
not_available Who did? 
not_available The DKE brothers.
not_available I'm a pledge.
not_available It's a hazing stunt? Said the arrow had a plastic tip, couldn't hurt me.
not_available They were wrong.
not_available We actually didn't think he'd let us do it.
not_available God, I'm glad I'm not a guy.
not_available All right, here's your note for school.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No more climbing fences till you're double digits, okay? Keep the wound dry until it's scabbed over.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Anytime.
not_available Can you hold on? 
not_available We really need to go.
not_available No, I
not_available Just one minute.
not_available I wasn't done.
not_available I asked you to find out what happened.
not_available You did.
not_available If you call me to consult wait for my assessment before releasing him.
not_available Your assessment was that the injury was consistent with the story.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available I haven't completed my evaluation.
not_available I can't sign off until I interview him.
not_available I don't need you to sign off.
not_available I got a 16year
not_available old girl with abdominal pain.
not_available Can you do the sexual history? She'd rather talk to a woman.
not_available I am sick and tired of you all using Social Work as a crutch when your patient smells bad or you don't wanna spend time with them.
not_available Actually, she smells kind of good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You should page me before you discharge.
not_available Which is it? We're calling you too often or not enough? If I don't leave now, I may lose my job.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available You're all set.
not_available When are you gonna take this thing out? It's not safe doing it here.
not_available We'll do it up in the OR.
not_available Dubenko's on his way.
not_available He's got no veins.
not_available I'm not having luck either.
not_available On the feet? Set up for a central line.
not_available Ray, let's tube him.
not_available All right.
not_available Sterile sixes to Jane.
not_available Jake said you were cool like that.
not_available Like what? 
not_available Letting med students do procedures.
not_available That's how he sold me on the switch.
not_available What switch? Anyone reached my mom? 
not_available We're working on it.
not_available He's swapping his remaining shifts with me so he can do nights with Neela supervising.
not_available We'll put a breathing tube down your throat for the OR.
not_available When you wake up, this thing will be out, and you'll be all fixed up, okay? 
not_available Eighteen gauge in dorsal arch.
not_available Twenty etomidate, 100 of sux.
not_available He wants to get a sense of how other interns do things.
not_available Oh, systolic's down to 62.
not_available Abby, why don't you go next door and get the rapid infuser.
not_available Flush the line with saline.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Etomidate is in.
not_available Okay, suction.
not_available We hardly ever do DPL's anymore.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Because CT makes us lazy.
not_available It's archaic.
not_available DPL has a higher sensitivity with occult intra
not_available abdominal injury.
not_available Dubenko doesn't want us near this guy.
not_available Well, it's safe, it's faster, and it's indicated in penetrating thoracic injury.
not_available Lower thoracic injury.
not_available Is there always this much debate? 
not_available Only with the really important stuff.
not_available Cool.
not_available I'm stealing your rapid infuser.
not_available Send Jane in.
not_available She should see this.
not_available Okay, we're gonna put a small catheter into your belly.
not_available We're gonna run a liter of saline in and out.
not_available If the fluid comes back clear, you're good.
not_available If there's any blood, you're gonna need the OR.
not_available Makes sense to me.
not_available He's not our patient.
not_available Dubenko's gonna freak out.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available The kid with the arrow in his belly went up to the OR.
not_available That's good.
not_available I was never in a fraternity.
not_available Boy What? I said I was never in a
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available Maybe sometimes I'm not the best team player.
not_available I have so many balls in the air.
not_available I'm sorry I took it out on you.
not_available It was a lot easier being a Resident.
not_available Attendings made tough calls, protected us from all that administrative crap.
not_available Didn't seem like that at the time.
not_available Students wanna be Residents.
not_available Residents wanna be Attendings.
not_available Yup.
not_available And Attendings just wanna be left alone.
not_available I'm not doing any more consults down here today.
not_available Why? Who's covering? 
not_available No one.
not_available The ER's blacklisted.
not_available What? They all brag about the ER's multidisciplinary approach but doctors only listen to other doctors.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Have the Residents call a candy striper if they need somebody to keep their patients company today.
not_available Okay, grasp the fascia with the towel clips and pull up.
not_available Are you a student? 
not_available No.
not_available She is.
not_available Now just pop the angiocath through to the peritoneal cavity and aspirate as you go.
not_available Want me to hold the clamps while you do that? No.
not_available I've got it.
not_available How long have you been a doctor? 
not_available Three years.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Nothing back.
not_available I've worked at the same place for the last 14.
not_available Extend with the scalpel and thread in your tubing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, urosepsis guy is coding.
not_available Morris is in there alone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dump in a warm liter of saline and let gravity pull it back out.
not_available It takes about 20 minutes.
not_available And if Dubenko sees this? 
not_available Call me.
not_available You want me to go with him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He seems like a cool boss.
not_available He's one of them.
not_available I have a bunch.
not_available I've had the same one for the whole time.
not_available Jack Meegly.
not_available He's a year younger than I am, and he's made me call him Mr.
not_available Meegly.
not_available Sounds like a jerk.
not_available Last night, I had my crew rearrange this display so that the cell phones were separated from the CD's.
not_available This morning, he came by, and he made me change it all back.
not_available I don't have the authority to change the displays in my own damn department.
not_available It sucks to be the middleman.
not_available For the last 14 years, I've been working holidays and covering his ass while he cheats on his wife with the girls in Cosmetics.
not_available Two hundred cc's in.
not_available Today, I had enough.
not_available I went to the firearms section I took a gun out of the case I grabbed some bullets, I went into Meegly's office, and I fired into the air.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available I didn't wanna hurt him.
not_available I was just mad.
not_available That explains the handcuffs and your friend outside.
not_available So, what happened next? He was calm.
not_available He grabbed the gun out of my hands.
not_available And then he He shot you? Story of my life.
not_available Damn.
not_available Thought I had it bad.
not_available Sorry for the delay, Mr.
not_available Martin.
not_available ICU should have a bed in
not_available Well, Dr.
not_available Pratt, what are you doing? 
not_available A DPL.
not_available Yeah, I see.
not_available Well, why stop there? Get sterile, Pratt.
not_available We're going in.
not_available What? 
not_available Scrub up, you assist.
not_available He's not serious.
not_available You guys are so sure he needs an ex
not_available lap, let's open him up right here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm not really getting surgery, am I? Oh, no.
not_available I was just making a point.
not_available Where's Kovac? 
not_available Sam's out looking for him.
not_available Quick, friendly tip of advice.
not_available Next time you're caught between a surgeon and anyone else 
not_available listen to the surgeon.
not_available How about this time? He's gotta finish what he started.
not_available Gravity's gonna pull the fluid into the bag.
not_available If it's red, we know you're bleeding.
not_available ER docs convince yourselves of the worst possible diagnosis then radiate, bleed and bludgeon to prove you're right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac is always on us to avoid unnecessary tests.
not_available So obsessed with the dramatic save that you fail to develop any finesse.
not_available Finesse? Sledgehammers and carpet
not_available bombing where discretion and restraint are required.
not_available He wouldn't push a procedure if he didn't think we'd find something.
not_available Kovac has you doing a procedure on somebody's patient
not_available You have something to say, say it to me, not my Resident.
not_available You and I should discuss it in the hallway.
not_available No, we can discuss it right here.
not_available Very well.
not_available My patient is fully aware that you and your Resident ignored my instructions and proceeded with this test.
not_available It's okay.
not_available After years of taking care of the cases that you guys blow off, I've learned to develop intuition.
not_available Your intuitive approach is very sweet, but I practice evidence
not_available based medicine.
not_available Okay? Let's look at the evidence, shall we? 
not_available It's pink.
not_available Does that mean I'm bleeding? 
not_available No.
not_available May I? Last vitals.
not_available Seventy
not_available two, 18, 114/66.
not_available Note, I am reading this through the fluid.
not_available How does that correlate to cell count? 
not_available Ten thousand RBC's, tops.
not_available Is that bad? 
not_available It's nothing.
not_available Tablespoon of blood.
not_available Probably from Dr.
not_available Pratt's incision.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Should we get another doctor? Like a tiebreaker or something? Maybe break the tie? 
not_available Look, if he was bleeding we'd be looking at tomato juice, not pink lemonade.
not_available He could have a small tear that's intermittently oozing.
not_available I'm getting very tired of this game.
not_available And since I can't trust you to stay away from my patient I'm going to go and find him a bed myself.
not_available He's not mad at me, is he? A blocked blood vessel deprived your heart of oxygen which caused the abnormal rhythm.
not_available That's why you passed out.
not_available The cardiologist will thread a catheter through your groin into your heart and unblock the vessel.
not_available Will it hurt? 
not_available No.
not_available You'll be sedated.
not_available Curtain B is open.
not_available Is there any family you'd like us to call for you? My
not_available My son lives in Seattle.
not_available Got any friends who could come be with you? No.
not_available It's just me and my dog now.
not_available I'll tell you what, Gertie.
not_available My shift is almost over, and I love the cath lab.
not_available I'm gonna come hang out with you while they do your procedure.
not_available You wanna stay with me? Listen, I'll be quiet.
not_available I'm not gonna bug you.
not_available Privacy, please.
not_available I need to do my assessment.
not_available That was nice of you.
not_available I wasn't lying.
not_available I really do like the cath lab.
not_available Hey, listen you did a great job on your rotation.
not_available I probably should've mentioned that sooner.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And I want you to know Just let me know if you need any help down the line.
not_available Sure.
not_available And I think it's good that you switched to have some shifts with Neela.
not_available She's very smart.
not_available And II
not_available It's good to have variety.
not_available Abby, I was wondering about something.
not_available Yeah? Do you think Gertie's blockage is in the circumflex or the LAD? You know, the next time you decide to start a turf war with Dubenko do me a favor, leave me out of it.
not_available This isn't about power, it's about the patient.
not_available But he's seen hundreds of GSW's.
not_available What makes you so sure you're right? If you have a strong gut feeling about something, you have to listen to it.
not_available Come on, we were wrong.
not_available We don't know that yet.
not_available Made us look like fools.
not_available Is that what you're worried about? 
not_available What? Nothing will get a doctor into bigger trouble than the fear of looking stupid.
not_available Trust me.
not_available So you're on nights for the rest of the rotation? Yeah.
not_available I guess this is it.
not_available I'm on days.
not_available It's too bad.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Abby, I'm sure Neela's a good doctor but that's not why I switched shifts.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available I switched shifts so that after today, I would no longer be your student.
not_available So tonight, I want you to fill out that evaluation seal the envelope and turn it in.
not_available Because tomorrow night 
not_available you and me, we're going out.
not_available No, we're not.
not_available Yes, we are.
not_available No, we're not.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, we're not.
not_available You ever think about Surgery? You seem the type.
not_available No.
not_available A month in the Death Star's enough for me.
not_available Death Star? 
not_available Surgical ICU.
not_available Pratt, excessive yawning a sign of something? Yeah.
not_available Sleepiness.
not_available Well, Lysander doesn't seem sleepy.
not_available He seems kind of wired.
not_available He's yawning? 
not_available Yeah, a lot.
not_available Detective Burowski's been waiting two hours.
not_available Can we go in? Not yet.
not_available Call Dubenko.

not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Just give me a minute, you'll see.
not_available You okay like that? 
not_available Well, I'm sliding a little bit.
not_available Maybe this will help.
not_available Can I make a call? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What's the number? 555
not_available 0198.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What is this, Medieval Torture Day in the ER? Nurse noticed frequent yawning in an alert patient.
not_available You got 30 seconds.
not_available Could be a sign 
not_available of diaphragmatic injury.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available It's a theory.
not_available Hard to prove but wouldn't necessarily show up on the DPL.
not_available You've reached Jack and Sally's house.
not_available Machine.
not_available I've got a bed for him in the ICU upstairs, okay? Hi, Sally? It's Lysander from Electronics.
not_available Methylene blue in the abdomen should seep through the diaphragmatic tear.
not_available And come out of the chest tube.
not_available I've been shot, and I'm hanging upside down with a tube in my belly and a vacuum cleaner in my chest.
not_available And in case I don't make it
not_available You're gonna make it.
not_available I just wanted to let you know that your husband cheats on you and that I love you.

not_available What the hell? 
not_available Can't get a pressure.
not_available Who did this? 
not_available Found him on the schoolyard.
not_available Is his mother here? Brother? Bruising and edema to bilateral thighs.
not_available How did this happen? Isn't it funny how you can be so completely sure of a diagnosis then find out you were totally wrong? You should write up the case, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Think you'll do the surgery laparoscopically or are you gonna go open? Don't know yet.
not_available We'll have to run the bowel.
not_available Think the bullet may have been bouncing around the abdomen? 
not_available Know what? It's possible.
not_available And Dr.
not_available Kovac was right.
not_available Good night, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I think this has been the best day of my life.
not_available Hey, Chuny, what's going on in there? 
not_available Abused kid.
not_available You don't wanna know.
not_available You guys need an extra set of hands? 
not_available It's Thomas.

not_available Pace him.
not_available He's oozing from his IV sites.
not_available It's DIC.
not_available Go for cryo and FFP.
not_available No, Pratt.
not_available Anybody got an ETA on the family? Another epi, another atropine, and let's treat the DIC.
not_available Come on, he's a kid, man.
not_available I'm not stopping yet.
not_available Atropine's in.
not_available Pratt, you want me to switch in? 
not_available Central access.
not_available It won't change.

not_available What's the time? 
not_available It's 43 minutes.
not_available The family's here.
not_available Why don't you see if they're ready to come in? How is he? 
not_available This is Thomas' dad.
not_available His injuries are very severe.
not_available Do you wanna see him? Sometimes it helps to see how hard the doctors are working.
not_available Casey, go back and sit down.
not_available I don't think he needs to see this.
not_available I wanna be with him.
not_available I saw them.
not_available Who? I saw them pull Thomas behind the swings after school today.
not_available Who did you see? They had a thing about his clothes.
not_available I gave him my shirt yesterday, but they still wouldn't leave him alone.
not_available Did they cut him? I tried to get Thomas to tell you.
not_available But they said they'd kill him if he said anything.
not_available He was scared.
not_available Everyone's scared of them.
not_available Casey, tell me who they are.
not_available I promise you'll be safe.
not_available I still have to be in school with them every day.
not_available Who? There's four of them.
not_available They're sixth graders.

not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available I was about to put this in your box.
not_available Med
not_available student evaluation.
not_available How's it going with him? He's thorough.
not_available He's got a good fund of knowledge.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available And I'm sorry, I didn't get to those time surveys today.
not_available We're so screwed at this point another day doesn't matter.
not_available What's going on? Is Carter's press conference that big a deal? If Keating
not_available Ward pulls funding, others will follow suit.
not_available Drug companies don't wanna associate with a department that overreacts during a post
not_available marketing surveillance.
not_available Well, Admin somehow always finds money to keep us open.
not_available I could lose my job.
not_available Why? You didn't personally run County Health into the ground.
not_available No, but my tenure's up for review, and I'm way short.
not_available They made you department head.
not_available I think you've proved your worth.
not_available The committee's only concern is how much money I bring in.
not_available That sucks.
not_available I have to bring in $100,000 a year 
not_available to even be in the ballpark.
not_available There's a quota? We're being pimped out by the university.
not_available You don't bring in the cash, you're out.
not_available Pharmaceutical grants are an easy way to raise a bunch of money fast.
not_available I can't lose my job.
not_available I have Chuck and Cosmo now.
not_available I just talked to the OR.
not_available Lysander had a three
not_available centimeter diaphragmatic laceration.
not_available Okay.
not_available You saved his life.
not_available We all miss things, Pratt.
not_available The social worker saw this kid too.
not_available I pulled rank on her.
not_available Attending trumps Resident, Resident trumps intern.
not_available We all trump the social worker.
not_available It's a great system.
not_available Most of the time it works.
not_available How do you stand it? 
not_available What? The responsibility.
not_available Busy shift? 
not_available Oh, the usual.
not_available What about you? What did you do? Tried to sleep, couldn't.
not_available Watched bad TV, ate cereal.
not_available I hate working nights.
not_available Okay, bring it on.
not_available Torticollis in 2 waiting for Benadryl to kick in.
not_available And tinea capitis has a scrip for griseo, but he needs to see an Attending.
not_available That's it? 
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available Anyone wanna go to Ike Ryan's? Luka's working.
not_available Alex is at a sleepover.
not_available I need a drink.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I'm exhausted.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, the inventory of teaching materials you asked for.
not_available Thank you, Jane.
not_available You're the only person who actually did what I asked.
not_available Textbooks and journals are in the front.
not_available Computer stuff is in the back.
not_available Come on out with us.
not_available I'll buy you a drink.
not_available I can't.
not_available There is something you can do for me though.
not_available Shoot.
not_available Write me a recommendation? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Way to work it, Jane.
not_available Ray, you coming out with us? Oh, I never drink with Attendings.
not_available It gets too weird.
not_available The plumber came, the shower's fixed.
not_available Oh, hallelujah.
not_available I love you.
not_available You owe me 80 bucks.
not_available Ready to sign out? Please don't give me the speech about how we win some and we lose some.
not_available I wasn't going to.
not_available I didn't complete my assessment.
not_available I didn't do my job.
not_available What do you think would have happened
not_available ? Please, don't.
not_available Don't what? Try to cheer me up.
not_available I should have saved that kid.
not_available Can I help you, sir? 
not_available No, actually, I'm looking for someone.
not_available What's the name of the party? Really.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Oh, no, that's awful.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm sorry, ladies, I didn't mean to interrupt.
not_available This will take a minute.
not_available Greg? I went to work thinking about what you said.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available And I just need to tell you something.
not_available The work that I do, it's as real and as serious as it gets.
not_available Now, I don't know how you define an adult but I assure you, I'm all grown up.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to offend you.
not_available I don't know what you're looking for, but I hope you find it.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Abby.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Big problem.
not_available What? You never signed off on my ABG or IV placement.
not_available So you staked out my apartment so I could sign your book? All student
not_available teacher relations have to be wrapped up by tomorrow.
not_available That is very important.
not_available I see.
not_available Sign it.
not_available How do you know where I live? 
not_available Residency office.
not_available They just gave out my address just like that? You could have been anybody.
not_available It's disturbing, really.
not_available They even gave me your phone number too.
not_available Well, I guess they thought you looked like a nice boy.
not_available I'm not that nice.
not_available Maybe I should change my number.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, congratulations, Jake.
not_available Your ER rotation is officially over.
