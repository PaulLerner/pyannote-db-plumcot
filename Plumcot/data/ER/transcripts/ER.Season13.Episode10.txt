not_available Here.
not_available Sure, I'll get to it in a minute.
not_available Whoa, whoa, Hope, about your newlyweds with flu symptoms, why would you prescribe "Long walks, holding hands and romantic dinners." Oh, um, I sensed tension in their young marriage and when we're tense or stressed, our immune systems weaken, which as you know, limits our body's ability to fight off infections and viruses.
not_available I felt if, uh, Andy and Phyllis carved out more time for one another, they could strengthen their marriage, thus speeding their recovery and protecting them from future illnesses.
not_available Oh, you can't 
not_available Bitch, it's mine, and I want it.
not_available Come on now; you stole it, and I want it back.

not_available Please.
not_available Do you know what happened? 
not_available No, no one saw anything.
not_available We've never had anything like this at Lakeside.
not_available Okay, what about her parents? Have they been notified? The school nurse called, but had to leave messages.

not_available It's over.
not_available I told Meg it's over.
not_available Maybe for you, but any idiot could see from the look on her face that it's not over for her.
not_available It's an ileus.
not_available The bowel's asleep.
not_available Doesn't help that he's been popping Vicodin four times a day.
not_available Just give him a laxative and wait for him to poop.
not_available That's ileusILEU
not_available S.
not_available My assistant pulled me out of a staff meeting.
not_available What's the emergency? 
not_available There's a patient in Trauma 1.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available We couldn't discuss this on the phone? 
not_available Look, we don't know what happened.
not_available They found her outside of her school.
not_available Luka, what's going on? 
not_available We think she was sexually assaulted.
not_available Who? Uh Angela, it's Danielle.
not_available My baby.
not_available My sweet baby girl! Okay, truly, and you explain to me how this happened? Well, Westhat's my boyfriend
not_available he's always talking on his cell, but when I'd ask, "Who are you calling? Who are you talking to?" he gets all secretive on me.
not_available Does your old man do that to you? 
not_available No, my old man's pretty cool.
not_available Lucky
not_available anyways, me and Wes are in bed, and his cell rings, so I rolled over and grabbed it before he could.
not_available That's pretty smart, huh? 
not_available Very smart.
not_available Anyways, Wes gets all mad, starts chasing me around the room, and I see that it's "Debbie" calling.
not_available So I say, "Who the hell is Debbie?" He tells me it's none of my damn business.
not_available And that's when you decided to swallow his cell phone.
not_available Okay, I'm going to order an X
not_available ray and we'll find out if we can pull it out here in the ER.
not_available If not, you're going to need surgery.
not_available Oh, it's one of those real tiny ones.
not_available I could stick my finger down my throat to try to barf it up.

not_available Hi.
not_available Okay, uh, I'll be back when GI gets here.

not_available It's been worse.
not_available How long you been off your medication? 
not_available Since my prescription ran out.
not_available And that was when? You giving me steroids? Yes, we're sorry, but only for five days to knock down the inflammation.

not_available It's called a speculum.
not_available It has a light in it.
not_available When the speculum is in, I'm going to take some swabs and sweep inside, and then I'm going to irrigate with water and remove that with a syringe.

not_available All right, here we go.

not_available Can I get you some fava beans and a nice Chianti? Dr.
not_available Morris, um, I need you to see my patient in Curtain 1.
not_available What's the problem? Well, he complains of a migraine, but

not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Archie Morris.
not_available I don't do migraines.
not_available I think it's more than that.
not_available You think? Look, I don't want a restraining order.
not_available I want him arrested.
not_available I know you're frustrated, but Ames hasn't done anything illegal.
not_available What? So he has to hurt my family before anyone will listen? I wouldn't worry about this guy.
not_available He's just a poor sucker, working a crappy job.
not_available And if you pursue this, you might piss him off for real.
not_available Piss Ames off? 
not_available Look, do yourself a 
favor forget Ames.
not_available He's already forgotten about you.
not_available Hey.

not_available Hi.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Was Danielle raped? Well, the initial results are negative for the presence of sperm.
not_available Thank God.
not_available But there's something else.
not_available Well, it looks like Danielle was assaulted with a sharp object.
not_available It appears she was cut and penetrated repeatedly with a razor blade.
not_available What kind of monster would do this? 
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Which one of you two saw Danielle last this morning? I usually drive her to school, but I had an early meeting, so Paul took her.
not_available And what time was that? 
not_available About 7:15.
not_available Anyone see you drop Danielle off? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What time did you get to work? Do you need to do this now? How is that important? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Gilliam, let's step outside.
not_available I'm staying here with my stepdaughter.
not_available Some lunatic has cut up our daughter and you're treating my husband like a suspect? Mom what's going on? 
not_available That's enough.
not_available Come on.
not_available Outside.
not_available I know you have a job to do, but I can't have you upsetting my patient.
not_available That wasn't our intent.
not_available Paul, listen to me.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available The police want to catch whoever did this to Danielle as much as you do.
not_available Of course, but 
not_available So just go answer their questions, and then you can rejoin your family.
not_available Please.
not_available Everything's going to be okay.
not_available I need you talk to me.
not_available Danielle, honey, do you know who hurt you? Yes.
not_available Then tell me.
not_available I can't.
not_available You'll be mad.
not_available Just looking at it.
not_available How'd he get it in so deep without hitting any vital structures? Wow, he managed to stay outside the brain, miss the internal carotid, optic nerve and pituitary.
not_available Lucky bastard.
not_available Hey, I heard you guys had a cool case.
not_available Is that a 
not_available Ice pick.
not_available What makes someone shove an ice pick in his ear? Ran out of Q
not_available tips? Guy was hearing voices, wanted them to shut up.
not_available Yeah, but I wonder why he didn't try pulling it out himself? Said the demons in his head would get loose if he did.
not_available Hey, is this an ER case? 
not_available I'd say Neurosurgery.
not_available Nah, ENT.
not_available Definitely Psych.
not_available I say we page 'em all.
not_available Let 'em fight it out.

not_available Heads up.
not_available I think you got the impression, and I kind of gave you the impression, that 
not_available something happened between me and her.
not_available Well, it sure looked like that to me.
not_available Nah.
not_available The truth is Nicole and I are just friends.
not_available Man, I mean, like her and she's cool to hang out with, but I'm not hitting it.
not_available Mmm.
not_available That's cool.
not_available It's nothing.
not_available Trust me.

not_available And I'm not going to do that anymore, man.
not_available This is my life! 
not_available And I'm sorry if it makes you hate me.
not_available I don't hate you.
not_available Oh, you don't hate me, but can you deal with it? Are we still cool? Pratt, can I give your vomiting guy another five of Compazine? Look, I
not_available I can't do this right now.
not_available It's okay.

not_available Um look, I gotta go.
not_available Ooh! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry, sorry, sorry.
not_available I have a bunch of eighth graders with gastroenteritis.
not_available Potato salad left out too long in the cafeteria.
not_available How's it going in there? Surgery's coming down to rule out intra
not_available abdominal injury.
not_available Seems Danielle knows her attacker, but won't say who it is.
not_available What, is she protecting someone? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, what does Hollis think? Hollis? 
not_available Hollis, the cop.

not_available Listen, doc, if I spoke out of line Wait.
not_available No, no, sir.
not_available Don't touch it.
not_available Don't touch it.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's official.
not_available Every department has passed the buck.
not_available Surgery, Neurosurg, and ENT? Uh
not_available huh, they all claim it's not their problem.
not_available What are we going to do? I say we pull it out.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, let's show those wusses that the ER is not afraid of a No, no.
not_available Push three of Versed.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's kinda The films show it missed everything on the way in.
not_available So all we have to do is ease it out along the same path, and admit him for IV antibiotics.
not_available I know, but what if 
not_available Not to mention, this is a publishable case report for any ambitious med student, intern or resident.
not_available Well, it's not the craziest No! The guy can't walk around 
not_available If we don't it, he's gonna do it himself.
not_available Okay.
not_available Who wants to do it? I'll do it! 
not_available Attagirl.
not_available All right.
not_available Don't wiggle the handle, Hope.
not_available Just give it one good tug, okay? 
not_available Don't be nervous.
not_available Now, relax, and pull, gentle, but firm.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is there any pain when I press here? 
not_available No.
not_available How about here? Uh
not_available uh.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna need to take a look inside you.
not_available They already did that.
not_available I know, but I'm checking for other things.
not_available It's okay, honey.
not_available Angela.
not_available The detective is asking if you could step out for a moment.
not_available I need to stay with my daughter.
not_available It's okay, Mom.
not_available You can go.
not_available I want you to.
not_available Okay.
not_available If that's what you want.
not_available I'm going to see how deep the cuts are.
not_available They're not bad.
not_available I know.
not_available How do you know the cuts weren't deep? Honey did you do this to yourself? Please don't tell my mom.
not_available How many loads you hauled out today? 
not_available Four.
not_available The boss wants to make sure you get that load you left in the corner last time.
not_available Hey, go screw yourself.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ames? Man, what are you doing here? 
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Man, I'm working now.
not_available This is not a good time, all right? 
not_available I don't care.
not_available Ames! I don't pay you to chitchat.
not_available Is it okay if I, uh, if I take my break right now? Ten minutes.
not_available You're lying.
not_available Check my time cards if you don't believe me.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available I don't even know where you live, man.
not_available And it wasn't you in the park.
not_available And you didn't send me my son's toy.
not_available Your initials were on it.
not_available Why are you doing this to me? You sent the police to my job.
not_available I can't have you doing that.
not_available This job is all I got left now.
not_available Stop playing games.
not_available I'm just trying to live my life and make it through one more day.
not_available My family is gone.
not_available My house is gone.
not_available I'm living in my car.
not_available My damn car.
not_available That's not my problem, okay? What is it you want from me? You've been watching my family, following us.
not_available That stops right now.
not_available I would never do anything to hurt your family.
not_available I know what it's like to lose one.
not_available You do, too, right? I heard that you were married once with kids.
not_available Must be horrible going through all that.
not_available I gotta get back to work, all right? Listen to me, Ames.
not_available Come near my family again, I'll kill you.
not_available I'm so sorry, it's all my fault.
not_available No, no.
not_available It was my idea.
not_available Maybe I pulled the handle too hard or I Hope, no, no.
not_available You were the only one in the entire hospital to step up to the plate.
not_available I'm proud of you.
not_available So how is he? The human shish
not_available kebab will be fine, no thanks to that incredibly imbecilic stunt of yours.
not_available Hey, how were we supposed to know the handle would break off? Okay, all right, just for fun, let's pretend that you each had even a modicum of grey matter that you somehow managed to fashion into some crude, rudimentary semblance of a brain.
not_available Maybe then you would know that you never pull out something near a vital structure unless you're in the OR.
not_available We remove foreign bodies all the time in the ER.
not_available Pulling a vibrator out of someone's ass not the same thing.
not_available Hey, hey, Dr.
not_available Bobek acted under my supervision and my orders.
not_available Perfect.
not_available You got the halfwit leading the dimwit.
not_available Look, you obnoxious boor.
not_available The ER works damn hard for every patient we see.
not_available We acted in this guy's best interest when no one, not even surgery, would give him the time of day.
not_available Now, did we do something that didn't work? Yes, fine.
not_available It happens sometimes; I will take full responsibility.
not_available But at least we got off our asses and tried to help.
not_available Oh, well, gold stars for the ER asses.
not_available Hey What is it about your need to belittle other people? Does insulting someone make you feel like a man? Bolster what little self
not_available esteem you're clinging to? Wow, you know I can't even begin to imagine what happened in your life to make you the kind of person that everybody hates.
not_available I could kiss you right now.
not_available Really? Hmm now it's gone.
not_available Sorry this took so long.
not_available It's just kind of the way things work around here.
not_available Oh, I didn't mind.
not_available Uh, don't forget to fill your prescription and remember you need to take the Prednisone with food.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available If you say so.
not_available And you need to follow up with your doctor in a week.
not_available Right.
not_available Um what are your office hours? Um, I can refer you to the pulmonary clinic.
not_available Ah, that's all right.
not_available I'll work it out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Where'd you disappear to? Dr.
not_available Kovac, I need to talk to you.
not_available Y
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nowhere.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available He seems like an interesting guy.
not_available Could use a little work on his bedside manner.
not_available Well, it's been a rough day.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Weaver's coming on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh good
not_available bye, Eddie.
not_available Take care.
not_available Good night.
not_available Did I miss anything? 
not_available No, I think it's on after the weather.
not_available Timmy, Channel 5 now.
not_available Pretty easy once you get the hang of it, huh? Yeah.
not_available Look, I appreciate you showing me the ropes today.
not_available Oh, please, I was once a, uh brash, overconfident new nurse myself.
not_available I just hope that we haven't changed your mind about County.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Why don't you let me buy you a drink or take you out to dinner just to say thank you.
not_available You mean like a date? 
not_available Does it sound like a date? Kinda.
not_available You can call it whatever you want.
not_available Just say yes.
not_available So, uh, did my incarcerated hernia guy? 
not_available Still in line for the OR.
not_available What? Do you think he needs a colostomy? Well, uh, it'll have to wait until I get there.
not_available Hey, Ray, you forgot to fill out the consult request on your CF'er.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available I was paged.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm sorry about that.
not_available Hey, and, uh you guys got to knock it off.
not_available I'm talking about Katey.
not_available She's a med student, Ray.
not_available I'm not gonna be evaluating her.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available I don't want you distracted or your judgment impaired.
not_available My judgment is fine.
not_available Besides, it's not like it's not going on around here all the time.
not_available Yeah, well, as long as I'm running the floor, it isn't, okay? Tell you what, Pratt.
not_available When it's your business to know about my love life, I'll let you know.
not_available Hey, hey, she's on.
not_available Shh, somebody turn up the sound.
not_available Last week, while looking for cans and bottles in the dumpster behind me, two homeless men found 
not_available Weaver's a real natural.
not_available what they thought was a child's discarded doll.
not_available Wow, this really turned out good.
not_available It's only TV.
not_available You're kidding, right? Shh, Henry just fell asleep.
not_available How many patients do you treat in one ER shift? 25, 30 tops? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It depends.
not_available Okay, well, on TV, you can reach a hell of a lot more than 30 people, and still help them.
not_available No, it's not the same.
not_available Yeah, but it still counts.
not_available Oh, my gosh.
not_available I can't believe it's me up there.
not_available Yeah, well, you better get used to it, because you're really very good.
not_available I couldn't have done it without my producer.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, you heading out? Thank God.
not_available It's been a long day.
not_available Yeah, this place can suck at times.
not_available Better leave while you can, huh? Uh, you know, Pratt's right.
not_available It's not cool to date a student.
not_available So now this is your business, too? 
not_available No, I'm only saying.
not_available She's nice and everything.
not_available I mean, I like her, but But what, Neela, what? Nothing.
not_available I'm concerned.
not_available Well, thank you, but I'm good and Katey's good.
not_available In fact, things are going great.
not_available Well, then, I'm happy for you.
not_available So, what's this really about? What? 
not_available Why do you care all of a sudden? We're friends, right? That's what friends do.
not_available Talk about the people in each other's lives.
not_available Oh, oh, that's how it is.
not_available Well, okay, friend, um, how's Gates? 'Cause you know what? I'm really not into playing your games anymore.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available Do you really think I'm gonna hang out waiting for you to find out that he's just jerking you around? Neela, you made your choice.
not_available You can't have it both ways.
not_available Ms.
not_available Gilliam, if you can think of anything else, give us a call.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is your husband back? 
not_available He'll be back soon.
not_available The police wanted to look at Danielle's computer, see if she kept a diary.
not_available Angela, I need to tell you something.
not_available Uh when Danielle was being examined by surgeons, she told the doctor and the nurse in the room that she did this.
not_available She cut herself.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available They must have misunderstood her.
not_available Well, she said she's done it before, but today she couldn't control the bleeding.
not_available She got frightened and she tried to run home, and that's when they found her.
not_available She also said a boy kissed her before class today.
not_available He tried to reach under her skirt, she pushed him away, 
not_available but she said she remembered something.
not_available Remembered what? That's when she went to the girl's room and cut herself.
not_available Luka, I don't understand.
not_available Angela Danielle talked about something that happened to you in Detroit, something she witnessed.
not_available Oh, God She saw When Danielle was nine, a man came to the door of our apartment, said he was doing repairs in the complex.
not_available He wore overalls and carried a tool box, so I let him in and he raped me.
not_available Danielle was playing outside.
not_available I never thought she had any idea.
not_available I never told anyone.
not_available Not even Paul.
not_available I didn't want to upset Danielle.
not_available I just wanted to put it all behind me.
not_available What did I do? 
not_available This isn't your fault.
not_available What did I do? I was so busy trying to keep it all together I didn't even see what my own daughter was going through.
not_available You did what you thought was best.
not_available You were just trying to protect your family.
not_available Hey, Neela.
not_available Neela, wait up.
not_available Oh, not now.
not_available Really, not now.
not_available Didn't get the chance to tell you 
earlier I'm moving.
not_available Oh, yeah, where? Well, I haven't actually found a place yet, but I so don't have time for this crap.
not_available Look, it's not like I can just walk out of there tomorrow.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available Sarah and Meg have had it rough for a long time 
not_available and they've come to count on me.
not_available Yeah, it must feel good to be the big hero.
not_available I promised my buddy a long time ago that I would take care of them 
not_available Oh, yeah, right, the promise.
not_available Tell me, was sleeping with your best friend's wife part of the deal, too? It wasn't about that.
not_available You know, you're not making this easy.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was supposed to.
not_available Look, right or wrong, yes, Meg and I sometimes Maybe it was out of comfort or convenience or loneliness.
not_available I don't know what you want to call it, but it wasn't love and we both knew that.
not_available Enough.
not_available Just stop.
not_available Stop lying.
not_available You're right.
not_available You're right.
not_available I haven't been honest for a long time.
not_available For ten years, I've dealt with people and things in my life in a way that I wouldn't have to get too close.
not_available Oh, and I suppose now you're going to tell me that it's different.
not_available Hell, yes.
not_available Since I met you, I've been a mess.
not_available You're making me think about the way I want my life to be, the way it could be.
not_available I am? My train's here.
not_available Hey, Chaz, Chaz.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey, man, what are you doing? Wait in the car for me, okay? 
not_available Sure.
not_available You don't have to leave.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available I never said I wasn't cool with it.
not_available You never said you were.
not_available All right, look, I
not_available I work on gay patients all the time.
not_available I work with gay doctors, but when it comes to my own blood, I I just need some time.
not_available That's all.
not_available Some time.
not_available That's funny.
not_available Greg, you're a lot more like Dad than you realize.
not_available No.
not_available It's not coming out like I mean.
not_available I could see when I told you you weren't okay with it.
not_available And maybe you'll never be okay with it.
not_available I sure hope someday you prove me wrong.
not_available So, tomorrow, they're taking Danielle to a private facility.
not_available Well, it sounds like she's getting the help she needs.
not_available Yeah, yeah, it's going to take some time, but I think they'll all get through it.
not_available Abby, you asked me about where I went.
not_available Yes, and you said something about "nowhere." 
not_available I went to see Curtis Ames.
not_available The patient who sued you? That guy in the park, when you lost Joe's toy, that was, that was Ames.
not_available How do you know? And this morning, he was on our street.
not_available He has been following us.
not_available What? I don't have proof, but today Wait, you didn't say anything? No, I just II thought 
not_available Luka.
not_available I
not_available I've been walking all around Chicago with our son.
not_available I know.
not_available and the babysitter takes him out every day.
not_available And there's a crazy, angry guy following us? 
not_available Well, it's over now.
not_available How do you know that? You don't know that.
not_available I know because I took care of it.
not_available How did you take care of it? I took care of it.
not_available Hey, let's just go home.
not_available We can talk about it there.
not_available Abby.
not_available Taxi! Abby, what are you doing? The train is too slow; 
not_available I just want to get home.
not_available Okay.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available I cannot believe you didn't tell me.
not_available I didn't want you to worry.
not_available You didn't want me to worry? 
not_available I thought we were past this.
not_available Past what? What are you talking about now? Thisin our relationship
not_available This need you have to protect me or, or shield me from the hurts of the world.
not_available Why are you bringing all that up? It's different now.
not_available We're different people.
not_available Yeah, that's what I thought.
not_available Look, I know I should have told you, but this is just about Ames.
not_available Don't make it about us.
not_available It is about us.
not_available I'm going.
not_available Are you coming or what?
