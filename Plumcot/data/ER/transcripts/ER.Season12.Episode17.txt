not_available People at work, I mean, they see this sliver of what you're about and make it all about that one thing.
not_available I know.
not_available They jump to all sorts of conclusions
not_available They don't know what I'm going through.
not_available They're making all these assumptions, but they only see what they wanna see.

not_available Too bad.
not_available Ha, ha.
not_available Timothy Weisner.
not_available There's always one ass in the audience determined to look smarter than you.
not_available He's that guy.
not_available You have his paper, right? He's gonna ask you about it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, not enough love in the sandbox needs to hear his own work cited in other people's talks.
not_available What? Relax, you'll be fine.
not_available I, uh, played a tangerine in a Christmas play in primary school.
not_available Lost my footing and rolled off the stage.
not_available I'm having flashbacks.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Read your slides, don't go too fast, and Well, memorize table three of the Weisner paper and you'll do just fine.

not_available She said you'd know what it's about.
not_available I do, and I do.
not_available She said if you do this, she'll watch any '70s movie you want even the extended version of Dawn of the Dead.
not_available And this came back on your overdose.
not_available You're sure this is right? 
not_available I even had them repeat it.
not_available How you feeling, Mr.
not_available Sadler? 
not_available About the same.
not_available But I suppose I won't feel much till most of the liver dies.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Your acetaminophen level is almost undetectable.
not_available That's strange.
not_available I know that's what I took.
not_available Could there have been anything else in the bottle? No.
not_available But, uh, that doesn't change the course of action.
not_available You still have to keep me on a hold.
not_available At least until Psychiatry sees you, yeah.
not_available Yeah, that makes sense.
not_available So, what happened in there? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available That wasn't nothing.
not_available She shouldn't be with someone like that.

not_available He's a jerk.
not_available He lives in Dorch it's the jock dorm.

not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Where's the boyfriend? Uh, staying away for now, out of respect for the family.
not_available Her brother doesn't think he's such a good guy.

not_available Uh, Surgery's still tied up? Yeah.

not_available Let's go to Plan B.
not_available Sam, call the perfusion team.
not_available What? 
not_available Heart rate's dropping.
not_available What does that mean? Putting her on a cardio
not_available pulmonary bypass.
not_available You need an O.R.
not_available and a surgeon.
not_available We don't have either.
not_available We're gonna cannulate, we'll bypass.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available If we work quick, we'll get her on before she suffers permanent hypoxic damage.
not_available Get a Resident.
not_available I'll find Abby.
not_available Tell me what's happening.
not_available The bleeding is blocking her airway.
not_available We can't get oxygen into her blood.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available We'll get her on a heartlung machine so we can buy more time before we can get her into an O.R., okay? 
not_available Whatever you think is right.
not_available Brady to 45, lost the pulse.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Mahir, you should wait outside.
not_available Mom.
not_available Go.
not_available Nimet.
not_available Nimet, you're a strong girl.
not_available You're a brave girl.

not_available Okay, what's this about, kids? I'm a doctor, very busy.
not_available You're Archibald Morris.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What do you need? You better have a seat.
not_available Here's the deal.
not_available We four live with different parents, but we all share the same dad.
not_available We're not supposed to be able to find out the identity of our father.
not_available But the Donor Sibling Registry allows us to find out the identity of each other.
not_available So I got in contact with them via e
not_available mail.
not_available And it actually turns out that little Max here is actually a computer genius.
not_available What's up? 
not_available What's up? He hacked the system at the sperm bank and found our father's name.
not_available Archibald Morris.
not_available So are you donor 140 from the Chicago CryoBank? Did you donate any sperm between 1991 and 1996? Ha.
not_available Did I ever.
not_available Heh.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm your daddy.
not_available Mr.
not_available Sadler.
not_available Being a sitter for crazy people seems like a really boring job.
not_available Well, guess what, Barry.
not_available You and the sitter can both go home.
not_available What? You convinced the psychiatrist it's safe to discharge you.
not_available No.
not_available You're free to go.
not_available Well, what about these? Mr.
not_available Sadler, you took what? Three, maybe four pills? 
not_available Two.
not_available Two.
not_available Yeah, but a gesture is a gesture.
not_available I was suicidal when I did it.
not_available The psychiatrist is convinced you're not gonna try it again.
not_available What if I'm homicidal? You have to keep me if I wanna kill people.
not_available Barry, ha, what's going on? The thing is I, uh
not_available I need to stay here.
not_available I can't go home this weekend.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I just can't.
not_available You're gonna have to do better than that.
not_available I'm in love with my best friend's girl.
not_available Ha.
not_available It happens.
not_available You'll get over it.
not_available They're getting married tomorrow.
not_available I don't trust myself not to To what? 
not_available Object.
not_available Or worse.
not_available Lock me up till the wedding's over, please.
not_available I'm begging you.
not_available I'll talk to Psych again, see what I can do.

not_available Who? Helen? Yeah.
not_available Have you told her how you feel? God, no.
not_available That would be crazy.

not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available It's okay, Nimet.
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available Got a flash.

not_available Nope.
not_available All right, give us some room.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll be right here.
not_available Just listen to my voice.
not_available It seems a little unconventional.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine, what's the alternative? 
not_available Somebody call Surgery again.
not_available Still working in an open chest five minutes ago.
not_available Did I tell you Mrs.
not_available Kalter's daughter has 14 bridesmaids in her wedding? We'll oxygenate her blood till Surgery's ready.
not_available It'll be awesome.
not_available If she doesn't bleed out.
not_available Threading easily.
not_available Nine yards of silk organza.
not_available Hook me up, Lockhart.
not_available Does Surgery know we're doing this? 
not_available They're not available.
not_available We can't wait.
not_available Silk flowers all around their neck.
not_available You must get better so you can help me with the embroidery.
not_available pH is only 7.02.

not_available Ninety
not_available two.
not_available Is it working? Her oxygen level is improving, yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for saving my daughter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Up to 15 percent of all deaths following motor vehicle collisions are caused by injury to the thoracic aorta.
not_available IUh We set out to document the incidence and utility of the seatbelt sign in predicting Is there anyone from audio
not_available visual support here? Unseen they suffer.
not_available Unheard they cry.
not_available In agony they linger.
not_available Alone they die.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available I would like to point out 
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available that our study didn't involve any rats.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Ray, meet my kids.
not_available Your what? Yeah, I needed cash in college, donated to a sperm bank.
not_available Best job I ever had.
not_available I'm Hana.
not_available My eldest.
not_available Stole her mom's car, drove to get everybody here.
not_available Michael is the regional "Dance Dance Revolution" champion.
not_available Melia is a professional jump roper, and my boy Max is a computer whiz.

not_available It's nice to meet you all.
not_available Yeah, I'm just giving them the tour.

not_available Uh, these, uh, are the trauma rooms, okay? 
not_available This is where Daddy saves lives.
not_available Cool.
not_available Abby, come meet my children.
not_available Not now, Morris.
not_available Okay, she hates kids.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Stable for now.
not_available Where'd the family go? 
not_available I made them get something to eat.
not_available It's gonna be a long night.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh, okay, I kind of snapped this morning.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's hormones.
not_available No, I hate that excuse.
not_available I just I just wanna say that I know you were trying to help, and I apologize.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available It's just strange being pregnant.
not_available It's so weird having such a personal thing be so public.
not_available Well, for me, being pregnant was something everyone was ashamed of.
not_available My parents didn't want me to leave the house.
not_available I think it's nice that everybody wants to share in this with you.
not_available Luka.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Tell us what's happening.
not_available Seventh unit, platelets, FFP going up.
not_available Wide open at the femoral.
not_available Somebody explain.
not_available What has gone wrong? Heparin's off, right? Heparin's off? 
not_available It's off.
not_available Okay, one gram of protamine.
not_available Please, you have to help her.
not_available Can't get her mean above 30.
not_available She's losing blood faster than we can put in.
not_available In order to put Nimet on this machine we had to give her a medicine that thins her blood.
not_available A side effect is internal bleeding.
not_available That might be what's happening now.
not_available If you stop the medicine, she'll be okay? 
not_available That's what we're hoping, yes.
not_available Whoa, acidotic, 6.8.
not_available Try one amp of bicarb and one gram of calcium.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Pupils are fixed and dilated.
not_available No corneal, no gag.
not_available Why? There's no head trauma, and no reason for a spontaneous bleed.
not_available Heparin
not_available induced thrombocytopenia can cause acute intracranial hemorrhage.
not_available She's been on heparin for less than an hour.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available Does it make sense? Check the oxygenator.
not_available Get another ACT.
not_available Volume's too low.
not_available No flow.
not_available She's lost some basic neurologic reflexes.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available We think that she's bled into her brain.
not_available Stop it, Mahir.
not_available I can't hear the doctors.
not_available Can you fix this? No, we can't.
not_available Her brain is gone and as soon as we turn the machine off, her body's gonna die too.
not_available Come back.
not_available Nimet is strong, she can fight.
not_available Stop, Mahir.
not_available Stop right now! This never would've happened if she stayed at home! 
not_available You should have made her stay.
not_available Enough! Please! There must be another machine or something! I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'll give my own blood.
not_available It was a good idea, Vic.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, if it had worked, right? You gave her the only chance she ever had.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry about the beta
not_available blocker.
not_available Ten milligrams was probably a bit much.
not_available The fainting part just makes for a better story.
not_available You know I once ate a hash brownie before giving a big talk in Amsterdam.
not_available I mistakenly thought that it would take an hour to kick in.
not_available Suddenly, I was up on a stage, completely out of my head lecturing to a roomful of biochemists in a faux French accent.
not_available Okay.
not_available I feel better.
not_available Today was a complete disaster, but at least I didn't bring it on myself.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You were the victim of a truly astounding confluence of technical problems miscalculated pharmaceuticals, and rat activists.
not_available As crazy as that sounds, that's totally in sync with my life at the moment.
not_available Well, your life sounds pretty interesting.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I know I may appear to be this kind of wild spontaneous girl who plans a wedding in a day and sits here getting drunk with her Attending in a hotel bar.
not_available But I'm not.
not_available I'm boring, really boring.
not_available All I wanna do is hang out at home with my roommate.
not_available Your roommate? Dr.
not_available Barnett? 
not_available Yeah, Ray.
not_available Well, that's nice.
not_available It's good the two of you get along so well.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available Maybe that's what I need.
not_available You know, I was thinking of getting a dog but a roommate's probably easier to housetrain.
not_available Are you ready for another round? Uh, no.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you, I, uh I should get going.
not_available It was worth a try.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need to go over organ donation and explain about the coroner.
not_available I don't wanna rush her.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available This might take a while.
not_available Maybe you should go home.
not_available Don't wait for me.
not_available I've been thinking, and if it's that important to your family I'm fine with the baptism.
not_available A little holy water never hurt anybody, right? Well, Archie, this was fun.
not_available I'm glad we came.
not_available Wait.
not_available You're not leaving, are you? I was gonna take you all out for burgers and shakes.
not_available Sorry, can't.
not_available I gotta get everyone home before 8 or our parents will start to worry.
not_available Well
not_available I mean, what's next? Now, I wanna take you guys to ball games, Millennium Park movies your parents won't let you see, there's so much.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available Um, we're all pretty busy.
not_available I don't know when I'll be able to steal my mom's car again, so Somebody hid the digital on the code cart.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Frank, thank you.
not_available I wanna take a picture.
not_available Really, we gotta run.
not_available Please, two seconds.
not_available Come on, please.
not_available Okay, everybody say freak.
not_available Samantha.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm glad you called.
not_available Where's all your stuff? Oh, I thought we were gonna conduct an interview first.
not_available I thought we already did.
not_available Hey, how was it? 
not_available Endless.
not_available Well, I'm making a stir
not_available fry.
not_available Beer or wine? Neither.
not_available I'm exhausted and already drunk.
not_available All right.
not_available Here.
not_available Taste this.
not_available Fresh water chestnut.
not_available Crazy, huh? Thought they grew in cans.
not_available All right, well, I rented The Omen, and I was too scared to watch it alone.
not_available Ray
not_available It's better than The Exorcist.
not_available I promise it's a classic.
not_available That's what you said about The Exorcist.
not_available True, but
not_available Ray.
not_available I know, you're tired.
not_available Ray.
not_available Okay, look.
not_available I know you don't like devil movies.
not_available It's the last one, I promise.
not_available I think I should move out.
not_available Why? 
not_available I think we both know why.
not_available Where's Mahir? I don't know.
not_available I'm afraid for him.
not_available He just needs some time.
not_available I'm sorry to bother you with this but, uh, you need to sign for her things.
not_available This is the hardest thing for any parent to experience.
not_available How do you protect them from all the evil in the world? You can't.
not_available No matter what you do, you can't.
not_available Mahir was beaten up at school after 9/11 for being Muslim.
not_available They called him a terrorist.
not_available Ever since then, he became very strict about his prayers.
not_available He cut himself off from everything except his fundamentalist friends.
not_available He wanted the same thing for his sister.
not_available There's a park down the street where we live.
not_available I close my eyes, and they're just little children on the swings.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I brought them to this country to find justice and freedom.
not_available But I lose two children today.
not_available Two children.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Mahir
not_available Mahir will be all right.
not_available I can't pretend that I don't know what I know in my heart.
not_available He loved his sister.
not_available But he thought she was disgracing the family, disgracing herself.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Doctor, doctor, doctor.
not_available Doctor, tell the police to search my house first.
not_available They should look into Mahir's room for the knife.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available This was an honor killing? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available That's what they call it.
not_available But there is no honor here.
not_available What the hell are you still doing here, man? Downloading the picture of my kids from the ER camera.
not_available Really photogenic, aren't they, huh? I'm gonna use this one for my Christmas card.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I hate Christmas cards, man.
not_available Hey, you wanna go grab some dinner together? Uh, no.
not_available My oldest boy, Michael, DJs an online radio show.
not_available I wanna check it out.
not_available Why don't we listen to it here? No, I can't.
not_available After that I gotta brush up on my trig so I can help Melia with her homework.
not_available She's 10 years old, she's smarter at math than I am, huh? Family really keeps you busy, huh? 
not_available Yeah, but it's worth it though, right? So you, uh, heading home? I heard your apartment got pretty messed up.
not_available No, it's fixed.
not_available I mean, that's finally what it took the landlord to paint it.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Cool.
not_available Welcome back, Vic.
not_available You have a good night.
not_available You too, man.
