not_available You've been a great friend.
not_available But? But there's this other guy.
not_available Both adults we enjoy each other Why not? None of you wants the family involved in your lives.
not_available He's not gonna break my heart! Men like him don't change! 
not_available Start an epinephrine drip.
not_available And a heart transplant too? Pizza? "Past Regret And Future Fear" Sleeping Beauty awakes.
not_available Hey.
not_available I was just checking my messages.
not_available You didn't even stir when the alarm went off.
not_available Dead to the world.
not_available It's not that often that I get a chance to sleep in.
not_available Don't rub it in.
not_available Some of us have to work Sundays.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available You know I've had my share.
not_available Well, you're welcome to stay.
not_available No reason to waste a warm bed.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Actually, I need to get going.
not_available There's tea and toast.
not_available You'll have to boil the kettle.
not_available But I think you can manage that.
not_available No.
not_available I've gotta go somewhere.
not_available Not some other clandestine meeting, I hope.
not_available Reece is getting baptized today.

not_available Hey, Peter.
not_available It was really lovely last night.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm hungry.
not_available You can't start without her.
not_available Why not? I knew this brunch was a bad idea.
not_available She's a little late.
not_available We should've met on neutral territory.
not_available I told you that deep down, your mother likes me.
not_available Keep dreaming.
not_available Finally.
not_available There you go.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.

not_available Can I get you guys a drink? You have orange juice? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Two mimosas, please.
not_available You brought champagne.
not_available Aren't we celebrating? Two happy couples, right? Did you see how he kept touching her back? I wasn't paying attention.
not_available You were busy laughing at his jokes.
not_available He was funny.
not_available And "sweet pea"? If he called her that again, I was gonna barf.
not_available I thought it was great.
not_available They met at the racetrack.
not_available Now, that was a senior citizen outing.
not_available So? They let anybody in those groups.
not_available Now, that's not true.
not_available This is the nicest your mother's ever been.
not_available I want to keep it that way.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available My mother hates men.
not_available "Hate" is a strong word.
not_available But accurate.
not_available Maybe she's getting some.
not_available Don't even go there! How was it? 
not_available In like Flint.
not_available I got it.
not_available You look like hell.
not_available You gotta love Saturday nights.
not_available ICU's packed.
not_available Two muggings, three bar fights, four gangbanger drop
not_available offs and a bad stroganoff from a wedding reception.
not_available And the guy who licked his girlfriend's shoe.
not_available Why's that? 
not_available She asked him to.
not_available Had to do a tongue culture.
not_available On that note, anybody hungry? No.
not_available Anna actually brought Sunday doughnuts.
not_available Cake isn't enough? You have to deep
not_available fry it? That's the point.
not_available How long you on? 
not_available Twenty minutes.
not_available Medevac is incoming.
not_available Twentynineyear
not_available old.
not_available Chemical accident.
not_available Bad chemical burn.
not_available Terrific.
not_available Hold the elevator.
not_available Going down? Up, actually.
not_available Up's fine.
not_available I'm surprised to see you here on a Sunday.
not_available Well, I'm just full of surprises.
not_available Covering the ER? You've signed up for a lot of extra coverage.
not_available You know, idle hands Lizzie, I think it's time you and I had a little sit
not_available down.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No problem.
not_available Let me buy you lunch.
not_available Is it about the HemoAid study? 
not_available That and the future.
not_available All right.
not_available Good.
not_available Then in about an hour? You said hydrofluoric acid? Yeah! Not hydrochloric? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Why? It's that
not_available I heard we had a burn victim.
not_available Actually, chemical burn! How bad? What do you got? Canterna, 31year
not_available old security guard.
not_available Chemical burns to the trunk, right arm and both legs.
not_available Doused with hydrofluoric acid.
not_available What happened? The vat was leaking.
not_available I tightened the valve.
not_available Just lie back and relax.
not_available I tried to rinse it off.
not_available I gave him 5 of morphine, You feeling any more pain? 
not_available It's okay now.
not_available All right, let's move him.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Usually improvement occurs within the first months.
not_available He's still working on his motor skills.
not_available Chase's progress has slowed considerably.
not_available All the more reason for aggressive therapy.
not_available He can get that at home.
not_available I want what's medically best for my cousin.
not_available I think this is a big mistake.
not_available John, it's often wise to listen to the perspective of those not personally involved.
not_available Chase is getting worse.
not_available He's lost all function on his left side.
not_available He just favors his right.
not_available You have to force him to use his left.
not_available I wish it were that simple.
not_available It is.
not_available Watch.
not_available John, please.
not_available Hey, Chase.
not_available How you doing? How you doing? You want to draw? He was left
not_available handed.
not_available He was drawing last week.
not_available Want to draw something? This isn't necessary.
not_available Okay? Okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Go ahead and you take the pencil.
not_available No, no.
not_available Other hand.
not_available Come on.
not_available He can do this.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available There you go.
not_available Now you're all set.
not_available What do you want to draw? 
not_available You.
not_available You want to draw me? Okay, go ahead.
not_available I rushed him.
not_available I rushed him.
not_available Can't rush him.
not_available All right? There you go.
not_available Let's try again.
not_available He needs calcium chloride, Five amps? Then set up an infusion.
not_available One gram every 15 minutes.
not_available So, Mr.
not_available Canterna, feeling any more pain? It's getting numb.
not_available Is that bad? Our immediate concern is the fluoride in the acid.
not_available Like toothpaste? Not exactly.
not_available The calcium can be drawn out of your cells.
not_available What does that mean? Well, it depends how much has penetrated your skin.
not_available We're giving you calcium intravenously to counteract the effect.
not_available Is there any family you want to call? 
not_available What are you not telling me? Hydrofluoric burns can be serious.
not_available Is there any family you'd like us to call? No, I don't really have family in Chicago.
not_available Okay, I'll be right back.
not_available Carol? Keep an eye on him.
not_available Make sure he's comfortable and watch his heart rhythm.
not_available Tell me if his leg gets worse.
not_available It's not his leg I'm worried about.
not_available You look nice.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, is Carla here yet? Inside.
not_available Hey, Uncle Peter.
not_available Where is she? Who? 
not_available Your girlfriend.
not_available Steven! 
not_available You said he had a new girlfriend.
not_available Well, I don't.
not_available Dad said Grandma was turning over in her grave.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Go in there and get a seat.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available You remember Roger.
not_available How are you doing, man? Carla, can I talk to you for a minute? All set? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We should do a little rehearsal before everyone arrives.
not_available Mom and Dad
not_available I'm the father.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Who's holding the baby? 
not_available I am.
not_available Can we just step back here? Yeah, come on.
not_available Everybody move around and make way.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available That's good.
not_available That's good.
not_available Here you go, little pickle.
not_available Mom in the middle.
not_available Dad right here on the end.
not_available Right here.
not_available That's good there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available I wasn't even supposed to go into work today.
not_available I was home restoring my car and the weekend guy called in sick.
not_available I figured I could use the overtime.
not_available What kind of car do you have? 
not_available She's a '63 Vette.
not_available She's a nice one.
not_available And she's got matching numbers.
not_available I'll fix her up.
not_available She'll be worth
not_available It's hurting under my skin.
not_available I'll give you something more for the pain.
not_available How long will this hang me up for? 
not_available It's hard to say.
not_available He's already severely hypocalcemic and the leg is necrotic.
not_available Any EKG changes? Prolonged QT.
not_available He's at risk for an arrhythmia.
not_available What does Toxicology say? Hydrofluoric burns of this magnitude are always fatal.
not_available There's no new treatment.
not_available His family on the way? 
not_available He doesn't have any in town.
not_available You might have time to fly somebody in.
not_available I guess I'd better go tell him.
not_available This is really starting to hurt.
not_available We can do something about that.
not_available Another 5 of morphine.
not_available Are you okay? You don't look so good yourself.
not_available Mr.
not_available Canterna, the calcium we're giving you can't reverse the chemical reaction in your body.
not_available What do you mean, chemical reaction? The fluoride is binding to your cellular calcium to form calcium fluoride the crystal salt that seeps into your body tissues.
not_available So, what does that mean? We're already seeing changes in your cardiogram.
not_available So now what? As the calcium level in your cardiac cells fall your heart's going to begin to fail.
not_available Are you saying I'm gonna die? 
not_available We're doing everything we can.
not_available Is that a yes? Yes.
not_available How long? Days? Maybe 12 hours.
not_available Is there anybody you'd like us to call? Mr.
not_available Canterna? I don't feel that bad.
not_available Let me know if the pain increases.
not_available It hurts.
not_available I just don't feel like I'm dying.
not_available We'll do everything we can to keep you comfortable.
not_available Maybe he's got it wrong.
not_available Shouldn't he call a specialist or something? You guys are giving up on me
not_available We're not giving up on you.
not_available I promise you that.
not_available We'll do everything we can.
not_available Are you sure there isn't someone we can call for you? 
not_available It's too late.
not_available How far away are they? No, I've been gone too long.
not_available She won't come.
not_available Who won't? My daughter.
not_available 21 years old.

not_available Six and a half.
not_available Oh, boy! 
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available You sure?

not_available Well, good for you.
not_available Gives me a month to get better.
not_available No promises.
not_available You might have pneumonia.
not_available We'll know more after the chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Didn't you have that voodoo woman yesterday? She's back? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She says voodoo man has taken over her body.
not_available This isn't the same one.
not_available Mine was 60.
not_available I had a voodoo guy last week.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Voodoo epidemic.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Ma'am, your ex

not_available Sir, can you tell me your name? 
not_available No use.
not_available You can't understand him.
not_available He might have a subdural.
not_available That could impair his speech.
not_available We should get a head CT.
not_available How do you do a neuro exam? It would help if we knew his baseline.
not_available Sir, can you push against my hand here? All right.
not_available Let's start with a C
not_available spine.
not_available Have you seen Elizabeth? 
not_available No.
not_available Wasn't she called down? 
not_available I just got here.
not_available Anna? 
not_available She's right there, actually.

not_available Maybe this is for the best, I guess.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was gonna make it up to her but I guess I ran out of time, you know? You'll have to let us know if you want to be put on a ventilator.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, do you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is it? Auto vs.
not_available pedestrian.

not_available All right.
not_available Call me at the first sign of arrhythmia.
not_available He might be posturing.

not_available I thought I'd be faster.
not_available How long has he been unconscious? 
not_available He just stopped crying.
not_available Pulse is weak.
not_available What happened? We were washing the car.
not_available I didn't see him.
not_available We need that room! 
not_available I backed up a few feet.
not_available Get that guy out of there! We're gonna roll him.
not_available Hang on.

not_available Down and right.
not_available What's that? What? 
not_available Lavage.
not_available It's a procedure to check for internal bleeding.
not_available That sounds pretty bad.
not_available Well, you never know.
not_available Is it a boy or a girl? It's a boy.
not_available You could go in there if you need to because
not_available No, no, no.
not_available They got it.

not_available I have a couple of thousand dollars in my savings account.
not_available Can you make sure it gets to Molly?

not_available I didn't get around to it.
not_available But I want to make sure I get her the money.
not_available It's not much, but I want to give it to her.
not_available I can get a public notary in here.
not_available I'll take care of it.

not_available Doug, are you done? 
not_available Almost.
not_available Hang on, hang on.
not_available Got it.
not_available We have to do a laparotomy.
not_available What's wrong with him? We have to control the internal bleeding.
not_available I need you to sign a release form.

not_available He has a good chance.
not_available Hold that elevator! Conni, you gotta cover my patient in Trauma 1.
not_available You're leaving?

not_available Where are you going? Can you do it for me? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't let him die! 
not_available I need you to sign.

not_available I understand.
not_available I understand.
not_available Please? Don't let him die.
not_available Turkey burger, please.

not_available What kind of salad dressings do you have? Caesar, ranch, Italian, blue cheese, honey mustard Catalina, oil and vinegar and poppy seed vinaigrette.
not_available I'll have the soup.
not_available So 
not_available So.
not_available Enjoying your year? It's been educational.
not_available I bet.
not_available Thoughts of staying, come fall? I've entertained the idea.
not_available Good.
not_available Is that what you wanted to talk about? No, not exactly.
not_available Must I guess? There's no way to say this but flat out, so here goes.
not_available Our relationship has not moved in a direction I would have liked.
not_available I have trouble communicating these types of feelings.
not_available But the fact is, I find you very attractive.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano
not_available Let me finish.
not_available I don't know what your long
not_available term plans are and I'm not foolish enough to think that colleagues can have an involvement without entanglements.
not_available But we have a lot of common interests and we share the same schedule.
not_available And it makes sense.
not_available So I would really like you to consider a date.
not_available Going out with me, on a date.
not_available What do you say? I'm flattered and shocked.
not_available Really? I thought you'd see right through me.
not_available No.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available However seeing as I do work for you I don't think it would be such a good idea.
not_available Not that under other circumstances Oh, I see.
not_available You have a policy.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available No fraternizing with people at work.
not_available Okay, I respect that.
not_available Just pretend that I never said anything.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, hey.
not_available I had to give it a shot.
not_available You know what's funny? For a while, I thought I was competing with Benton.
not_available Can you open your fist? How about your fingers? Just do that.
not_available How about just your fingers? What are you doing? Weaver said to examine him like any patient.
not_available By pinning his arm down? 
not_available I'm isolating finger motion.
not_available You're not afraid of hurting him? 
not_available Actually, yes.
not_available He's trying to tell me something.
not_available Head CT's normal.
not_available No subdural bleeds, no sign of brain abnormalities.
not_available He opened his hand.
not_available How about that? He's got a bad lac.
not_available He might've cut a tendon.
not_available They didn't teach this in med school.
not_available I guess we could call a hand surgeon down here.
not_available What did you do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Is he having a seizure or something? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available The x
not_available ray indicates you have what we call atypical pneumonia.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available There are several kinds.
not_available Do you have any birds in the house? 
not_available How did you know? Psittacosis pneumonia is carried by small birds.
not_available What is it? Is it a parakeet or a dove? 
not_available A falcon.
not_available A falcon? Only thing Daniel loves more than me.
not_available That's not true.
not_available I want to go to Italy for our honeymoon.
not_available He didn't want to leave Sinbad that long.
not_available Who's gonna feed him? What does he eat? 
not_available Partridges.
not_available It's not pretty.
not_available He doesn't eat them alive.
not_available We kill them and clean them first.
not_available That's where I come in.
not_available Well, that's probably how you contracted the pneumonia.
not_available I'll get a blood test to see what type.
not_available But we can treat it with antibiotics.
not_available Funny, I thought I was covering the ER.
not_available I was there, so I took it.
not_available What happened to your postop notes? 
not_available I thought we were past these games.
not_available Excuse me? The adolescent competition.
not_available He was in bad shape.
not_available Give it a rest.
not_available Peter, I was simply commenting on how strange
not_available You don't "simply" do anything.
not_available Something the matter? 
not_available The boy could bleed out.
not_available I mean, with you.
not_available Has something happened since this morning? No.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, I didn't know you were working today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I am now.
not_available I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one without a life.
not_available sustained splenic fracture Bus tour? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sandy Madder? Hi, I'm Carol Hathaway.
not_available We spoke on the phone about your ex
not_available husband.
not_available I'm sorry I can't help you.
not_available Just go right on.
not_available I'm working, okay? Look, I don't pretend to know the history here.
not_available That's right.
not_available Your ex
not_available husband isn't gonna make it through the night.
not_available Paul walked out on us.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Bus tour.
not_available He just left.
not_available He couldn't hold a job, couldn't handle it.
not_available I feel bad for him, but he's not a part of our lives.
not_available Bus tour? 
not_available All he wants to do is see Molly.
not_available He was never there for her, but now he wants her to watch him die? You really want him to die alone? Who are you? This isn't your business.
not_available I'm not putting my daughter through that.
not_available I understand how you feel.
not_available And you don't know me.
not_available But trust me, you're making a mistake here.
not_available I was a girl when my father was dying in the hospital.
not_available And I couldn't see him.
not_available I wasn't given a chance to say goodbye.
not_available You think you're protecting Molly, but she'll have to live with this.
not_available Did you know him, your father, before he died? I remember him.
not_available Molly won't remember Paul.
not_available She has no recollection of him.
not_available Now, I'm sorry, but he chose this for himself.
not_available Has anyone seen Carol? She had some administrative stuff upstairs.
not_available On Sunday? 
not_available Something about payroll.
not_available Mr.
not_available Canterna is asking for her.
not_available He needs 40 Lasix, IV.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Kerry, your labs came back.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Weinbach tested positive for HIV.
not_available No, Mrs.
not_available Weinbach is the older lady with the bird.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I made them redo it.
not_available I asked for cold agglutinin and antibodies, not HIV.
not_available Are you sure? It was marked on the form.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It makes total sense.
not_available I don't know why I didn't think of it.
not_available Want to do another one? 
not_available No.
not_available I can't do an HIV test without consent.
not_available Now what? He's been on methadone since birth? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You haven't stopped and started? 
not_available No.
not_available That's a long time.
not_available It's tough on neurological development.
not_available They told me to give him less, but it doesn't work.
not_available Are you still using? What does it matter? If you're breastfeeding
not_available I don't.
not_available Your baby has a high fever.
not_available He's sweating.
not_available His pupils are dilated.
not_available He has an abnormally high heart rate.
not_available All signs of withdrawal.
not_available Now, why would that be? I don't know.
not_available You're the doctor.
not_available When was his last dose? Come here.
not_available Yesterday.
not_available I ran out.
not_available My clinic is closed on Sunday, so I came here.
not_available More methadone? It's what he needs.
not_available You don't need it? What? You're using your baby to get methadone.
not_available I can get that for free.
not_available I think you come here when you can't score.
not_available I don't need this.
not_available He needs to be admitted.
not_available No way.
not_available You'll call the cops.
not_available You come here because no place else will give you the stuff.
not_available If you leave, that baby won't get treatment.
not_available Then give me some and let me go! Until next time? Vicki, you addicted your son.
not_available You strung him out.
not_available Don't you think it's time to do something right? Wait for his family.
not_available Someone will be looking for him.
not_available What if he's homeless? He couldn't survive out on the street alone.
not_available The cops are checking the neighborhood.
not_available He can't live that far.
not_available Hey, take it easy.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Why does he keep banging? 
not_available Maybe he is telling us something.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What is that, ring? Ring? Ring what? 
not_available A phone? You want us to call somebody? Lie still if that's what you want us to do.
not_available Four? Four? Four what? Are you giving us your telephone number? Four is the first number of your telephone? 
not_available Here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Four, then what? Then two.
not_available Two? I'll tell the father, and I'll meet you in Recovery.
not_available Your son sustained irreparable damage to the blood vessels supplying the spleen.
not_available We had no choice but to perform a splenectomy.
not_available But he's alive? Yeah, yeah.
not_available No, of course.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available Thank God! Look, in time he'll make a full recovery.
not_available Now, listen to me.
not_available He's gonna be prone to certain infections so he'll need to be vaccinated against
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available I made a mistake about the birds.
not_available You may have what's called pneumocystis pneumonia.
not_available Is that worse? 
not_available We need to get a sample from your bronchial tube to confirm it.
not_available But since it's the defining illness of AIDS, we should do an HIV test.
not_available AIDS? 
not_available That's a good one.
not_available We need to be sure.
not_available You don't know Loretta.
not_available Can I speak with her alone? 
not_available Why? No, it's all right.
not_available Daniel's practically my husband.
not_available To tell the truth, we made a mistake.
not_available We need written consent from our patients to test for HIV.
not_available However, we tested you by accident, and it was positive.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available It was a mistake, a mix
not_available up.
not_available Perhaps another test would remove any doubt.
not_available I'll take care of this.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Give her something for the pneumonia and we'll go.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Don't make me report you.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available You tested her illegally.
not_available Yes, but it would be unethical to let her leave untreated.
not_available I don't want to burden her with this.
not_available Have you been tested? I'm not talking about me, all right? There are drug programs that would drastically enhance both your lives.
not_available Can't you say they're for something else? Either you should find a way to explain it to her, or I'll have to.
not_available You disappeared on me.
not_available I needed to check on something.
not_available Molly's still not coming? I'm afraid not.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's better this way, she doesn't see me.
not_available Want to write her a note? I could take something down.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available It's too late.
not_available It wouldn't be fair.
not_available I think she'd really like to hear something from you.
not_available I was gonna make it up to her, I swear.
not_available I called her a couple of times last fall.
not_available You can guess how that went over.
not_available I figured they just needed time.
not_available I'm so glad you called me.
not_available I was going crazy.
not_available I can't believe he was able to give us your number.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lorenzo, I am so sorry.
not_available I lost all track of time.
not_available I got stuck with the rejects.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available John Carter.
not_available You understand? Katherine Dunlap.
not_available I'm Mr.
not_available Lorenzo's personal assistant.
not_available It takes a while to get the accent.
not_available Accent? He says you're a little slow but he'll forgive you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Can you tell him that they need to operate on his hand? You just did.
not_available He understands English.
not_available It's one of his many languages.
not_available He's a leading expert in hieroglyphics.
not_available That's fascinating.
not_available Liar.
not_available I understood that.
not_available Would you excuse me? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome Mr.
not_available Lorenzo.
not_available Gamma? Oh, John.
not_available I'm sorry to bother you at work.
not_available What's wrong? I'm not happy the way we left things earlier.
not_available Do you have a moment? Yeah, sure.
not_available Do you want to sit down? 
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available John, I respect your opinion.
not_available If you think we should keep Chase at the institute, I'll support that.
not_available I can't guarantee that it'll make any difference but I won't give up on him.
not_available I never intend to.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available I'm glad we've got that straightened out.
not_available Me too.
not_available I understand the freedom that comes with financial independence.
not_available But money or not, we're still your family.
not_available I know.
not_available You were always your grandfather's first choice.
not_available He's much too proud to come to you now but he'd really like you to come to him.
not_available What are you asking me? Finish your residency if you must.
not_available You can always practice medicine part
not_available time.
not_available But your family needs you, John.
not_available We need you to run the business.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Please.
not_available Think about it.
not_available No, I don't need to think about it.
not_available Gamma, I can't.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available It's all that I've ever wanted to be since Since your brother died.
not_available Since I was a kid.
not_available And there's nothing else for me.
not_available You really love it that much? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available Forgive me for asking.
not_available I had to try.
not_available I'll see you on your grandfather's birthday? You will.
not_available I always wondered what you'd be like when you grew up.
not_available Hey, Conni? Whose patient is this? I think it's Doug's.
not_available Where's the mother? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Yeah, it's Doug's.
not_available Get him, will you? Hi, sweetheart.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I just found him alone.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available Yeah, well, this baby has a fever.
not_available He's in heroin withdrawal.
not_available The mother's stealing his methadone.
not_available So she split? 
not_available I told her to do the right thing.
not_available Maybe she did.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available It's okay, buddy.
not_available No, please.
not_available Leave it open.
not_available How much longer? It's hard to tell.
not_available Please.
not_available Not long.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available I won't leave you.
not_available Do you have things you wish you did different? Doesn't everybody? You should fix it if you can.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Want me to read you back the letter? "Dear 
Molly You don't know me.
not_available I'm your father.
not_available I suppose I shouldn't even call myself that.
not_available You're the best thing I ever did with my life.
not_available Leaving you was the worst.
not_available God knows I haven't done much for you while I was alive but if there's a place called heaven and they let me in I promise to always look over you.
not_available Please forgive me.
not_available I'm sorry I never got to know you.
not_available " Me too.
not_available I'm gonna start to worry about you.
not_available First you work on a holiday and now I find you alone, standing out here in the dark.
not_available What are you doing out here? 
not_available Looking for you.
not_available Well, you found me.
not_available That brooding veneer is part of your appeal but I thought I'd broken through most of it.
not_available I should be at Carla's restaurant celebrating my son's baptism.
not_available I see.
not_available And you're here because? I don't want to feel like an intruder.
not_available Like I have to share my son with Carla's boyfriend.
not_available Do you? He spends all the time with him.
not_available How do I compete with that? You're his father, Peter.
not_available You don't have to compete.
not_available Then I thought I'd come and see you, but you had that lunch thing.
not_available Are you jealous? Well, your instincts were right.
not_available Romano propositioned me.
not_available Are you serious? What did you say? I lied.
not_available I said I don't date colleagues.
not_available It's cowardly of me, I know.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I lied too.
not_available What, about me? So much for a relationship without complications.
not_available You know what? Screw it.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Where? 
not_available To the party.
not_available There's still time.
not_available You don't have to prove anything.
not_available Elizabeth, I know that.
not_available I just want to go.
not_available You should go, but you should go alone.
not_available For your son.
not_available This is his day.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available Hey, thanks.
not_available Listen, if it's not too late Listen, I'll be up.
not_available Are you kidding? Hey, Anna! Hey, Carter.
not_available Want some cookie? You off? 
not_available Yep.
not_available You? 
not_available Another six hours.
not_available Bummer.
not_available Did you discharge Mr.
not_available Lorenzo? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He even gave me his web site.
not_available Why? So you could feel like an idiot? Max! Oh, sorry.
not_available That's okay.
not_available What time is it? 
not_available Ten to 2.
not_available Are you on call? 
not_available I'm waiting for Carol.
not_available She should be ready.
not_available They called it a half
not_available hour ago.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll just be another minute.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Take your time.
not_available Tough one, huh? You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You sure? He kept asking for his daughter.
not_available I never thought of it like that.
not_available Maybe he was asking for me.
not_available Maybe he wanted to see me and I never came.
not_available Your dad was probably in a coma.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I've lived my mother's version of it for so long, I don't know what memories are mine.
not_available What's her version? Everything was all right.
not_available That it was an accident.
not_available He was depressed, Doug.
not_available Maybe it's time you talked to your mom about it.
not_available After he was gone, my mom used to go on and on about how you can never depend on men.
not_available Now she's head over heels and I'm the one holding back.
not_available How messed up is that? It keeps me on my toes.
not_available I say I want time, but the truth is I'm scared to death of losing you.
not_available Well, don't be.
not_available I'm so sorry, Doug.
not_available Don't be.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
