not_available Once convinced they've mastered it, they're free to focus on humanistic skills.
not_available They're works in progress.

not_available But you can't teach empathy.
not_available Or common sense.
not_available Ray? 
not_available Yeah? People want to see a doctor, not a rock star.
not_available Put on some scrubs.
not_available We do have a dress code here, people.
not_available No stains, no tattered clothes, no leather, no piercings.
not_available Got it? You mean visible piercings, right? And if your shift starts at 7:00 and you come in at 7:02 that's two minutes off another Resident's life which is wrong and salary

not_available What's this? A ventriculostomy.
not_available I've made the skin incision.
not_available What? Three
not_available oh silk.

not_available Separate the attachments of the temporal muscle from the bone.
not_available Is it normal to have this much bleeding? 
not_available Yes.

not_available I can't see.
not_available More gauze, Sam.
not_available Frontal bones exposed.
not_available Nice.
not_available You'll use the twist drill to penetrate the outer cranium.
not_available Hold it perpendicular to the skull toward the ipsilateral medial canthus.
not_available Like this? Perfect.
not_available You can do this, okay? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available What is it? I just need Neela when she has a sec.
not_available Is this about my pregnant teenager? No.
not_available A guy whose wife died last week.
not_available He's been hanging around the hospital.
not_available Wants to talk to the doctor who handled her.
not_available That'd be you.

not_available One, two, three four, five.
not_available One, two, three, four, five.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis was pulled onto a critical case and won't be available for a while.
not_available Now, I'm sure you'd prefer her to do this.
not_available But we don't have a lot of time.
not_available And, unfortunately, I'm going to have to be the one to tell you.
not_available We think you have testicular cancer.
not_available What? Yeah, your urine was positive for a hormone called Beta HCG.
not_available Now, in women that hormone means pregnancy.
not_available In men it means testicular cancer.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We ran a number of blood tests that support the diagnosis.
not_available We will do a testicular ultrasound.
not_available But, yeah, I'm sure.
not_available But listen, it's treatable.
not_available Even if it spreads your chances are great, okay? 
not_available That's funny.
not_available What? 
not_available I was getting rid of the equipment.
not_available Ms.
not_available Mitchell you mind if I ask you why you wanted another doctor? It's like you put on a show here like you're not comfortable in your own skin.
not_available I don't trust that kind of energy.
not_available I know it too well.
not_available Three, four, five.
not_available He dying? Two, three four, five.
not_available He ain't dying, bitch.
not_available You hear me? Don't you let him die! 
not_available Three, four, five.
not_available Come on! One, two, three.
not_available Come on.
not_available No, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available Please.
not_available I said, let's go.
not_available Got no shovel here.
not_available We'll do it somewhere else.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Lay down.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I said, lay down.
not_available Transducer's reading on the portable.
not_available Bring a dose of Ativan.
not_available Pratt, walk him up to ICU.
not_available Me? Yeah, just to be safe.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That was incredible.
not_available You're gifted technically, Neela.
not_available That's what makes you feel best.
not_available Now all you have to 
do Take the confidence you have when you do a procedure like that and put it in the other half of your game.
not_available Not sure I know what you mean.
not_available Here's her chart.
not_available Jenna Putnam, multiple injuries sustained in MVC.
not_available Your signature.
not_available I still can't believe it.
not_available You handle what, 20, 30 cases a day? Easy to see how you could forget.
not_available But it was just Monday.
not_available I don't know what to tell him.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, I have no memory of that man's wife.
not_available Are you telling me to lie? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm telling you to trust yourself enough to comfort.
not_available Mr.
not_available Putnam? Yes? I'm sorry I didn't recognize your wife's name earlier.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available That's okay.
not_available But you do remember her now, though? She was lovely.
not_available She talked about how much you meant to her.
not_available How much she loved you.
not_available And I don't think she was scared.
not_available Hey.
not_available Changed my plans.
not_available I'm sorry? 
not_available Telluride.
not_available I'm in.
not_available If the offer's still open.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Oh, it's something.
not_available I can tell.
not_available I just Are you all right moving forward with this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available She wasn't even in the room? 
not_available Nope.
not_available He pulled her from somewhere else? Hey, Carter, I need your opinion.
not_available Talk to you later? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Neurosurg called to find out why Kovac did a ventriculostomy in the ER which is difficult enough to explain.
not_available Factor in the idea that he actually let Neela perform it.
not_available And so? 
not_available A, it's a very difficult procedure.
not_available B, in a delicate situation like that it's customary to let the senior Resident have first crack at it 
not_available and Pratt was right there.
not_available Hey, I told her it was no big deal.
not_available Well, I'm gonna talk to Kovac about it.
not_available Are you kidding? 
not_available No, I'm not kidding.
not_available You don't think that's an overreaction? 
not_available Thanks for your support.
not_available Susan, I understand you want to define yourself as chief.
not_available I do, we all do.
not_available But? Are you sure that this is the way you want to do it? Stop crying, man.
not_available It won't bring him back.
not_available It's almost 10:00.
not_available They'll be getting up around the block.
not_available Listen.
not_available I'm not gonna tell anybody.
not_available Okay, I really won't.
not_available I just wanna go home.
not_available Hiding out, are you? Maybe.
not_available Sometimes I'd use the utility closet instead.
not_available Worse lighting, but more privacy.
not_available So how's it going? 
not_available Good.
not_available Actually, it blows.
not_available Every time I turn around, I'm offending someone or hurting someone's feelings or acting like a total 
not_available crab.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available It sucks to be in charge.
not_available So, what do you do? Get used to not being liked.
not_available That's it? That's your advice? Look, it's what we as women have the hardest time with.
not_available We want to be liked, care what people think.
not_available The fact is, when you're in a position of authority, you'll piss people off and you're gonna lose friends.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hope it helps.
not_available Hi, this is Abby.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Hey, it's Susan.
not_available You're probably not there.
not_available Don't know, maybe you're at the movies or down by the river having a smoke.
not_available If that's the case, I should be pissed.
not_available If it's not, I'm worried.
not_available Hopefully I'll see you before you get this message.
not_available Sorry about today.
not_available This is it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We got business to take care of.
not_available Get out.
not_available Thanks anyway.
