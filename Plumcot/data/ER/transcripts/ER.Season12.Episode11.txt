not_available You see this? That's the heart beating.
not_available It's about seven weeks old, I'd say.
not_available They won't understand.
not_available Your parents? 
not_available They'll say I've sinned.
not_available I can help you talk to them if you want.

not_available Call me when they get here.

not_available Just left one day.
not_available What if I don't know how to love it right? Abby.
not_available Maybe I'm not strong enough.
not_available Being a parent makes you stronger.
not_available And it breaks your heart.
not_available You told me that.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available I'm sorry, I didn't meanNo, don't
not_available Don't use that as a reason.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What if I go shopping and leave it in the supermarket? Don't worry, I'll do all the shopping.

not_available We'd like to be alone with our daughter now.
not_available Thank you.

not_available Stable after the chest tube.
not_available Anything enter the peritoneum? 
not_available Not sure.
not_available Ultrasound's negative.
not_available Doesn't answer my question.
not_available Hey, I got the cops out here.
not_available Relax.
not_available Relax.
not_available I got your back.
not_available If you can get a smile out of Surgery, I'll pay for the date.
not_available You're right on the cusp of sexual harassment.
not_available The cusp.
not_available That would be a new position for me.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available I'm the Attending Physician on this case.
not_available Clemente? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This dude is very sick.
not_available He's out of it completely.
not_available He won't be able to give a statement.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hold on a sec.
not_available You're Victor Clemente? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Were you listening to me? 
not_available He won't be able to give a statement.
not_available Easy.
not_available We're not here on your patient.
not_available We're here for you.
not_available Dubenko's feisty gopher's at it again.
not_available What? The chief Resident from the Death Star.
not_available She's down on a consult.
not_available Albright? He's hemodynamically stable with no peritoneal signs.
not_available So why'd you call me? 
not_available Look, missy, it's protocol, all right? You didn't really just call me "missy," did you? Okay, look.
not_available The case meets trauma criteria.
not_available Next time, call me when you know what you got on your hands.
not_available Are you Dr.
not_available Albright? He was stabbed.
not_available I need to know if he needs surgical repair.
not_available Neela Rasgotra.
not_available I wanted to catch you about doing a surgery elective.
not_available Right.
not_available Work up your patient.
not_available Image the belly, explore the wounds, figure out how deep they are.
not_available If they enter the peritoneal cavity, call me.
not_available I'll be more than happy to get involved.
not_available One
not_available third of stab wounds enter the peritoneal cavity and damage the viscera.
not_available One
not_available third go in and don't hit anything.
not_available And one
not_available third are shallow and tangential.
not_available The trajectory was suggested by the hilt mark of the knife.
not_available He won't need surgery.
not_available You should pay more attention to your interns, Red.
not_available I'm an R2, actually.
not_available Okay, R2.
not_available Call me about that elective.
not_available We might be able to work something out.
not_available Parking violations? You gotta be kidding me, right? Okay.
not_available But you had some other problems back East.
not_available What problems you talking about? You left Newark General under some serious allegations.
not_available I never.
not_available I never, never, never compromised a patient's care.
not_available Do you understand me? I never.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Let's get back to Mrs.
not_available Kenyon.
not_available She had issues
not_available What issues? She had no issues.
not_available She was a nurse.
not_available I'd ask her for 6
not_available 0 Vicryl and she'd bring it to me.
not_available No issues.
not_available Can I go now? Thank you.
not_available Not yet.
not_available All right.
not_available You do realize that son of a bitch hits her? So you have seen her? 
not_available You realize that.
not_available No, I haven't seen her.
not_available But I can see what's going on here and it's pretty low.
not_available To sic you on me because he can't keep his wife happy, that's pretty pathetic.
not_available All we know is Mrs.
not_available Kenyon's a missing person who might be in trouble.
not_available Be in more trouble if you find her.
not_available Meaning? Meaning sometimes people go missing because they feel safer that way.
not_available My 
advice Stop looking for her.
not_available Don't you go missing.
not_available I'm gonna wanna talk to you.
not_available Why would I go missing? Why? Confusing me for one of your scumbags? Settle down before it gets embarrassing.
not_available Hope this conversation doesn't throw me off my game.
not_available After all the cops' lives I've saved.
not_available I'd hate to be less than 100 percent when your brother comes in with a bullet.
not_available I think we're done for now.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Hey, we got any loperamide in stock? Yeah, I'm sure we have some.

not_available This is big.
not_available This is a big opportunity for my band.
not_available And for me.
not_available And you never know when you're gonna get another shot like this.
not_available My recollection is you were warned last year about your commitment to this job.
not_available Yes, I was.
not_available To your credit, you've done an excellent job showing us that you wanna be here.
not_available I do.
not_available You're a good doctor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We don't need to discuss this further.
not_available You're valuable, you're valued.
not_available Conversation over.
not_available Have you tried the stuffing? It's great stuffing.
not_available And, you know, I got you an extra piece
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett! Look, Kerry
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Have you ever dreamed about something without ever believing it would actually happen? Because that's what this is.
not_available I've This is so huge to me, that if I couldn't do this I would seriously consider quitting.
not_available Far be it from me to stand in the way of the next Springsteen or KC &amp; The Sunshine Band.
not_available Resignation accepted.
not_available What? Why do you wanna do surgery? 
not_available I'm curious about it.
not_available The hours suck, Attendings are slave drivers Residents stab each other in the back.
not_available Not like down here where we're just one big, happy family.
not_available What's wrong? Ashlee Simpson get caught lipsynching again? 
not_available I think I just quit.
not_available Quit? To go to California with my band.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, bold move.
not_available I like it.
not_available Keeping that music dream alive.
not_available No, you'll love California.
not_available Everybody, Ray Barnett, rock god.
not_available Morris, I've already sent my paperwork up to Surgery.
not_available Well, get it back.
not_available I can't spare you, especially now with Ray on his way out.
not_available If we're not fully staffed, you're not going anywhere.
not_available I don't care what Dr.
not_available Cruella says.
not_available Three forty
not_available five, that'll work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ray's on his way out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Up and quit, not gonna let the man keep him down.
not_available I don't think he meant to.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Guys, come here.
not_available Know the girl I've been hanging with? 
not_available Jodie? Yeah, we love Jodie.
not_available Taught me to tie a knot in a cherry stem using only my tongue.
not_available Really? 
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Anybody ask for her? 
not_available No.
not_available You never saw her, okay? And if anybody asks, the same goes for me.
not_available What? 
not_available Pretend you never heard of me.
not_available Pratt's bringing in a patient.
not_available Get with him, okay? Okay.
not_available He gets weirder every day.
not_available Look, you heard what Dr.
not_available Albright said.
not_available So? She's the chief Resident upstairs, I'm the chief here.
not_available You work for me.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available Fair? What's fair? Excuse me, doctor.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ramsey.
not_available I can sign whatever I need to, and we'll get out of your way.
not_available Like me to call anyone for further treatment? Thank you.
not_available I think we'll arrange our own prenatal care.
not_available Amanda decided to keep it? The baby.
not_available It's just that she's young and it was an accident.
not_available No, no.
not_available I don't believe in accidents.
not_available Now, I know you may not understand this but it is God's will for her to have this child.
not_available I only mean you may want to consider the long
not_available term effects.
not_available You might wanna consider the spiritual effects of what you're suggesting.
not_available It's my job to make sure the patient understands all the options available.
not_available A human life has just been created.
not_available And I'm sorry, but anything that interferes with that is morally indefensible.
not_available Finished a cycle of chemo two days ago.
not_available Couldn't get an IV, he's too dry.
not_available Pratt, O.R.
not_available needs an Attending to sign off on your pancreatic pseudocyst.
not_available Where's Clemente? 
not_available On the roof.
not_available We're getting a chopper patient? 
not_available No.
not_available He just says that his cell phone gets better reception up there.
not_available Place a subclavian and bolus him.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Okay, triple lumen tray and 1 percent lido.
not_available He's tachy at 132.
not_available A little bit cold here.
not_available I was never the sickly type, you know.
not_available No? 
not_available Always very healthy.
not_available Used to do triathlons.
not_available Believe that? 
not_available Me too.
not_available Really? Smoking, drinking and watching TV.
not_available You should stop that.
not_available I have.
not_available Six years ago, I find out I inherited the Philadelphia chromosome.
not_available Ran on my mother's side of the family.
not_available I never knew.
not_available Screwed by genetics.
not_available First time, I was panicked the baby would be bipolar.
not_available I'm not so sure I've changed that much.
not_available The chances are slim, you know that.
not_available Crossing the street is a risk.
not_available If you let it get to you, you'd never have children.
not_available Nobody would.
not_available Well, maybe some people aren't supposed to.
not_available Well, I don't think you're one of them.
not_available Yeah, well, you don't know what it was like with Maggie and Eric.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're looking for reasons again.
not_available And what are you looking for? Someone to have a baby with? That what you think? Because if it is, then what the hell are we doing here? Happy New Year.
not_available A whole cascade of things have to happen to cause CML.
not_available Philadelphia chromosome doesn't mean cancer.
not_available No, just that you're born with a big strike against you.
not_available As soon as you get this message, call me.
not_available I wanna talk to you immediately.
not_available Right away.
not_available Maybe you're trying me right now, so I'm just gonna hang up and And you gotta call me.
not_available You gonna jump? 
not_available It's not a trick question.
not_available Yeah, sure it's not.
not_available Here.
not_available I need you to sign off on this.
not_available What are you doing here? It's freezing.
not_available Yeah, well, I got a very high core temp.
not_available It's a Latin thing.
not_available You wanna talk or something? 
not_available No.
not_available Why would I? I don't know.
not_available You seem a little ragged.
not_available Yeah, I just got some chick trouble, that's all.
not_available Then I'm your men.
not_available Except I don't like to share.
not_available You know, I heard you never stick anyplace.
not_available Maybe people don't go to the mat for you because they have no idea who you are.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, so there was this crazy nurse at my last hospital.
not_available In Newark? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's a piece of work, and it just ended bad.
not_available It usually does.
not_available You know, I came here just to focus, to stay on the straight and narrow.
not_available Sounds like a good idea.
not_available Yeah, one would think.
not_available Except it's easier said than done, because this girl she's got my number, if you know what I mean.
not_available And a very pissed
not_available off husband.
not_available See? I'm starting to like you more already.
not_available Damn, so many patients.
not_available Don't you feel better now? 
not_available Not really, no.
not_available Can't say that I do.
not_available Type and Rh are back on Amanda.
not_available Then we're done.
not_available You off already? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have a doctor's appointment.
not_available Oh.
not_available I'm going to see Coburn.
not_available Coburn? 
not_available At her practice.
not_available I'll get Clemente to cover.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You're working.
not_available No, I should come with you.
not_available It probably would be easier if you didn't.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available When I say I want us to keep it, you don't like the way it sounds.
not_available But anything else is a lie.
not_available Luka.
not_available Neela's waiting for you to sign off on the Ramsey girl.
not_available Get Clemente to do it.
not_available He's MIA.
not_available I don't know what else to say.
not_available Don't say anything.
not_available Take one of these every day.
not_available It'll help keep you and the baby healthy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where are your parents? My mom's making some calls and my dad had to go to a meeting.
not_available If it makes you nauseous, try taking it at night before you go to bed, okay? This is some more information that might be useful.
not_available And we got this for you from the ultrasound.
not_available I wish this didn't happen.
not_available I wish I could make it go away.
not_available Well, everything happens for a reason.
not_available There was this party at my friend Ginny's house.
not_available And I drank some beer and I did some other stuff with a couple of guys, and And I must have passed out in the bedroom because when I woke up my jeans were on the floor and there was blood all over the sheets.
not_available I tried to change the covers
not_available Amanda were you raped? Always thought the first time would be with someone I loved.
not_available Why didn't you say something? I don't want this.
not_available Please.
not_available You need to explain to your parents what happened.
not_available They'll understand.
not_available You have to tell them.
not_available I did tell them.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Ramsey? I'll call you back.
not_available Amanda told you what happened to her? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And you still want her to do this? That baby can't be punished for how it was conceived.
not_available It's not up to us to determine who gets to be born.
not_available We're talking about a 15year
not_available old girl.
not_available Your daughter, who was raped.
not_available Neela.
not_available You'd force her to carry this to term, change her life? I wouldn't force her to do anything.
not_available She believes the same things that we believe.
not_available This is an inappropriate conversation.
not_available Inappropriate? 
not_available She's terrified, doesn't wanna keep it.
not_available Let's take a walk.
not_available Think for one minute about what's in your daughter's best interest.
not_available You think it's in her best interest to kill the baby? Because I can assure you that in the eyes of God, it most certainly is not.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Leave these people alone now.
not_available They've made a decision.
not_available Parents have no legal rights.
not_available Pregnancy emancipates her.
not_available There's nothing else you can do.
not_available That girl's head is so far twisted, she doesn't understand she has a choice.
not_available She doesn't want an abortion.
not_available She doesn't wanna have the baby either.
not_available Anyone can see that.
not_available What about misoprostol? It's used as an abortifacient.
not_available She won't consent to that.
not_available Just let it go, Neela.
not_available You're the wrong person to talk to about this.
not_available Excuse me? I would like your permission to consult another Attending.
not_available Someone who's not Catholic.
not_available Listen to me very seriously.
not_available I'm a doctor first, above and beyond anything else and I don't let my personal beliefs get in the way of a patient's best interests.
not_available Ever.
not_available Now, give me that chart and move on to the next one.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I There's gotta be something that we
not_available You're done here.
not_available Do you wanna have this baby? I have to.
not_available Is it what you want? No.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available This is called a laminaria.
not_available It goes into the cervix where it absorbs water and swells, creating a larger opening.
not_available After that happens it's possible that the fetus might fall out.
not_available Possible? 
not_available You might have a miscarriage.
not_available Does it hurt? 
not_available A little.
not_available There might be some cramping.
not_available Is it a sin? It's just a medical way we have of giving God a chance to reconsider.
not_available Abigail Lockhart? Oh, my God.
not_available Nobody was out today.
not_available I had the pick of the litter.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available You gotta leave.
not_available Hey, what the hell's wrong with you? Cops are on me, getting on my ass.
not_available Why? Your dick of a husband, Bobby, has put out a missing
not_available persons report.
not_available That's why.
not_available He did? Yeah.
not_available How long we got till he traces you to me? How long before I'm walking around with my testicles in a jar? Tell me.
not_available Vicky.
not_available Vic, Vic.
not_available I love you.
not_available Sometimes you can be such a little faggot.
not_available Oh, yeah? I'm gonna get a big boyfriend who'll kick your maniac of a husband's ass.
not_available How do you like that, huh? How do you like that? Hey, you're ripping the leather.
not_available Quiet, will you? 
not_available That's great.
not_available That's great.
not_available You gotta pay your tickets.
not_available That's great.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Vic, what's going on? Hey, X
not_available Ray, how's it going? So this must be Jodie, huh? Who, her? That's not Jodie.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's weird.
not_available I've parked here a lot of times and never had a problem.
not_available Yeah, it's weird.
not_available We're gonna take the el.
not_available Right.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available Likewise.
not_available Yo, Ray.
not_available Bret.
not_available Hey, how was practice? 
not_available Thanks for meeting me, man.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Grab some coffee? Yeah.
not_available So I took care of everything.
not_available Schedule's all cleared up.
not_available I thought we were gonna talk before you did anything.
not_available Did something happen? Don't tell me Ginzberg isn't interested.
not_available No, it's still on.
not_available Here's the thing.
not_available You've been pretty busy with this whole doctor thing lately.
not_available Kind of distracted, you know? 
not_available True.
not_available True.
not_available But I'm a hundred percent onboard now, okay? Hundred and ten, actually.
not_available Well, we all got together and talked about it.
not_available Who did? The guys.
not_available This morning.
not_available Kind of decided the band's gotta make some changes.
not_available Changes? What do you mean, changes? You'll need to come back to have the laminaria removed.
not_available Probably feel a little pain.
not_available Nothing to worry about.
not_available You can take ibuprofen.
not_available That should help.
not_available Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee.
not_available And before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
not_available Jeremiah 1:5.
not_available Man was born of dust.
not_available It was only when God breathed life into Adam that he became a living soul.
not_available Genesis.
not_available You're a Christian.
not_available What do I tell my mom? She'll think you're having a miscarriage.
not_available And you will be.
not_available All done.
not_available You can take her home now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Weaver's MRI results are back.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Sorry? What were you doing in there? Taking care of the patient.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available It's me.
not_available I guess I missed you.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available Okay.
not_available Advanced degeneration with a cartilaginous flap.
not_available At least that explains the pain.
not_available I've seen that kind of thing heal with enough bed rest and physical therapy.
not_available I've been putting this off for years.
not_available Maybe it's time to face the music.
not_available I'll need a total hip replacement.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available Just when Henry's starting to run around like a crazy man.
not_available How is he? 
not_available He's great.
not_available You should see him.
not_available He looks just like Sandy.
not_available Went by your place but I figured you might come home this way.
not_available I don't want everything we have to come down to this one decision.
not_available We can get past it.
not_available You did what you had to do.
not_available Doesn't mean we can't be together.
not_available I didn't do it.
not_available I couldn't.
not_available I wanna keep it.
not_available I want us to have this baby.
