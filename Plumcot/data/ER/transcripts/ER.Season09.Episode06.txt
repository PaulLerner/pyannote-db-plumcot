not_available He's doing a good job, considering.
not_available Considering what? 
not_available He has Parkinson's.
not_available Excuse me? How much did you take out? 
not_available None of it.
not_available None of it? Metastatic lesions are studding the entire abdominal cavity present on the outer surface of the liver the spleen, the small intestines, the colon.
not_available Shouldn't you take out what you can? Surgical removal won't affect survival.
not_available You need to see an oncologist.
not_available Survival? You don't think I'll survive it? 
not_available You need to see an oncologist.
not_available No.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Do I have a chance or don't I? There's always a chance, Mr.
not_available Willow.
not_available How much of a chance? Given the extent of your disease, with chemotherapy less than a 10 percent, five
not_available year survival.
not_available What's the earliest? The least amount of time? I'll have the oncologist see you.
not_available Excessive therapy.
not_available Excessive.
not_available How's this for excessive? I had my arm sliced off.

not_available Hence, the martini
not_available shaker reference.
not_available Come on, work with me.
not_available Stress and sleep deprivation only exacerbate his symptoms.
not_available He says he's managing it, makes a good argument.
not_available It's not fair to the others to pick up his slack.
not_available I won't put the man on 
not_available He'll nap.
not_available It's bad enough he has to treat patients.
not_available Oh, I get it.
not_available What? You have something against doctors with disabilities.

not_available case basis.
not_available Look if this guy wants the surgical

not_available The last thing I need is some gimp lawyer from the ACLU coming in here telling me to put handrails on the urinals.
not_available And, "The guy with the twitch, he's suing you.
not_available " What and we care nothing about Mr.
not_available Nathan? Who's Nathan? 
not_available Him.
not_available My Parkinson's student.

not_available Did she fall? 
not_available She was in her seat when we found her.
not_available I don't see any signs of trauma.

not_available It comes with the territory.
not_available Where's Eric? 
not_available He went out for a smoke.
not_available A smoke? 
not_available I know.
not_available I tell him to quit, but he doesn't listen.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm being sent to the principal's office because of you.

not_available You pissed off a bunch of nurses.

not_available I have a good attitude.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available I do.
not_available Abby, I still can't find her.

not_available When did you start smoking? 
not_available Oh, a while ago.
not_available What's "a while"? 
not_available What difference does it make? I don't know.
not_available Nobody starts smoking over the age of 25.
not_available Well, what can I say? I'm a late bloomer.
not_available You know, I'm serious.
not_available Eric, it's really not good.
not_available Well, you smoke, and you've been smoking since you were what, 8?

not_available Got hives and anaphylactic shock.

not_available A new record.
not_available Well, we can clear that up.
not_available Do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No.
not_available I wanna sign a DNR.
not_available My liver's sick.
not_available My lungs are shredded.
not_available The antibiotics will make you feel better.
not_available Don't take it personally.
not_available I just don't want any more help.
not_available I'm ready to die.
not_available Can you hold her arm down? 
not_available Nobody mentioned she was seizing.
not_available She is not.
not_available Six centimeter jagged scalp lac.
not_available Looks like it's torn straight to the bone.
not_available What was she in for? 
not_available We don't know for sure.
not_available Police found her asleep on the El.
not_available Possible drug overdose.
not_available Possible brain bleed.
not_available I just don't understand these girls who'll take any pill handed to them at a party.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday 
not_available Yeah.
not_available could you witness a DNR? I need a second physician's signature.
not_available Oh, there's no gag.
not_available She's not protecting her airway.
not_available I got it.
not_available Thanks, Luka.
not_available Okay, let's intubate her and then get her up to CT.
not_available Care to do the honors? Yeah, sure.
not_available Scope in the left hand.
not_available Sats are 98.
not_available Slide along the tongue.
not_available Across and out of the way.
not_available Good.
not_available That was excellent.
not_available Now look for the cords.
not_available That's it.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Lucky lottery ticket? It's only 2 bucks a pop.
not_available They' re one buck across the street.
not_available Not with my patented number
not_available selection system.
not_available Looks like she's feeling better.
not_available She should, after 125 milligrams of Demerol.
not_available She had a migraine.
not_available So she needed Demerol? She failed Compazine, she's allergic to Imitrex, and she's almost 21.
not_available Oh, he mentioned that, did he? 
not_available He's a funny guy.
not_available He thinks he's in love.
not_available Well, you can't have enough love in the world.
not_available What, you don't like her? 
not_available I just met her.
not_available So did he.
not_available Jerry, call me when the labs for Fay Graham get here.
not_available You bet.
not_available Speaking of betting, are you feeling lucky today, Dr.
not_available Chen? Reselling lottery tickets is a felony.
not_available Got an officer needs some work here.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She was involved in a shooting.
not_available Her hand got shredded by a window.
not_available She says it's no big deal.
not_available It's not.
not_available Let's sit down right here.
not_available She's lost a pint by now.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Okay, let me take a look at it.
not_available Abby, director of Nursing's calling.
not_available You' re late for a meeting with Romano.
not_available Okay, here.
not_available Someone'll be with you in a minute, okay? Nathan, you' re surgical, right? Yeah, but I'm taking this
not_available Somebody from Trauma or Hand should take a look at this.
not_available Irrigate, but she might need an O.R.
not_available She collapsed on the street.
not_available She's got pneumonia, signs of liver rejection.
not_available Why isn't she on a vent? She declined the use of one.
not_available You said she had pneumonia and her lungs are shot.
not_available How will she breathe? Mr.
not_available Deluca, your daughter signed a "do not resuscitate" order.
not_available She's just depressed.
not_available She gets that way sometimes.
not_available Let me talk to her.
not_available I don't think she wants to be talked out of it.
not_available Of course she does, she's just a kid.
not_available She's 26.
not_available She gets tired.
not_available Yeah, she's dying.
not_available We' re all dying.
not_available Not like that.
not_available She's in tremendous pain.
not_available And she knows that that's never gonna change.
not_available She stopped taking her anti
not_available rejection meds weeks ago.
not_available Catch her up.
not_available Can't do that.
not_available Then I'll make her take them.
not_available It won't work.
not_available She's allergic to the only medicine that can keep her alive.
not_available We'll find new meds.
not_available And when those fail she'll need a complete heart
not_available lung transplant for even a chance of survival.
not_available Then I'll get her one.
not_available So she can face the same disease all over again? If you don't want to fight for her I'll find a doctor who will.
not_available Insert and cock your wrist at 90 degrees.
not_available Fired three rounds before I knew it.
not_available Departmentissue semi
not_available automatic.
not_available If possible, use your pinkie to steady your hand.
not_available It was all really fast, you know? 
not_available I'm sure you did the right thing.
not_available It's my first week.
not_available I've been scared every day.
not_available If it's not what you were expecting there's no shame in exploring other options.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, I need you.
not_available I'll be back to check the sutures.
not_available Could you put some pressure right here? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available She was so altered when she came in.
not_available Don't you think that officer could be suffering from post
not_available traumatic stress? Yes.
not_available Call a social worker.
not_available You know, I just thought it was me, but you' re kind of cool, aren't you? Pardon? 
not_available A social worker? Isn't it our job to take care of people? If you insist on being on a surgical rotation, Mr.
not_available Nathan, act like a surgeon.
not_available Act like I don't give a damn.
not_available Got it.
not_available That woman's hand is bleeding and in need of suture.
not_available That's how you can help.
not_available What was it? 
not_available She was altered when she came in.
not_available I figured it was something that wouldn't show on a tox screen, like Ecstasy.
not_available I read this article about Special K
not_available Come on, get on with it.
not_available It's replaced roofies.
not_available It's mostly a date
not_available rape drug.
not_available It's sometimes recreational.
not_available I just never thought to look before, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Of course you disagree.
not_available It flies in the face of the culture you've established.
not_available There is no culture.
not_available We' re too busy saving lives.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available By not occluding it at the onset you have allowed it to proliferate.
not_available You have anything monosyllabic to add other than apologies for being late? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, that's two syllables.
not_available So, Mary answer me this.
not_available What are you looking for from us? As nursing director, I feel a full investigation is in order.
not_available Of Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Of the entire physician staff.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available It's true we get no respect, but this is one complaint filed by one nurse against one doctor that she knew.
not_available That she what? Nothing, she just doesn't like him anymore.
not_available I have a petition signed by every nurse in the department.
not_available All of whom are tired, overworked, underpaid and pissed off.
not_available Excluding the males.
not_available And Nurse Lockhart.
not_available Apparently, your relationship with Dr.
not_available Kovac ended better than Chuny's.
not_available Did you really just say that? So it's true.
not_available You' re all suckers for the accent.
not_available Robert.
not_available Bottom line is this'll be handled by the medical exec committee.
not_available So until then how do we untwist everybody's panties? Open your eyes.
not_available I know you' re faking.
not_available Flowers from a doc.
not_available I like this hospital.
not_available They were half price at the gift shop, day
not_available old.
not_available Pull off a few petals, they' re good as new.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Did he go outside? Yeah.
not_available He's taking a walk.
not_available In circles? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He did that a lot when Mom died.
not_available Sometimes it's harder on the people that love us.
not_available He's in denial, thinks there's actually hope.
not_available So do I.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Did Weaver get down here? 
not_available I haven't seen her.
not_available Hey, how'd it go? Luka.
not_available Where'd you go? I was looking for you.
not_available I had a meeting.
not_available She's resting.
not_available Can I talk to you in a second? She's feeling better and John was great with her.
not_available Luka.
not_available Who? 
not_available Your boyfriend, John Carter.
not_available Carter.
not_available Hey, can I borrow your keys? I think we need to crash for a while.
not_available I hoped we could stay at your place.
not_available Yeah, no problem.
not_available We'll grab a hotel if it's a hassle, but I figured we could spend time together.
not_available No, you' re right.
not_available It will be fun.
not_available You sure? There's not a lot of room, but
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Jody's great, and you're great, and you should get to know her.
not_available Okay, Eric.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Great.
not_available So So 
not_available The keys.
not_available The keys.
not_available Right.
not_available They' re in my locker.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Elizabeth, can you handle the rape exam in 4? I believe you did her consult? 
not_available She's an ER case.
not_available Well, at the moment I'm down in ER attending.
not_available Sorry, I tried to get to you first.
not_available What'd she say? Suspended, pending an investigation.
not_available I guess the nurses don't like me.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available But once they got the director involved It's fine.
not_available Right now, I'm not too crazy about them either.
not_available It could be as little as three days.
not_available You could use the free time, right? Thanks for the heads
not_available up.
not_available Pull inferiorly on the speculum heel slowly.
not_available I should've checked sooner.
not_available She was alone on the train.
not_available Open and visualize the cervix.
not_available Not so fast.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You sure this is the case she should be learning on? Patient's unconscious.
not_available You have stricter criteria? 
not_available Father's here.
not_available Should I let him in? 
not_available No.
not_available Could you shut the door, please? Let's swab for a wet mount and a Gram stain.
not_available Is this the cervix? I think it's the cervix.
not_available A small tear at the introitus.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available Semen present.
not_available Check the culture for GC and chlamydia.
not_available You'll need consent for a full kit.
not_available What, are they dating now? I don't think he'll make the best surgeon but he seems to have a way with the patients.
not_available Maybe he could be a nursing liaison.
not_available Need me for something? 
not_available No.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available Where is she? Where's my daughter? Mr.
not_available Paspalis, we' re examining her right now.
not_available Why do they make shower knobs so sharp? 
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available Head lac, no LOC.
not_available Sorry, cat.
not_available I'm off.
not_available Night, Lisa.
not_available So did you get your lottery tickets yet? And live on the dole my whole life? I thought you were off at 5.
not_available Charts.
not_available I can't sleep knowing that they' re sitting here waiting for me.
not_available How come nobody told us being a doctor was about killing trees? You need some help? 
not_available I think I have it down.
not_available How about a beer maybe? No! I don't take trains! I hate trains! Stop it! I wanna get off! Let me go! Haleh, Ativan's not working on Dorothy.
not_available Give her five of Haldol.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available That guy really spooked you today.
not_available Who? You should go home.
not_available We treat crazy people here.
not_available It's nothing new.
not_available Come on, get your things.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We'll split a cab.
not_available Trauma coming in.
not_available Car jumped a curb and ran into a line of people waiting to buy lottery tickets.
not_available And some people don't believe in luck.
not_available We out of Haldol? Top drawer.
not_available Chuny forgot to restock.
not_available It's nothing personal, Abby.
not_available I like Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Really? It's hard to tell.
not_available He'll be back to work tomorrow.
not_available We have to do this to send a message.
not_available Do you know what happened? 
not_available I don't care what happened.
not_available You cared enough to sign a petition.
not_available Another nurse asks for support 
not_available I'll give it every time.
not_available Whether she's right or not? I've been doing this job for 17 years, honey.
not_available Doctors come and go, but nurses make this place run.
not_available We don't get much credit or much pay.
not_available We see a lot of misery, a lot of dying but we come back every day.
not_available I've given up on being appreciated.
not_available But I sure as hell won't let any of us be taken for granted.
not_available I can't even get to the bathroom anymore.
not_available Well, nobody said it was gonna be easy.
not_available But you have a brain that works, a father who loves you.
not_available You hold on to that.
not_available You hold on to that as long as you can.
not_available Anything could happen.
not_available A cure could happen.
not_available We need to move her.
not_available There are traumas coming.
not_available Fine.
not_available Just about to head up to six west anyway, start looking for that liver.
not_available He's cute, but annoying.
not_available Only because I'm right.
not_available Come on, they need to prep this room.
not_available Have you ever been to the ocean? 
not_available Better.
not_available I used to have a lakeside condo.
not_available I dream about it.
not_available I dream I'm down on the bottom, and no matter what, I can't swim up.
not_available I try to breathe, and it's just water, breathing water.
not_available And then when you wake up, it's true.
not_available But you do wake up, you know.
not_available You open your eyes, you breathe.
not_available It's another day.
not_available That's because you' re still alive.
not_available Your body knows it isn't over.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday! What? 
not_available She woke up.
not_available Very good.
not_available Sara, do you know where you are? Daddy? 
not_available You' re all right now, honey.
not_available What happened? Sara, do you know where you are? 
not_available The hospital.
not_available What's the last thing you remember? I
not_available I was on the train with Pat and Andy going to the city.
not_available My head.
not_available Oh, you hit it outside on the stairs.
not_available Do you remember anything else? Anything you did? No.
not_available No.
not_available We were laughing about something.
not_available And then We were laughing.
not_available Sara, we think there may have been a drug in your system.
not_available A sedative.
not_available No, I don't do drugs.
not_available Daddy 
not_available I don't do drugs.
not_available I know, honey.
not_available Upon examination
not_available Doctor, I need to speak to you outside.
not_available Yes, in a minute.
not_available No.
not_available I would like to speak to you now.
not_available Sara, we'll be right back.
not_available Start O
not_available 2 humidified mask.
not_available Don't tell her what happened.
not_available We don't know what happened.
not_available I don't want her to know.
not_available Mr.
not_available Paspalis
not_available I'll check her out.
not_available I'll take responsibility.
not_available Mr.
not_available Paspalis, your daughter was probably raped.
not_available She could be pregnant.
not_available She might have a sexually transmitted disease.
not_available I promise, I'll get her checked out.
not_available She may not remember, but she
not_available Look, someone hurt her body.
not_available It doesn't mean that he has to ruin her life.
not_available Please.
not_available I couldn't protect her then, but if she doesn't know, I can protect her now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available BP 110/70.
not_available Pulse 106.
not_available Complains of headache.
not_available History of hypotension I'm so sorry.
not_available Can you just wait here a minute? Lottery line guy.
not_available Good airway, no LOC, refused treatment at the site.
not_available You thought to bring him anyway? 
not_available I made an executive decision.
not_available I'm next in line.
not_available I just wanna buy a ticket.
not_available The call was for multiples.
not_available Five minors went to Mercy.
not_available Nine centimeter penetrating lac over the right frontal
not_available Bollocks.
not_available What? 
not_available Sir, stay very, very still.
not_available Foreign body goes right through.
not_available More tachy, pulse 120.
not_available Abby, your brother's on the phone.
not_available Lung sounds are clear bilaterally.
not_available Maybe the keys don't work.
not_available We'll need a neurosurgeon.
not_available BP's dropping, 100/70.
not_available Eric? 
not_available Sounds busy.
not_available Should I call back? What's wrong? 
not_available No other deformity.
not_available I was looking for the blender.
not_available When was your last tetanus? 
not_available We 're making milk shakes.
not_available High school, I think.
not_available The blender? 
not_available Milk shake sounds really good.
not_available I think it's in the cabinet 
not_available under the coffeemaker.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gasmer we'll need to take you to the operating room for this.
not_available Jackpot's 87 million.
not_available Your breadmaker's still in the box.
not_available Sats are at 96, pulse 110.
not_available Hey, Eric.
not_available How's Jody doing? 
not_available Hey, John.
not_available She's better.
not_available She was thinking we should go out tonight.
not_available Maybe get my sister to dance.
not_available Yeah, she looks excited.
not_available Get off the phone.
not_available Call for a CTscan.
not_available There's the blender.
not_available Crisis averted.
not_available They' re making milk shakes? Okay, let's pack him up to go.
not_available We need Ativan and an airway box.
not_available Alison would like to speak with you.
not_available Is she moving air? 
not_available Yeah, sats 93, her temp's down to 99.
not_available Send her home with Biaxin and a fresh O
not_available 2 tank.
not_available She's not ready to go.
not_available She wants a consult from the transplant service.
not_available Did I say the last ticket sold is at 6:00? He did it.
not_available He talked her into it.
not_available She needed to regain her strength.
not_available Wants to be considered for transplant.
not_available She signed a DNR.
not_available Well, unsign it, destroy it.
not_available I don't care.
not_available She was upset for a few hours.
not_available Does it disqualify her for the liver? 
not_available No.
not_available No, it shouldn't.
not_available But she's not a great candidate.
not_available Please.
not_available She wants to keep fighting.
not_available I'll be in to see her in a minute.
not_available Would you excuse us? So do we call UNOS now or work her up first? What are you doing? 
not_available She didn't have all the facts.
not_available Do you know what it'll take to keep her alive for transplant if she even qualifies for transplant and they find a match? It's not worth it if there's a shot at a cure? She's dying.
not_available She's suffocating.
not_available That's her reality.
not_available There are a lot of realities.
not_available Stem cell research is a reality.
not_available Stem cells? 
not_available It's coming.
not_available Whether the government approves it or not, it's coming.
not_available You know that.
not_available Embryonic stem cells can be used to grow any tissue in the body.
not_available You told her we could grow new lungs? 
not_available She's got a genetic disease.
not_available Stem cells can fix the defect at the genetic level.
not_available Yeah, maybe in 50 years.
not_available No, in five years.
not_available The science is there if we get past all this political posturing.
not_available Do you know what it took for her to face her mortality? 
not_available I think I do.
not_available For me to convince her dad to accept it? This is about your time? 
not_available No, it's about you.
not_available Going in with your agenda and giving her false hopes.
not_available It's not false.
not_available Oh, no? 
not_available The flowers were an interesting touch.
not_available Well, you gave her 10 minutes.
not_available There is such a thing as dying with dignity.
not_available Every time a woman goes in for in vitro and harvests eggs there are blastocysts
not_available I know the issues.
not_available She's suffering.
not_available She doesn't care about politics.
not_available It's the politics that are killing her.
not_available Ml in 1, cured.
not_available All heart disease gone.
not_available Cancer in 4, cured.
not_available Alzheimer's, cured.
not_available The spinal cord injury this morning, cured.
not_available Parkinson's disease.
not_available Cured.
not_available We' re out of business.
not_available You need to believe that.
not_available Pack up all this crap.
not_available I would love to believe in miracles too but she's dying.
not_available She's dying, Nathan.
not_available And the only question is, how well? She's 26 years old.
not_available There's no dying well.
not_available You' re giving up.
not_available You were happy when he was babysitting your patient.
not_available He's spending more time in the ER than the surgical ward.
not_available If her mind was that easily changed, she wasn't ready to sign.
not_available Not if he's distorting reality for her.
not_available He believes that reality.
not_available It's not gangrene, but he'll need Unasyn.
not_available I'm all for big science, and I hope he's right.
not_available But it won't save this girl.
not_available He offered her hope.
not_available Is that so terrible? 
not_available For her, yeah, it is.
not_available You want him on the ward, I'll keep him there.
not_available No, just supervise him.
not_available Patients are who they are.
not_available I can't change how he sees them.
not_available Well, it is a teaching hospital.
not_available Quiet, they' re announcing the numbers.
not_available Hey, move.
not_available I can't see.
not_available Jackpot is $87 million.
not_available You better watch out.
not_available They' re choosing the next megamillionaire out there.
not_available Thought you already won the lottery.
not_available Oh, I did when I met you.
not_available Is this gonna be warm enough? I don't know.
not_available Who dances outside in November? 
not_available Eskimos.
not_available He doesn't even like to dance.
not_available Well, love makes you do crazy things.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I just wish I could go be someplace quiet with him.
not_available Well, give her a chance.
not_available Maybe she's mature beyond her years.
not_available I know.
not_available It's not her, really.
not_available It's him.
not_available He's acting strange.
not_available Strange how? You know, flighty, spontaneous.
not_available Happy? 
not_available Too happy.
not_available Oh, there's no such thing.
not_available In my family, yes, there is.
not_available He's what, 27? Yeah, but he's smoking, and he's flying around in planes and he has this milk shake obsession.
not_available What? Milk shake obsession? Well
not_available Think your radar might be a little sensitive? No.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's a double date.
not_available I think we can all afford to have some fun.
not_available Only if you don't make me dance.
not_available I can't promise.
not_available You have real commitment issues, you know that? Yo, Greg! Yo, Greg! 
not_available Leon.
not_available I won! I won, man! Look at this! What you doing here? You're supposed to be at Stevie's.
not_available Who are you? You pretty.
not_available Get out! Get out! I'm a winner! What the hell is wrong with you? I checked the number three times! 
not_available I don't care.
not_available Give me some privacy.
not_available I won! 
not_available It's all right.
not_available I should go.
not_available No, he's leaving.
not_available Leon, get out of here.
not_available I'll see you at work, all right? Bye.
not_available No, JingMei, it'sAre you gonna be okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'll be fine.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available Damn it, Leon.
not_available She was hot.
not_available Anybody win anything? This place is cursed.
not_available Abby.
not_available I'm off.
not_available Luka's in for counseling tomorrow.
not_available I wanna get him on the schedule Tuesday.
not_available He agreed to that? Reluctantly.
not_available I threw it on Human Resources.
not_available You should've been more on top of this.
not_available I didn't ask to be nurse manager.
not_available Are you quitting? 
not_available You want me to quit? No.
not_available Did you change to go home and then clock out? Just set a time to meet with him after your shift.
not_available Who? 
not_available Luka.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available He needs to be counseled by the manager.
not_available Maybe I do wanna quit.
not_available It's too late.
not_available Did we get the UA back on the rape exam? 
not_available I called down there twice.
not_available If it's negative, have Harkins dispo her.
not_available You' re sending her home? 
not_available With an observation chart.
not_available I mean, without telling her.
not_available She's a minor.
not_available What about emergency contraception? 
not_available It's the end of her cycle.
not_available So you' re gonna lie to her? 
not_available Her father has the right to sign her out.
not_available She was raped.
not_available Doesn't she have rights? 
not_available Check the labs.
not_available She wants to go.
not_available Sorry, I'm off.
not_available What? ICU admitted Alison.
not_available They' re getting her FFP up there.
not_available Fine.

not_available Thank you.

not_available Go home, get some rest.
not_available You'll need it.
not_available I can't wash my hair? Only for a few days.
not_available Your pediatrician will take your stitches out in a week.
not_available You like being a doctor? Some days are better than others.
not_available It must be weird seeing people naked and stuff.
not_available I suppose it's weird.
not_available Depends on the patient.
not_available I don't care for the hairy ones.
not_available Sara I have to tell you something very difficult.
not_available When we examined you, we found evidence of sexual assault.
not_available Assault? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You were raped.
not_available You told my dad I was raped? He's just trying to protect you.
not_available But you do have the right to know.
not_available The scratches, the bruising There's more bruising inside.
not_available You looked inside? 
not_available We did a rape exam, yes.
not_available Who said you could? I didn't say you could do that.
not_available You were unconscious.
not_available We had to make sure
not_available I didn't say you could do that! I know it's confusing and scary.
not_available If you'd like to speak with someone about it
not_available I wasn't raped, you stupid bitch.
not_available Sara, there were drugs.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Special K.
not_available Makes the sex all kind of swirly.
not_available You took ketamine and had sexual intercourse? It's like having 20 boyfriends, and they all totally love me.
not_available That's incredibly dangerous.
not_available No.
not_available I do it every weekend.
not_available You could suffer from long
not_available term brain damage.
not_available I seize sometimes.
not_available But we usually have Ativan or Xanax.
not_available And all the guys say I'm the best.
not_available Catholic school refugees, both of us.
not_available Abby was completely famous.
not_available She had a Sex Pistols Tshirt 
not_available that she wore over her jumper.
