not_available John.
not_available I wish you'd talk to somebody about your not sleeping.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Hello, David.
not_available How are you? Well, I'm still here, Elizabeth, it couldn't be too bad.
not_available I mean, this isn't right, Mark.
not_available It just isn't right.
not_available I know, dad.
not_available Nothing has gone as expected today.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 6x20 "LOOSE ENDS" Mark.
not_available Mark, I'm cold.
not_available All right, Dad.
not_available I'll get you a blanket.
not_available Did you get any sleep? You look awful.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I need to turn up your oxygen, Dad.
not_available If you have trouble breathing, I will have to put you on a mask.
not_available No mask.
not_available We'll see.
not_available You ought to go back to work.
not_available Maybe later.
not_available I wanna make sure you're comfortable.
not_available In that case, how about a drink? 
not_available What? I'm craving a bloody mary.
not_available Your mother made them for brunch.
not_available That's not a good idea.
not_available You think it'll kill me? With or without Worcestershire? 
not_available Without.
not_available But I'll take a dash of Tabasco.
not_available What's all the racket? 
not_available Sorry, trying to get back into shape.
not_available When did you get this equipment? 
not_available Couple of days ago.
not_available Didn't mean to wake you.
not_available No, I'm up with the birds.
not_available How'd you sleep? 
not_available Like a baby.
not_available Good.
not_available You can get back to your regimen.
not_available Toast and coffee for breakfast? 
not_available I feel like pancakes today.
not_available I think we can manage that.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Everything all right? I only get your answering machine.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's been crazy.
not_available Tess had a bad cold.
not_available The kitchen's being painted.
not_available We're at my mom's.
not_available Well, anyway, happy birthday.
not_available They're beautiful.
not_available I picked them from my garden.
not_available My neighbor's garden, actually.
not_available How'd you know it's my birthday? 
not_available I have my ways.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, we need you.
not_available GSW coming in.
not_available See you later.
not_available Okay.
not_available Looking sharp.
not_available Where you been? 
not_available Checking out Lincoln Park condos.
not_available Trendy.
not_available And expensive.
not_available Too many yuppies.
not_available You're a yuppie.
not_available No way.
not_available Young urban professional.
not_available That's you.
not_available I am not.
not_available Am I a Yuppie? 
not_available No, but you will be when you grow up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene won't be in tonight.
not_available I need someone to cover his shift.
not_available All night? 
not_available You can flip for it.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available You will? As senior Resident, I'm responsible.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You can nap later.
not_available Malucci will cover you.
not_available Your EMS meeting's at 10.
not_available This morning? Where's Carol? 
not_available Over there.
not_available You didn't hear me calling? 
not_available What's up? I need the paramedic compliance data.
not_available I'll get to it.
not_available I put a memo in your box.
not_available You didn't see it? 
not_available I must've forgot.
not_available The meeting's in two hours.
not_available I need that data.
not_available I will.
not_available I will get to it.
not_available You'll do it? 
not_available I will do it.
not_available I made you French toast.
not_available You want the TV on? No.
not_available Lean forward.
not_available You in pain? 
not_available When I take a breath.
not_available Probably pleurisy from the pneumonia.
not_available We'll try Toradol.
not_available This'll make you feel better.
not_available Hungry? 
not_available No.
not_available Why don't you eat? For me.
not_available Just take one bite, please? I'll eat.
not_available What'd you give him? 
not_available Lasix, nitro and morphine.
not_available Excellent.
not_available He's acidemic and retaining CO
not_available 2.
not_available His pulse ox is dropping.
not_available 85.
not_available Set us up for an intubation.
not_available We'll put a tube down your throat.
not_available Anything to help me breathe.
not_available This one's tough.
not_available Have you done a COPDer before? 
not_available I've never tubed.
not_available Time to step up to the plate.
not_available A patient's in respiratory distress? On top of it.
not_available I'm going to teach Abby intubation.
not_available We can try this new Airway Cam.
not_available If you don't mind, slip this around your head.
not_available As she intubates, we can see exactly what she sees on the TV and make adjustments.
not_available Cool.
not_available You ready, Abby? Give your patient 20 of etomidate and start bagging him.
not_available Right.
not_available Everything looks okay.
not_available No bleeding? I can go home.
not_available You vomited blood.
not_available Fainted at work.
not_available The IV needs to stay in a bit longer.
not_available You said I could leave if everything checked out.
not_available Yes, but your potassium level's low.
not_available We need to replenish it.
not_available Where'd you put the lab slip? 
not_available I got it off the computer.
not_available You've wasted enough of my time.
not_available Nurse, get my clothes.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Just dizzy from sitting up too fast.
not_available You're dehydrated.
not_available You can go after this fluid runs in.
not_available All right.
not_available But that's it.
not_available Then I'm out of here.
not_available Can you make sure her discharge papers are in order? Sure.
not_available Her gag's absent, her tooth enamel's eroded, she's severely malnourished.
not_available She's anorectic and bulimic.
not_available And I don't want her leaving.
not_available What can we do? 
not_available We'll have Psych put a hold on her.
not_available What is it? Hammer vs.
not_available scalp.
not_available We're going to CT.
not_available Seen Carol? 
not_available Not since this morning.
not_available I need data from her.
not_available Page her? 
not_available Twice.
not_available It's her birthday.
not_available Maybe she went out for breakfast.
not_available I certainly hope not.
not_available All right.
not_available Go for it.
not_available Enter on the right and sweep the tongue to the left.
not_available Slide it all the way down.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Advance slowly until you see the epiglottis.
not_available See it.
not_available So can we.
not_available A little more.
not_available Lift it with your tip.
not_available This is pretty cool.
not_available No, lift toward the handle.
not_available You could have fun with this.
not_available See the vocal cords.
not_available Pass the tube.
not_available Good.
not_available Wasn't hard.
not_available Easy with a good teacher.
not_available You're right.
not_available You're wheezing again.
not_available Want another breathing treatment? Having any chest pain? No.
not_available That last stuff worked pretty good.
not_available Just mixing up your antibiotics.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available What? Broke.
not_available Now what? 
not_available Cut my hand.
not_available You're bleeding on the floor.
not_available I know.
not_available You should keep pressure on that.
not_available I know.
not_available Keep your hand above your heart to stop the bleeding.
not_available You need stitches.
not_available I won't leave you here alone.
not_available You're the doctor.
not_available Your leg's circulation is poor.
not_available An arteriogram will check your blood flow.
not_available When he came, the doc couldn't feel a pulse in his foot.
not_available When was that? 
not_available About a month ago, right? The doc took the dead skin off his toe, gave him some ointment.
not_available My shoe fit poorly.
not_available Rubbed my toe raw.
not_available The toe's gangrenous.
not_available Your leg has an ulceration.
not_available We must operate.
not_available How bad is it? We have to amputate below the knee.
not_available Amputate? 
not_available How could this happen? That first doctor gave my dad some pills.
not_available How could it be so serious? 
not_available Remember the doctor? Some foreign guy.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I'm off to Mark's.
not_available Is it his dad? No.
not_available Mark cut his hand.
not_available He needs sutures.
not_available Make sure Psych sees Claire.
not_available She won't leave.
not_available She's on a slow drip.
not_available She's got hours left on that bag.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm still massaging the data.
not_available I'll have to make the presentation in June.
not_available Where were you? 
not_available Daycare.
not_available Tess is cranky.
not_available I postponed my meeting.
not_available I didn't have your report.
not_available I didn't finish it.
not_available You need to stay on top of the stats.
not_available I'm just incredibly busy.
not_available Give it to another nurse.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Your babies take a lot of time.
not_available If you need to cut back
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Things can't fall through the cracks.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Good.
not_available What? 
not_available Delivery guy dropped this off.
not_available God! It's from Doug.
not_available Let's see.
not_available What'd he give you? 
not_available Animal crackers.
not_available A weird birthday present.
not_available It's a thing we used to do.
not_available When he'd go to the store, he came back with animal crackers.
not_available I'd put one in his Christmas stocking.
not_available Kind of a tradition? 
not_available I'll do the foreign body in the eye.
not_available Carter got it.
not_available I'll take the hip dislocation.
not_available Carter got it.
not_available Tell him, if he wants to see all the patients, I can go home.
not_available He left you Mr.
not_available Barclay.
not_available Wound check.
not_available Swell.
not_available Mr.
not_available Barclay? 
not_available Finally.
not_available I've waited here for three hours.
not_available Your CHF guy dropped his sats.
not_available You must go back to Chairs.
not_available What's taking so long? 
not_available My patient's not breathing.
not_available Would you take him? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I burnt my arm cleaning out a furnace.
not_available Remove the gauze and
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Kenny's been seizing for 20 minutes.
not_available Please help him.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll take good care of him.
not_available Prep the Pedes ER.
not_available Hey, I was here first! 
not_available Ativan's on board.
not_available Draw a CBC, lytes and cath a urine.
not_available Pulse ox is dropping, 92.
not_available Has he had seizures before? 
not_available No.
not_available He's always been perfectly healthy.
not_available Could he have ingested poison? 
not_available We keep everything locked up.
not_available He had a sore throat last night.
not_available Fever this morning? Just a little.
not_available I tried to get him to eat, he wanted to sleep.
not_available Next thing I knew, he was shaking.
not_available Push 600 of phenobarb.
not_available We must stop it.
not_available You want to intubate? 
not_available If his sats keep dropping.
not_available Blood glucose is really low.
not_available Under 40.
not_available Seizures can lower blood sugar.
not_available Push 50 cc's of D
not_available 25 and get Weaver now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you remember Chet Fulton? African
not_available American, early 60s.
not_available Last month.
not_available Had vascular insufficiency and an ulcerated toe.
not_available Do you have his chart? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's back with gangrene.
not_available I remember him.
not_available I débrided the wound and gave him Trental.
not_available Sorry he's back.
not_available Well, now I have to do a belowthe
not_available knee amputation.
not_available It may have been avoided if he went to Vascular clinic.
not_available The chart shows I made the referral.
not_available Highrisk patients with no insurance need follow
not_available up.
not_available And I made an appointment with Vascular.
not_available I can't see to his care outside the ER.
not_available But did you put him on the callback list or phone him? Do you call back everyone you see? The high
not_available risk ones I do.
not_available Really? Older AfricanAmerican men are at high
not_available risk for amputation.
not_available You should know that.
not_available I do.
not_available Then why didn't you call him? 
not_available What are you saying? There's more to the emergency medicine than treating and streeting patients.
not_available That's one more thing you don't have to teach me.
not_available How long's he been seizing? 
not_available Thirty minutes.
not_available Dilantin, 300 mg.
not_available His blood sugar? 
not_available Still under 40.
not_available Push another 50 of D
not_available 25.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Why's the glucose so low? Could be an insulinoma or a metabolic disorder.
not_available Give me an ammonia, an insulin level and a uric acid.
not_available Seizure stopped.
not_available Start a dextrose drip.
not_available Check blood sugar every 20 minutes.
not_available He can't tolerate another seizure.
not_available Why isn't he awake? It's normal for him to sleep after something like this.
not_available He will wake up, right? 
not_available Why not stay with him? He might be scared waking in a strange place.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Get a head CT and an EEG.
not_available What do you think? I don't know.
not_available D
not_available 25 should've corrected the hypoglycemia.
not_available Check the labs and start hunting for zebras.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is this your patient? 
not_available No, he's Carol's.
not_available Can you change the IV bag? 
not_available I got a guy puking in Exam Two.
not_available Carol.
not_available Your patient needs a new IV.
not_available Right.
not_available The IV ran dry.
not_available That's not like you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available You have a problem with me? Say it.
not_available Don't get defensive.
not_available I'm just asking what's going on.
not_available I'm caring for 10 patients, my babies are in daycare.
not_available And you're constantly on my back.
not_available Stay on top of things and I won't bother you.
not_available Fortyfiveyear
not_available old guy tried to beat the El train.
not_available Knocked down, but not run over.
not_available BP's 80 over 40.
not_available Intubated in the field.
not_available When is somebody gonna look at my arm? I came here on the busWould you sit down? And three 
not_available Got some rib fractures.
not_available BP's 75 palp.
not_available Prep for a central line.
not_available This guy's gonna need some fluid.
not_available Absent breath sounds on the left.
not_available This dude's got a pneumo.
not_available Chest
not_available tube tray.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Why can't I get a wound check? This guy's trying to die.
not_available Get out of here! I'll pop this in and his pressure will shoot back up.
not_available Don't assume that.
not_available He may be losing blood.
not_available Malik, stand by to resuscitate.
not_available Did I ever tell you the story? 
not_available I'd love to, but sick people await.
not_available Cliff
not_available diver hit the rocks.
not_available I'm in.
not_available You done? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Pressure still 75.
not_available So much for your chest tube.
not_available May be blood in the belly.
not_available Get an ultrasound.
not_available He stole my rig! Who? Your wound
not_available check patient.
not_available That sucks.
not_available You're good at this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The way you did it, you hardly need to close the skin.
not_available That's the point.
not_available Is he giving you a hard time over there? No, he's being a very good patient.
not_available We'll remove those in five days.
not_available Shouldn't leave a scar.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Keep it dry for two days.
not_available Put a plastic bag on it when you shower.
not_available I know.
not_available I know you know.
not_available His breathing's difficult.
not_available Should I treat him? I can't breathe.
not_available But I can still hear every word you say.
not_available Can I make you lunch? 
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available But stay.
not_available Have some tea.
not_available I'd like that.
not_available Heard your patient's unstable.
not_available Blunt chest trauma.
not_available Hypotensive despite a chest tube.
not_available Probably cracked his spleen.
not_available His neck veins are elevated.
not_available May be fluid around the heart.
not_available Could be the belly.
not_available Check for a cardiac tamponade.
not_available I'd check the belly.
not_available Carter's right.
not_available He's got an effusion around the heart.
not_available Go for it.
not_available Get me a spinal needle.
not_available Now you can check the belly.
not_available Watch for injury current.
not_available Looks pretty clean.
not_available You hit the heart.
not_available Pull back.
not_available I've got good return.
not_available Pulse is stronger.
not_available Need another syringe? 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Call for an ICU bed.
not_available Good job, Carter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I did a Medline search on the boy with seizures.
not_available His symptoms are consistent with M
not_available CAD, a rare metabolic disorder.
not_available Get a Genetics consult.
not_available Talk to the parents.
not_available Good pickup.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Look.
not_available I'm sorry I came down so hard on you 
not_available but I depend on you.
not_available I need to be more on top of things.
not_available You're our best nurse, but something's going on with you.
not_available Can I do anything to help? Not really.
not_available I just need time to figure a few things out.
not_available I've worked with you for five years.
not_available I know you.
not_available I hate my life.
not_available I mean, I love my work.
not_available And I love my daughters, but How did I end up raising twins by myself? It's just I think you need some time.
not_available You have some sick days.
not_available I've used them all up.
not_available Check.
not_available You have some extras.
not_available Use them whenever you like.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You said Kenny would wake up.
not_available His genetic disorder prevents his burning fat for energy.
not_available When he got sick, his blood sugar dropped, causing his seizure.
not_available Will he have brain damage? 
not_available We'll look at the EEG.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available He was born here.
not_available They didn't tell us he had this.
not_available Chicago hospitals don't test for rare metabolic disorders.
not_available Do other hospitals? 
not_available In some states.
not_available If we'd known, could we have done anything? Dr.
not_available Chen, please.
not_available Tell us.
not_available If he had sugar water when he got sick you could have prevented the seizure.
not_available Sugar water? Oh, my God! 
not_available Our patient's in the O.R.
not_available Did you cause myocardial damage? Not to worry.
not_available Easy as threading a needle.
not_available Hello? I'm in the ambulance, bringing in sick people.
not_available What unit is this? 
not_available How should I know? I was flagged down on my way to Mercy.
not_available Who is this? 
not_available Joe Barclay.
not_available It's your woundcheck guy! 
not_available What are you doing? Heading back.
not_available I got people here puking their guts out.
not_available Is that the thief? Are the patients stable? 
not_available I don't know, man.
not_available They're puking.
not_available Not on the floor.
not_available I just cleaned it! I'm gonna let you take this one.
not_available You've already established a relationship.
not_available Call me if there's any change.
not_available I will.
not_available David, I'm leaving.
not_available I have to get back to the hospital.
not_available A doctor's work is never done.
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available Wait.
not_available I have something I want to give you.
not_available Mark, get that little green box from the top dresser drawer.
not_available It's not necessary.
not_available I know.
not_available These belonged to Mark's mother.
not_available I gave them to her on her wedding day.
not_available I want you to have them.
not_available I can't.
not_available Please.
not_available They're lovely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't just stand there.
not_available Help her put them on.
not_available She looks beautiful, doesn't she, Mark? Yeah.
not_available She does.
not_available Hello, Jing.
not_available No, it's Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available What's the matter? Somebody die? We should screen babies for rare metabolic disorders.
not_available What? 
not_available I cared for a little boy today.
not_available He seized because we didn't give him a $25 test when he was born.
not_available Well, if we tested for every genetic disorder we'd spend millions to identify a tiny handful of kids.
not_available But if I'd known what he had, I'd have treated him differently.
not_available I might have stopped the seizure more quickly.
not_available It's all an allocation of precious resources.
not_available We have to draw a line.
not_available We should offer the tests.
not_available We can't afford it.
not_available Tell that to my patient's family.
not_available They're waiting to see if their son comes out of a coma.
not_available They wouldn't stop puking.
not_available Strong radial pulse.
not_available This guy is stable.
not_available Soft on this one.
not_available We got a father/daughter MVA.
not_available Can you give me a hand? Start a liter of saline and titrate five to 10 of Compazine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Can I get my wound checked? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Rear
not_available ended while at a red light.
not_available Sixyear
not_available old girl complains of neck pain.
not_available I want to stay with my daddy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dave will take care of you.
not_available I'll take the dad.
not_available Knee versus dashboard, facial lac.
not_available Wife informed? 
not_available Divorced.
not_available She's in Pittsburgh.
not_available Daughter's visiting.
not_available Dislocated knee.
not_available Pain's horrible.
not_available Had six of MS.
not_available Ten of morphine.
not_available Ever reduced a patella? You will now.
not_available Did you see my patient? 
not_available I'm finishing the note.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't thank me.
not_available I'm removing the Psych hold.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available She's starving herself to death.
not_available She might be.
not_available But I can't make her stay against her will.
not_available She's got a job, she's not an immediate threat to herself or anybody.
not_available She could go into kidney failure.
not_available What's it take to get her treatment? Her consent.
not_available Many people do bad things to themselves.
not_available They smoke, they drink, eat fatty foods, but we don't lock them up.
not_available So we do nothing? 
not_available It's her right to decide herself.
not_available Even if they're bad ones.
not_available There must be something I can do.
not_available If you convince her to stay, I'll admit her.
not_available Otherwise, you'll have to discharge her.
not_available Is the water too warm? No, no.
not_available Where's Elizabeth? 
not_available She left a couple of hours ago.
not_available Do you have to go to work? No, Dad.
not_available I'm gonna stay right here.
not_available Okay? Here.
not_available Lie back.
not_available Having any pain? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available You all right? Yeah.
not_available You look tired.
not_available What is that soap? 
not_available Plain old Ivory.
not_available That's what your mother used.
not_available I remember.
not_available Every night when she tucked me in she'd kiss me and I could smell the soap on her face.
not_available This used to be my job.
not_available What's that? Giving you a bath when you were a baby.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available You're a good doctor.
not_available The day you became a doctor was the proudest day of my life.
not_available It's okay, Dad.
not_available You don't have to talk.
not_available I love you, Mark.
not_available I love you too, Dad.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available When can I get up? After I see your x
not_available ray.
not_available Get a CBC, dip a urine 
not_available check a bedside crit.
not_available HemoCue's next door.
not_available That's two of Versed.
not_available He's pretty relaxed.
not_available I'll keep the hip flexed.
not_available Keeping the knee extended, apply gentle pressure medially.
not_available Like this? Perfect.
not_available How you guys doing? She's stable.
not_available Clearing the neck.
not_available What is it? Sixyear
not_available old, minor MVA.
not_available Probably just whiplash.
not_available I took a lateral C
not_available spine.
not_available Careful.
not_available Don't! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available We have to examine you.
not_available We'll cover you with a sheet.
not_available What is it? She has bruised thighs and bloody underpants.
not_available Could be a urethral injury from a pelvic fracture? We need a plain film and a cystourethrogram.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Does this hurt, sweetheart? 
not_available No.
