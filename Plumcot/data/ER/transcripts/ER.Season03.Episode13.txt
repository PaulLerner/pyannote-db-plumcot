
not_available Previously on ER Either he lost his balance and fell onto the tracks, or he jumped.
not_available All he ever got from you was harping and criticism.
not_available Now he's dead, and you have to face it.
not_available I was a bit tough on your son.
not_available No one admitted to an organized sickout? Nope.
not_available You're spoiling me.
not_available I'm HIV
not_available positive.
not_available I gave typeA blood to a type
not_available O patient.
not_available I killed him.
not_available Hey, Doug! Doug! Wait up a minute.
not_available I gotta ask you something.
not_available Good morning to you.
not_available How many people know about me and Chuny? Including the cleaning crew? Everyone? 
not_available That would be an understatement.
not_available It's just 
not_available We've run out of things to say.
not_available You want out.
not_available I think it would be best.
not_available You covered the spread.
not_available The office pool.
not_available I had you for next week.
not_available But what's $5 for your happiness? You've had experience at this.
not_available How do I end it? You know those Chinese finger puzzles? The harder you pull on them, the tighter they get? You gotta just relax, then they just droop and fall off.
not_available That sounds ominous.
not_available Here's what you do.
not_available Explain to her that you're doing this for her benefit.
not_available It's been fun but it's interfering with work.
not_available You don't want to ruin the friendship.
not_available Because that's what you care about.
not_available You know what? You're frightening.
not_available Good morning.
not_available You're late.
not_available I was checking the schedule.
not_available This is it for us today? A hernia? Is that what it says? Problem, Carter? It's just that our schedule's been pretty lightweight lately.
not_available Hernias and Hickman lines.
not_available You could do these in your sleep.
not_available No Hibiclens? 
not_available No, we're out.
not_available This gives us more time to prepare for the conference.
not_available You ready? Three o'clock sharp, right? I'm doing the first half.
not_available You're doing the second.
not_available We'll brush up over lunch.
not_available Carter, if I need your help, I'll ask for it, okay? Happiness is a full nursing staff.
not_available I hope everyone is feeling healthy.
not_available Peachy! I'd hate to see us get hit by the one
not_available day flu again.
not_available It's run its course.
not_available I hope so.
not_available I can't afford to get fired.
not_available That was just management rattling its tired old saber.
not_available What if they replace us? 
not_available They won't.
not_available After our sickout, they got religion.
not_available Negotiations are going great.
not_available Are we gonna get what we want? Commissioners are nervous.
not_available They know the public's on our side.
not_available They won't be after they read this.
not_available Right there.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available What? "Patient dies after nurses walk.
not_available An unidentified nurse at County General Hospital allegedly transfused a patient with the wrong type blood leading to his death in the hospital's emergency room." Somebody died? They get that for hiring temps.
not_available "Hospital sources say the error was the result of understaffing caused by an illegal one
not_available day sickout by ER nurses." Where's Carol? She's on at 9.
not_available Did this guy die because of us? First name, Gil.
not_available Last name, unknown.
not_available Section Y
not_available 37.
not_available No headstones? 
not_available They just get a number.
not_available Of course, between the wind and the snow There's nothing.
not_available Friend of yours? He might be one of these in here.
not_available I think we buried them last.
not_available Ah, Mark.
not_available I was reminding Kerry that today 
not_available Is Prospective Intern Day.
not_available How could I forget? There are six 4th
not_available year students interviewing upstairs.
not_available They're being hotly recruited by other programs.
not_available I expect you to show them what a real ER is all about.
not_available We'll do our best.
not_available I'm sure you will.
not_available Can we talk to you? 
not_available What's up? This.
not_available We won't take the fall for this.
not_available Negotiations are going our way.
not_available A temp made a mistake.
not_available It's not our fault.
not_available What temp? 
not_available The one who gave the wrong blood.
not_available It wasn't a temp.
not_available It was me.

not_available Tubas.
not_available We were in the marching band.
not_available You're also suffering from insomnia and dizziness.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available He just hasn't been himself.
not_available How so? Last night in his sleep, he bit me.
not_available And when he woke up, he didn't know where he was.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available How's that kid who got shot? 
not_available Well, he made it to surgery.
not_available Thank you.
not_available My mother was disappointed you couldn't make it last night.
not_available Work, you know.
not_available My brothers are doubting your intentions.
not_available All five of them? You first.
not_available I'm not sorry we did this.
not_available It's been fun.
not_available But it's starting to interfere with my work.
not_available I want to preserve our friendship.
not_available I know that's important for you too.
not_available No hard feelings, right? Of course not.
not_available What did you want to say? Nothing.
not_available You hung me out to dry.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available Then who did? Let me get you a cup of coffee.
not_available I don't want a cup of coffee.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available Who then? Drummond? Somebody who wanted to influence negotiations.
not_available And somebody who had access to your report.
not_available Carol, we've got a threatened work stoppage here.
not_available Emotions are high, the budget's shrinking and your nursing staff refuses to acknowledge the realities of 90s medicine! 
not_available This isn't about the sickout! I gave him the wrong blood.
not_available Which wouldn't have happened if your friends had shown up for work.
not_available This isn't labor politics, Mary! A man died.
not_available I'm sorry, Carol.
not_available I killed a man! And nobody around here seems to give a damn! Tie.
not_available Peter? Tie.
not_available I think you're wise to slow it down after Pediatrics.
not_available Nothing like a simple hernia to put you in touch with the basics.
not_available Hand, blade, clamp, suture.
not_available Peanut, please.
not_available Carter, what's the difference between a prostate and a garden hose? 
not_available I don't know.

not_available Met his maker with his pants down.
not_available Metz.
not_available Sometimes you have to step back to reassess.
not_available It's a lot easier to take stock from a nice, puffy blimp than an F
not_available 16.
not_available Right? That's the first mature breakup of my life.
not_available Congratulations! 
not_available No histrionics, no yelling.
not_available We saw the situation and addressed it.
not_available How'd she take it? She's hurting, but she'll get over it in time.
not_available What time you got? I'd like you to meet Jay Musoff, Whit Haskell Monica Campbell, Alex Ghandar Matt Collins and Leslie Wu.
not_available I've prepared an introductory packet to our Emergency Medicine Program.
not_available Refer to it throughout the day.
not_available The ER may appear chaotic but if you watch closely you'll see an organized system at work.
not_available I'll take Jay, Whit and Monica.
not_available Fine.
not_available We'll start with the Admissions Desk and go from there.
not_available If you wanna follow at a 10
not_available minute stagger, feel free.
not_available The heart of any emergency room is the Admit Desk.
not_available Information is the blood that courses through it.
not_available And the desk clerk is like a tricuspid valve, if you will.
not_available So you guys want to play doctor? Let's go.
not_available I chase number one, lose him down an alley.
not_available I come back just in time to catch number two bleeding my partner here with a cheap.22.
not_available He doesn't even have his gun out.
not_available So I cap the punk.
not_available Twice.
not_available You're lucky your partner came back when he did.
not_available Two rounds, two hits.
not_available I couldn't believe it! You should've seen his face.
not_available He was so surprised.
not_available What did he think I was gonna do? Give him a hug? Then when he saw the blood 
not_available You have to go now.
not_available He needs rest.
not_available I'll wait outside, sarge.
not_available You go on home.
not_available I'll wait outside.
not_available Home.
not_available Bring me a chocolate frosted in the morning.
not_available He can do that, right? 
not_available Lf he gets a dozen for us.
not_available All right.
not_available Take care of him.
not_available Talkative.
not_available Ten months out of the academy, he thinks he's Dirty Harry.
not_available Why didn't you shoot back? twice outside the practice range.
not_available A cop who won't use his gun.
not_available That's a first.
not_available Your arm okay? It's just a little sore.
not_available Carol, can I speak to you a minute? Be right back.
not_available We got a situation here.
not_available I spoke to Mary Cain.
not_available She doesn't know who leaked it.
not_available You believed her? 
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available We had an agreement on the table to protect current staffing levels.
not_available Management just pulled it.
not_available They're gonna use this to renege on the whole contract.
not_available Sorry to hear that.
not_available You had no idea they'd use this incident against us? No, I didn't.
not_available What? You think I'm lying to you? I don't know anymore, Carol.
not_available You and management can fight and tear each other's hair out.
not_available I've got a patient.
not_available Most interns send samples to the lab without knowing what happens once they're there.
not_available Let's pretend that we're a urine sample and find out.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Scalded foot in Curtain 2.
not_available That looks promising.
not_available This way.
not_available I've got a 25year
not_available old male, headaches, insomnia He's pretty young for a stroke.

not_available Shoom! Right down my boot.
not_available I'd amputate, but I'm afraid you'd put it on the menu.
not_available Alex, first step? 
not_available Assess the burn.
not_available Leslie, what do you think? Partial thickness, and there's a small blister below the medial malleolus.
not_available Good.
not_available Matt, what's next? Then d Ábride any broken blisters.

not_available You know what he is now? A locksmith.
not_available They used to have these dances here called Blue and Whites.
not_available You know, cops and nurses.
not_available A lot of marriages came out of that.
not_available Yours too? 
not_available No.
not_available For me, it was always the job.
not_available You were probably just a lousy dancer.
not_available If I didn't have this hole in my leg, I'd show you a turn or two.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll take a rain check.
not_available Do you know why so many nurses end up with cops? Similar schedule? A shared appreciation for life's vicissitudes.
not_available That's beautiful.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I stole it myself.
not_available Too much coffee.
not_available Has that happened before today? Give me a break.
not_available I'm 58.
not_available I can't have the shakes after I get shot? I thought only the scheduling nurse was allowed to change the board.
not_available I like to erase my surgery when I'm done.
not_available It gives me a sense of accomplishment.
not_available What are you up to? 
not_available Presenting a conference with Benton.
not_available There's a name I haven't seen in a while.
not_available It's been a little slow lately.
not_available There's a splenectomy open at 5:00 with Crosby.
not_available Why don't you sign him up for it? He usually signs up for surgery.
not_available Just because he's in neutral doesn't mean you have to be.
not_available I'm doing a portacaval shunt later.
not_available Care to join me? I'd love to.
not_available But I don't know what Benton has planned.
not_available Judging by this, not much.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available I'm Lisa Sayler.
not_available This is my son, Benny.
not_available You work for the hospital? 
not_available Upstairs in ICU.
not_available I usually bring him to the clinic, but I didn't want to wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available What happened? I'm not sure.
not_available He was out in the back yard, and he hurt his elbow.
not_available Can you straighten out your arm like that for me? You have to use his special name.
not_available Which is? 
not_available It's Clark Kent.
not_available Hi, Clark.
not_available Hello.
not_available Let me straighten your arm out.
not_available Does that hurt? All right.
not_available We'll have to get some x
not_available rays.
not_available Anybody here have x
not_available ray vision? Okay, we'll get Radiology to take a look at it.
not_available No idea how this happened? 
not_available I wasn't there.
not_available But I think he was trying to fly.
not_available Ghandar, Jeopardy time.
not_available Tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox indicates this common fracture.
not_available What is first
not_available metacarpal? Navicular.
not_available I should try that on my students.
not_available I teach third grade.
not_available That's nice.
not_available Heather, you have a medial, collateral ligament tear otherwise known as "gamekeeper's thumb." Playing goalie is hell on a manicure.
not_available Hockey? 
not_available Water polo.
not_available Coed.
not_available Sounds rough.
not_available Last year, took a shot to the face.
not_available Fractured my left orbit.
not_available It's a singles league.
not_available Swim and mingle.
not_available The guys I've met are tough outside, but emotionally they're wimps.
not_available I guess my type is more the reverse.
not_available Need some help? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I want to talk to you about that cop.
not_available Isn't he great? 
not_available My dad says he's a real legend.
not_available His right hand has a twitch.
not_available No head trauma, no focal deficits, right? It's probably nerves.
not_available Well, I'd like a head CT to be sure.
not_available The way his hand moves bothers me.
not_available I can't order a $ 1000 test without indications.
not_available I think it's recurring.
not_available He's hiding it.
not_available I'll do a neuro exam.
not_available If something shows up, we'll scan him.
not_available Accommodation without direct response to light.
not_available I'll dial Robertson.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Patterson 
not_available Cindy.
not_available When did you notice the change in Mike's behavior? A month ago, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a.m.
not_available Talking to himself.
not_available It's possible you have a low
not_available grade infection in your nervous system.
not_available I'd like to do a spinal tap.
not_available That sounds painful.
not_available We'll give you local anesthetic.
not_available Takes about 5 minutes.
not_available Can you get an L.P.
not_available Tray, please? 
not_available I've been meaning to call.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I didn't expect you to.
not_available Which leaves us plenty of time for a splenectomy at 5.
not_available We'll be in and out by 6:30.
not_available You signed me up without permission? 
not_available Crosby needs someone to assist.
not_available He does great work and respects yours.
not_available Take it off.
not_available My name.
not_available Take it off the board.
not_available It's too late.
not_available Someone's going to have to cancel.
not_available The only sign of a fracture is the fat
not_available pad.
not_available Very slight.
not_available Will he need a cast? 
not_available The splint will be fine.
not_available He should heal in three or four weeks.
not_available Can I talk to you outside? We're gonna be right back.
not_available Okay? You just hang here.
not_available Has he always been this uncommunicative? My husband died five months ago in a car accident.
not_available He was taking Benny to get an ice
not_available cream cone.
not_available Was Benny hurt? But it took about 10 minutes for the ambulance to get there.
not_available Benny watched his father die.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available When he started to pretend he was Superman, I thought it was healthy.
not_available A way of coping.
not_available I got him that costume for Halloween.
not_available Now he wears it every day.
not_available Do you know Lyle Baker? He's a child psychiatrist.
not_available One of the best.
not_available Why don't I have him come down for a consult? Benny, come out, please.
not_available How long will it take to heal? 
not_available About six weeks.
not_available There go the playoffs.
not_available I don't know what I'll do with myself.
not_available Would you like to go out sometime? That brings up an interesting issue.
not_available Are doctors supposed to date patients? Definitely not.
not_available For my protection, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available What if you weren't my doctor? That's hypothetical.
not_available When do you get off? Six o'clock.
not_available So hypothetically if I were at Finch's Bar on Dearborn tonight at 6:30 and you just happened to come in and have a drink that would be legal, right? Hypothetically.
not_available If I weren't your doctor.
not_available You know, this thumb is starting to hurt again.
not_available I think I'd like to see a specialist.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Ever seen an abscess this big? 
not_available Never.
not_available It's extraordinary.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cliffe, how did this happen? I'm building a cabin up north.
not_available No plumbing yet.
not_available Just an outhouse.
not_available I sat down on the seat without noticing the ice.
not_available When I stood up That would account for the wide extension.
not_available We need to drain.
not_available Eleven
not_available blade.
not_available Not to worry, Mr.
not_available Cliffe.
not_available Relief is on the way.
not_available My two favorite ladies! Still trying to charm us.
not_available They said man would never fly.
not_available Now they have Air Jordan on a mission to Mars.
not_available Nurse Hathaway told me about the problem you're having with your hand.
not_available She did, did she? I'm sure it's not serious, but I'd like to do a neurological exam.
not_available I want you to squeeze my fingers when I say so.
not_available I got shot in the leg.
not_available The rest of me is fine.
not_available We just want to make sure.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available It'll only take a minute.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available It's for your own good.
not_available I said I don't want it.
not_available The man doesn't want it.
not_available Carla? What are you doing here? Waiting.
not_available What's wrong? You sick? What's wrong? We should probably talk later, Peter.
not_available Carla Reece? 
not_available That's me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn will see you now.
not_available Coburn? OB? I'll call you later.
not_available I promise.
not_available What's up? You pregnant? Later, all right? When Kerry asked me to talk to you, I 
thought "What's a grizzled old muckety
not_available muck have to say to the next generation of sawbones?" Then I realized, nope, everyone has a tale to tell.
not_available And mine begins in a cold, little farmhouse in Kubane, North Dakota.
not_available Pa Morgenstern worked at the local tannery.
not_available Ma was a taxidermist 
not_available How are they holding up? Stick a fork in them.
not_available They've been "Weavered."

not_available Thanks, Malik.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available What is that smell? Bratwurst, on the house.
not_available Compliments of Sasha, the cafeteria guy.
not_available Remind me not to cure him again.
not_available What do you think? About dating a patient, Exxon Valdez ring a bell? I'm still holding.
not_available You should talk.
not_available This is new territory.
not_available It takes time to learn the signs.
not_available I know the difference between dependence and mutual attraction.
not_available So what are you gonna do about it? 
not_available Doyle.
not_available Gamekeeper's thumb in 4.
not_available Check the splint.
not_available If it's set, discharge her.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Lisa? Yeah.
not_available Not yet.
not_available He didn't get past Security, so he's still in the building.
not_available Stay put.
not_available He knows where you work.
not_available He'll probably head your way.
not_available Great.
not_available Bye.
not_available When I held that dying mole rat in my hand when I felt its little heart pitterpattering in my hands Do you see it? 
not_available It's glowing.
not_available Looks like syphilis.
not_available Neurosyphilis.
not_available I'm surprised.
not_available Imagine how surprised she'll be.
not_available How are we gonna tell them? We don't tell them.
not_available We tell him.
not_available And not her? It's his disease.
not_available We can't violate his right to privacy.
not_available And she has no rights except the right to be infected? Why don't I talk to him? 
not_available I asked you down on a consult.
not_available This is a tricky situation.
not_available I have more experience in these matters.
not_available It's my field.
not_available I've dealt with these situations hundreds of times.
not_available This kind of thing can kill a marriage.
not_available So can silence.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Are you aware of the time? I was waiting for Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available The entire surgical staff is already here.
not_available Anytime now, doctor.
not_available When were you gonna tell me? When I knew I had something to tell.
not_available My sisters had miscarriages in their first trimesters.
not_available What did Coburn say? She said that it was just some spotting nothing to worry about.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available We were careful.
not_available It's like they say, nothing is 100% effective.
not_available And you're sure it's mine? I'm gonna forget you said that.
not_available I'm gonna lay it on the stress and surprise.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, honey What am I supposed to say? We're two very different people, Peter.
not_available And Lord knows we both have enough going on in our lives.
not_available I've made the choice, Peter to have this baby.
not_available All right.
not_available What do you expect from me, Carla? The truth.
not_available You've always been honest with me.
not_available It's one of your finer qualities.
not_available I've gotta get back to work.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available All right? Sure.
not_available You can adjust these if they're too short.
not_available They'll probably discharge you today.
not_available You could use the practice.
not_available Stop being so nice.
not_available It makes me feel even more foolish for speaking the way I did.
not_available You know, when I was in the alley with the kid Hernandez I've had guns pulled on me a dozen times.
not_available This wasn't a hard guy.
not_available This was a kid caught in the deep end.
not_available we both walk out of there.
not_available What happened? My hand jerked.
not_available He thought I was going for my gun.
not_available In a second, he had to decide whether he wanted to live or die.
not_available Does anyone else know about your hand? You mean the department? They'd put me in the mailroom.
not_available Then who deals with the next kid who panics and pulls a piece? Some hotshot like Pino.
not_available You need to get it checked out.
not_available What is it? Is it Parkinson's? Is it a brain tumor? I don't know.
not_available But those are treatable disorders.
not_available You could have years to teach the Pinos to be better cops.
not_available Or I could be here lying flat on my back stuck full of tubes.
not_available Let me do a CAT scan, find out what's going on.
not_available I'll tell you what, angel.
not_available I'll think about it, okay? Good.
not_available The aortogram confirms the unilateral renal
not_available artery stenosis.
not_available And treatment was via an aortorenal
not_available bypass graft using a segment of the saphenous vein.
not_available Now, discussing the causes and evaluation of surgical hypertension will be my colleague Dr.
not_available Peter Benton.
not_available Except that he was detained, which is why he asked me to stand in for him.
not_available The surgically correctable causes of hypertension include coarctation of the aorta, Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma.
not_available What about Conn's syndrome? 
not_available And Conn's syndrome, of course.
not_available And hyperaldosteronism? 
not_available That too.
not_available Wasn't a trial of drug therapy warranted before surgical intervention was undertaken? 
not_available Surgery carries a 1 % mortality rate.
not_available I see your point What were the results of the renal
not_available vein renin assays? They were high.
not_available Very high.
not_available Of course.
not_available But what was the ratio of affected to unaffected sides? That I don't know.
not_available Obviously not.
not_available Anyone know the difference between a prostate and a garden hose? Leave her alone! 
not_available I should slap some manners into you.
not_available You can't talk to me like that! 
not_available What are you doing? Let go of him! I'm trying to talk, and this kid starts kicking me.
not_available You were being mean to her! 
not_available Sit down! Relax! Call ICU.
not_available Tell Lisa Sayler we found her son, and get Security down here.
not_available What is that? What are you doing? He was mean to her! 
not_available He could've been mean to you too.
not_available No, he couldn't.
not_available Yes, he could've.
not_available I have super powers! You don't have super powers.
not_available You're a 6year
not_available old boy.
not_available You live with your mother in Hyde Park! You cannot fly and you can't attack grown men who are arguing with their girlfriend.
not_available Are you listening to me? How's it going? Somebody who'll talk to me! You must not have gotten the memo.
not_available I read the paper.
not_available Are you hanging in there? By a thread.
not_available The nurses think I'm Benedict Arnold.
not_available Management's using my mistake to make the RNs look bad.
not_available You're in a tough spot.
not_available I should probably go to the Sun
not_available Times myself.
not_available Tell them the death had nothing to do with the sickout.
not_available Then what happens? I don't know.
not_available Lose my job maybe.
not_available You ready for that? Good news? I need to speak to your husband alone.
not_available Why? What's wrong? Show Mrs.
not_available Patterson to the waiting room.
not_available I want to stay with you, Mike.
not_available Does she have to? 
not_available Only if you want.
not_available I want to stay.
not_available I want her to stay.
not_available This is sensitive information.
not_available It can be difficult to hear.
not_available I want my wife here with me, okay? All right.
not_available If that's your decision.
not_available Our tests show that you have neurosyphilis which can cause mild personality disorders like you've been suffering.
not_available Syphilis? 
not_available Neurosyphilis.
not_available It's sexually transmitted.
not_available That doesn't mean it was contracted recently.
not_available It takes 7 years for symptoms to arise after the initial infection.
not_available We've been together since high school.
not_available We've always been committed to each other from the day we met to now.
not_available We can treat you with IV antibiotics check Cindy for exposure.
not_available In 2 weeks you'll be as good as new.
not_available This is impossible.
not_available We've only been with each other.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Car skidded into a light pole.
not_available ALOC.
not_available Multiple lacs.
not_available GCS, eight at the scene.
not_available BP's 90 over 60.

not_available Pupils are sluggish.

not_available Excellent.
not_available All right.
not_available Collins put in a Foley.
not_available Don't be shy.
not_available It's not yours.
not_available Ghandar, glove up.
not_available You'll help me with the peritoneal lavage.
not_available Doug, how's that leg?

not_available More four by fours.
not_available Grab that 5
not_available inch ace.
not_available Where were you? 
not_available Oh, the firm conference.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got crucified covering for you.
not_available You shouldn't have tried.
not_available I didn't have a choice! We were supposed to do it together! You left me twisting in the wind and trashed my reputation in front of every surgeon here! I'm sorry.
not_available All right? Something came up.
not_available You're sorry and something came up.
not_available That's your excuse? I've got a shunt with Hicks.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available The next time you feel the urge to ruin my career, I'd appreciate a warning.
not_available Tom Clayton? 
not_available Carol Hathaway.
not_available You want something to eat? Coffee? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available You're the nurse manager in the ER.
not_available Is that right? Do you mind if I take notes? 
not_available No.
not_available Is this gonna be on the record? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Is that man going to die? Maybe.
not_available He was hurt pretty badly.
not_available Just like your dad, right? I was thinking about what I said to you earlier, and I was wrong.
not_available Sometimes when you try to help somebody and you can't it gets inside you and it twists, and you wonder why.
not_available You should do what you think is right.
not_available And you don't let me or anybody else stop you.
not_available It's been a long time.
not_available I can't remember if Superman had a dad or not.
not_available But if he did I know that he was very, very proud of his son.
not_available Okay? Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available I've never done this before.
not_available Really? This is exactly the kind of thing you should be doing.
not_available So should I be worried about Peter? What do you mean? 
not_available Don't play dumb.
not_available It doesn't suit you.
not_available Is his emotional state impairing his surgical ability? No, not that I've seen.
not_available I appreciate your loyalty.
not_available But I want you to know if Peter can't use your talents, my team can.
not_available Really? Are you serious? I'm almost always serious.
not_available I need Mr.
not_available Patterson's chart.
not_available Why is that? I couldn't convince him to stay.
not_available Tricky situation.
not_available Are you going to notify the Department of Health? It's the law.
not_available Why don't you wait and let them talk.
not_available I'll give them a call.
not_available He'll probably come back in.
not_available You refuse to give me his chart? It's my job to be an advocate for my patients.
not_available It's your job to assist me.
not_available That's why it's called Physician Assistant.
not_available Are you always this arrogant, or is it just me? It's just you.
not_available I owe you an apology for the other night.
not_available You don't want to date a woman who's HIV
not_available positive.
not_available You owe me nothing.
not_available Did you see me zap that guy? 
not_available I had my hands inside his chest! Unbelievable! Thank you.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Well, I want to thank you two for taking care of our charges.
not_available What did you think? Frankly, I was disappointed.
not_available I found a general lack of enthusiasm, inattention to detail If I were you, I'd seriously re
not_available evaluate their applications.
not_available Don't worry, none of your students applied for the program.
not_available On the other hand, Mark all three of your candidates rank us as their top choice.
not_available You really reached those kids.
not_available Ever think of an academic appointment? There's a tenured spot available.
not_available I never thought about it.
not_available It's clear your place is on the faculty.
not_available Really? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Carol, I just got a call from a Sun
not_available Times reporter.
not_available He wanted me to confirm some statements you made.
not_available I hope you did.
not_available They're all true.
not_available Why did you do it? If you have to ask, you don't know me very well.
not_available I thought we were friends.
not_available No, Mary.
not_available You're my boss.
not_available I lost a patient.
not_available I can't forget it.
not_available Neither should you.
not_available Drummond wants to see you right away.
not_available Hicks offered me a position on her team.
not_available I'm taking it.
not_available Effective Monday.
not_available A month ago, you would've ripped my lungs out for going to another surgeon.
not_available Now you just stand there? Since when did I start caring about what you do, Carter? Never.
not_available But now you don't care about yourself or your reputation.
not_available I need an evaluation before I can transfer to Hicks' team.
not_available You'll get it.
not_available You know, in that surgery today everything I did, you taught me.
not_available I'll try your winter ale.
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available Heather Morgan.
not_available What happened to your thumb? 
not_available Long story.
not_available I had to go to the hospital.
not_available Saw this great doctor.
not_available Hope he took good care of you.
not_available She, actually.
not_available Can I ask you a hypothetical question? 
not_available We can dispense with those.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Did you order those? 
not_available They're from table 14 in the back.
not_available You bring them everywhere? These are the shifts for next week.
not_available There's a problem with Wednesday.
not_available We only have 6 RNs scheduled.
not_available You may need to bring in a float.
not_available There's supply reqs, a memo from Mary Cain and a note from Grounds that Don't go to the parking clerk.
not_available Go to Webber.
not_available We won on this last year but I think now they're getting serious.
not_available That's not my job.
not_available It is now.
not_available I've been suspended.
