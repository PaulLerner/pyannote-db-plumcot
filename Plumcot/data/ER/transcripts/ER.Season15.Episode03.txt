
not_available ABBY [lN VOlCE
not_available OVER.]
 Why is light given to those in misery? And life to the bitter of soul? To those who long for death that does not come? Who search for it more than for hidden treasure? Who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave? For sighing comes to me instead of food.
not_available My groans pour out like water.

not_available Come here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just easy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Listen to me, we have a man bleeding out.
GATES The rapid infuser.
BANFlELD We're bringing the GSW.
not_available Switch to portable, we're going.
not_available Someone tell me what's going on.
not_available Losing blood faster than it's replaced.
not_available Surgeons need to get in there and repair.
GRADY Seems too red.
not_available Run of six.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's roll.
not_available He's got a pulse.
not_available Send him with a crappy BP and intermittent V
not_available tach he'll arrest.
not_available Longer we argue, the greater the chance.
GATES She's right.
not_available We're more equipped to handle a code down here, trust me.
not_available Abby.
HALEH He's in V
not_available tach.
not_available All right, lost pulse.
BANFlELD Thoracotomy tray.
GATES Starting compressions.
not_available Charge to 36O.
BANFlELD Sterile 7s, a 1 0 blade.
LlLY What are you doing?.
not_available We have to open his chest.
GRADY Abby, look at this.
not_available Not now, Grady.
not_available Clear.
not_available No change.

GRADY Look at the left hemi
not_available diaphragm.

HALEH Strong radial pulse.
BANFlELD All right.
not_available Let's get him to the O.R.
GATES All right.
not_available Wait.
not_available No.
not_available Grady's right.
not_available Chest tube followed the bullet, in the spleen.
not_available Listen, that is highly unlikely, and we can't prove it here.
not_available We could see it with the ultrasound.
not_available Let me see.
GATES We did an ultrasound.
not_available But it's easy to miss.
not_available A dislodged clot in the spleen could have caused
not_available Caused a precipitous arterial bleed to drain out the chest tube.

not_available It's just getting too hard to deny.
not_available Well, I've never heard of using fibrin glue this way.
not_available Yeah.
not_available To tell you the truth, I have absolutely no idea where that came from.
not_available Lodged in there somewhere.
not_available Well, it's a good job it was.
not_available And I see you've met our new chief.

not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available And you're gonna have to talk to some doctors to make sure you're okay too.
not_available I know you think you're a bad person.
not_available We all think that about ourselves sometimes.
not_available But you're not.
not_available You just did a bad thing.
not_available Don't make the same mistake again, okay?.
not_available You would've never let me use that thing, would you?.
not_available You know what?.
not_available I really hadn't thought that far ahead.
not_available See you later.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Dear, you made me so nervous 
not_available I had to come back.
not_available What's the matter, Roxanne?.
not_available You're sick, aren't you?.
not_available No.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Oh, ha, ha, but the way you were talking.
not_available Is something bad gonna happen?.
not_available No.
not_available Something good.
not_available Hey, Sam! Are you going up now?.
not_available Dead nurse walking.
ABBY I wanna talk.
not_available Will I see you next time?.
not_available Ask for Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available You have to do some stupid monkey dance for a bunch of cheap suits?.
not_available T o justify how we navigate a broken system which is the problem that they should be looking at.
not_available You're very articulate today.
not_available I know.
not_available Nurse T aggart, it'll be a few more minutes.
not_available Are you kidding me?.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it's not okay.
not_available She's working, all right?.
not_available She can't keep bouncing up and down like some registered yo
not_available yo.
SAM Abby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, I'm sorry, but don't you think this is kind of ass?.
not_available Excuse me?.
not_available Who are you?.
not_available Abby Lockhart.
not_available I used to be a nurse in the ER, I am now an attending physician.
not_available You'll have to be on the agenda.
not_available Let me break it down for you.
not_available What we do is take care of patients that nobody else wants to deal with, all right?.
not_available The homeless alcoholics, drug addicts, psychotics.
not_available All of us, especially the nurses, put ourselves at risk every day.
not_available Every day.
not_available When wards don't want to go over nurseto
not_available patient ratio because they want to follow rules, guess who sucks up the surplus?.
not_available The ER does.
not_available And never mind that means having admitted patients parked on gurneys in the hallway for days and our nurses have to cover three times as many patients as anybody else.
not_available We're the safety net.
not_available We do not have the luxury of abiding by the rules because we don't kick patients out on the streets.
not_available So we get creative.
not_available And yes, it's against the rules to send a patient home with an lV.
not_available Worst
not_available case, he'll do something stupid.
not_available But Sam T aggart is not a worst
not_available case scenario kind of person.
not_available Well, none of us are.
not_available Because to work down there you have to have some sort of faith in people and in your ability to help them.
not_available She didn't inject drugs into the lV, the patient did.
not_available And what would you have her do?.
not_available Deny a potentially lifesaving treatment because the guy maybe might do something stupid later?.
not_available She's an excellent nurse.
not_available And she did what almost anybody else would do and she should not be punished because a patient made a bad choice.
not_available I mean, we have so many things working against us.
not_available Don't be another one of them.
not_available And they all deserve a raise.
not_available Don't make me come back here.
not_available ABBY [lN VOlCE
not_available OVER.]
 Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea? Or walked in the recesses of the deep? 
HALEH What are you doing with that?.
not_available Souvenir.
not_available Mm

not_available Do I have to go up there and apologize?.

not_available So thank you.
not_available Nurses gotta stick together, right?.
not_available All right.

FRANK Hey.
not_available Tell that big Croat to bring you back for a visit sometime.
not_available Keep your head up, Frank.
not_available I guess I let the cat out of the bag, huh?.
not_available This kind of group thing I was sort of hoping to avoid but, um, Luka's picking me up and since you're all here I just wanna to say, it's been a great decade.
MORRlS Excuse me?.
not_available What the hell?.
not_available She's leaving, Archie.
not_available When?.
not_available Now, you idiot.
not_available What?.
not_available You are?.
not_available She
not_available ?.
not_available You are?.
not_available You never said anything.
not_available Well, I just.
not_available I kind of thought you got the idea.
not_available I didn't.
not_available I didn't.
ABBY lWell, I'm
