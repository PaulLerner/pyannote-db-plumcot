
not_available ER Previously on ER Gamma, if that is all you think of me, then you can keep your money.
not_available As you wish, John.
not_available Cancer's back.
not_available Your bone marrow failed to match the last two potential donors.
not_available I don't want any more chemo.
not_available Gather all the charts and the tape.
not_available The tape? We often tape laparoscopic procedures.
not_available Don't pull so hard with the Babcock.
not_available You'll tear the gastric artery.
not_available I'm not pulling.
not_available Oh, son of a bitch! 
not_available He's lost too much blood.
not_available Let's open.
not_available We're losing him.
not_available Doctor, it's been three minutes.
not_available He's dying.
not_available Move! "Shades Of Gray" Cubs fan, huh? 
not_available Please don't touch that.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Before I make any decisions about your loan application I have to clarify a few points.
not_available Yeah? You only included one tax return, as a surgical resident with an annual salary of $28,000? Yeah.
not_available Before taxes.
not_available We'll need your other returns from previous years.
not_available There aren't any.
not_available Before that, I was a med student.
not_available No summer jobs? Well, I 
not_available crewed in the Whitbread in 1990.
not_available Where was that? Capetown.
not_available Fremantle.
not_available Capsized between Sydney and Auckland.
not_available It's a yacht race.
not_available And you earned? A few thousand.
not_available But after living expenses I spent more than I made.
not_available You're a Resident in emergency medicine now.
not_available Is that correct? Yeah.
not_available When I shifted from surgery, I agreed to do so without pay.
not_available But I'm gonna ask for a paycheck next year, for sure.
not_available I would hope so.
not_available What about this trust fund? The holdings are in my grandfather's name and I am no longer drawing funds from it.
not_available Would he be willing to cosign for your loan? I want my application to be judged on its own merits.
not_available On its own merits, I must reject it.
not_available Why? Either talk to your grandfather or acquaint yourself with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
not_available Peter? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available I looked over your report for the Morbidity and Mortality Conference.
not_available It was quite evenhanded.
not_available Well, I just charted what happened.
not_available Sometimes these things can become so "he said, she said.
not_available " 
not_available There's no need for that.
not_available No, no.
not_available Lizzie and I did an aortobifemoral bypass in 2 hours, 20 minutes.
not_available Well, that's wonderful, Robert.
not_available Is M and M still on, or can I buy Lizzie a five
not_available egg omelet? It's still on.
not_available Looks like you're not out of the hot seat yet.
not_available Will Anspaugh be there? No.
not_available He requested that I messenger the meeting notes over to his house.
not_available Is the funeral today? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I sent flowers from the department.
not_available Well, looks like a cruller and a Coke is all we have time for.
not_available My treat! Mark? I'm going to a surgical M and M.
not_available Can you cover for an hour? Sure, what's going on? It's the Swanson laparoscopy.
not_available Right.
not_available Peter's case.
not_available It's actually Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available Right.
not_available Have fun.
not_available I'll hold down the fort.
not_available I thought you said 
not_available he's the best.
not_available He is! He rolled my med school loan into a Sallie Mae, Fannie Mae, Ellie Mae, whatever.
not_available All I know is I don't have to eat meals out of a can anymore.
not_available Did you catch that Sox game? 
not_available Missed it.
not_available Center fielder, pop fly, catching a few z's.
not_available Pay up! I'm short right now.
not_available Can I get you? Sure.
not_available I know you're good for it.
not_available My aunt made a killing selling Tupperware.
not_available Tupperware? Those little plastic storage things
not_available I know what Tupperware is.
not_available How about Amway? 
not_available You're really enjoying this.
not_available Yeah, a little.
not_available Heads up, doctors! 
not_available Carter, you're up.
not_available This day gets better and better, doesn't it? Grabarsky, who do you got? Mike Lembreaux.
not_available Doesn't know when to say when.
not_available Fell over a curb.
not_available A curb? Maybe we should have those removed.
not_available His wrist looks pretty bad.
not_available Well, from the smell of things, we can skip the pain medication.
not_available Let's check out that wrist, Mr.
not_available Lembreaux.
not_available I wanted to eulogize him somehow, but I I never felt comfortable in his mother's church.
not_available So austere.
not_available No pomp and ceremony, just silent judgment.
not_available I thought the silence was for contemplation.
not_available It's just Well, you can imagine how her Quaker parents felt when she brought home a West Point man.
not_available Well, you ended up getting married.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The hawk and the dove.
not_available Long time ago.
not_available Scotty wanted you to have the stuff in this box.
not_available Green Day.
not_available I'm surprised he didn't burn a hole through this one.
not_available What? 
not_available Soap Opera Digest.
not_available I knew he was getting those future plots from somewhere.
not_available The most important aspect of M and M is not to linger on our missteps but to analyze every case as a teaching tool.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Gonna need a reduction.
not_available An open reduction.
not_available Internal fixation in the O.R.
not_available Not so fast.
not_available You're not in surgery.
not_available I got my real ones knocked out in Joliet.
not_available He can't breathe! He can't breathe! 
not_available I'm showing him something.
not_available Keep breathing on the nebulizer.
not_available Leave this kid alone.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available Put your teeth back in your mouth.
not_available I can talk to anybody! Take deep breaths.
not_available Don't tell me what to do.
not_available Leave me alone! Guys, get the soft restraints! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Stop it! Leave me alone! Please help him! You'll be fine.
not_available He's cyanotic! I'm gonna intubate him.
not_available Check his right wrist.
not_available I'm intubating.
not_available Get me 40 of ketamine.
not_available Forty of ketamine What are you doing bringing a psycho in here? 
not_available I didn't realize.
not_available This boy is a critical asthma patient.
not_available Nobody cares about Pedes.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Give me suction.
not_available Morgenstern's attempt to control the hemorrhage by incision was futile.
not_available Bleeding obscured the operative field, but we were controlling it.
not_available It was difficult.
not_available What did you do next? Called for additional suction.
not_available Then you decided to change course and open the chest.
not_available Who made that incision? I did.
not_available Morgenstern allowed you to crack the chest? Not exactlyI didn't feel it
not_available Gentlemen, one at a time.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? I took over the surgery.
not_available What do you mean, "take over"? In the heat of the moment, Dr.
not_available Benton became agitated.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? I pushed him aside.
not_available What was your justification for such an action? The man was bleeding out.
not_available The midline incision was adequate.
not_available It was the varices.
not_available No.
not_available He needed to be cracked immediately.
not_available And that justifies committing battery? The man was dying.
not_available Would you have stood there? I would have assisted the Attending.
not_available After three minutes of arterial bleeding cross
not_available clamping the aorta was the only alternative.
not_available No, Peter.
not_available I don't think it was.
not_available No, it was the only alternative! Gentlemen, it's best to adjourn and convene a resident review at 12:30 to discuss it.
not_available I agree.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern? Yes.
not_available I think that would be for the best.
not_available What do we have here? A 28year
not_available old woman, 18 weeks pregnant, found unconscious.
not_available GCS 11, multiple lacs, vitals stable.
not_available Let's go! The Chicago Reproductive Center was bombed.
not_available The abortion clinic? They also do prenatal care.
not_available They're still pulling people from the rubble.
not_available Blowing up clinics.
not_available Bastards! How many we got? 
not_available No idea.
not_available It's chaos down there.
not_available We got a 17year
not_available old, second trimester.
not_available Chest pain, shortness of breath.
not_available BP's real low, 80/50.
not_available Pulse 120.
not_available Resps 24.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available You're at a hospital.
not_available Donny? 
not_available I'm right here.
not_available Her name? 
not_available Zoe Kearney.
not_available A wall fell on her.
not_available How far along is she? 
not_available Six months.
not_available Clear Trauma 1! We can't release patient information over the phone.
not_available The hospital has no official comment at this time.
not_available It's the Trib.
not_available They want to know if any abortion docs died.
not_available They're "gynecologists.
not_available " We don't have any information.
not_available A vanload of protesters with minor injuries came in.
not_available Triage them.
not_available We're swamped with criticals.
not_available Something's wrong with my ears.
not_available No one is helping me.
not_available We're really busy, but someone will get to you as soon as they can.
not_available Please! I've been in a bombing.
not_available I know.
not_available We'll get you a room as soon as we can.
not_available Have somebody look at that.
not_available What? 
not_available Your head.
not_available Thirty
not_available two French.
not_available Urine dip's negative.
not_available Blood gas? PO289.
not_available PCO225.
not_available PH 7.29 on 10 liters.
not_available Borderline, but okay.
not_available Resps down to 27.
not_available Fetal heart rate 140.
not_available No contractions.
not_available Mom's 110/60.
not_available Where's my boyfriend? 
not_available He's outside.
not_available Is he okay? 
not_available He's fine.
not_available Relax.
not_available Still want the blood? Hang a unit of red cells.
not_available Get her to CT.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Got it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Send her blood to Radiology.
not_available Where's she going? 
not_available Taking her to CT.
not_available What's on the scope? 
not_available Sinus tach at 120.
not_available Let OB know where we're going! 
not_available I'm right behind you, okay? Was she in for an abortion or prenatal care? She's 18, 19 weeks.
not_available Kind of late for an AB, don't you think? We've got fetal heart tones, 145.
not_available CBC, type and cross for four units, and cath a urine.
not_available Pulse ox 98.
not_available BP 90/70.
not_available Good cap refill.
not_available Also get a chest.
not_available Shield her abdomen and let's prep her for a pelvic.
not_available I've got her chart.
not_available Brianna Thomas, 
not_available In for a suction extraction.
not_available An abortion? Looks like they didn't finish.
not_available BP's dropped, 80/50.
not_available Pulse 110.
not_available She's hemorrhaging.
not_available Complete the AB.
not_available Grab a gyn tray.
not_available Grab a tray! We need to evacuate the uterus.
not_available Now, doctor.
not_available I can't.
not_available Speculum! Betadine! Set suction on high, and get me a size 14 cannula.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available Second liter's in.
not_available Hang a third and repeat a crit.
not_available Anna? Can I speak to you for a moment? Sure.
not_available Kerry, you want some coffee? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available What happened in that trauma today? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I froze.
not_available That can't happen.
not_available I couldn't complete the abortion.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available The fetus was so far along and
not_available What about Brianna Thomas? Your patient was hemorrhaging.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I didn't exThe baby had a chance, you know? There are patients and procedures that we might find distasteful
not_available Distasteful? Come on, Kerry, I'm not squeamish.
not_available It just felt wrong.
not_available We can't allow our feelings to dictate our standard of care.
not_available I don't.
not_available But you did.
not_available Your moral objection to abortion
not_available I don't have a moral objection! Well, something happened in there today.
not_available I'm his son, Burke.
not_available He lives with me.
not_available How long has he been wetting the bed? Maybe two days.
not_available He smelled pretty bad.
not_available He's had urine infections before.
not_available Right.
not_available Temp's 102, and he looks dehydrated.
not_available We try to get him to eat or drink, but he won't.
not_available Let's start a line of normal saline.
not_available Give him a 500 cc bolus.
not_available CBC, Chem
not_available 20, blood cultures times two, urine CNS.
not_available You got it.
not_available I don't think that's necessary.
not_available Before, they just gave him antibiotics.
not_available We need to do a full evaluation.
not_available If you're worried about being sued
not_available It's nothing to do with being sued.
not_available You'll poke him and prod him and then thousands of dollars later, you'll give him antibiotics.
not_available Go have a seat while we work on your dad.
not_available Unbefriggin
not_available lievable! Grab a blood gas kit and show Mr.
not_available Newton to Chairs.
not_available I can show myself.
not_available He's a charmer.
not_available When's the last time anyone bathed this guy? From the looks of these bedsores, about the same time they turned him.
not_available So much for "honor thy father.
not_available " I don't understand your argument.
not_available The decision has been made.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton allowed his emotions to get a little out of hand.
not_available Otherwise, he's a good resident.
not_available Who committed battery.
not_available Peter's a good surgeon.
not_available But you can't let this stand.
not_available Like you said, Dr.
not_available Weaver, the decision's been made.
not_available Unless you have a problem with it? No.
not_available Debra, would you ask Dr.
not_available Benton to come in, please? Dr.
not_available Benton, we have reviewed Dr.
not_available Swanson's chart and the autopsy.
not_available I thought the autopsy was inconclusive due to the state of the body.
not_available Regardless, this committee feels the matter warrants further investigation.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Everything I saw and did is in this report.
not_available Chart aside, you pushed an Attending.
not_available You're out of the rotation pending a formal inquiry.
not_available You're suspending me? Until Dr.
not_available Anspaugh returns and there's a full investigation.
not_available When can I return to my job? We don't know yet.
not_available And this is effective? 
not_available Immediately.
not_available She threw three PVCs, unifocal, no R on T.
not_available Should I give her lidocaine? Three? No.
not_available Let's observe.
not_available Her chest tube stopped draining.
not_available Resps are a little high at 26.
not_available Zoe, we looked at your CT.
not_available There's no evidence of organ damage.
not_available We still want to admit you for observation.
not_available For how long? 
not_available We're not sure.
not_available It's kind of hard to breathe.
not_available Pulse ox always 94? 
not_available No.
not_available It's down.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What about the baby? You have fetal heart tones, which means that the baby is alive.
not_available As for kicking, you tell me.
not_available We should name him Lucky, huh? 
not_available "Her.
not_available " 
not_available I have a feeling.
not_available Do you want to see him or her? 
not_available We're gonna do an ultrasound.
not_available Yeah, cool.
not_available Zoe, what's wrong? 
not_available BP's down to 60 palp.
not_available Are you in pain? Pulse ox 90! 
not_available She's bradying down! Let's go! Hang on.
not_available Step back! Pulse is 40.
not_available You gotta give us room to work here.
not_available Oh, no! No! Pulmonary embolus? 
not_available Probably.
not_available Repeat a gas,.5 atropine.
not_available Damn! All right.
not_available Start CPR.
not_available This one is almost to the bone.
not_available I've seen all I need to see.
not_available I'll put this paperwork through.
not_available Hopefully, we'll get him into an extended care facility.
not_available I'd appreciate it.
not_available I just need you to sign this.
not_available I'll run it down to the courthouse.
not_available Thank you for taking care of this so quickly.
not_available I'd say it was my pleasure, but see how people treat their own parents? Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, what gives? I've been sitting here forever.
not_available Your father exhibited textbook signs of neglect.
not_available That's crazy.
not_available He hasn't been bathed for weeks.
not_available He's covered in feces.
not_available He's got bedsores to the bone.
not_available I've recommended that he be placed in an adult
not_available care facility.
not_available You don't have any say.
not_available I have power of attorney.
not_available The hospital has claimed temporary guardianship.
not_available Really? Who'll pay? I handle the Medicare.
not_available His Medicare payments will be transferred to the facility he's in.
not_available Expect to hear from my lawyer.
not_available Look forward to it.
not_available It feels like there's something in there.
not_available With all that glass flying after the explosion I didn't want to take a chance.
not_available No, you did the right thing.
not_available It's so sad.
not_available These extremists blowing up buildings with people inside.
not_available It's pretty stupid if the idea is to save lives, huh? Exactly.
not_available I marched with Dr.
not_available King in the '60s.
not_available I thought the world would learn something from him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Would you put your chin up here for me, please? Must be hard on you as a doctor, and of course a young woman to know that for every life you save, they're taking one away in that clinic.
not_available I don't think about it like that.
not_available I don't think a lot of people do.
not_available It's like that old poem about the Nazis.
not_available You know.
not_available First they came for the Jews then for whoever, and when they came to take me
not_available Doctors who perform abortions aren't Nazis.
not_available Of course not.
not_available But if you sit around while they're taking the children, who's next? All right.
not_available I see something in there.
not_available I knew I wasn't crazy.
not_available Hold real still for me.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're all set.
not_available If you have any discomfort, you can take some ibuprofen.
not_available Use these drops four times a day.
not_available Come back tomorrow for a re
not_available check.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is some information on our group.
not_available We hold strategy meetings every Wednesday.
not_available The address is on
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, can't forget this.
not_available STOP ABORTIONIST GENOCIDE Hey, Miss Martinez! You forgot this.
not_available I thought we felt the same.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available You're not a peaceful protester.
not_available That sign is a call to arms.
not_available The bomber saw it, or one like it.
not_available It's reality.
not_available If it upsets you, then it's done its job.
not_available The only job it's done is to encourage violence.
not_available And, yes, that upsets me.
not_available She was okay before.
not_available She was fine.
not_available She was talking.
not_available She had a clot in her lung.
not_available It deprived her brain of oxygen.
not_available There's no way to predict it would happen.
not_available Are you sure? We're gonna do an EEG and a brain scan to confirm it.
not_available So she's in a coma? It's like a coma, yeah.
not_available Yes.
not_available People come out of comas.
not_available Not when the brain has been deprived of oxygen as long as Zoe's has, no.
not_available What about the baby? The baby appears to be fine.
not_available Can you save her? Probably.
not_available I think so, yeah.
not_available And it's a girl? Yes.
not_available You hear that, Zoe? You were right.
not_available It's a girl.
not_available Wanted to talk to you before I left.
not_available Aren't you on till 7? 
not_available No.
not_available I've been suspended.
not_available You're not serious? 
not_available Yeah, well, I wish I wasn't.
not_available We need help here, now! I'll call you later, okay? What have we got? She's my trainee.
not_available She got crushed underneath some unstable debris.
not_available We took care of all the traumas.
not_available People were trapped underneath.
not_available BP 60 palp.
not_available Pulse 150 and thready.
not_available IV's infiltrated, poor cap refill.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? Oh, my God! Allison! Clear Trauma 1! EBL on scene? 
not_available Half a liter.
not_available Hope you didn't mess up my beautiful graft.
not_available We need X
not_available ray in here now.
not_available Blood bank on their way.
not_available A 48year
not_available old custodian.
not_available Multiple lacs to the chest and back.
not_available BP's 70/30.
not_available Pulse thready at 144.
not_available Sir, are you with us? Peter? 
not_available I'm on my way home.
not_available Very funny.
not_available I'm not joking.
not_available I've been suspended.
not_available Not by me you haven't.
not_available I need you! All right.
not_available Let's get 6 shooters O
not_available neg.
not_available Call the trauma team, we're on our way.
not_available All right, let's roll him.
not_available Open pneumothorax.
not_available Let's tube him.
not_available Damn it.
not_available We got a pumper! No pulse! 
not_available All right.
not_available Start CPR.
not_available We need to crack him.
not_available Thoracotomy tray.
not_available Cricoid pressure? 
not_available Here's your 10 blade.
not_available A 7.5 ET tube.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Suction.
not_available There it is.
not_available Dramatic aortic dissection and rupture.
not_available I'm in! Hyperventilate him.
not_available Can you get the Satinsky in? No.
not_available I'm sticking my finger in.
not_available Don't let go.
not_available You stopped the bleeding.
not_available I'm holding CPR.
not_available Carotid pulse? 
not_available Faint.
not_available Pump in more O
not_available neg.
not_available Get him upstairs.
not_available Malik, you stay with us.
not_available Keep bagging him.
not_available Let's go, people! Go, go, go! Alert the bypass team.
not_available You set the pace.
not_available We're following you.
not_available Watch that IV.
not_available Call the O.R., tell them we're coming! Dr.
not_available Benton, I thought you understood
not_available Not now.
not_available He's tamponing an aortic tear.
not_available Don't jostle the gurney.
not_available Carry on.
not_available All right, hit five.
not_available We need four units O
not_available neg.
not_available What's up, Lizzie? Decreased breath, hyper
not_available resonant, hemopneumo.
not_available I got the chest tube.
not_available Can we give her morphine? 
not_available Check the BP first.
not_available It hurts! You've got rib fractures.
not_available Try not to talk.
not_available Where have I heard that before? Thora
not_available Seal's filling.
not_available We need an abdominal CT.
not_available She's unstable.
not_available Do a peritoneal lavage.
not_available Type and cross for eight.
not_available Pulse ox is down, 90.
not_available Here's the O

not_available You want me to do it? No.
not_available You do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey Hi.
not_available I'm sorry to wake you up.
not_available I was just resting my eyes.
not_available I brought you juice and a sandwich.
not_available I figured you'd be hungry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You feeling okay? Fine, considering.
not_available Were you my doctor? No.
not_available That was Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Two docs, no waiting, huh? My boyfriend brought my clothes.
not_available I'll give you your bed back.
not_available Are you feeling well enough to go? 
not_available Like I said, I'm fine.
not_available I'd just rather be at home.
not_available If you don't mind, I'm gonna get changed.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Doctor? Hi, Mr.
not_available Newton.
not_available How are you feeling? I'm tired.
not_available That's from the dehydration.
not_available Malnutrition, mostly.
not_available Where Where's Where's Burke? He left.
not_available He deals with the paperwork.
not_available Your son is no longer your guardian.
not_available For the time being, I am.
not_available Why? What? The elder abuse unit is filing paperwork to put you into a home.
not_available But I have a home.
not_available You have some very serious medical problems resulting from what we believe is very serious neglect.
not_available I'm 86 years old.
not_available I've slept in the same bed for 70 years now.
not_available I'm just trying to help you.
not_available I want to die in my own bed.
not_available You're not sterile.
not_available Go scrub.
not_available I'm not letting go.
not_available Get 10 units packed cells.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Okay, people, on my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Move this gurney.
not_available Mark, help me roll him.
not_available Open the instrument tray.
not_available No one's gloved and gowned.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Get gloves, gowns, masks and caps in here now.
not_available Okay, 10 blade.
not_available Get him a mask.
not_available Tonsil sucker.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm gonna mobilize the aorta.
not_available Metz! 
not_available Let's move, let's move.
not_available Come on.
not_available What's going on? Peter's got his hand on this man's aorta.
not_available Potts' clamp.
not_available I'll do a revised clampand
not_available run.
not_available Got a second Potts? Stand by.
not_available Got it.
not_available Take your finger out now.
not_available Set up the Bovie.
not_available Pulse is stronger.
not_available Okay, let's go for a BP.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Suction, please.
not_available Somebody Hoover that.
not_available Systolic's up to 80.
not_available Terrific.
not_available Okay, we can take over now.
not_available Bovie, please.
not_available A 30, please.
not_available Keep them coming.
not_available Retractor and Bovie.
not_available Fourby
not_available four and a sponge stick, please.
not_available Cut that.
not_available Good, good, good.
not_available A 30, keep them coming.
not_available It's looking very good, very good.
not_available Oh, sweet Jesus! 
not_available There's gotta be another test.
not_available My angel, sweetheart.
not_available What's he doing here? 
not_available He was with her during the bombing.
not_available I bet he was.
not_available We were getting a checkup.
not_available You killed my daughter.
not_available Proud of yourself? If she'd stayed with you, she would've killed herself.
not_available Calm down.
not_available He needs to get the hell out of my daughter's room.
not_available I love her.
not_available You guys treated her like crap.
not_available We're calling an OB consult.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Give them some time alone.
not_available All right? Come on.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Come on.
not_available She's been in asystole for 20 minutes.
not_available Another 7 of epi.
not_available You already had 10.
not_available We got a response.
not_available Two beats is not a response.
not_available Start an epinephrine drip.
not_available And a heart transplant too? Stop being such a prick.
not_available Get me two units of packed cells! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I wanted to say thanks for all you did.
not_available The abortion and all.
not_available Right.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available It's the most memorable one I ever got.
not_available You've had others? 
not_available A few.
not_available I thought Earl would want this baby.
not_available Like he'd get serious about us, but he hit the roof.
not_available Our clinic can advise you on family planning.
not_available Earl doesn't like that stuff.
not_available Pills make me fat.
not_available There are preferable forms of birth control than abortion.
not_available Why are you being such a bitch? Because you're being irresponsible.
not_available More likely, it's because you don't get any yourself.
not_available It's a very difficult decision.
not_available Neither of which will bring Zoe back.
not_available It's true.
not_available But if the decision is to keep the baby you have two 
options The first is we perform an emergency C
not_available section.
not_available We deliver a very premature baby, and we take Zoe off the respirator.
not_available The baby would have to go in an incubator, right? That's right.
not_available Probably months of intensive care.
not_available What's the other option? The other option is that we keep Zoe on life support until we can deliver the baby full
not_available term.
not_available And what do you recommend? I recommend the later delivery.
not_available You're suggesting that our daughter be made into a human incubator.
not_available Even though she has no chance of recovery.
not_available It's the baby's best chance.
not_available I don't want to see Zoe left lying there like some kind of vessel.
not_available She wanted this baby more than anything in the world.
not_available You have no say in this matter.
not_available I'm the baby's father.
not_available I'm Zoe's father, and you and she are minors.
not_available The decision is mine and her mother's.
not_available They can't do this, can they? I'm sorry it took us so long to get to you.
not_available I understand.
not_available I was just really freaked out.
not_available It's not every day the room you're in explodes.
not_available Understandable.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're all set.
not_available Keep it elevated and dry, and come back in two days for a re
not_available check.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You left your insurance form blank.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I left my card at home.
not_available Can you call someone to get it? 
not_available No, I'll pay cash.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available Your insurance will cover this.
not_available No, I know.
not_available I just don't want my husband to know I was at the clinic.
not_available I thought I was too old for this kind of thing to happen.
not_available Then I started to puke up corn flakes every morning.
not_available Now I have to find a new clinic.
not_available Preferably one that is not ticking.
not_available You haven't had the abortion? 
not_available No.
not_available And if my husband finds out, he just won't have the heart.
not_available Our youngest daughter's in college.
not_available He put all four kids through college.
not_available He worked five years past his retirement to be able to pay for it.
not_available I've never kept anything from him, but
not_available What if you told him what you told me? I can't.
not_available I'd love to but I can't.
not_available Anyway, what do I owe you? Don't worry.
not_available Bring your card tomorrow.
not_available I could leave a license or something as collateral.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I trust you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available If anybody asks you can get a laceration like that from a dog bite.
not_available Have you seen Corday? She's still in O.R.
not_available 3 with Beaumont.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available She made it, huh? What's wrong? You okay? Yeah.
not_available It was scary.
not_available You can put them back together, but you can't keep them that way.
not_available Scotty always had such great school spirit.
not_available I think I can speak for the whole team when I say we're really going to miss him.
not_available I was gonna sing a hymn.
not_available But as I'm sitting here, thinking of Scott there's a song that he loved.
not_available And it'll always remind me of him.
not_available Zadro, I fancy seeing you on the surgical floor.
not_available I wanted to tell you, we appreciate what you did for Allison.
not_available She's a fighter.
not_available With a damn good guardian angel.
not_available Lizzie I want to apologize for when I spoke during the Beaumont surgery.
not_available I know that she means a lot to you.
not_available I just hope you forgive me.
not_available Of course.
not_available It's been a crazy day for all of us.
not_available I get off in about an hour.
not_available Do you want to get a drink? Decompress? Look, I'm knackered.
not_available Any other day.
not_available Okay? I understand.
not_available If you change your mind, you have my number.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available David? I forgot what this place was all about.
not_available The teamwork.
not_available The well
not_available oiled machine.
not_available What? I've let this situation get completely out of hand.
not_available I told myself the varices were too friable.
not_available That my field was obscured.
not_available That I was protecting Dr.
not_available Swanson's dignity.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available I was covering my own ass.
not_available Look, if you make a mistake, that's all that it is.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available It's more than that.
not_available What are you watching? What am I not watching? That's the question.
not_available This is the tape of Swanson's laparoscopy.
not_available Where did you get it? I took it right after the surgery.
not_available I've been too chicken to look at it.
not_available I guess I thought we could avoid a confrontation.
not_available A resident can take a note in his file, right? Peter's got so much less to lose than
not_available I can toss this right now.
not_available No one would be the wiser.
not_available You wouldn't have called me if that's what you were going to do.
not_available Jeanie? I wondered where you'd gotten to.
not_available I'm just sitting in here.
not_available It's very peaceful.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available When Scotty was going through the worst of it I went into his room.
not_available Found his journal.
not_available I know I shouldn't have looked at it but I wanted to understand him the way you and his mother seemed to.
not_available He loved you very much.
not_available He said, "Jeanie just gets it.
not_available I don't have to explain anything to her, because she already knows.
not_available " That's very sweet.
not_available He told me what he wanted to be when he grew up.
not_available Some kind of rock 'n' roll star, probably.
not_available He wanted to join the Army.
not_available He did? I paged OB.
not_available They'll send somebody to discuss your options.
not_available We've decided to keep the baby and wait until it's closer to term.
not_available Good, I'm glad.
not_available Donny will be glad too.
not_available This is no longer any of Donny's business.
not_available Give it a little more time.
not_available I've contacted our attorney.
not_available My wife and I are filing for sole custody.
not_available Is this to teach Donny a lesson? Nothing could teach him what he deserves.
not_available I've seen parents twice his age who weren't responsible enough to seek care.
not_available Responsible? Getting a 16year
not_available old girl pregnant.
not_available Forcing her to leave home.
not_available Drop out of school
not_available Please, Miles.
not_available No.
not_available The doctor thinks he's an expert.
not_available No, it's just
not_available It's just what's best for the child.
not_available We let Donny into our lives once and he took our daughter away.
not_available He's not gonna take our granddaughter.
not_available I don't want to go.
not_available Everything will be fine.
not_available This is for the best.
not_available I'm not sure it is.
not_available You filed a legal report.
not_available You can't rescind that.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available If you won't listen to me, listen to him.
not_available Someone being abused can't always determine the best course of action.
not_available This isn't a hypothetical.
not_available This is an adult human being who's deciding to go home.
not_available Your report said he was non compos mentis.
not_available He was severely dehydrated.
not_available Once we ran fluids in him, he's become lucid.
not_available Mr.
not_available Newton, I know you're scared.
not_available But I'm scared about what's going to happen to you if you're not cared for.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, call Burke.
not_available He'll explain.
not_available Don't force me to get the police involved and press charges against your son and daughterin
not_available law.
not_available Can she do that? 
not_available Please don't let her do that.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't let her do that! I'm sorry! 
not_available I want to go home! Kerry.
not_available Anna.
not_available What happened today, it threw me.
not_available It's been on my mind.
not_available I wanted to talk to you about it.
not_available Same here.
not_available I should have explained myself better instead of flying off the handle.
not_available You were right.
not_available No, just let me explain.
not_available I did some overseas work in Africa where abortion is illegal.
not_available And I saw 15year
not_available old girls in septic shock from botched procedures.
not_available And there was nothing we could do.
not_available I've made it a priority to be the best doctor I can be and to support all my patients' choices.
not_available If you had asked me when I got up this morning I would've said the same thing.
not_available But in this case, she was so far along.
not_available What if another Brianna Thomas comes in? I'd love to be able to tell you that if the same case came in tomorrow I'd do the procedure without a second thought, but I don't know.
not_available Peter, I'm glad I caught you.
not_available I was on my way to your apartment.
not_available I'm sorry about that surgery, but I already had my hand in there.
not_available No, you did the right thing.
not_available You were thinking on your feet.
not_available That's not what I want to talk about.
not_available I wanted to let you know that one of my last two acts as Chief of Surgery is to rescind your suspension.
not_available What do you mean? That's Swanson's laparoscopy in full living color.
not_available The mistake wasn't yours.
not_available I cut the gastric artery.
not_available My last act as chief will be to resign.
not_available It was just one incident.
not_available No.
not_available When I saw you in that trauma today, the passion that you exhibited it's been years since I felt that.
not_available It might have something to do with my heart attack.
not_available The pressure of feeling that I just don't belong here anymore.
not_available What do you mean? You're a great surgeon.
not_available You taught me everything I know.
not_available I was a great surgeon.
not_available But what happened what I allowed to happen it just proves that I'm not a very great man.
not_available That's what I gotta work on.
not_available Here.
not_available You smell that? 
not_available What's that? The smell of spring.
not_available All green, and full of possibility.
not_available Ramen Delight.
not_available You feeling suicidal? No, I'm just poor.
not_available John Truman Carter, poor? It's a long story.
not_available I've had a bit of a long week.
not_available I overdid it with a patient.
not_available Thought I was doing what was best.
not_available Better to overdo it and be wrong, than not do anything at all.
not_available I'll tell you what.
not_available Dump that liquid sodium and I'll buy you a burger and a beer.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's not an option.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Is it still raining? It's not so bad.
not_available It's kind of nice, actually.
not_available Peter? I hope I'm not disturbing you.
not_available Come on in.
not_available I'll turn the music down.
not_available Let me take that.
not_available Oh Here, look, you're soaking wet.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cheap umbrella.
not_available What possessed you to come out in these elements? My day, my week, my life.
not_available I heard about Morgenstern.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available I lost my mentor today.
not_available And the hospital they lost a great surgeon.
not_available You can be so close to somebody and then they're gone.
not_available And you've never even told them that youYou know, how What you
not_available I'm sorry, I'm babbling.
not_available I'm not making sense.
