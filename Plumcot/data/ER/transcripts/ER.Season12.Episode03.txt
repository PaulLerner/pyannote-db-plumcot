not_available Literature? 
not_available As far as I know oral antibiotics are still the standard of care.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I know that.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Then maybe you can educate the nurses about inferior alveolar dental blocks.
not_available What? Doing a study to track patients is the best way to determine how to improve Uh, hey, Tony, can you give my friends here a tour of the rig? Sure thing, Dr.

not_available Yes, he's been called.
not_available Do you have a washroom? Chuny, I'll get that.
not_available You show Mrs.
not_available Beckwith where that is.
not_available Vertical incision.
not_available Come with me, ma'am.
not_available Bring you back when they're done.
not_available Cricoid cartilage to sternal notch.
not_available I'm glad you found time to supervise your Resident.
not_available Cauterize here for the hemostasis.
not_available There's no excuse for what happened earlier.
not_available I was with another patient.
not_available She's less critical.
not_available Not by my assessment.
not_available Then it was wrong.
not_available Ready to divide the thyroid isthmus.
not_available Two Kellys.
not_available Kid with severe head trauma takes priority.
not_available Shouldn't need a nurse to tell you.
not_available Shouldn't need a doctor to explain it's not always clear who the most critical is.
not_available Then next time, you call in a second Attending or get a more senior Resident.
not_available Hey, I'm an R
not_available 4.
not_available I thought I had it.
not_available You and I need to talk in private about which nurses you're willing to work with and not.
not_available That way, this won't have to happen again.
not_available Number 6 Shiley.
not_available Hard to come up with right thing.
not_available People sending Michael loser presents? Well, Pratt thinks he can send him a pizza, and Chuny got him these.
not_available But I meant from me.
not_available Well, what's your current plan? Well, I wrote him a poem.
not_available Are you sure you want me to? Scented.
not_available It rhymes.
not_available Is it too high school? 
not_available Yeah, it's kind of cheesy.
not_available I'm an idiot.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Look, you're his girlfriend, right? Well, I guess, yeah.
not_available Well, Neela, a man at war has certain needs.
not_available You're beginning to sound like Frank.
not_available I get that a lot.
not_available Meet me in the Family Room in 10 minutes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I'm tired of fighting with you.
not_available There's issue between you
not_available It's my job to assess where I'm needed.
not_available I understand that.
not_available As for me and Sam, we're a couple.
not_available I mean, it's not a problem.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Look, normally I try to resolve internal issues as calmly, as civilly, as possible.
not_available And you probably don't understand that, because in this case well, I didn't.
not_available Look, from now on, I'm just gonna focus my attention on determining how the nurses should be utilized.
not_available That sounds good.
not_available Nice.
not_available Don't be so serious.
not_available Try to relax a little bit.
not_available Have some fun.
not_available It just feels too weird.
not_available It's okay, it'll be fine.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, grab those lollipops.
not_available You're kidding, right? No.
not_available Come on.
not_available This guy's asking for you again.
not_available Secret of my success, Chuny, always leave them wanting more.
not_available Done.
not_available Done.
not_available Dead.
not_available And done.
not_available You don't need the bra.
not_available Take it off.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available It'll be fine.
not_available Like this? Nice.
not_available More open.
not_available Oh, I just feel weird.
not_available Do my legs look okay? Yes.
not_available You have the gams of a patriot.
not_available Now, make love to the camera.
not_available That's great! Excellent.
not_available Smile.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Hi.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where's your Roller
not_available date? Lou.
not_available He said he'd come back with pizza and sneakers.
not_available Seems like a sweet guy.
not_available So your lead levels came back critical.
not_available Is that from my treatments? It's probably from the herbs you were taking.
not_available You're gonna need a series of injections, but the anemia should resolve.
not_available More importantly is what you're doing about the BRCA.
not_available What I'm doing? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you hold onto this for a minute? If you like, I could get an oncologist to come down here and talk to you.
not_available No.
not_available I don't want that.
not_available You okay? I saw an oncologist when I first found out.
not_available And what made you get tested? My doctor recommended it, on account of my mother.
not_available Is she positive too? She beat cancer once when I was little, but it came back to get her.
not_available I watched her getting smaller and smaller all winter.
not_available And then, as soon as the leaves began to go green, she passed away.
not_available It was right before my senior prom.
not_available Just 44 years old.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Did the oncologist you spoke with mention anything about prophylactic surgery? You mean having my breasts removed? 
not_available And an oophorectomy.
not_available I'd never do that.
not_available That's why I tried Mexico.
not_available I wanna fall in love.
not_available I wanna have a child, a family, while there's still time.
not_available Then you might wanna consider just the mastectomies.
not_available And wait for the ovarian
not_available Just the mastectomies? Would a man even wanna look at me then? There have been advances in reconstructive surgery.
not_available And you need to protect yourself.
not_available Can you promise me that giving up my breasts would protect me? It would decrease your chance of getting cancer by 90 percent.
not_available And I would lose months of my life to recovery with no guarantees.
not_available And the clock is ticking, and I'm not getting younger.
not_available So tell me which poison to pick.
not_available The cancer risk or the surgery? Well, I can't.
not_available But maybe an oncologist could.
not_available Mr.
not_available Beckwith? 
not_available Are you Doctor? Kovac.
not_available Yeah, please, come with me.
not_available Where is he? Can I see him now? 
not_available I'd like to talk to you about his condition.
not_available Is my wife here? 
not_available She's in with Robbie now.
not_available Is he awake? I wanna see him.
not_available You will, soon.
not_available I told her not to get him that thing.
not_available She's always making me out to be the bad guy, spoiling that kid rotten.
not_available Why don't we go inside so I can explain to you where we're at with Robbie now? I'm not going.
not_available I know why you take people there.
not_available Sir, pleaseNo, my boy is not dead! Robbie? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Beckwith.
not_available Robbie.
not_available Where is he? Sir, can you just calm down? Where is he? Robbie? Robbie! Robbie! 
not_available Mr.
not_available Beckwith! There's swelling in his brain.
not_available We hope it's gonna go down soon.
not_available We had to put an emergency airway in his neck.
not_available Oh, buddy, what did you do? What did you do? I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No! No! Oh, God! Security! 
not_available No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Get off me! Get No.
not_available I didn't want that floor to be without an Attending.
not_available That's all right.
not_available My shift starts in 35 minutes anyway.
not_available Your shift? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Till we get new faculty, it's just you, me and the moonlighters.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available Wife doesn't wanna press charges.
not_available How about you? 
not_available No.
not_available When she leaves the room, we'll let him go inside, see his son.
not_available Hey, that burn victim who went up to ICU, how's he doing? He's hanging in there.
not_available The guy's such a mess, he can't even tell us his name.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available That floor came out of nowhere.
not_available Hey, I signed out to Morris.
not_available He's our minichief, right? 
not_available Just go.
not_available Neela, you Ltrainbound? 
not_available In a minute.
not_available All right, I'll walk out with you.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Found it in Sutures.
not_available It was wrapped in a death
not_available kit shroud.
not_available It's kind of soggy.
not_available Frank, that was for Gallant.
not_available Hey, try Lou Malnati's.
not_available They overnight.
not_available So, Neela, I feel you should know that I minored in photography.
not_available So if there's anything you need a hand
not_available Shut up.
not_available What's he talking about? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Okay, different tack.
not_available As Chief Resident, I think I need to know what you and Abby were doing in that room.
not_available And by know, I mean see.
not_available You know what, Morris? Just because you're so cute.
not_available Sebaceous cyst abscess.
not_available On somebody's ass.
not_available Oh, that was my fat guy in Curtain 2.
not_available Weighing in at an easy 400 pounds.
not_available Looks like it's leaking, Morris.
not_available You might wanna check that out.
not_available I won't have to sleep up here, will I? No, we have a bed for you on the third floor.
not_available We both know what they're gonna say.
not_available The safest thing would be for me to have the double mastectomy.
not_available Well, I know it's a sacrifice but it's not as though you'd have to live without breasts forever.
not_available It won't be the same.
not_available It won't feel like my body.
not_available Well, the things you want, you can't have if you get cancer.
not_available So if you were me, you would do it.
not_available Well, sometimes, we want life to stay the same, but it doesn't it changes, and if I were you, I hope I would be brave enough to change.
not_available Hi, Abby.
not_available Is this Miss Lowenstein? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Dr.
not_available Geary can see you now.
not_available I'll check on you tomorrow.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Someone picking you up? Erica's dropping off Alex.
not_available Heard you had a little throwdown with a patient.
not_available Not a patient.
not_available The scooter kid's father.
not_available Yeah, Robbie.
not_available He was having some purposeful movements.
not_available Yeah.
not_available More than I can say for myself today.
not_available I shouldn't have left him.
not_available It was the wrong thing for the wrong reason.
not_available We'll figure it out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's start again tomorrow, huh? Tell Alex I'll be seeing him for that soccer game tomorrow.
not_available He's gonna be real happy.
not_available Hey.
not_available What, are you off? No, coffee.
not_available I got six more hours.
not_available Hey, walk with me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is something wrong? You're sleeping with him? I was.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's never over, hon.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I don't think it's appropriate for you two to work together.
not_available What? Since I can't control physician shifts 
not_available I guess I gotta rejigger yours.
not_available Rejigger? I took a look at the schedule 
not_available Come on, wait.
not_available and it seems to work out if you work Tuesday and Friday nights and pick up a third shift Saturday or Sunday.
not_available That's two less than I'm doing, which I can't afford, and I'll never see my kid.
not_available I'm doing you a favor.
not_available Doesn't sound like it.
not_available I could do what any manager would do.
not_available How do you feel about ICU or Recovery? 
not_available Geriatrics always has openings.
not_available Threatening to transfer me? I am giving you a choice.
not_available I'm an ER nurse.
not_available Right.
not_available So be here Friday, 
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't you have work? Nope, 48 hours off.
not_available Oh, lucky you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Oh, there's more in the fridge.
not_available Well, who's the other one for? Having a sleepover.
not_available Hi.
not_available I ordered a caesar salad and a root beer.
not_available That should be right out.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, sailor.
not_available New in town? Have a seat.
not_available No, I have to get going.
not_available I took our BRCA lady up to Oncology.
not_available Yeah? It was sad.
not_available She was telling me how she's at this point in her life where she's worried that some of the things she wants she's never gonna have.
not_available She could never imagine feeling that way.
not_available It's sad.
not_available You must miss it.
not_available Drinking.
not_available You'd be a terrible sponsor.
not_available Yeah, I could never give up.
not_available I'd miss it too much.
not_available Well, you might wanna think about suspending it for the evening.
not_available Need a ride home? No, but I think you do.
not_available I do? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available You're not driving like this.
not_available I'm not? Ray, I can't concentrate! 
not_available Help yourself to something.
not_available Wow.
not_available Didn't take you long to embrace the bachelor lifestyle.
not_available No.
not_available It's like riding a horse.
not_available Or living in a barn.
not_available Can't get him out of my head.
not_available Who? That guy.
not_available What a mess.
not_available All melted of flesh, but even so, enough will to keep walking.
not_available Body ruined, but still desperate to live.
not_available And he's alive.
not_available Yeah, I wonder if I If I were hurt like that If you'd keep on walking? If anyone would know who I was.
not_available I would.
not_available Probably.
not_available You know, you might wanna think about getting a housekeeper.
not_available Because it's really disgusting in here.
not_available In a charming sort of way, of course.
not_available Do you want a coffee? You 're watching the movie on WMAQ
not_available TV, Chicago's Channel 5.
not_available Probably don't want a coffee, but I got you a black coffee and It's about time we got out there, huh? There's plenty of time.
not_available Yeah, but they'll be here any damn minute.
not_available I think Sam's right.
not_available We ought to.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What about after? What about after we do it? Hmm? 
not_available What do we do then? Then you live with it.
