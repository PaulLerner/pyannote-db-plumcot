not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't see Dr.
not_available Cooper.
not_available I would've asked Dr.
not_available Morris, but
not_available He's stuck with a patient in 2.
not_available The sprained ankle? Damn it, Morris, I have 30 patients on the rack and 40 in Triage.
not_available A little multitasking on your part would be helpful.
not_available You're not doing that clown any favors by picking up his slack.
not_available Okay, not a single chart's been picked up in the past 45 minutes.
not_available It's called a work ethic, people.
not_available Since when is Weaver on graveyard? God forbid you take a patient the last hour of your shift.
not_available You might stay an extra 20 minutes.
not_available Once a month.
not_available Keeps up her skills.

not_available Eloise, you've been pregnant for seven years, you can wait 10 more minutes.
not_available All right, listen up, listen up.
not_available We're the A team, people.
not_available You know what that means? That means we have exactly 12 hours to clear this place out and show those quacks at the day shift how it's done! Most people are pleased with its lifelike appearance and attention paid to detail
not_available They should've clipped my nails, then.
not_available With a minimum of motion, your own muscle signals will trigger the arm so that
not_available Yeah, I read the brochure.
not_available Let's go.
not_available To bend the arm, simply contract your biceps.
not_available That's it.
not_available Biceps up, triceps down.
not_available Biceps up, triceps down.
not_available They pay you to state the obvious? Okay.
not_available Pausing, as you just did, causes the arm to lock.
not_available How do you unlock it? Well, it requires a quick co
not_available contraction, but that's too advanced for now.
not_available We're not ready to move on to the hand yet.
not_available We don't have to.
not_available How do you put it on? Donning and doffing are complex tasks.
not_available Harness first, or stump in the socket? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, it's late
not_available I want my damn arm, all right? I've waited long enough! Let's go.
not_available Screwy thing is, if I was on welfare, Medicaid would've covered me, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available Now, remember open fractures can lead to gram
not_available negative osteomyelitis which is why we add gentamicin.
not_available Veins are sclerosed.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Ever use IV drugs, Mr.

not_available I was off an hour ago.
not_available Me too.
not_available She hates me, doesn't she? 
not_available Who, Dr.

not_available Thank you.
not_available We got off on the wrong foot, and I'd very much like to remedy that.
not_available What? Dr.
not_available Pratt's a bit of a flirt, of which I'm sure you're well aware but I want you to know, I did nothing to bring it on.
not_available In fact, I think he rather can't help himself.
not_available But if I did anything to worsen the situation, I apologize.
not_available And I hope you wouldn't penalize me over something which I had no control.
not_available Penalize you? 
not_available Be hard on me.
not_available Show me up in front of the others.
not_available Look Neela.
not_available I'm hard on all my med students, especially the women because I have to be, for their own good.

not_available You're a part of something that's in constant motion over there.
not_available Any break from it you get is a luxury not just something to be taken for granted.
not_available And that's different from County how? It's its own addiction, I guess.
not_available Yeah, it certainly hooked Carter.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How are you doing with that? Without him, you mean? I'm fine.
not_available I'm better than fine.
not_available So you're happy? Getting there.

not_available So, what's your point? 
not_available I'm thinking it'll just pass.
not_available In my poop? So that's it, we just wait till it comes out? No, being that he's symptomatic, we call in a specialist

not_available But he needs a chest and AP pelvis.
not_available That'll take a while.
not_available Okay, if CT opens first, we'll have to send him there.
not_available You wanna go when he does? 
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm the only Attending and Pratt's the senior on the floor.
not_available Abby, you go.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available They're young.
not_available They're allowed to be stupid.
not_available No one's allowed to be that stupid, Mr.
not_available Vangoss.
not_available I got bone sticking out of my legs! Six Flags, only better.
not_available Cranial nerves grossly intact.
not_available I have been here six hours! Somebody needs to shut him up.

not_available Is that all she said? No, actually, she said you're an asshole too.
not_available Night.
not_available Wow, it's 1 in the morning.
not_available I guess it's lunchtime.
not_available You gotta try this.
not_available Sure.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Dinuguan.
not_available Oh, yeah? What's that? Cooked pork blood.
not_available Did I ever mention I was half Jewish? Hey, Randi.
not_available I'm still waiting on Ortho for my open
not_available fracture guy.
not_available As soon as they call, tell them
not_available They said you should irrigate him.
not_available They're kind of busy right now.
not_available Nice.
not_available Neela, find Morris and have him supervise you on doing a poor man's washout on Mr.
not_available Mathers.
not_available Any idea where he is? 
not_available No, but that's an 
MSP Med student problem.
not_available I love being an R2.
not_available So, what do you think? 
not_available I think it's a little loud.
not_available If I to stay up, everybody does.
not_available No, he hasn't gone to Radiology yet.

not_available I was 17 when that song first came out.
not_available You probably weren't even born yet.
not_available Oh, I was around.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Hold the door.
not_available We're full, I'm afraid.
not_available Well, I'll catch the next one.
not_available He's cute.
not_available Did you guys ever get together? 
not_available Who? Dorset.
not_available Didn't he ask you out or something? I suppose you could say we're dating.
not_available Really.
not_available What? What? 
not_available What? You think it's too soon? I didn't say that.
not_available I think it's too soon.
not_available I just said he was cute.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Too soon.
not_available You're not too good at this, are you? It should start to feel numb soon.
not_available What the hell is that stuff? 
not_available Sterile saline, washes the germs out.
not_available And you're just now getting around to this? We thought you'd be in the O.R.
not_available by now.
not_available This will buy us an extra hour or two.
not_available Before what? Neela, what do you think you're doing? 
not_available Temporary washout.
not_available Which is not a procedure a med student performs without Resident supervision.
not_available Great, she's not even a doctor? Stop what you're doing and tell me who the Resident is on this case.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, but he asked Dr.
not_available Morris to supervise on his behalf.
not_available And where's Dr.
not_available Morris? I'm surrounded by incompetence.
not_available Hey, how do you think I feel? This one's been trying to kill me all night.
not_available No mass, no hemorrhage, normal ventricles, no shift.
not_available So he's clear? 
not_available Crystal.
not_available Hey, Mr.
not_available Gamble, your head CT looks good.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available So, what do I do now? I've arranged for you to speak with one of our mental
not_available health specialists.
not_available I'm not crazy.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available You're just stressed
not_available Then give me something for that, but don't send me to a shrink.
not_available God, the last thing I need is for Gloria to have proof I'm nuts.
not_available Pratt, dislocated patella.
not_available COPD exacerbation.
not_available I&amp;D; on a pilonidal cyst.
not_available And don't pass these off on that idiot Morris.
not_available I know you think I'm a wuss
not_available Mr.
not_available Gamble, I don't have time
not_available Just give me something to get me through the night.
not_available Hey, I want you to give Ed here 
not_available and discharge him.
not_available Obecalp? You know what obecalp is? Yes, doctor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Whatever works, right? Erika.
not_available What does DNR mean? It stands for "do not resuscitate.
not_available " Which means someone doesn't want to be kept alive by machines if they should get very sick.
not_available Let's get you back to the other room where you can rest.
not_available Can I stay here? She says she sleeps better with me.
not_available Sure.
not_available Good night.
not_available Night.
not_available I'm glad you have time for a Kodak moment.
not_available I know I sure as hell don't.
not_available We still got 20 on the board and 35 in Triage.
not_available Sorry.
not_available She's by herself here.
not_available It's hard, isn't it? Learning where your time is best spent whether it's with the patient or their family.
not_available You know, that's really rough.
not_available Now, if you're done playing house, do an I&amp;D; on Mr.
not_available Brier's pilonidal cyst.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available He's tough, but he's got the goods, you know? Yeah.
not_available Hey, have you ever heard of obecalp? Because I can't find it in the PDR.
not_available It's "placebo" spelled backwards.
not_available Who's prescribing it? Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Obecalp? Look, the guy's playing games with his wife.
not_available He gets panicky whenever I mention Psych and he begs me to give him something to calm his nerves.
not_available So I give him saline.
not_available And it looks like he feels a lot better.
not_available No harm, no foul.
not_available Ever hear of truth
not_available telling? Deceptive practices? Not only have you breached every principle of medical ethics you've also opened us up to a lawsuit if this patient finds out.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, your MVA guy is crashing in CT.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Severa, I guess we better pull the plug on Mr.
not_available Gamble's obecalp.
not_available I never gave it to him.
not_available Doctor, how long before my son is taken care of? Your son? 
not_available Damian, the quarter? Right, right.
not_available Well, it looks like the Gl doctor who performs the procedure won't be able to see him till the morning.
not_available When in the morning? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available But he's stable, and I don't see a problem.
not_available We've been here for 14 hours.
not_available No one's done a damn thing.
not_available Damian's scared to death.
not_available She needs to get to bed.
not_available We all do.
not_available I know it's hard
not_available This is an emergency room.
not_available There's a quarter in my son's throat.
not_available He can't breathe.
not_available That's an emergency, isn't it? What happened? He got altered and his sats drifted down.
not_available Did you finish the scan? 
not_available No.
not_available How long has he been down? 
not_available Under five minutes.
not_available Let's tube him.
not_available Pulmonary edema? More than likely.
not_available Okay, stop compressions.
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available Never, never send an even slightly unstable patient to CT without a doctor.
not_available You told me to bring him
not_available I'm talking to me.
not_available I'm in.
not_available You coming? Pratt's trying the old Foley trick.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah, that's what's so cool.
not_available Okay, Foley and a 2 Mack blade.
not_available All right, sats is 96, BP steady.
not_available All right, come on.
not_available Okay, so now what we wanna do is put this tube just past the quarter.
not_available And once we do that we're gonna blow up the little balloon with saline and hopefully pull the quarter back into his mouth.
not_available Couldn't he aspirate the quarter into his lungs? Not if I grab it first.
not_available Now, here's the tricky part.
not_available Okay.
not_available And Presto.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Here.
not_available One for the piggy bank.
not_available Oh, Abby, you're back.
not_available Can you cover for Melinda in Triage? Sure.
not_available Love to.
not_available Triage is my personal favorite.
not_available Thanks for asking.
not_available Where's Weaver? The bars are closing.
not_available We're gonna get slammed.
not_available She's still in CT, which means the R2s are in charge, and that scares me.
not_available You and me, man.
not_available All right, let's get the party started.
not_available You, come on.
not_available Come show me some love.
not_available Come here.
not_available Please tell me it's not just 3.
not_available Shut the hell up! How's anybody supposed to sleep around here?! Yo, Abby, any time now.
not_available Okay, where we at?

not_available This is Jay Jay.
not_available He has a toothache.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Jay Jay, how you feeling? 
not_available Tooth hurts.
not_available When did you first notice it? About a year ago.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available I'll be right with you.
not_available No, we've already been seen.
not_available My son was feeling a little queasy.
not_available It might just be the anesthesia, but could you get Dr.
not_available Pratt to maybe? 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Pratt! Damian? 
not_available Here, help me lie him down.
not_available What did he come in for? 
not_available He swallowed a quarter.
not_available Blood looks arterial.
not_available Page Surgery and Vascular.
not_available Aortoesophageal fistula? 
not_available Pratt, I need you at Curtain 1.
not_available Not now.
not_available Get a gurney.
not_available Watch your back.
not_available What's going on? Probable aortoesophageal fistula after a foreign
not_available body removal.
not_available You did endoscopy? 
not_available I used a Foley.
not_available Are you out of your mind? 
not_available It worked fine.
not_available The quarter was in there too long.
not_available After he was discharged, this happened.
not_available We'll take it from here.
not_available Trans
not_available esophageal erosion needs immediate aortic repair.
not_available Not all ER Residents can walk on water.
not_available You're lucky this happened while they were still here otherwise this boy would be dead.
not_available Add five of PEEP once he's on a vent.
not_available Andy, what did the NG aspirate show on Maloney? 
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available Let me find out.
not_available Pratt! 
not_available Lungs clear.
not_available Let's get some O2 and check a D
not_available stick.
not_available Watch it.
not_available Syncopal episode? Only groans with a sternal rub.
not_available We were ready to go, then he slumped to the floor.
not_available Let's get him on the bed.
not_available One, two, three, up.
not_available All right, put him on a monitor and get me some vitals.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available I thought he was kidding.
not_available Pupils asymmetric, mild ptosis.
not_available He was fine other than being a nut case.
not_available Young, healthy guy with transient loss of speech.
not_available SonoSite.
not_available And a negative CT.
not_available Turn that damn music off! Listen, man, I got this.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Any risk factors for stroke? 
not_available No.
not_available Decreased tone on the right.
not_available Oh, my God, he had a stroke? 
not_available Call CT.
not_available Have them clear a room.
not_available I think I have something here.
not_available This is my patient.
not_available It might be a carotid dissection.
not_available Let me see that.
not_available Tapering occlusion of the left carotid.
not_available What is that? Your husband has a tear in one of his main arteries, it caused a clot.
not_available Your open
not_available fracture patient demands to be euthanized.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mathers is still here? 
not_available I got your back on this.
not_available Get consent for TPA, 0.9 migs per kig.
not_available Okay, that's enough of Triage.
