
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available Our goal is to enroll 200 donor
not_available recipient pairs.
not_available By mixing and matching, we'd find kidneys for almost 50% of them.
not_available Ask me again.
not_available Ask me to marry you.
not_available I don't know what happened If it is what I think, it scares the hell out of me.
not_available She's yours,Tony.
not_available Is it possible? Crisis of conscience Oh,crap! What time is it? I don't want to stay over.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No,it's not okay.
not_available We agreed that it was too soon for Sarah to deal with this.
not_available Sleep in for another hour.
not_available She won't even know you're here.
not_available Well,when are you going to tell her? Tell her what? Come on.
not_available I don't even know if it's true.
not_available Well,you will be if you do the test.
not_available What am I supposed to do? "Hey,can I have some of your DNA? I want to find out if I'm your father"? What if I'm not?I don't want to mess with the kid's head.
not_available Why,are you afraid to find out? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe the actual biology doesn't matter anyway,huh? Of course it does.
not_available You want something to eat before you go? No,I'm fine.
not_available Some juice? 
not_available We don't have any.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Did we wake you? No,I couldn't sleep.
not_available I'm just leaving.
not_available You don't have to sneak out.
not_available She's not sneaking out.
not_available She's going to work.
not_available And I'm late.
not_available I'll page you later? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I made coffee.
not_available Since when do you drink coffee? Since we ran out of juice.
not_available Oh.
not_available Give me some.
not_available Sorry,I meant to go to the store.
not_available I just You know,if you want me to, I can do all the cooking and the shopping and cleaning.
not_available If you did that, when would you do your homework and talk to boys on the phone and text? It's called multitasking.
not_available Since it is plainly ludicrous to page a surgeon at 6:15 in the morning for something as silly as Tylenol, the only conceivable explanation I have for your call is that you have a crush on me.
not_available I'm flattered.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good
not_available bye.
not_available Who was that? This new ICU nurse.
not_available She's useless.
not_available Someone needs to show her the ropes.
not_available Did you say "ropes"? Jane,come on.
not_available I have to round soon.
not_available FYI? This is my last night in the call room.
not_available The prosthetics lab could be fun.
not_available No,we're through with hospital kink.
not_available We're staying at your place next time.
not_available Whoa,whoa,whoa.
not_available No,we can't.
not_available I I know,I know,you have no bed,you sleep on the couch,your sink is clogged, this pathetic "I work all the time, so my place is a rat hole" thing is not going to fly anymore.
not_available What? Yeah,you're going to clean up your apartment and buy a proper bed today.
not_available Jane,just because you want to stay at my place Hey,it's been three months,okay? Upgrade the sleeping arrangements 
not_available or you will be punished.
not_available Ooh.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's tradition, a symbol.
not_available Yeah,a symbol of the wedding industrial complex.
not_available No,I'll wear a ring.
not_available I want to wear a ring, you just have to abide by my ring policy.
not_available Your ring policy? Yeah,if one of us loses our wedding ring, we replace the ring immediately and give the new ring full status.
not_available You're going to lose it? Well,I don't know,if something happens to the ring, and everybody freaks out like the marriage is doomed.
not_available But a simple gold band would be very nice.
not_available Now we're getting somewhere.
not_available So do you think we should make an announcement or just tell people individually and let it trickle out? Uh,is it all right if we wait a while? Really? Why? When
not_available when you tell people you're getting married, they start asking a million questions about a wedding, and marriage is not about wedding.
not_available Like it's not about ring.
not_available Let's just enjoy this for a while, the two of us,okay? That's fine.
not_available A secret engagement will be fun.
not_available All right,Jane, you take the boob rash and,Ray,you get the bounty hunter with the gout.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac returns.
not_available Nice seeing you again,man.
not_available You,too.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available It was weird here without you.
not_available What's that? A rat died in the air vent.
not_available There's a cleaning crew up there.
not_available Hey,did you really squash your own hand in a vise? I mean,'cause, wow,that's Need a doc here.
not_available Jane,why don't we take this? seizures.
not_available You,take the bus.
not_available Something bad's going to happen on the El today.
not_available I upped my meds,butbut
not_available but the seizures won't stop.
not_available Well,you're not seizing now.
not_available No,yes,yes,I am.
not_available I
not_available I two milligrams of Ativan should take care of it.
not_available Sir,you're sitting up and you're talking to me.
not_available You're not having a seizure.
not_available Can we not stop here? We're about to transfer you.
not_available Yeah,but can you just move me back at all here? Just be patient.
not_available Move me now,please?! 
not_available All right,all right.
not_available ER Season 13 Episode 16 Lily's sick, Marquez is out on vacation, and the rest of us are doing doubles trying to cover all their shifts.
not_available This is why nurses quit and burn out.
not_available Shortage just keeps getting worse.
not_available What about your boy ***? Uh,he was lured to a hospital in Minneapolis.
not_available New cars for nurses willing to stay six months.
not_available Cool with that? What,I got left for a Camry? Nah,it's a good gig.
not_available I can't blame him.
not_available Anna Hayes,39,vomiting and altered mental status.
not_available Tachy to 120, sats 92 on room air.
not_available This your mom? Yeah.
not_available I could barely wake her up this morning.
not_available Ms.
not_available Hayes, I'm Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available Can you open your eyes for me,please? Please,just take me home.
not_available No,you need oxygen and fluids.
not_available Wait,is she going to be all right? Honey,I'm fine.
not_available Ma'am,you're not fine, you're severely dehydrated, but we're going to help you with that.
not_available Access? blew.
not_available Sam? Trauma One's open.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available Hey,Jeff,what's up? I think we have something that belongs to you.
not_available Alex,what happened? Okay,Mr.
not_available Brewer, let's get you hooked up.
not_available Yeah,okay.
not_available You're not going to need that.
not_available You're not going to need that? No? No,these are temporal lobe seizures,okay? I never have any cardiac or respiratory symptoms.
not_available Okay,well,we'll just hook you up to be safe.
not_available If you haven't noticed, my
not_available my,uh,seizures are unusual.
not_available I get hunches,premonitions, that sort of thing.
not_available Nothing ever shows up on the heart monitor.
not_available I see.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh,here comes another one.
not_available I'm sensing bacon and eggs.
not_available There you go,okay? So can you just give me the Ativan and I'll be out of your hair? I'm sorry,but I just think anybody could have made that prediction,Mr.
not_available Brewer.
not_available Look,I know that,uh,it looks like I'm making this stuff up just so I can get drugs but that's not what's going on,okay? Can you call my neurologist? He'll back me up.
not_available Did you get what you want,Alex? Huh? A couple bags of quarters? You know what? You can be in jail right now.
not_available It's not anything like they're saying,okay? Officer Greenberg is going to take you home.
not_available I'm going to call you every half hour.
not_available You don't answer that phone, we got a problem.
not_available Mom,it's not my fault.
not_available Of course,it's not,it never is.
not_available Mom,please, just listen to me.
not_available I have to go back to work.
not_available I'll talk to you tonight.
not_available Thank you very much,Jeff.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's up with Alex? He knocked off a Laundromat near his school.
not_available Ah I'll get better faster at home,really.
not_available Mom,you're sick,okay? We're not leaving.
not_available She hates hospitals.
not_available Oh,but this is County.
not_available This is nice here.You get organic food and room massage.
not_available We have ice sculptures.
not_available You're going to love it here.
not_available All right,she needs coags.
not_available She's oozing around the needle.
not_available Pulse up to 125.
not_available You know,when you were four years old, our neighbor fell off that ladder and they brought him here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Madsen? Oh,he was such a grouch.
not_available He was always yelling at you and your brother for playing too loud.
not_available But when you found out he was sick, you wanted to visit him.
not_available Systolic's only 84.
not_available She needs access,Gates.
not_available I'm trying,Sam.She's clamping down.
not_available One more try and I'll go central.
not_available You stood up on your chair and you stuck your favorite toy turtle in bed with him,and you said anybody who was sick, needed a toy turtle.
not_available She's making this up.
not_available No,no,I made a lot of mistakes,son, but you were the one thing I got right.
not_available All right,I'm in,Sam.
not_available Let's get the fluids up.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Morning,Neela.
not_available Ready to round? Uh,sorry.
not_available Shoot, I need five more minutes.
not_available I overslept.I never oversleep.
not_available Is that a yoga mat? Yeah,there's an Ashtanga class in the anesthesia conference room.
not_available You should check it out.
not_available Nurses station,five minutes.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Uh,hello,good morning.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Manish? Hi.
not_available Uh,this is the doctor I was telling you about.
not_available I'm Emily.
not_available I've heard a lot about you.
not_available What are you doing here? Uh,well,I was 
not_available Saving my life.
not_available I was giving a talk about the paired exchange program at a dialysis center in Evanston He was really impressive.
not_available He gave us all hope.
not_available And there were all these people there,and they were just waiting and suffering and it inspired me.
not_available To donate your kidney? You ran screaming from a blood drive.
not_available Well,I was moved by their stories.
not_available We've worked together every day for the past month.
not_available How come you never said anything? 'Cause I thought that I'd chicken out.
not_available I've been on dialysis for six years, on the UNOS list for five.
not_available I'd just about given up when,boom, Manish walks into my life.
not_available Got tested,turns out I'm a good match.
not_available Wow.
not_available Amazing,right? It's like right out of a movie or something.
not_available What's your differential? Infectious hepatitis is at the top of my list.
not_available Sent viral titers.
not_available Good.
not_available What else? Hepato
not_available renal syndrome, vascular disorder, autoimmune, alcoholic hepatitis.
not_available But my mom doesn't drink.
not_available Oh,we're just running through the possibilities.
not_available Here,Luka,Jane's tibia fractures got compartment syndrome
not_available ortho's MIA.
not_available What about toxic ingestions? Acetaminophen,poison mushrooms? Tox screen's negative, acetaminophen's zero.
not_available Okay,get a CT and notify nephrology and GI.
not_available Sam,come with me.
not_available Is there,uh,is there anyone else you want to be here? My other son's at work.
not_available Don't bother him.
not_available Oh,I think he should be here.
not_available Is it close? He's a repair guy over at Begley's Appliances.
not_available My mom works there,too.
not_available It's just the stomach flu.
not_available Don't bother Nick.
not_available It's a little more serious.
not_available Why don't you go out to the front desk.
not_available The clerk will help you call your brother.
not_available It's all right,honey.
not_available Go.
not_available It's out there to the left.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You're scaring him.
not_available You're in acute liver failure,ma'am.
not_available This
not_available this is a little scary.
not_available Did you hear what I said? This is serious.
not_available You could die.
not_available I heard you.
not_available Do you have any questions? No.
not_available Manish nearly fainted the other day when I was drawing blood.
not_available Now he's giving his kidney to someone he barely just met.
not_available Isn't that a little strange? No,everyone goes through some kind of a mini
not_available life crisis in their 20s.
not_available He's far from family,he's unattached, he's unsure about career, he's drifting, he's looking for purpose.
not_available Some people donate kidneys, others end up working at the Jumbo Mart.
not_available Who are we to judge? Neela,what are you doing? I came down to see the volvulus case.
not_available But you're supposed to be covering the post
not_available op floor.
not_available You done with all those dressing changes? Well,not all of them,no.
not_available Okay,I'm going to leave you kids to work this out.
not_available I'll be in Curtain Three.
not_available You,upstairs,shoo.
not_available Well What is this? A consult note.
not_available I said black ink today.
not_available Only black.
not_available Oh What color is this? 
not_available Eh,blue.Oops.
not_available Hey,Mayday.
not_available How's it going? Well,my attending thinks I'm a complete idiot, and Crenshaw's back to being a little bitch.
not_available Hey,most hepatic toxins take a few days to destroy the liver,right? Yeah.
not_available So,theoretically, you could trash your liver, but by the time you become symptomatic, the toxin couldn't be detected in the blood.
not_available I suppose.
not_available Hmm.
not_available I'll page you later.
not_available Ms.
not_available Hayes? Anna.
not_available Anna What's a young,healthy woman with no medical history doing with fulminant liver failure? Aren't you the doctor? You got a family, 40 good years ahead of you.
not_available Yet when I told you,you might die,you hardly reacted.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess we all have our own way of dealing with bad news.
not_available Huh.
not_available You know,I used to be a paramedic for ten years before I became a doctor.
not_available Young healthy patients,no matter how religious,mellow,Zen they were they don't want to die.
not_available Something kicks in
not_available instinct.
not_available Maybe I've just been too tired to cry.
not_available You seem depressed.
not_available Let's say someone wanted to kill themselves without anyone knowing it was suicide.
not_available You know,there's a whole class of chemicals that can damage the liver just days after they're ingested.
not_available Please.
not_available I just want to go to sleep now.
not_available Fuels and solvents found in refrigerators, dryers,cleaning products.
not_available Stuff you'd have access to every day at your job.
not_available Come on,Anna,tell me what you took so I can help you.
not_available Your sons deserve to have you around.
not_available They're all grown up now.
not_available I know I'm right about this.
not_available Propane? Kerosene?Carbon tetrachloride? What? Tell me.
not_available I hear if you mix it with juice, it's got quite a kick.
not_available Everything okay? Anna?!Anna?!! Everything's back to normal with you and Luka? Uh,I don't know if I'd say normal, but they're good.
not_available How's things with you and Katey? 
not_available Uh,she's great.Really great.
not_available But? But nothing.
not_available She's awesome.
not_available Our friend's hurt.
not_available Help! Don't move so fast.
not_available Come on,you're tough.
not_available Please don't make me walk.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Come on,guys, give her a break.
not_available I got her.
not_available Get a gurney over here please.
not_available Are you a doctor? 
not_available We both are.
not_available Okay,what happened? They were doing a formation called layer cake.
not_available Most schools do three layers and we do five.
not_available Tasha fell all the way from the top.
not_available Wow,four layer fall,huh? I need this kiddo back in action for the Great Lakes Regionals.
not_available Okay,Tasha,let's go.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still V tach.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Gates,I got poison control on the line.
not_available All right,put them on speakerphone.
not_available Wh What's this about? 
not_available Okay,she's on.
not_available Possible carbon tetrachloride overdose.
not_available Fulminant liver and kidney failure.
not_available Why the hell didn't you say anything about this before? It was just a hunch.
not_available When did the exposure occur? Unclear.
not_available Transaminases in 2,000 range.
not_available It's too late.Nothing to offer other than supportive measures.
not_available Nothing to offer? No.
not_available If it's carbon tet,the damage to the liver has already been done.
not_available I'm afraid that's right.
not_available Cell death is irreversible at this point.
not_available All right,thanks.
not_available Epi's in,fourth dose.
not_available Another hundred of lido and recheck the K.
not_available Wh why were you withholding patient history? I wasn't sure.
not_available She didn't fully admit it.
not_available Charging to 360.
not_available Where'd her son go? He's out at the front desk trying to bet ahold of his brother.
not_available Well,he better find him fast.
not_available All right,clear.
not_available I don't think I could do something like this for a stranger.
not_available So,maybe it bothers me that you can.
not_available Look,Emily's parents are too old to be donors.
not_available She's getting sicker every day.You would have done the same thing.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You're a better person.
not_available I'm not a better person,Neela.
not_available I'd be too worried about time lost from work,complications.
not_available I don't mean to be negative, but you have to at least consider the possibility of bleeding,infection I've considered it.
not_available We've all considered it.
not_available It's covered.
not_available Covered? Manish Look,it wasn't my intent, it wasn't why I agreed, but they offered, they insisted actually.
not_available Manish,no.
not_available Just listen,okay? First I refused.
not_available But then I started thinking what $50,000 could do for my family.
not_available Stop.
not_available I don't want to hear any more.
not_available Look,when I was 14,my parents sent me here to live with a distant cousin.
not_available I went to school, I learned English,I played baseball, while my sisters sewed shirts for two dollars a day in Mumbai.
not_available I understand you feel guilty.
not_available Yeah,well,with $50,000, I could hire an immigration lawyer.
not_available I can get my whole family over here.
not_available My parents could get proper health care.
not_available My sisters could get a proper education.
not_available Emily's family is wealthy.
not_available It's no hardship for them.
not_available So why not? Because people don't sell their body parts in this country,period.
not_available Not to mention the fact that you could put our whole transplant program in jeopardy.
not_available Nobody needs to know.
not_available But I know,Manish.
not_available I don't understand why you told me, but if you were looking to clear your conscience, I can't help you there.
not_available Of all people,I would think that you would understand.
not_available Well,I don't understand.
not_available I don't.
not_available And I kind of resent the assumption that I should.
not_available You can't do this, Manish,I'm sorry.
not_available No deformities, no step
not_available offs.
not_available We have this one cheer, it's so cool.
not_available It's called paper dolls.
not_available Yeah,it's our signature formation.
not_available It's like a college level routine.
not_available Pulse is in the 120s, and the hemacue is dropping.
not_available That would be because she's bleeding into her belly.
not_available I have fluid here.
not_available We've got the All
not_available Cheer Regionals coming up next week.
not_available I've been driving them too hard.
not_available The outer flyers have their outside hand in the half "Y," and the other hand grabs hold of the middle flyer.
not_available That's me.
not_available And the ending is really cute.
not_available Sounds great.
not_available Liter of warm salinewide open, and call for O
not_available neg.
not_available Make sure surgery knows to get down here.
not_available Oh,my God,surgery? If we don't have a middle flyer for the competition, 
not_available we are so screwed.
not_available Watch it,girls.
not_available Why don't we worry less about the competition and more about your friend,okay? I'll get the infuser.
not_available Do you guys have any warm saline? 
not_available There's LR in the oven.
not_available K is 7.2.
not_available Amp of D
not_available 50 and ten units of insulin.
not_available Her nose is bleeding.
not_available Her coags are through the roof.
not_available Oh,my God,she wasn't like this when I left.
not_available Her condition changed quickly.
not_available Without a functioning liver, toxins start to accumulate in the blood.
not_available She's in an abnormal heart rhythm.
not_available She isn't getting enough blood to her brain and body.
not_available We're doing CPR, and giving her medications, but she's just not responding.
not_available But can't you just do something to fix her liver? Once the cells have died, there's little we can do,Evan.
not_available So is this it, or what? We're breathing and compressing her heart for her, but your mother's body is shutting down.
not_available Anything you guys want to say? No,Mom,okay? This isn't happening.
not_available This can't be happening.
not_available Please don't go.
not_available One more round for the kids? 
not_available Don't let her die.
not_available Sam.
not_available All right,clear.
not_available Whoa,wait a minute.
not_available She's got a pulse.
not_available Sinus rhythm.
not_available I don't understand, is she dying or not? Her heart is beating, but her brain was deprived of oxygen for a long time.
not_available It's very likely that she suffered serious brain injury.
not_available Wow.
not_available She can't even die right.
not_available Pressure's stabilized after two liters, but her crit's still dropping, and did I mention I hate cheerleaders? I hate clowns.
not_available I heard Gates was afraid of folksingers.
not_available Really? Two plus guarding with rebound on the left.
not_available Could be a splenic rupture.
not_available Neela,you writing this down? Yes,Dr.
not_available Crenshaw, I am.
not_available How do you stand this? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm like a battered child.
not_available I just keep coming back for more.
not_available All right,let's bring her up to whatever OR is open.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko will meet you there.
not_available Okay,girls,Tasha's going to surgery now.
not_available Everyone say good
not_available bye and wish her luck.
not_available I'm really sorry you need surgery and everything,Tash.
not_available But you should know that we'll have to replace you for All
not_available Cheer.
not_available Where's my mom? Hey,she sacrificed her spleen for you guys.
not_available Show some respect.
not_available It's going to be okay.I'll explain everything as we go.
not_available Am I going to have a big scar? 
not_available Not if we can help it.
not_available Let me tell you something about Mom 
not_available Don't talk like that,okay? She's not going to die.
not_available This is the best idea she's had in a long time.
not_available You don't mean that.
not_available This is your mother we're talking about.
not_available You don't know the first thing about my mother.
not_available I know that she's barely alive, and I know you guys should be in there instead of out here fighting in the hall.
not_available Sorry,I just don't care.
not_available Why do you hate her so much? Ever since Dad died,all she does is try to make us happy.
not_available Happy,right.
not_available By gambling on the Internet all day? 
not_available It helps her relax.
not_available Shut up! She started out with a few dollars on poker.
not_available And by the end of the year, she'd lost everything.
not_available The crummy cars,the savings from our dad.
not_available She has a problem.
not_available When they stopped giving her credit, she took out more cards in our name and racked up more debt.
not_available $80,000,Evan.We got to live with that now.
not_available She was trying to get help.
not_available Stop making excuses for her! The house is in foreclosure, Evan.
not_available Next week,you're going to be homeless.
not_available All right,she may be screwed up, but she's your mother.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available It's not.
not_available Can I get your advice on something? 
not_available Yeah,of course.
not_available Well,let's say I knew a really nice person about to do a pretty bad thing.
not_available But this bad thing had really good consequences for a bunch of people.
not_available You don't need my advice.
not_available Yes,I do.
not_available No,no,'cause you have like this ethical alarm system hardwired into your brain.Makes you a self
not_available righteous pain in the ass, but it's one of the best things about you.
not_available But if I tell what I know, it's going to mess things up for a whole bunch of people.
not_available They'll get over it.
not_available It will be a major betrayal.
not_available Uh,do the right thing,Neela.
not_available That's all I'm saying.
not_available Is this where I'm having my operation? Yep.
not_available The ORs are straight ahead.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available I know.
not_available But we're going to take good care of you.
not_available My stomach Hey,we'll get you more pain medication when we get to pre
not_available op.
not_available No.
not_available That's not it.
not_available Is it your mom? We won't start until she gets here.
not_available I didn't fall from the top of the formation.
not_available You didn't? The other girlsthey did this.
not_available They didi this to me.
not_available New cheerleaders are forced to submit to ten minutes in an equipment closet in their gym.
not_available The newbie just takes it while her teammates do whatever they want.
not_available Tasha got kicked in the stomach till she started coughing up blood.
not_available I trust the authorities have been notified.
not_available Ray's on it.
not_available Good.
not_available Lucien,there's something else I need to talk to you about.
not_available Sure.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Can it wait? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Well,it's going to have to.
not_available Our cases are completely backed up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Oh,Dr.
not_available Kovac, you really must see this.
not_available This is,uh Fred and Brenda.
not_available Neurovascular symptoms after a Handfasting Ceremony.
not_available A what? 
not_available It's a Wiccan wedding.
not_available The guests bound our wrists with cords.
not_available It's where the expression "tie the knot" comes from.
not_available These are really strong.
not_available Braided to be tough, like our marriage bond.
not_available Regular scissors didn't work, and the knots were too tight to undo.
not_available I can't feel my fingers.
not_available And I can't move my thumb.
not_available Is a Wiccan ceremony recognized by the state? No.
not_available We have to get married at the courthouse so I can put Fred on my insurance.
not_available They don't recognize us because we don't believe in mating for life.
not_available Oh,you don't? We are betrothed for one year and one day.
not_available To be reevaluated at the end of that period.
not_available Yeah,well,it does seem like "till death" is kind of extreme.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just Judeo
not_available Christian bullcrap.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available We're getting married,and all those things are on our minds.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Just slipped out.
not_available Uh okay.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Um,all right,um I'll be right back,okay? What,the first people we tell are strangers? Wiccans? I just felt like saying it.
not_available Hey,Abby,have you seen the cheerleading coach? She's outside practicing with the girls.
not_available Oops.
not_available When tissues are deprived of oxygen for a long time, they produce acids,so we're giving her medicine for that.
not_available How long can she live like this? Weeks.
not_available Months.
not_available It's hard to tell.
not_available But it's just a matter of time,right? I mean,if you want to help us,don't prolong this.
not_available She's not suffering.
not_available Evan and I are going to have to be responsible for her.
not_available We're the only close family she has.
not_available We're alone.It's too much.
not_available I understand.
not_available Social worker will call you.
not_available We have programs.
not_available There's a support group.
not_available Please.
not_available We've been through enoug She's been having runs of V tach.
not_available Forget the lido drip.
not_available What,you want amiodarone? No.
not_available Why prolong the inevitable? That's not your call to make.
not_available Oh,come on,Sam,we both know how this ends.
not_available Why put her boys through it? She's a full code.
not_available We don't know the extent of her injuries.
not_available We gave her CPR for 40 minutes.
not_available Her brain is fried.
not_available Another run of ten.
not_available Sam,your little raver is having a dystonic reaction to Haldol.
not_available It's cool.
not_available Go.
not_available The lido is hanging and the infuser is set.
not_available If she has another run, start the drip,okay? Page Dr.
not_available Kovac and tell him his patient in Trauma One is coding.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You heard what happened last year.
not_available My girls are not staying in the same motel as the football team.
not_available I need to talk to you about Tasha.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Get off the phone.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Tasha's injuries were not caused by a fall.
not_available What do you mean? I saw her hit the ground.
not_available She was forced into a closet, and then she was beaten by the other girls.
not_available What? My girls would never Come on! Don't do this! She knows you know.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available Tasha's sensitive.
not_available Never really fit in with the others.
not_available What she's referring to is just a little team
not_available building exercise we do.
not_available They ripped open her spleen.
not_available That's not little.
not_available And I definitely wouldn't consider that team
not_available building.
not_available My girls are regional champions.
not_available They're under a lot of pressure.
not_available Why don't you save the excuses for these guys,all right? Mom,I don't care what happened.
not_available I don't care about the money.
not_available Just please don't go.
not_available Another mig of epi.
not_available Charged to 360.
not_available Clear.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available What were you thinking? Why didn't you talk to me? Lido isn't going to change the outcome.
not_available I thought you'd agree.
not_available Yeah,well, we work together here,Gates.
not_available Clear! I'll be right back.
not_available Gates,you can't leave in the middle of a code.
not_available The kid should be in here.
not_available Gates! Hey! What do you want? Look,I know you're angry, and I know you got screwed.
not_available You don't know anything.
not_available I know your dad died, and your mom messed up.
not_available It ain't fair.
not_available No,it isn't.
not_available But your mom is dying.
not_available And I know you care.
not_available Because,if you didn't,you wouldn't be out here sulking in the hall.
not_available You go in there and you forgive your mother right now.
not_available I can't.
not_available Nick,you have one shot at being with your mother while she's dying.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Save a cheerleader, save the world.
not_available Lucien,I still need to talk to you about that thing.
not_available Well,make it quick.
not_available Manish is on the table, everyone's waiting.
not_available Well,that's what it's about.
not_available Emily paid Manish for his kidney.
not_available That's ridiculous.He knows better.
not_available Well,it's true.He told me.
not_available He was screened by psych.
not_available They would have picked this up.
not_available Well,they didn't.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's wrong,and could jeopardize the whole transplant program.
not_available All right.
not_available All right,Neela.
not_available All right,well,look.
not_available Just as an exercise, consider this.
not_available There are over 65,000 people on the UNOS list waiting for kidneys.
not_available Can we really rely on voluntary altruism to solve this problem? What are you saying? 
not_available What am I saying? Well,when somebody donates a kidney, the recipient obviously benefits,right? Hospitals make money.
not_available The surgeons get paid.
not_available The donor who gives up a kidney gets flowers and a handshake.
not_available Am I right? Are you kidding? So many sick people, so few organs.
not_available Why not let market forces sort out the imbalance? Because people aren't commodities.
not_available We don't live in a world where it's all right for rich people to buy body parts from those less fortunate.
not_available Hey,it's legal to rent out your uterus, or to harvest your eggs for money.
not_available You can get paid to donate sperm.
not_available How is this different? All I know is thata dying girl is going to get a new kidney today.
not_available Then what happens to the 65,000 others who can't afford to buy one? Ancef will be ready to run soon.
not_available Quick question.
not_available Why are you doing this? Excuse me? Why are you giving this girl your kidney? I guess I've been inspired by the work that we do here.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available And you would never dream of jeopardizing everything by doing something stupid and illegal,would you? What are you talking about? You know exactly what he's talking about.
not_available Okay,Emily wanted to give me money, but I turned her down after talking to Neela.
not_available Money was never part of the reason why I wanted to do any of this.
not_available Lucien,he's just saying what he knows you need to hear.
not_available She's obviously made up her mind about me.
not_available I don't know what else to say.
not_available All right.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Neela,let's go scrub.
not_available No.
not_available I won't be a part of this.
not_available Fine.
not_available Shirley,have Crenshaw get me a surgeon who actually wants to operate.
not_available You get out of here Nella,now.
not_available The tornado was hard to see against the background, so I painted it black.
not_available I was going to put some lights in the bottom, but I ran out of time.
not_available Wow,that should look really,really cool.
not_available Sam.
not_available Yeah,and I fell down the stairs at school and it broke.
not_available That's not the only thing you broke.
not_available I know
not_available I broke my tibia and my fibula.
not_available Can you fix it fast? 
not_available I can fix you up in about an hour.
not_available An hour?! I'll never have time to finish my tornado before the end of the science fair.
not_available Hey,did you know that casts give off heat when they're hardening? 
not_available No.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available It's called an exothermic reaction.
not_available It could make a pretty cool science project.
not_available Can you help me make it?! Uh,sure.
not_available I'll get the stuff.
not_available Sam,can you dispose of the rest of that Ativan,please? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available So,I talked to your neurologist, Uh
not_available huh.
not_available and I got quite an eful about temporal lobe epilepsy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Interesting stuff.
not_available Well,I told you I was the real deal.
not_available Mmmm.
not_available Well,do you have any last words of psychic wisdom before I medicate you and sever your ties to the paranormal? Oh,sure.
not_available Um,well,I see great things for you in the year to come, although you will struggle to balance home and career.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's the most generic fortune I've ever heard.
not_available And you should really invite your dad to the wedding.
not_available I'm just saying.
not_available Gates.
not_available Hm? Can you explain this,please? Explain what? Why did you write "idiopathic liver failure" on her death certificate worksheet? It should be "carbon tetrachloride ingestion." Well,she never admitted it straight
not_available out.
not_available We don't know what really happened.
not_available You can't withhold information whenever it suits you.
not_available What she told you needs to be part of the medical record.
not_available If we document suicidality, then life insurance won't pay.
not_available We say it was a natural death
not_available what's the harm? The harm is that it's unethical, and it's insurance fraud.
not_available Oh,come on,insurance companies screw people over any chance they get.
not_available And why should those kids be punished for the rest of their life because of something their mother did? Gates,I'm worried about you.Don't worry abou4 me.I'm all right.
not_available No,I'm worried about your ability to do this job.
not_available And it's too bad because you're good, but you
not_available you you lie and you think nothing of it.
not_available It's not lying if we don't know for sure.
not_available Now,come on,let their mother do this one last thing for them.
not_available I'm not going to let you lie for them,Gates.
not_available Hey,Gates,can you sign this discharge? 
not_available Later.
not_available Jane,you seen Neela? Uh,Dubenko sent her home early.
not_available Oh.
not_available I just had to wheel an appy up from the ER, in case you're wondering.
not_available Wondering what? 
not_available Why I'm here.
not_available Good night,Jane.
not_available King
not_available sized,wrought iron frame.
not_available The rest is up to you.
not_available Hey,you guys, have you seen Tony around? 
not_available Not in a while.
not_available Okay,have a good night.
not_available Do you think I chased away my father too fast? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe I should've at least listened to what he had to say.
not_available Why? You can call him.
not_available I tried.
not_available He checked out of his hotel
not_available the number he gave me in Texas is disconnected.
not_available Um,Abby,uhSorry,I just need a minute to check something,okay? Hey,Malik,do we still have the chart on Anna Hayes? You think I memorize the name of every patient who comes through here? The woman that died of liver failure.
not_available I forgot to do some paperwork for the death certificate.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey,first day back.
not_available How'd it go? Just like riding a bike.
not_available Luka,I told Miranda we'd be home by Coming.
not_available CAUSE OF liver failure of unknown et iology 
not_available Good night.
not_available See ya.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How'd it go with your little secret? Oh,terrible,actually.
not_available Worse than expected.
not_available But our cheerleader did well,though.
not_available The police are interviewing the whole squad as well as the coach,so 
not_available Oh,good.
not_available Getting off soon? 
not_available Uh,yeah,thank God.
not_available Yeah,me,too.
not_available Want to grab a beer? Sounds good,but,um I've got some dictations to do.
not_available Okay.
not_available Another time.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available You're still here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Our uncle drove in from Ann Arbor.
not_available He wanted to see her.
not_available I'm sorry for your loss.
not_available You know,I never got to thank you for everything you did.
not_available It's my job.
not_available You really helped us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good night,Nick.
not_available You know,she knew it was the only way out.
not_available Had to look natural so we could get the insurance money.
not_available I found some old solvent at the store.
not_available You helped her? I left out a bottle.
not_available At least she finally got something right.
not_available Good night,Doc.
not_available Leave me alone.
not_available No,you can't break and steal things,Alex
not_available you know that.
not_available You do that,you're going to end up on the wrong track Mom,you're not in my head,okay? You
not_available you don't know what happened! Alex,come on.
not_available Alex! Open this door! You hear me? Right now! Open the door! Go away! I can't go away
not_available I'm your mom! Come on,Alex, don't do this to me.
not_available Hey,do you remember that time that,uh, we made that science project for your school,that volcano? And I couldn't get the mix of,uh, of baking soda and vinegar right? And it erupted all over the living room.
not_available What were you,what, five or six? I know I didn't give you the most stable childhood,okay? I know you've seen a lot of crazy stuff, that is mostly my fault.
not_available But the only thing I ever wanted was for you to be happy,Alex.
not_available Okay? And I don't know how to give that to you.
not_available So,please tell me what to do.
not_available I know you're listening in there,Alex,okay? I love you.
not_available You know that,right? Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available You look tired.
not_available Want a beer? 
not_available Yeah,thanks.
not_available I made chili,salad and corn bread from scratch.
not_available I know what your next question is.
not_available My homework's already done.
not_available All right.
not_available No more fast food around here.
not_available Wow,Sarah, this looks great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Leaving so soon? Guess not.
