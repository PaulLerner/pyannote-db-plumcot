not_available Do you care to respond? Look, I may have been out of line
not_available Oh, baloney.
not_available Excuse me?

not_available Because you're a kid.
not_available So? I like him.
not_available He's cool.
not_available I know what you're trying.
not_available I'm not.
not_available And I'd rather not go out with someone right now, okay? You're probably not his type.

not_available The year before.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Which one's Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available I'm gonna need a massive amount of caffeine to make it to sunrise.

not_available Yeah.
not_available You know what they 
say When you lose an organ, the other ones get stronger.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you still doing here? Waiting on a few labs.
not_available I hate to pass on patients when it's busy.
not_available That will change.
not_available Today was pretty amazing.
not_available I've never seen anything like it.
not_available I didn't think we could handle it, but we did.
not_available We did really well.
not_available We saved lives.
not_available It was like a roller coaster.
not_available I've always hated roller coasters, but 
not_available I sort of can't wait for the next ride.
not_available As long as it's not in the next 12 hours.
not_available You drink coffee? I'm not in the club.
not_available I got an extra.
not_available Thanks.
