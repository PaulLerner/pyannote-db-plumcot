not_available It may not be.

not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available How long down? Cops had to secure the building.
not_available How long did that take? 
not_available Made us wait 45 minutes.
not_available It takes 20 minutes to bleed out.
not_available If there'd been a shooter, she'd be full of holes.
not_available Two of O
not_available neg on the infuser.
not_available On my count
not_available Hold on.

not_available Take it easy.
not_available I got it.
not_available Can the officers wait outside?

not_available We're waiting here.
not_available Don't think he's gonna jump off the bed.
not_available Hook up the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Give her room to work.
not_available Think he's got a chance? Why do you think they're letting me crack his chest? 
not_available That thing's got to wait outside.
not_available That thing is a service animal.
not_available A service animal with fleas.
not_available Actually, fleas have a natural aversion to minis.
not_available Abby, Dilantin level's back
not_available Carter, this is Mrs.
not_available Gellin 
not_available and her guide horse, Ruby.
not_available Who should be outside.

not_available You got a rhythm? 
not_available Unit five and six are up.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Asystole.
not_available How's his volume? 
not_available Heart's filling well.
not_available Too many holes.
not_available We could try high
not_available dose epi.
not_available Penetrating trauma with no pulse in the field.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's dead? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You just saved the taxpayers a million bucks in trial fees and prison costs.
not_available What happened to your wrist? 
not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available Neela, you wanna help Officer McWayne out here? 
not_available I was gonna find family for this patient.
not_available Get him started in the suture room.
not_available Sorry about the misunderstanding.
not_available Some people are freaked out by little animals.
not_available I'm gonna clean your cut out.
not_available I have a cousin who gets nervous around Chihuahuas.
not_available Is she wearing sneakers? 
not_available It keeps her from slipping on the floor.
not_available My husband wants her transferred to Mercy.
not_available Surgery's on their way to check her out.
not_available We wanna move her.
not_available You're gonna have to find a surgeon at Mercy to accept her before I can okay a transfer.
not_available Hey, back off, Ruby.
not_available Doctor, can you come to the phone? 
not_available Yes.
not_available One minute.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Re
not_available prep the wound and tie up the horse.
not_available It's my husband.
not_available He's driving back from Detroit.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Are you the doctor? 
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available You better be damn sure 
not_available you know what you're doing.
not_available Mr.
not_available TragerIf you do anything
not_available Mr.
not_available Trager, I understand.
not_available We will.
not_available Yes, your wife is working on that right now.
not_available We would never do that, sir.
not_available Got paged about a patient transfer? Wendall Meade, Social Services.
not_available Thank God you're here.
not_available Why don't you get here soon, and we won't make any decisions with
not_available Nice talking to you too.
not_available Little pin prick and some burning.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Must be a pain having to waste all that time trying to save a scumbag's life.
not_available He jacked a mini
not_available mart, doc.
not_available Looks like a 14year
not_available old.
not_available Feels like a foreign body.
not_available Something hard.
not_available Is it possible you were shot? I don't think so.
not_available I remember I scraped my wrist when I fell.
not_available How about there? 
not_available That's a loop of bowel.
not_available I left messages for three surgeons at Mercy.
not_available They'll call back.
not_available How long can we wait? Eight to 10 hours.
not_available I can't find the appendix.
not_available What does that mean? Usually if it's enlarged, it's easy to find.
not_available She may not have appendicitis? 
not_available It's not a perfect test.
not_available She could still have the disease even if the ultrasound is normal.
not_available Can't you people give me a straight answer? I would say, based on her fever and tenderness, that it is appendicitis.
not_available She said it was stomach flu, then changed her mind.
not_available Now you can't find her appendix? Transfer center from Mercy wants to talk to the Attending.
not_available Finally.
not_available Hang a gram of cefotetan.
not_available Do you think I need an operation? Do I need it soon? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Can I have it here? Well, you could but your parents want you to have it at a different hospital.
not_available Won't that take a while? 
not_available Not too long.
not_available It'll be okay.
not_available Why can't I decide? Because when you're a kid, your parents get to decide what's best.
not_available The only way to stop the bleeding is by blowing up a balloon in his artery.
not_available This x
not_available ray is gonna guide us to the right spot.
not_available How does he get blood to his brain? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Hold on.
not_available That's a good question, Arlo.
not_available Two carotid arteries supply the brain.
not_available Right and left, okay? If one gets blocked, Mother Nature has a backup plan.
not_available It is called the Circle of Willis.
not_available It's a detour.
not_available But it allows the blood from the right to get over to the left
not_available hand side.
not_available I understand.
not_available So he can recover.
not_available Well, priority number one is to stop the bleeding.
not_available If you're not wearing lead, leave.
not_available I'll come get you when we're done.
not_available Thanks, Dr.
not_available Barnett.
not_available Ray's fine.
not_available Okay, Ray.
not_available Sam, Dr.
not_available Kovac called.
not_available Did you take a message? Sounds like your kid got suspended from school again.
not_available I may need to leave.
not_available In a minute.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Have them step outside.
not_available I removed a foreign body from Officer McWayne's arm.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Feels like a plastic BB.
not_available Could be what shot your patient.
not_available That couldn't sever a carotid artery.
not_available You sure? Officer Escobar was shot with this metal slug from a sub
not_available Q, right upper a trapezius.
not_available Looks like a 9 mm.
not_available Is that what the suspect used? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Ninemillimeter semi
not_available automatic, standard issue.
not_available That's what we carry.
not_available I can pick him up.
not_available It's not a problem.
not_available Stay at work.
not_available Well, what is it about? 
not_available No.
not_available The school didn't tell me anything.
not_available They didn't tell you? What did he do? 
not_available They just said to come in for a meeting.
not_available Well, is he okay? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available He's fine.
not_available All right.
not_available Call me as soon as you get back.
not_available I will.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Tetanus shot for Officer McWayne.
not_available Being interviewed about friendly
not_available fire.
not_available Is it for sure now? 
not_available They found a pellet gun at the scene.
not_available So he didn't shoot the cop then.
not_available Guess not.
not_available Arlo, you should be in the family room.
not_available Is that the guy who shot my dad? He was the suspect they were pursuing.
not_available Can I go in there? 
not_available Probably not a good idea.
not_available I wanna see him.
not_available Arlo.
not_available He's a kid.
not_available You don't have to do thisWas he on drugs? 
not_available I can't say.
not_available Did he have a police record? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Why would he do that? Why would he shoot my dad? Arlo, we're not exactly sure who shot your dad.
not_available He may have been accidentally shot by a police officer.
not_available What? But I thought
not_available This guy was only carrying a BB gun.
not_available They won't know for sure until the ballistics tests are completed.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available One of his own guys.
not_available Arlo, can we talk to you? Which one of you did it? 
not_available We don't know anything yet.
not_available Why don't we go and sit down? 
not_available We're sorry.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available Comes with the job.
not_available There, balloon is up and the vessel is occluded.
not_available Can we have his family in? 
not_available Not just yet.
not_available Entrance wound is dry as a bone.
not_available Nice.
not_available He's not waking up.
not_available He's still comatose with a flaccid paralysis and an up
not_available going toe.
not_available So much for collateral flow.
not_available But you can repair the carotid? 
not_available Oh, it'd likely do more harm than good.
not_available It's not a procedure that I'm comfortable with.
not_available But if the wife consents
not_available His fiancÃ©e.
not_available Not her call then.
not_available We have an ex
not_available wife.
not_available Is there a blood relative? 
not_available Yeah, a son, but he's 15.
not_available Could he be a mature minor? 
not_available A what? It's when a kid's mature enough to make medical decisions.
not_available Could be.
not_available Okay, I'll talk to him.
not_available Get Wendall in on this.
not_available And find me if you need me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko, I need you right now.
not_available Keep his crit above 30.
not_available PO
not_available 2, 90.
not_available Tenyear
not_available old, appy, systolic's 60.
not_available Is she septic? 
not_available Antibiotics are on board.
not_available We're running in a liter.
not_available Who saw her from Surgery? 
not_available The family wants her transferred.
not_available That isn't happening.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hong at Mercy accepted her.
not_available Pressure's up to 70 with 500.
not_available They're sending an ambulance.
not_available I'm sorry, ma'am.
not_available Your daughter is very sick.
not_available She needs surgery now.
not_available Do we have consent? 
not_available No.
not_available She said we could wait.
not_available In most cases, we could.
not_available This is unusual.
not_available The infection spread to her blood quickly.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Trager, we need consent for surgery.
not_available My husband will be here.
not_available I need to wait.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available It's life
not_available threatening.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll double
not_available doctor it.
not_available What? What? Two physicians' signatures can override your consent.
not_available Sign it.
not_available Sign it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available This is not what we agreed on.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You done this before? No one gets in trouble 
not_available acting for the patient.
not_available Tell that to Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Treating your dad
not_available Sorry, I was tied up.
not_available Everyone, this is Wendall Meade.
not_available Hi, Arlo.
not_available Can he stay? If it's okay with Arlo.
not_available Yeah? Okay, so the two treatment 
options We can use a catheter to plug up the artery with coils.
not_available Like with a balloon? Yeah.
not_available That would give him a 15 percent chance of getting better 85 percent chance of still staying in a coma.
not_available Or we could do surgery to reconnect the artery.
not_available If we do that that would give him a 30 percent chance of improving.
not_available That's a little better.
not_available Yeah, well, it's risky.
not_available Usually with surgery, half the time the patient deteriorates or dies.
not_available The surgery sounds too risky.
not_available Do you understand the choices, Arlo? They both kind of suck.
not_available Can you explain them back to me? What? 
not_available I need to make sure he understands.
not_available I'll make sure he does.
not_available Arlo? Well, if we play it safe there's a small chance he gets better.
not_available If we do the surgery there's a bigger chance he'll improve, but an even bigger risk he'll get sicker.
not_available That's right.
not_available It's your call.
not_available What are you talking about? We've decided Arlo's mature.
not_available He can make the decision.
not_available By himself? He can't handle this.
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available No, you can't.
not_available You're 15.
not_available He's my dad.
not_available In cases like this, the decision has to be made by a blood relative.
not_available It's the law.
not_available How can this be right? Between you and me, it's not the end of the world.
not_available The board has a zero
not_available tolerance approach to what they consider pornographic.
not_available What? He brought this to school.
not_available He was showing it to the other kids.
not_available That may not be appropriate.
not_available They have lots of cool electronic gadgets in here.
not_available I don't think they were looking at the gadgets.
not_available Is that your name on the mailing label? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you're Alex's stepfather? Not exactly.
not_available I see.
not_available But you take an active role in the child
not_available rearing? Yeah, I pick him up from school.
not_available You know, we do sports.
not_available I took him fishing.
not_available That's great.
not_available You know, Alex and his mom we've been all living together, and it's really going well.
not_available And how long has that been the arrangement? About a week.
not_available Ray, do you have a minute? Hey.
not_available Hot chocolate? It's my treat.
not_available I'm really sorry about my mom.
not_available She's just looking out for you, okay? 
not_available By freaking out? My dad's lucky she won't even talk to him anymore.
not_available Are you okay with what we talked about? About your dad? Last year for the ninthgrade prom 
not_available there was this girl Sarah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was too afraid to ask her.
not_available But my dad told me that you got to take chances or you miss out.
not_available She was going with this guy from the baseball team.
not_available And two weeks later, she asked me to go to a concert on the pier.
not_available Sounds like your dad's a pretty cool guy.
not_available He'd want the surgery.
not_available Then that's what we'll do.
not_available But my mom's gonna freak out.
not_available It's your decision.
not_available And I'll back you up.
not_available You will? Sure thing.
not_available Abdominal pain and near
not_available syncope from hypotension.
not_available He was here this morning.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt's patient.
not_available Marina, find Pratt, and grab the ultrasound.
not_available I thought it was a bruise.
not_available When did you get dizzy? 
not_available A few hours ago.
not_available Why didn't you come back? 
not_available Doctor said it wasn't serious.
not_available Pressure's only 80 palp.
not_available Trendelenburg, liter of saline, CBC, type and cross for force.
not_available Sir, where does it hurt? 
not_available Sonosite.
not_available What's up? 
not_available You sent home an unstable patient.
not_available Damn, he lacerated a spleen.
not_available Call Surgery.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt 
not_available I signed off on this.
not_available He was rolling with his nephew.
not_available You didn't mention belly pain.
not_available He didn't have any.
not_available Did you even check a crit? 
not_available It would have been normal.
not_available His shoulder was hurting? There was no point
not_available Blood irritates the diaphragm and gives you pain.
not_available You missed it.
not_available You forgot about Kerr's sign.
not_available No, we missed it because you were too tired to see the patient.
not_available So, what did the principal say? 
not_available You're busy, we'll talk at home.
not_available Why can't you tell me now? I don't want to talk about it over the phone.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay, when I get home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Arlo's consenting for surgery.
not_available It's taken care of.
not_available You called it in? 
not_available Vascular's ready for him.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll start the pre
not_available op list.
not_available I have to go pump before I explode.
not_available Carolyn made it to the O.R.
not_available Who? 
not_available Appendix girl.
not_available Great.
not_available You were busy today.
not_available Declared a 15yearold a mature minor 
not_available overrode parental consent on an appy.
not_available And took a kid from an abusive parent.
not_available It's the triple crown of social work.
not_available When are you off? 
not_available Another hour.
not_available Wanna get some dinner? Thanks, I have plans already.
not_available Not with anyone, if you're wondering.
not_available Not a problem.
not_available You can come along, but I have to warn you, it's pretty physical.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter Neuro's admitting my CVA in 4.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Abby, that's two to sign out.
not_available It's 7:05.
not_available I've been here five minutes too long.
not_available Stroke patient, tele
not_available admit and the cop Dubenko's sending to surgery.
not_available You've still got three on the board.
not_available I know.
not_available They're all discharged.
not_available Hey, Ray, you forgot something.
not_available Abby, what? Your flu shot.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Pressure's good, 122/76.
not_available You feeling better, Mr.
not_available Sakabu? Yes.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Okay if the nephew comes back? Yeah, sure.
not_available We might be able to get more history.
not_available Are you on any medication? 
not_available No.
not_available Any allergies? How could this happen? Well, it's a very unusual presentation.
not_available You need enough force to break a rib that cuts into the spleen.
not_available My nephew's a pretty tough kid.
not_available He'd have to be to cause something like this.
not_available My uncle gonna be okay? Hey, have you seen Susan? 
not_available She signed out.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available No, just page her again for me, please.
not_available What do you need? Can't believe Ray dumped this on me.
not_available I'm supposed to take care of this cop's kid.
not_available What's going on? He signed out to you? Why'd he do that? 
not_available I was in his exit path to the door.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, this is Keith Trager.
not_available Daughter has appendicitis.
not_available Right.
not_available Hi.
not_available We spoke on the phoneWhere is she? 
not_available Her condition worsened.
not_available We had to take her.
not_available You were to transfer her.
not_available I know.
not_available There wasn't time for that, sir.
not_available Take me to her now.
not_available One second.
not_available There's a problem with Arlo? Ray said it was all settled, but he's very upset.
not_available I know the case.
not_available Want me to take it? Can you? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah, I'm coming.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Arlo? Where's Ray? 
not_available He had to leave.
not_available When's he coming back? 
not_available He left for the night.
not_available He left? 
not_available I'm sure I can help.
not_available He promised that he would help me talk to my mom.
not_available I can do that.
not_available Bowel grasper and stapler.
not_available Pressure is 122/76.
not_available Prep the extraction bag.
not_available Peanut swab with Betadine for the stump.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Got it.
not_available They're doing it through the scope, which means a smaller scar, shorter recovery.
not_available So she's okay? It's not a complicated procedure.
not_available Everything's fine, Keith.
not_available Who is that operating? That's the chief of surgery.
not_available He's the best.
not_available Up on the cautery.
not_available Dr.
not_available Dubenko, the parents are here.
not_available Oh, she's doing great.
not_available We caught it before it burst.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Pulse ox probe slipped off.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available You know, I brought my dad here for back surgery.
not_available He never left.
not_available Well, that's not gonna happen.
not_available He died on the table.
not_available Some junior doc botched the job.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available I hate this hospital.
not_available Where's the other doc? He isn't available
not_available He took off.
not_available So, Arlo, have you decided on which treatment you would like us to pursue? I want him to have the operation.
not_available It's too risky, honey.
not_available It's what he'd want.
not_available Isn't it better to have him around sick than to lose him? Does he have to be here? 
not_available He's your father's best friend.
not_available I feel bad too.
not_available I don't know why we're still talking.
not_available Ray said it's my decision.
not_available What, you don't want my opinion? 
not_available No.
not_available Tell her.
not_available Legally, Arlo has the right
not_available He's too young to handle it.
not_available I'm not! Don't talk to your mother like that! Maybe if I reviewed the risks
not_available No.
not_available I understood it the first time.
not_available Dad would wanna go for it.
not_available I know that's how he always talked.
not_available He liked to take chances.
not_available That's what probably got him shot.
not_available We're not gonna make any progress
not_available I want him to have the operation.
not_available If you approve this surgery how are you going to feel if he dies? 
not_available He's not gonna die.
not_available He could die.
not_available Are you ready to live with that? I'm trying to protect you.
not_available I know you think you're all grown up.
not_available Are you ready to accept responsibility for your father's death? 
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, Marie.
not_available It's Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Well.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, go ahead and push another two of Ativan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen, any chance you can work late tonight? 
not_available Probably.
not_available Yeah, we're getting slammed.

not_available So who's the potassium for? My dad.
not_available You gotta go easy on that stuff.

not_available This should last me a few weeks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's a big wall.
not_available Yep, I'm in training.

not_available Hey, Wendy.

not_available All right, thanks.
not_available Take good care of him.
not_available See you at the top.
not_available Let's go to the beginner wall.
not_available Is this how this thing is supposed to go? Sure, if you want to hang upside
not_available down by your balls.
not_available What's going on? The family have decided not to have the surgery.
not_available The family? We've been together for three years.
not_available Don't I get a say in any of this? 
not_available Hello, this is Dr.
not_available Rasgotra in the ER.
not_available We are canceling the carotid surgery on patient Escobar.
not_available Yes, I can hold.
not_available Hey, John.
not_available Hi.
not_available So you two are dating? No, we're just friends.
not_available Well, that's how it starts.
not_available We went out for a year or two.
not_available Oh, yeah? Great.
not_available Thought we might even get married.
not_available One day she tells me she wants to start seeing other people.
not_available Why do they say that? You know, if you want to break up, you should just do it.
not_available Is the rope supposed to be this loose? Better? 
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you get back to sleep? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Okay, where's Alex? Up in his room.
not_available Want a beer? Do I need one? He brought this to school.
not_available That's it? That's such crap.
not_available Where'd he get it? You subscribe? 
not_available I like the articles.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available So listen, anyway a friend of his had the magazine in the bathroom in the stall at school You know, the kid was Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
not_available Do you think that Alex is? I thought it would be at least a year or two until I had to deal with this.
not_available Well, I guess I need to talk to him.
not_available Yep.
not_available So I'm here twice a week, anytime you want to join me.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available Brett could give you another lesson.
not_available He's quite a teacher.
not_available See you next time.
not_available Bye.
not_available I got an outfit just like that at home, but I didn't want to show off.
not_available So are you hungry? No.
not_available No, not really.
not_available You got to eat dinner.
not_available I'm just gonna grab something at home.
not_available Come on, you've been a good sport.
not_available My treat.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, what are you in the mood for? I don't know.
not_available Indian? No? Chinese? Sushi? 
not_available Had it for lunch.
not_available What about deep
not_available dish pizza? I could go for pizza.
not_available I know a good pizza place on Monroe.
not_available Yeah, too many carbs.
not_available Right.
not_available Hey, I have an idea.
not_available Okay, close your eyes, pick a page and point.
not_available That's where we go.
not_available What if it's a doughnut shop? Are you in this or not? There? 
not_available Not there.
not_available There? 
not_available Right there.
not_available And the winner is 
not_available Uncle Vito's Mongolian Barbecue.
not_available What's that? It's Italian.
not_available It's Asian.
not_available It's maybe Southern.
not_available All right, close your eyes and do it again.
not_available No, no.
not_available You made the rules.
not_available Mongolian barbecue? But it's in Downers Grove.
not_available We don't want to go that far.
not_available Are you in this or not? All right.
not_available I hope they have tofu.
not_available Officer McWayne.
not_available They're moving him up to the ICU.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Arlo! Arlo! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Where is he going? 
not_available Probably just getting a snack.
not_available He seems really upset.
not_available It'll pass.
not_available Well, maybe I should go talk to him.
not_available No, he's too emotional.
not_available You can't talk to him when he gets this way.
not_available I hope he doesn't feel like he was forced into this.
not_available You don't want to think about it some more discuss it after he calms down? 
not_available It won't help.
not_available He's not being realistic.
not_available That's why we had to make the decision.
not_available He's too confused.
not_available I heard him express a strong opinion more than once.
not_available You and I both know it was the wrong choice.
not_available He was hoping for something that's never going to happen.
not_available He loves his father, but I'm the one who has to set the limits.
not_available Anyway, thanks for everything you did.
not_available I'm not sure I helped.
not_available Well, when you let us work it out together you did the right thing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can I come in? Didn't know you liked The Goon.
not_available They didn't have Hellboy.
not_available So look about today at school Mr.
not_available Elmore is such a loser.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What happened with that kid in the bathroom all right, I just wanted to make sure you didn't have any questions.
not_available About what? You know, about what he was doing.
not_available Spanking the monkey? Yeah.
not_available What about it? Well, it's
not_available It's normal but, you know, it's not the kind of thing you should do at school.
not_available You think I'm stupid? No.
not_available At your age, it can be a confusing time.
not_available If you ever want to, you can always talk to me about these things.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available I heard there was an after
not_available hours club.
not_available Cool.
not_available Have you seen Kristy? 
not_available Yeah, she's pulling around the side.
not_available Hey, you're late.
not_available We went on at 9.
not_available How could you just leave like that? I'll meet you in the car.
not_available I'm sorry, what? 
not_available You abandoned that kid.
not_available I signed out my patients when my shift was ov
not_available You should have signed out to me.
not_available You were busy.
not_available You thought it was easy.
not_available It got complicated.
not_available How did it get complicated? The kid wanted his dad to have surgery.
not_available How long you discuss it, two minutes? 
not_available He understood.
not_available His dad's not having the surgery.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because you weren't there.
not_available His mom gave him a hard time about it, and he gave in.
not_available Did you at least talk to him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, all he needed was a little hand
not_available holding, Neela.
not_available I mean, God, is that so hard for you? 
not_available Don't turn it around, make it about me.
not_available You promised to help.
not_available No, I told him
not_available You know, it's not my job or anyone else's to keep your promises.
not_available My shift was over.
not_available He was counting on you.
not_available I had a gig.
not_available Screw your gig! Medicine isn't a day job! This coming from a girl who was selling hot dogs three months ago.
not_available I was off at 7.
not_available Abby was off at 7.
not_available But we were still there taking care of our patients.
not_available We'd never leave the hospital if we had to stick around to tuck in every patient! I'm not talking about every patient, I'm talking about one kid.
not_available It was the most important decision of his life.
not_available He trusted you, and you left.
