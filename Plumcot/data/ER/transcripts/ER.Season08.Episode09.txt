not_available Missed you last night.
not_available I know.
not_available I had to work late.
not_available No, no, no.

not_available Well, call Edson.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What is it? It's the ER.
not_available Remember how Carla wanted Reece to be with you on Father's Day? 
not_available It says a lot.
not_available The judge should know.
not_available That's good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll be okay? 
not_available It's just the first day.
not_available Maybe I should be there to help.
not_available Jackie, you are helping.
not_available Rachel Greene.
not_available I need a copy of her attendance records.
not_available You could have told me.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Who's allergic to lilies? She may not have appreciated the symbolism.
not_available Symbolism? 
not_available Lilies are for funerals.
not_available Oh, God, I'm sorry.
not_available I just wanted to send her some flowers.
not_available You got his grandmother flowers? I can't seem to get in her good graces.
not_available How's her leg anyway? 
not_available She's concerned with the girl she hit.
not_available I already met with him.
not_available I thought that girl was better.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's in her upswing.
not_available About to have a bigger bank account.
not_available She settled? 
not_available Very good offer.
not_available Good.
not_available So you can fax it to me.
not_available Who's paging me? 
not_available They need you in Room 2.
not_available Where's Corday? 
not_available Upstairs.
not_available Isn't she on for Trauma? 
not_available We just got here.
not_available I thought she was on leave.
not_available She's been cleared to operate.
not_available What about all the dead geezers? There's no evidence of any wrongdoing.
not_available Good news.
not_available When the paramedics roll me in, I'll take Romano.
not_available Entrance, left temple, no exit.
not_available What type of gun? 
not_available Cops said a.
not_available 32 at close range.
not_available Pupils are 5 mm and fixed.
not_available Who shot her? Does it matter? 
not_available Got caught in a gas station holdup.
not_available Absent blink reflex.
not_available Probable brainstem damage.
not_available Did we push mannitol? 
not_available I'm still assessing her.
not_available What are you waiting for? Let's push the mannitol, load Dilantin and hyperventilate.
not_available I was taking Gallant through the exam.
not_available Treat the patient first, okay? ABG, gram of Ancef and a head CT.
not_available What's the GCS? 
not_available Elizabeth, it's 8:20.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I had to change.
not_available Let's call Neurosurg if there's something fixable on CT.
not_available What's the rush? 
not_available I have to go.
not_available Heart rate's 50.
not_available Push an amp of atropine.
not_available Is there a problem, Peter? 
not_available You're late.
not_available I have to get out of here.
not_available What's the caloric reflex?

not_available And then? Saccadic return to the midline.
not_available Date of 
birth 9/12/73.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton ever in a good mood? 
not_available He has his moments.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available No response.
not_available Looks like she's a donor.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Is there any family we can call for you? Her parents live in Minnesota.
not_available We were gonna drive there today.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I'm so sorry, Mr.
not_available Pruitt.
not_available Are you gonna operate? The bullet passed through the brainstem.
not_available I'm afraid no surgery can repair that.
not_available Is there any chance that she'll survive? She's no longer breathing on her own.
not_available We have to wait and see if she regains consciousness.
not_available But it's highly unlikely.
not_available The medical exam is consistent with brain death.
not_available I was still asleep when she left.
not_available I know this is a difficult time, but we found a donor card.
not_available A what? 
not_available Your wife wanted to be an organ donor.
not_available Oh.
not_available Yeah, I guess that's what she wanted.
not_available Can I go see her? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Elizabeth, we need you in here.
not_available Started an 18
not_available gauge in the left AC.
not_available Rudy Escalona, 15 years old.
not_available LOC from blunt head trauma.
not_available One, two, three! Boxing league.
not_available He took a lot of punches.
not_available Any medical problems, Rudy? 
not_available No.
not_available He's in good shape.
not_available Do you know where you are? I hit him, man.
not_available I hit him good.
not_available Pulse ox is 98 on two liters.
not_available Pupils equal and reactive.
not_available Do you know what year it is? 
not_available Nobody thought I could do it.
not_available Answer the doctor.
not_available But I did it.
not_available Squeeze my hand, Rudy.
not_available Haleh? 
not_available He's not responding.
not_available We need to get some information from you, sir.
not_available Airway's okay.
not_available Still has gag.
not_available No.
not_available I'll stay.
not_available After the x
not_available rays, you can come back.
not_available Soft abdomen.
not_available No guarding or rebounds.
not_available How late are you on? 
not_available Peter should be back by 6.
not_available I'm on till 10.
not_available Could you check Rachel's homework? Sure.
not_available Lateral C
not_available spine and a head CT.
not_available She needs help with her trinomials.
not_available Normal Babinski.
not_available I believe I failed algebra.
not_available It's either that or Revolutionary War.
not_available I'll stick with math.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why can't you talk to HR? 
not_available It won't change the outcome.
not_available Nicole deserves a second chance.
not_available Is that your objective opinion? She made a mistake.
not_available I know it won't happen again.
not_available The hospital has a zero
not_available tolerance policy against stealing.
not_available But if you explain, they might reconsider.
not_available There is nothing to explain.
not_available Just do it as a favor to me.
not_available I'm sorry, I can't.
not_available Or you won't? Please.
not_available I got her the job.
not_available You should have screened her first.
not_available Carter, what is this abscess still doing in Exam 4? 
not_available It's perirectal.
not_available Yeah, it needs surgery.
not_available So you're on this too, Susan? 
not_available Carter wanted a second opinion.
not_available No.
not_available Call Surgery.
not_available We're busy.
not_available One doctor per patient.
not_available Have fun suturing.
not_available Have fun with your rectum.
not_available When was your last tetanus shot? You better ask my dad.
not_available I 
not_available Jorge, this is Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Hi.
not_available How's his exam? Two
not_available centimeter lac on the labial mucosa.
not_available Suggest an interrupted 4
not_available 0 Vicryl.
not_available How'd you get hurt? 
not_available He was boxing.
not_available And the other guy? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available The patient in Trauma 1? Jorge's little brother, Rudy.
not_available He got in a good one.
not_available I kind of lost it, but I didn't mean to hurt him.
not_available Not bad.
not_available There you are.
not_available How's Rudy? They say he's gonna wake up, he's gonna be all right.
not_available You okay? 
not_available He needs a couple of stitches.
not_available Does it hurt? No.
not_available This is one tough kid.
not_available Be careful with your reaction to the testimony.
not_available No sighing, no faces.
not_available What if I have a question? 
not_available Write it down.
not_available They switched judges on us.
not_available Who'd we draft? 
not_available Alter.
not_available Is that good or bad? He always favors the mother.
not_available That's not a problem in this case.
not_available It wouldn't hurt to show a maternal side.
not_available Is that the tie you're wearing? What's wrong with it? 
not_available It's a little showy, don't you think? And don't get too emotional.
not_available You don't wanna come across as cold either.
not_available You make it sound like a performance.
not_available Well, it is.
not_available That is the whitest tie I've ever seen.
not_available It's blue.
not_available She keeps breaking out in hives, like a reaction.
not_available To what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Nobody knows.
not_available We've been to three ERs.
not_available Fifty of Benadryl.
not_available Push 125 of Solu
not_available Medrol.
not_available We've found guided imagery helps.
not_available Close your eyes, honey.
not_available Who's her doctor? 
not_available He's in Syracuse.
not_available We're on our honeymoon.
not_available Go to your peaceful place.
not_available Better hide the good silver.
not_available What's she doing here? Meeting with Personnel.
not_available I hear she's getting fired.
not_available Let our souls intermingle.
not_available Any new soaps or pesticides? 
not_available Everything's the same.
not_available What about latex? What do you mean? Some people are allergic to rubber gloves, condoms 
not_available We stopped using them.
not_available When? 
not_available A few weeks ago.
not_available We're trying to get pregnant.
not_available Everything's all right.
not_available Feel the warmth of the sun.
not_available Just embrace the joy.
not_available Rudy's vitals and oxygen level are good.
not_available Is he awake now? Not quite yet.
not_available But he might be able to hear you.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Even before I married Carla, we discussed it.
not_available I knew it would be a challenge but we agreed our first priority would be Reece.
not_available You took a variety of steps to be a good parent to him, didn't you? I learned to sign.
not_available I've always been in contact with his teachers.
not_available I've been volunteering at his school.
not_available And you're self
not_available employed? I run a website company out of my home office.
not_available What kind of hours do you have? 
not_available Very flexible.
not_available I make my own schedule.
not_available You ever needed to hire a babysitter? 
not_available No.
not_available Ever have someone get him from school? No.
not_available So you've never passed Reece's caregiving to anyone? Never wanted to.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton often needs help, doesn't he? Objection.
not_available Outside his scope.
not_available Mr.
not_available McGrath has knowledge, can testify to what he's observed.
not_available Overruled.
not_available Peter has a long list of people who pick Reece up from school.
not_available His girlfriend, his sister, his niece.
not_available They're all involved in looking after him.
not_available Even Dr.
not_available Benton himself has asked you to help him out, hasn't he? Yeah.
not_available He asked me to get Reece.
not_available But I don't mind.
not_available I wanna be with him.
not_available Did Reece ever mention where he prefers to sleep? Your house or Dr.
not_available Benton's? 
not_available He likes my place.
not_available Why is that? He says it's his home.
not_available Once the procurement teams arrive, we'll move her to the O.R.
not_available She'll be on the ventilator? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So her heart will keep beating? So she'll be alive when you remove her organs? Mr.
not_available Pruitt, your wife's brain is not functioning at its most basic level.
not_available There is no medical distinction between brain death and cardiac death.
not_available You said that the machines are keeping her alive.
not_available Not exactly.
not_available They're merely keeping her organs viable.
not_available Can't you just let her die naturally? To get healthy organs, we procure while the heart's beating and there's oxygen in the bloodstream.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available We never talked about this.
not_available I know she filled out the card
not_available I understand.
not_available I'm not so sure that I can do this.
not_available Why don't you take some time with her.
not_available I'll come back and we'll talk some more.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, pre
not_available op's ready.
not_available We're gonna wait a bit.
not_available Abby? I need morphine for a perilunate dislocation.
not_available How much? Get 20, just to be safe.
not_available What's the patient's name? 
not_available Bovard.
not_available I saw Nicole.
not_available They let her go? 
not_available I'm sure she'll find another job.
not_available It's not important.
not_available She might want to take it easy now, with the baby coming.
not_available She's keeping it? You thought she wouldn't? I don't know.
not_available It's tough being a single mother.
not_available Maybe she won't be.
not_available I need some Versed too.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available She's a good person.
not_available You met her five minutes ago.
not_available It's the right thing to do.
not_available Did she ever take a pregnancy test? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Did you see it? I mean, in front of you? 
not_available I trust her.
not_available What exactly has she done to deserve that? Even if it is yours, there's other ways to help.
not_available How much Versed? 
not_available I'll do it.
not_available No, I'll do it.
not_available I said, I'll do it.
not_available There was bleeding inside Rudy's brain.
not_available How bad is it? Problem's the arterial wall.
not_available If we prevent any further hemorrhage, should be okay.
not_available He's always begging to get in the ring.
not_available I shouldn't have let him.
not_available This is from a pre
not_available existing condition.
not_available What do you have to do? The neuroradiologist can use a catheter to mend the artery from within.
not_available And then he'll be okay? 
not_available He should be.
not_available Look, you didn't cause this, okay? It could have happened at any time.
not_available It happened when I hit him.
not_available Susan, you have Curtain 2? Woman with hives? 
not_available No.
not_available I've got the thyrotoxicosis.
not_available It's mine.
not_available Is she ready for dispo? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm still working her up.
not_available Either one of you guys ever heard of an allergy to semen? Maybe an aversion, but not an allergy.
not_available It's hundreds of proteins that are potential antigens.
not_available That your best diagnosis? 
not_available It's a possibility.
not_available You must be desperate.
not_available This is Sean Gatney.
not_available My foot's stuck.
not_available You doing okay? 
not_available His dad wouldn't let us break it.
not_available The toilet? 
not_available It's a personal hygiene system.
not_available You're out of your mind.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, right? Sandy Lopez.
not_available Right.
not_available Good job.
not_available I hear the lady and the baby are doing okay.
not_available Hey, Abby, I got this.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you need something? 
not_available I was looking for Luka.
not_available He's with a patient.
not_available Do you want a cup of coffee? Based on your extensive observation of Dr.
not_available Benton and Reece how would you summarize their relationship? Peter's completely devoted to Reece.
not_available He's always focused on what's best for him.
not_available I can't imagine anyone being a better father.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Are you and Dr.
not_available Benton married? 
not_available No.
not_available Living together? 
not_available We've discussed it.
not_available How long have you been a couple? 
not_available Almost three years.
not_available So you didn't break up in June? It wasn't exactly a breakupThen get together again about two weeks ago? Are you tracking my love life? 
not_available Objection.
not_available Argumentative.
not_available Sustained.
not_available Let me 
ask Do you consider yourself a stable factor in Reece's life? I do.
not_available How can we be sure you two won't break up again next week or next month? Next year? 
not_available Objection.
not_available Calls for prophecy.
not_available Goes to the stability of the home.
not_available Point taken.
not_available But you can answer.
not_available It's my intention to be around Peter and Reece for a long time.
not_available You occasionally babysit for Reece, don't you? Quite often.
not_available We get along well.
not_available There was an incident with a piano.
not_available Could you explain? 
not_available Reece hurt himself.
not_available Under your care.
not_available It wasn't my
not_available That's the supervision Dr.
not_available Benton 
not_available entrusts his son to.
not_available I looked away for two seconds.
not_available When he should be looking after him.
not_available Are you gonna ask a question? Counselors, let's all breathe.
not_available Fifteen
not_available minute recess.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is that decaf? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh.
not_available I shouldn't have caffeine.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Luka told you? Have you had a prenatal exam yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available I used to work in OB.
not_available I could do an ultrasound.
not_available That's nice of you, but I'll take care of it.
not_available How do you know you're pregnant? Thanks for the coffee.
not_available This is not the way to get Luka.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available The truth.
not_available What happened to your father? 
not_available He killed himself when I was little.
not_available And then, miraculously, he came back to life so he could kick you out at 16? Is this funny to you? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm just trying to figure it out.
not_available You haven't told anyone the same story twice.
not_available My mother re
not_available married and my stepfather didn't want me around.
not_available Okay.
not_available I guess you have an answer for everything.
not_available I guess everything's your business.
not_available I don't want to see him hurt.
not_available Maybe you don't want to see him happy.
not_available I know what won't make him happy.
not_available A made
not_available up life.
not_available You know, if this is all for real, that's great.
not_available Go for it.
not_available But if it's not, he's gonna figure it out.
not_available He's not stupid.
not_available I never got a chance to thank you for Saving your life? Yeah, that.
not_available It was no sweat.
not_available It was a crazy night.
not_available It's a pretty crazy job.
not_available I haven't met too many female firefighters.
not_available Only one in Company B.
not_available Must be pretty challenging.
not_available No, not really.
not_available I'm just one of the guys.
not_available Anyway, I'll see you around.
not_available Did you get a wound check? Your hand.
not_available I don't like doctors.
not_available Let me take a look at it before you go.
not_available Maybe some other time.
not_available What happened? Rudy dropped his sats.
not_available BP is 230/120.
not_available Pulse ox, 78/15.
not_available He stopped breathing.
not_available One of Pavulon, 100 of sux.
not_available What's going on? Check the fundi.
not_available There's pressure in his brain.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available We're gonna help him breathe first.
not_available Multifocal PVCs.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Push another 100 of lidocaine.
not_available It's Rachel.
not_available Can't talk.
not_available Start Nipride at 70 mics.
not_available She said you told her to check in.
not_available Elizabeth will be home at 6.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Lily, another 60 of nimodipine.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Looks like V
not_available tach.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available Start compressions.
not_available Ever try a nonheart
not_available beating protocol? I observed one at Case Western.
not_available They go to the O.R., turn off the vent, and wait for the heart to stop beating.
not_available Meanwhile, lack of oxygen can ruin the organs.
not_available You remove them after only two minutes of cardiac arrest.
not_available They'll be viable, with a natural death.
not_available She's dead either way.
not_available This approach compromises the transplant.
not_available It's the only approach the husband will consent to.
not_available You know that for a fact? 
not_available You presented this to Mr.
not_available Pruitt? Luka? 
not_available I suggested it as an option.
not_available Without consulting me? She's my patient too.
not_available You're not the one who needs approval for an unconventional procedure, nor you're the one going to have to do it.
not_available Can you take a break? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr Weaver, is there anyone in Exam 4? The middle bed's free.
not_available I don't wanna tie up a monitor.
not_available Hey, do I have to keep this in my arm? Yeah.
not_available You might need emergency meds.
not_available What if someone comes in? 
not_available These doors lock from the inside.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Is that what I think it is? Just give me one second.
not_available Wasn't this guy going to the morgue? 
not_available Yeah, I was just about to.
not_available Get him out.
not_available We need epi in here.
not_available How many amps? 
not_available As much as you can carry.
not_available Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
not_available No.
not_available It'll be fine.
not_available Charge to 360.
not_available Clear.
not_available Asystole.
not_available How long has he been down? Forty
not_available five minutes.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available How much epi? 
not_available Push another 4 milligrams.
not_available How much longer are we going? 
not_available I'm gonna bring them in.
not_available You're calling it? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Rudy hasn't had a heartbeat for an hour.
not_available How could this happen? 
not_available He had a massive hemorrhage.
not_available No.
not_available He damaged the part of his brain that controls his heart and breathing.
not_available You said they could fix it.
not_available There wasn't enough time.
not_available Keep trying, please.
not_available We've shocked him repeatedly.
not_available We've used every drug.
not_available Nothing is working.
not_available Do you want to say goodbye before we stop? You fought hard, Rudy.
not_available You never gave up.
not_available I'm proud of you.
not_available We'll never forget you.
not_available Shut up.
not_available We love you, mijo.
not_available You'll always be in our hearts.
not_available Shut up! Shut up! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Shut up! Shut up! Just let us know when you want us to stop.
not_available I hope it snows.
not_available I'd like to see the city covered in white.
not_available Yeah, it's pretty until your car won't start.
not_available Maybe I can get a job shoveling sidewalks.
not_available It might be good if you don't work for a while.
not_available Take care of yourself, the baby.
not_available I need to work.
not_available You don't need to worry about the rent.
not_available I talked to my friend.
not_available I think I found a job.
not_available Wow.
not_available That was quick.
not_available He's opening a café in Montreal.
not_available He wants me to help run it.
not_available I can't move to Montreal.
not_available You've been very generous.
not_available I'm thankful for everything.
not_available So what are you saying, that's it? You could leave like that? Listen, my shift's over at 7.
not_available Let's talk about this tonight.
not_available I'll call you in a few days.
not_available Are you angry with me? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available Do you think I'm angry with you? 
not_available I hope not.
not_available Then why? I thought we both felt the same.
not_available You're a good person.
not_available But you talked yourself into loving me.
not_available This isn't real.
not_available I'll leave the key inside.
not_available I made an OB appointment for Friday.
not_available It's not necessary.
not_available It is.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available I felt safe for the first time in a long time.
not_available I didn't wanna lose you.
not_available So I made it up, Luka.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I made it all up.
not_available We need two layers.
not_available Do you know how to bury the knot? Take your first bite in the center, deep, then come up.
not_available You hear something? 
not_available Three knots.
not_available I hear banging.
not_available What's that noise? 
not_available I think they're working on the pipes.
not_available Oh, that don't sound like pipes.
not_available You got this? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available I think so.
not_available Who's in there? 
not_available My allergy patient.
not_available The lady with hives? 
not_available And her husband.
not_available You're tying up a room so they can have sex? 
not_available I'm conducting a clinical trial.
not_available Send them to an allergist.
not_available No.
not_available That'll take weeks.
not_available They're young.
not_available They're aroused.
not_available They want their answer now.
not_available Weaver know you're running a brothel? It's not a brothel if they're married.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, lab's back on Escalona.
not_available I didn't order any labs.
not_available Rudy? Kid arrested? 
not_available I had the brother.
not_available That's mine.
not_available It wasn't your fault.
not_available Things happen.
not_available You can't explain it.
not_available Did Rudy ever take any stimulants? I'd never let him do that.
not_available There was Ephedra in his bloodstream.
not_available Ephedra? A natural supplement.
not_available It's in power formulas.
not_available He drinks Beta
not_available Morph sometimes.
not_available From where? From the store.
not_available He wanted a six
not_available pack before we sparred.
not_available He said he wanted to dust me for once.
not_available The Ephedra probably raised his BP causing a vessel in his brain to rupture.
not_available Why would he do it? 
not_available To enhance his performance.
not_available He wanted to make you proud, Dad.
not_available You knew about this? 
not_available He was never tough enough for you.
not_available Why didn't you stop him? You kept pushing him! And you never let up! 
not_available Calm down.
not_available No! He was just a kid! He wanted to be a champ! No! That's what you wanted! It's over! I'm through! This is not how to honor your brother! It's my choice! It's not your choice! You were born with a gift! 
not_available Come on, Jorge.
not_available No! Here's your gift! Here's your gift! Man, he's spinning everything his way.
not_available We'll get it all back on your testimony.
not_available Hey.
not_available Everything all right? Yeah.
not_available I just couldn't sit at home, not knowing what was going on.
not_available We're just getting started.
not_available You testify yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Roger went first.
not_available What'd he say? That I was the world's greatest father.
not_available Peter.
not_available He made it seem like I ask him to help out with Reece all the time.
not_available He lied.
not_available It's his version of the truth.
not_available Isn't that perjury? Isn't there something you can do? Jackie! Why are you lying? Jackie? 
not_available Leave us alone.
not_available Jackie, don't.
not_available Get away from me.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Stop it and tell the truth.
not_available Ma'am, step away.
not_available Jackie, you're not helping.
not_available Get your own family! He got us here.
not_available It's his choice.
not_available Reece is our boy! He's our boy! What are you doing? 
not_available Getting caught up on my charts.
not_available You were listening.
not_available You were.
not_available You were listening to them have sex.
not_available I am not.
not_available You usually chart in admits or in the lounge.
not_available I can chart wherever I want.
not_available And I don't need to listen to your porno patients for kicks.
not_available They stopped.
not_available See? You were listening.
not_available Do you think she's okay? You think we should check? What's going on in there? 
not_available Ask Carter.
not_available You broke your fifth metacarpal.
not_available Damn.
not_available Hey, that's what they call a boxer's fracture.
not_available You're gonna be in a cast for six weeks.
not_available Good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, teenager with a 10
not_available foot fall coming in.
not_available Get Carter.
not_available Clear Trauma 1.
not_available You want me on that? Numb him up first.
not_available Hematoma block.
not_available Does my dad know? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available It'd be better coming from you.
not_available Listen, Jorge everyone has a hard time talking to their dad.
not_available It's different with him.
not_available He's old school.
not_available He grew up in Cuba.
not_available When did he come over? Before I was born.
not_available He was a great fighter.
not_available When he tried to leave, they broke his hands.
not_available That's why he pushes you so hard.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess he just wants us to have what they took away from him.
not_available You ever talk to him about this? Well, maybe you should.
not_available I'm sorry, honey.
not_available Maybe you just need a break.
not_available He never had a problem finishing.
not_available That dead guy freaked me.
not_available You need to use condoms until you can try again under supervision.
not_available I never used to be allergic to sperm.
not_available It's the semen, actually.
not_available Oh.
not_available What would cause that? Sometimes multiple sex partners.
not_available Have you had more than 10? Ten? 
not_available Let's go, honey.
not_available I thought it was just me and Kenny Markowitz.
not_available What else haven't you told me? Good job there.
not_available It's very diplomatic.
not_available It was your diagnosis.
not_available No.
not_available I bring people together, Susan.
not_available You and Cupid.
not_available Sixteenyear
not_available old male, fell from a post.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Good vitals.
not_available No LOC.
not_available He's got an obvious ankle fracture.
not_available No meds, no allergies.
not_available Okay, everybody, on my count.
not_available One, two and three.
not_available Pulse ox, 99 on two liters.
not_available You got any pain here? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Turn your head towards me.
not_available Need any help? Yeah, can you doppler the foot? 
not_available You got it.
not_available Okay if I cuff him? Do it on the right side.
not_available Turn away from me.
not_available BP's 124/78.
not_available Does that hurt? 
not_available No.
not_available Neck's clear.
not_available Get him off the board.
not_available Bounding dorsalis pedis.
not_available Go.
not_available What's he in custody for? 
not_available Stealing street signs.
not_available Anybody else hurt? 
not_available Girl's fine.
not_available She's in the car.
not_available Okay, we're gonna sit you up now.
not_available What's your name? Andrew.
not_available Don't I know you? Is that your daughter? 
not_available She's not under arrest? No.
not_available Situations like this we like to scare them a little.
not_available Take them down, call their parents.
not_available Will they release her to me? 
not_available I'll call the sergeant.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Got a phone I can use? I adjusted her meds.
not_available Have the nurse call if she has any questions.
not_available Sandy.
not_available Still got time for a wound check? 
not_available I thought you had to leave AMA.
not_available It wasn't bothering me until I jammed it rolling some hose.
not_available Still bleeding? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available What happens when you're on call? We work 12
not_available hour shifts.
not_available Seven a.
not_available m.
not_available to 7 p.
not_available m.? 
not_available Half the time.
not_available And the other half you work overnight? There's always a surgeon in
not_available house.
not_available So you cover weekends too? 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available It appears that over half your shifts are weekends or overnights.
not_available I'd have to check.
not_available Tell me what happens when a gunshot victim enters the ER.
not_available I evaluate the patient and I take them to the O.R.
not_available if necessary.
not_available Gunshot to the chest.
not_available How long an operation is that? 
not_available Well, that depends.
not_available On what? The path of the bullet, extent of vascular damage if bypass is necessary for cardiac repair.
not_available So it could take over an hour? 
not_available Three hours is a reasonable estimate.
not_available Sometimes longer? Five hours? 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available If a patient comes in at 6:30 p.
not_available m who takes over for you when you go home? 
not_available I try to get someone to cover for me.
not_available And if you can't? Then I stay with the patient.
not_available If an operation takes five hours, you'll be there until midnight? That's a rare situation.
not_available But it happens.
not_available It's possible.
not_available When you're tied up in surgery all night, who's looking after Reece? I have the support of family and friends.
not_available Like Dr.
not_available Finch, for example.
not_available Yes.
not_available Cleo is very good with Reece.
not_available Yes, we've already covered that.
not_available Who else helps you out? My sister, Jackie, picks him up from school.
not_available And makes him dinner? 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Puts him to bed while you're working? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Is she always available? Jackie's been like a mother to Reece these last few months.
not_available But initially, after Carla died, she wasn't so receptive to the idea of carign for Recce, was she? 
not_available It was a tough time.
not_available She has her own children, doesn't she? Joanie, her daughter.
not_available Wasn't there a boy? Yeah.
not_available Jesse, my nephew.
not_available He died last year.
not_available The death was gangrelated, right? 
not_available Objection.
not_available He can answer the question.
not_available Yes.
not_available How is your sister handling that loss? You know, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't I don't see how this pertains to my fitness as a father.
not_available Your Honor, this is far afield.
not_available Goes to the stability of the person he's identified as primary caregiver.
not_available I'll give some latitude.
not_available Is Jackie under the care of a psychiatrist? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available For situation of depression and pathologic grieving? 
not_available She lost her son.
not_available Is she currently managed by medication? This has nothing to do with Reece.
not_available Whose side effects include insomnia, sedation and anxiety? Why don't you ask me what kind of father I am.
not_available Ask me about how I was there when he was born prematurely.
not_available How I stayed in the hospital, watching over him making tough decisions and praying over him day and night.
not_available Ask me that.
not_available Your Honor, a moment with my client? 
not_available There's no question before the court.
not_available No! Why don't you ask me about Reece, so I can tell you there's nothing more important to me in this world than my son.
not_available Ask me that! 
not_available That can't happen again.
not_available They were provoking him.
not_available Get used to it, Peter.
not_available I said what I had to say.
not_available I hope you feel better.
not_available It sure didn't help.
not_available What did the judge say in chambers? He's impressed with Roger's availability.
not_available Availability? 
not_available I'm available to Reece.
not_available We'll have to do better.
not_available I'll do better tomorrow.
not_available That's not gonna do it.
not_available Your hours are hurting us.
not_available He's a surgeon.
not_available It goes with the job.
not_available Do you wanna keep your son? 
not_available What do you think? That you need to start setting priorities and making some hard choices.
not_available That's what I think.
not_available How well do you know Andrew? What's that supposed to mean? Does he do drugs? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Are you sure? What's this? 
not_available Results of his tox screen.
not_available He tested positive for marijuana.
not_available Aren't you supposed to keep that confidential? Were you smoking with him? 
not_available No.
not_available Have you ever smoked with him? 
not_available I wouldn't do that.
not_available Good.
not_available Then you'll test negative.
not_available Are you serious? You don't trust me? 
not_available I trusted you to go home after school.
not_available Dad, he was gonna drop me off, but then he wanted to stop.
not_available We agreed no rides.
not_available I missed the bus.
not_available You should have called me.
not_available I didn't wanna bother you.
not_available It sure didn't work out that way.
not_available You want me to pee in a cup? Yep.
not_available Yes, a gram of Ceftazidime.
not_available Did the family choose a mortuary yet? Rudy Escalona.
not_available We need to get him to the morgue.
not_available Not the ICU.
not_available The ER.
not_available Do you need me to do something? 
not_available Ask Frank for the decedent packet.
not_available Luka? You weren't here, so I gave Collins the gent first.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I had to go out.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available She's leaving town.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, Exam 4's vomiting blood.
not_available What about the baby? There is no baby.
not_available I started another line on Zahler.
not_available Did you have a written order? It was right up there.
not_available Why was Abby about to discharge my bowel obstruction? I have no idea.
not_available Because you can't write between the lines.
not_available Carter, is this one yours? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Urman? 
not_available Gave her 50 of Benadryl.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I guess you were right.
not_available We followed our bliss.
not_available Where? To our pickup truck.
not_available We thought we'd be safe by the hospital.
not_available I'll get her started.
not_available 300 of cimetidine.
not_available I will be right there.
not_available That's a very nice suit.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I was in court all day.
not_available A patient? 
not_available No.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available No.
not_available Everything's cool.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, they need you in the O.R.
not_available Mr.
not_available Escalona.
not_available If you'd like, the nurse said we could make arrangements for the funeral home.
not_available We used Rose Hills when his mother died.
not_available But I never thought that He was a good kid.
not_available He made everybody smile.
not_available Jorge he was the serious one.
not_available I didn't mean to lose my temper.
not_available It's been a hard day, you know? He doesn't wanna see me.
not_available He doesn't understand.
not_available You should give him a shot.
not_available You know, he might surprise you.
not_available Sorry to be brief, but my nanny gets off in six minutes.
not_available Diane Pruitt, GSW to the head.
not_available The transplant teams are flying in from Indiana and Michigan..
not_available Gas station robbery? Yes.
not_available Romano's agreed to a nonheart
not_available beating protocol.
not_available When did we start doing that? 
not_available Today, apparently.
not_available That's the husband.
not_available If you could review the procedure with him? He's already consented, right? 
not_available Of course.
not_available So, what is there to talk about? 
not_available He needs some reassurance.
not_available You've had him for 12 hours.
not_available You deal with him.
not_available He wants to talk to the operating surgeon.
not_available Peter, what's the matter? Nothing.
not_available Go home.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pruitt? Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.

not_available I'll be coordinating the procedure.
not_available As soon as the outof
not_available state team gets here, we'll take her to the O.R.
not_available I tried to explain it to her, but she's too young.
not_available I don't know how I'm gonna do this by myself.
not_available You're gonna do the best you can.
not_available You're supposed to be on light duty.
not_available I was moving some gear.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You went on the run.
not_available I get a little stir
not_available crazy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Looks pretty good.
not_available No sign of infection.
not_available That's it? No, you need a new bandage.
not_available So is Captain Devlin still at the sevenfive? 
not_available I know that name.
not_available Those guys used to hang out at a place called Moose and Squirrel.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Every Friday night.
not_available That was a fun place.
not_available You should have someone remove the stitches in four days.
not_available I know where to find you.
not_available Listen, Sandy Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I bunched it up.
not_available That's all right.

not_available How's it going? Fine.
not_available Your drug screen came back.
not_available Everything was negative.
not_available Don't look so disappointed.
not_available I know you're upset.
not_available But I had to do this because I want you to be safe.
not_available I care more about that than about you being angry with me.
not_available I wanna be able to trust you.
not_available It's something we both have to work at.
not_available Can I go now? Is the recipient ready?

not_available That's a new one.
not_available Just goes to teach you never to doubt my diagnoses.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No matter how loony they are.
not_available I can't believe they did it in the back of a pickup truck.
not_available They had a camper shell.
not_available How do you know?
