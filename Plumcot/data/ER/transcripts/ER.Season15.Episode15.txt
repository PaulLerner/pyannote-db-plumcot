not_available You broke the socket of the hip joint.
not_available We can reconstruct it surgically, but you'll need to stay at the hospital.
not_available How long will that take?.
not_available A week.
not_available Another month of rehab.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I have Lucy.

not_available Hey, Lucy, have you ever seen a newborn baby close up?.
not_available I'll take you to where they' re sleeping.
not_available It's okay.
LUCY Okay.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I've been looking after her alone for so long.
not_available You never expect something like this to happen.
not_available Well, we can hold off on surgery while you find someone to take her home.
SAM Do you have any family nearby?.
not_available Uh, my mom died when I was in college.
not_available Do you have any friends that can take her?.
not_available Uh, siblings?.
not_available I have a brother, Stuart, but we haven't talked in a while.
not_available Last I heard, he works a bar on Cicero.
not_available I can call him if you want.
not_available If he's reachable, we need to try.
not_available Look, Lucy was 3 the last time we saw him.
not_available He shows up late one night, says he's in trouble he needs a place to stay, regroup, whatever.
not_available When we woke up, he was long gone.
not_available He'd stolen cash from my wallet and my mom's wedding ring.
not_available My family's gotten pretty small since then.
not_available I have a neighbor that looks after her sometimes.
not_available We can just ask her.
not_available Okay.
not_available What labs do you want?.
not_available CBC, BMP, and a blood culture.

not_available You're not going anywhere.
not_available Do you want me to call Dr.
not_available Brenner?.
not_available I got this.
not_available The paramedics would not have brought you here if they thought nothing was wrong.
not_available Your heart's beating way too fast, your blood pressure's very low.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available I'm fine, you know.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Finger.
not_available Everyone wants to help me.
not_available Draw some blood, will you?.
not_available What?.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Wait.
not_available My daughter, you know?.
GATES Mm
not_available hm.
not_available She got these computers all over my house.
not_available Couldn't even go to the can without this little light blinking at me.
not_available She's worried about you.
not_available Yeah, she should have let me go to the assisted
not_available living place.
not_available At least there, I wouldn't be bothering nobody.
not_available Let's order an abdominal series.
not_available What's that?.
not_available T ake X
not_available rays of your belly.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available No, no.
not_available Come on.
not_available Look, if it's clear, I'll call you a cab.
not_available Deal?.
not_available Deal.
not_available No fever, no neuro deficits.
not_available An epidural abscess is a long throw.
not_available Worsening pain, not relieved with vicodin.
not_available We should image him before he's paralyzed.
not_available Of course.
not_available But it's not our call.
not_available Somebody called this guy about his sister.
not_available You're Stuart Moore?.
not_available Joanie was asking about me?.
not_available Y eah, I called you, yeah.
not_available Must be bad, man.
not_available I'm the last person she'd call.
not_available Okay, she's back here.
not_available Uh, Dr.
not_available Brenner?.
not_available Frank, his sister is in Trauma 1.
not_available Would you mind?.
not_available Look, Dr.
not_available Fazzio promised he'd be down in the next hour.
not_available If he doesn't approve it, call my cell.
not_available I'll deal with it.
not_available Fine.
not_available Really?.
not_available I can go?.
not_available Hallelujah.
not_available Thank you.
NEELA Hey, Sam.
not_available I, uh, talked to Dubenko about the Rouxen
not_available Y with the robotic surgery system next week.
not_available You got me in?.
not_available Cool, thanks.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available We've seen you upstairs quite a bit.
not_available Yeah, I'm taking as many O.R.
not_available shifts as I can.
not_available I'm not really having a great time down here.
not_available Tony.
not_available Breakup.
not_available Oh, well, you seem to be managing.
not_available For the most part.
not_available But you know him.
not_available You know.
not_available We had coffee.
not_available He apologized, I yelled then we both decided we didn't want it to affect our jobs 
not_available so that's that.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available From now on, I am keeping my work life out of my ""life"" life.
not_available Well, sounds like a plan.
not_available You were done loaning me money.
not_available So you rob me?.
not_available My car was in the shop, Joanie.
not_available That is not what I'm talking about.
not_available I am talking about what you did to me.
not_available You want your half of Mom's ring?.
not_available The ring was a joke.
not_available What is he doing here?.
not_available I did not want him called.
not_available I'm sorry, but we called your neighbors, they're out of town.
not_available It's him or foster care.
not_available She'd be better off with strangers.
not_available We're fine.
not_available CT can take her.
not_available Everything okay?.
not_available My brother needs to leave.
not_available Call CT.
not_available We're gonna take her upstairs.
not_available If something's happening with Lucy, I should know.
not_available Why should you know?.
not_available You don't deserve anything.
not_available Okay, you know what?.
not_available Here.
not_available Have a nice life.
not_available Get out! Stuart, I'm sorry about all this.
not_available I didn't realize
not_available Yeah, look, it was my mistake to come.
not_available Look, your sister's sick.
not_available Someone needs to take care of Lucy.
not_available That ain't me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Sam, he's not interested.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available You're just gonna walk away?.
not_available It's what she wants.
not_available Not what your niece wants.
not_available What do you know?.
not_available She needs someone.
BRENNER Stuart.
not_available Lucy's not my niece.
not_available She's my daughter.
not_available So Joanie's not her mother?.
not_available I don't know where her mom is.
not_available She took off when, uh, Lucy was 3.
not_available And Lucy has no idea?.
not_available I haven't exactly been around.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Look, I didn't know what I was doing.
not_available I wasn't supposed to have a kid.
not_available I figured leaving her with Joanie was the best I could do.
not_available Well, uh
not_available Asking your sister to raise your child, it's a pretty big favor.
not_available I guess that's why I didn't ask.
not_available Joanie's in trouble.
not_available She needs your help now.
not_available I got a tiny apartment.
not_available I play guitar at a bar.
not_available I can't take care of a 9year
not_available old kid.
not_available Hey, maybe you'll surprise yourself.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Uh, look, I gotta go, so, uh, tell Joanie I had to go to work.
not_available Uh, maybe I'll come visit later.
not_available Sure.
not_available So?.
not_available He's not gonna do it.
not_available Call foster care when you're done with the CT.
not_available It's been over an hour.
not_available You were gonna call me a cab.
not_available The results are on their way.
not_available Huh.
not_available Hey, look.
not_available I got lightheaded and I fainted, ain't no big deal.
not_available Why can't you understand?.
not_available Whatever you have, Leo, let us try to fix it.
not_available Ah, I'm sure you will.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available I got tied up.
not_available I've got the O.R.
not_available standing by.
not_available Free air under the diaphragm.
not_available It's most likely a perfed ulcer.
not_available He's been taking large doses of ibuprofen for his arthritis.
not_available Do you have any belly pain?.
not_available No.
not_available The NSAlDs could be masking the symptoms.
not_available Uh, Mr.
not_available Malcolm, air in the abdomen is not normal.
not_available We need to go in, find the perforation, and repair it.
not_available Go in?.
NEELA Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Lady, I'm 78 years old.
not_available There is some increased risk associated with surgery at your age but there's every reason to believe there will be a good outcome.
not_available If you don't do this operation, you could die.
not_available What are we waiting for?.
not_available Cancer?.
not_available I've seen that.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Are you sure this is your decision?.
not_available Y es.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available His daughter is here.
GATES Have them hold on a second.
not_available Look, Leo, this is one relatively routine operation.
not_available You could be home in a few days.
not_available That's what they told my wife.
not_available Two years later, she was still in the hospital, tied to hoses and machines.
not_available I can't do that, man.
not_available You get to stay here and watch all the action.
not_available We're going to see inside my mom?.
RONNlE Yeah, it's pretty cool.
not_available I can do a 3
not_available D reconstruction.
not_available Wow.
SAM How are you doing?.
JOANlE A little dizzy.
SAM It's probably the morphine.
not_available Will I be able to meet the foster family before she goes?.
not_available Of course.
not_available And she can visit me here?.
not_available Y eah.
not_available Every day.
not_available Two weeks is gonna fly by, you'll see.
not_available She deserves better than Stuart.
not_available Does she remember him at all?.
not_available She knows that she has an uncle.
not_available She knows that she met him once.
not_available That he lives in the city.
not_available My brother
not_available He wasn't always like this.
not_available But I'm worried that if I'm stuck here, he'll use it against me.
not_available He could use custody to blackmail me for money.
not_available It's what he does.
not_available But you're her mom now.
not_available Not legally.
not_available I always thought adoption was just a formality.
not_available I never thought that I could ever really Iose her.
not_available You won't.
not_available Joanie, he's not coming back.
not_available So, what happens now?.
not_available Well, if he's refusing treatment, there's nothing we can do.
not_available Nothing?.
not_available This is a hospital.
not_available You can't just let someone die.
not_available It's his choice.
not_available It's been one battle after another since my mom died.
not_available Trying to move him out of his house, give up his car.
not_available Feels like I should know how to do this.
not_available Sometimes, people make this kind of decision when they're depressed.
not_available Maybe we can have him talk to somebody.
not_available Like a psychiatrist?.
not_available We can offer counseling, medication.
not_available I know he's not ready to say goodbye.
not_available Hi, Archie.
not_available I'm late, I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Come on in.
MORRlS Oh.
not_available Nice place.
not_available Here, these are for you.
not_available Aww.
not_available I have a surprise for you.
not_available Yeah?.
not_available What kind of surprise?.
not_available Hey, are those cupcakes?.
not_available Yes.
not_available And balloons.
not_available I like balloons, I guess.
not_available Archie, this is my mom, Olga.
not_available My sister, Lorraine.
not_available My cousins Bianca, Javier, Gabriella, Jose.
not_available And these are my grandmothers, Carmen and Alicia.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm having Psych see Leo.
not_available What?.
not_available Why?.
not_available If we can have him declared incompetent we can have power of attorney transferred to his daughter.
not_available He's not incompetent.
not_available He doesn't want treatment.
not_available If not incompetent, then depressed.
not_available It's natural.
not_available It's part of the process of letting go.
not_available If a 25year
not_available old kid refused surgery, you'd get Psych involved just like that.
not_available It's his right to decide whether he wants his last years spent in and out of hospital beds.
not_available You have to respect his wishes.
not_available Here you go, Frank.
not_available Isn't it ridiculous to file four copies of the base
not_available station report?.
not_available Gee, that thought has never occurred to me.
not_available Neela.
not_available Uh, just put the rest in the break room.
not_available I'll deal with them.
not_available Also, your father of the year is out there in Waiting.
not_available Stuart Moore?.
not_available He came back?.
not_available Y eah, I'm watching my wallet, suggest you do the same.
not_available Car crash in the ambulance bay, dysfunctional family drama.
not_available Yeah, listen, I was
not_available About Duke.
not_available Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
not_available I don't know why I was going on.
not_available I guess I got caught off
not_available guard.
not_available It's a big move.
not_available You're probably right to be a little hesitant.
not_available I was thinking maybe we could
not_available I booked my flight.
not_available You did?.
not_available Lucien switched my schedule.
not_available He said if I couldn't come up with a better reason than nerves.
not_available Of course.
not_available That's good.
not_available It's just an interview, right?.
not_available No need to make any big life decisions.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Need some help here! 
not_available Mom.
not_available I need some help! 
LUCY Mom, wake up.

not_available Pulmonary edema.
SAM Congestive heart failure?.
not_available We're helping her breathe.
not_available She might have bruised her heart in the crash.
not_available BiPAP, 4O of Lasix, titrate, dopamine, and set up for an ultrasound.
SAM Calm down, okay?.
not_available Calm down, step aside and let us do our job.
not_available Thirty on 1 5.
not_available Let's see if we can avoid intubation.
SAM Multifocal PVCs.
not_available Hundred of lidocaine.
not_available Mommy, please talk to me.
not_available Mommy.
not_available She's sleeping, Lucy.
not_available Her oxygen level is low.
not_available When the heart isn't pumping well, the lungs fill with fluid.
GATES BiPAP is on.
BRENNER Diffuse hypokinesis.
not_available Ejection fraction, 2O percent.
GATES Looks dilated cardiomyopathy.
not_available Can't be from the crash.
not_available What's happening?.
not_available Your mom's heart isn't doing its job.
not_available We're trying to find out why.
not_available Run of six on the monitor.
not_available Did she present in failure?.
not_available No.
not_available Couldn't handle the two liters of saline we gave her.
LUCY Mommy.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Charge to 300.
not_available Stop! 
SAM You're charged.

SAM No change.
not_available No! No! Mommy! Mommy! I wanna stay! I wanna stay! 
not_available She was down for two minutes, came back after the third shock.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, that sounds good.
not_available You call me when you're ready.
not_available Was that Cardiology?.
not_available Fulminant myocarditis.
not_available Heart biopsy is gonna tell us if it's treatable with steroids.
not_available What about the hip surgery?.
not_available We'll keep her in traction, give her lungs a chance to dry out before we subject her to anesthesia.
not_available I put the little girl in the break room.
not_available Social Service is on their way.
not_available Jeez, poor kid.
not_available Two weeks is scary enough, but a month?.
not_available And if the biopsy shows scarring.
not_available The brother's out in Waiting.
not_available I'll speak to him.
not_available We are not sending her with that guy.
not_available He's the father.
not_available He deserves to know if his child is gonna be sent off.
not_available He didn't mind abandoning her.
not_available That was six years ago.
not_available This is different.
not_available You think?.
not_available Hey.
not_available It was a slow night.
not_available How did the surgery go?.
not_available She hasn't had it yet.
not_available We discovered Joanie was in heart failure.
not_available What?.
not_available From the car crash?.
not_available No, it's something else, I think.
not_available We're running a test now to assess the damage.

DADE That's Stuart Moore?.
not_available Yeah, he's the father.
not_available Technically.
not_available That's what the birth certificate says.
not_available No criminal record, no history of violence, no record of abuse.
not_available Given the gravity of Joanie's condition, he's a candidate for temporary custody.
not_available lf he wants.
not_available I think he will.
not_available You can't show up after six years and act like nothing's happened.
not_available I'll interview him.
not_available Get a sense if he can handle it.

not_available What about Joanie?.
