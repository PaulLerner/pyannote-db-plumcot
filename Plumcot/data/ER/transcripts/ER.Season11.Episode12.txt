not_available I understand you want to define yourself as chief.
not_available But? Are you sure that this is the way you want to do it? I suck.
not_available No, you don't suck.
not_available You're still learning.
not_available So how are you doing? I processed feelings of anger, shame and guilt in an emotionally safe environment.
not_available I've addressed the urge to use alcohol.
not_available And I've consulted both a shaman and a guru, so I'm all good.
not_available I must've made an impression on you.
not_available You didn't notice I was gone for a week.
not_available Are you high? E.
not_available R.
not_available 11x12 "THE PROVIDERS" Alex, hurry up! The bus is gonna be here! What time do you start? 
not_available Noon.
not_available Is Neela on today? Is Neela on? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I think she is.
not_available It's funny how that keeps working out.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Come on.
not_available She's young, single, lonely.
not_available She's got a crush on you.
not_available I'm her teacher.
not_available She's just trying to learn.
not_available Yeah, bet she is.
not_available Come on.
not_available What? Everyone can see it.
not_available Who's everyone? 
not_available Pratt, Frank Jerry, Morris, Chuny, Haleh.
not_available Even Murray.
not_available Murray? 
not_available That guy who works at the roach coach.
not_available It's not funny, Luka.
not_available You're doing everything to encourage it.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Yeah? Well, it better not be.
not_available Or else I might have to get into some nasty chick fight with Neela.
not_available In the mud? Just don't hurt her.
not_available The only person who's going to get hurt around here is you.
not_available You got it? Yeah, I think it was April.
not_available But the fact that I need a calendar to figure it out is not a good sign.
not_available Did I meet him? 
not_available No.
not_available He drove a motorcycle.
not_available That was his defining characteristic? 
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available What about you? 
not_available Third year.
not_available My gross anatomy instructor.
not_available He was very skilled at prosecting the brachial plexus.
not_available You slept with your instructor? Dr.
not_available Gibson had a very tender way with cadavers.
not_available And you called him Dr.
not_available Gibson? Only in bed.
not_available So basically, neither one of us has gotten any in a ridiculously long time.
not_available Well, at least we have work to keep our minds off men, romance, sex.
not_available Yeah, at least we have that.
not_available Morning.
not_available Hello, Luka.
not_available Dr.

not_available Yeah, it's good.
not_available Very good.
not_available I'm gonna post it.
not_available Carter, I wanna thank you.
not_available I know that my taking over as chief has been stressful.
not_available It's been a little weird for you but you've made the transition a lot easier, and I appreciate it.
not_available Susan, I can't think of anybody I'd rather have as a boss than you.
not_available Sixteenyear
not_available old driver backed into a utility pole.
not_available Okay, hop to it.
not_available And don't call me Susan at work.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Dad was teaching her to parallel park.
not_available She just got her learner's permit.
not_available I got a little bit dizzy, and maybe I got the pedals mixed up.
not_available New scores? Yep, we don't suck as bad as we used to.
not_available Maybe by next week, we'll suck less.
not_available Must be your motivational speeches.
not_available We're pairing Attendings with interns.
not_available Abby, you got me.
not_available Neela, you got Kovac.
not_available What? Big Croatian guy.
not_available You can't miss him.
not_available We've got a double MVC rolling in.
not_available Abby, he's all yours today.
not_available Who? 
not_available Hey.
not_available You guys know each other, right? Hi.
not_available You know how to clear a C
not_available spine clinically? You mean, if it's not tender? That's a no.
not_available Check the NEXUS criteria.
not_available Get back to me tomorrow.
not_available I give you Rodney Dixon and Amanda Field.
not_available Rear
not_available ended by a truck while having sex in his car.
not_available Good vitals on both.
not_available I'd say.
not_available Are they stuck together with superglue? We tried to disengage them but
not_available Oh, it's killing me, man.
not_available Broken pelvis plus lust equalsOh, God! 
not_available Chest is clear, belly's benign.
not_available Back seat of a car, huh? '66 Mustang fastback.
not_available I hope it's not totaled.
not_available Fastback? That's a pretty tight squeeze.
not_available I do Pilates.
not_available It's got a 389
not_available 1 rear gear with a 31 spline axle.
not_available Nice.
not_available You were screwing in an old Ford? What were we supposed to do? My husband was home.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Probably a small crack in the pelvis.
not_available You've got this, right? Oh, I'm all over it.
not_available We'll give you morphine and wait for your Viagra to wear off.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis told me to present to you today.
not_available She did? 
not_available Something about interns having a primary Attending.
not_available Okay.
not_available I hope you'll show me that combat procedure you mentioned last shift.
not_available The femoral tear.
not_available Oh, it depends on whether we get a patient 
not_available who needs emergent central access.
not_available Well, whenever we do.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Infected anal fissure in the hallway.
not_available Okay.
not_available Pupils, four millimeters and reactive.
not_available Ten centimeters JVD.
not_available My wife is not gonna be happy.
not_available It's okay, Dad.
not_available It was my idea.
not_available I take it Mom wasn't aware of the lessons.
not_available If she had it her way, I would never be allowed out.
not_available We're kind of separated for now.
not_available Katie was with me this week.
not_available Does she take any medications? Prednisone, tacrolimus The antirejection drug? 
not_available She had a kidney transplant.
not_available I have polycystic kidney disease.
not_available We were on the UNOS list for seven years waiting for a donor.
not_available Yeah, I'm a big fan of dialysis.
not_available She's got blood type O with an 80 percent reactive antibody panel.
not_available Tough match.
not_available Yeah, well finally got big enough that I could give her one of mine.
not_available Your kidney? What a dad, huh? Any other meds? Yeah, she's on an anti
not_available seizure drug too.
not_available The PKD gave her an aneurysm.
not_available Mom's on the way, sweetie.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay.
not_available A few crackles at the base.
not_available Bradycardic at 48.
not_available Peak T waves, widened QRS.
not_available All right, amp of bicarb, What do you think is going on? Well, low heart rate, dizziness and EKG changes.
not_available Could be hyperkalemia.
not_available What? 
not_available No, no, that can't be.
not_available Hey, John.
not_available Since the transplant, her kidney has been fine.
not_available Why don't we see what the blood tests show then we'll take it from there.
not_available Excuse me for one second.
not_available Do you have an intern on this? 
not_available I got Ray.
not_available What do you think about taking Neela? 
not_available Why? Is there a problem? Just do me a favor, okay? All right, send the Punjabi Powerhouse my way.
not_available Painless jaundice in 3 and ulnar styloid fracture.
not_available I'll take those.
not_available There was a change.
not_available You're with Carter today.
not_available I thought I was with you.
not_available No, he needs you in Trauma 1.
not_available Isolated pubic ramus fracture.
not_available Will I be, you know, all right? No cast, no surgery.
not_available Just rest and pain meds.
not_available But you're gonna have to be careful for a couple of weeks until it heals.
not_available Careful? 
not_available Yes, as in abstinent.
not_available The safest sex of all.
not_available Abstinent? Are you serious? 
not_available Can't put any pressure on your pelvis or you'll end up back here.
not_available Not what we want.
not_available It's the pelvis we should worry about? 
not_available That's right.
not_available But other positions? Yeah, sure.
not_available Get yourself a six
not_available pack, the Kamasutra, and shoot out the lights.
not_available Did we do something to offend her? Pulse is up to 61.
not_available BP's stable.
not_available Looks like the QRS complexes are narrowing.
not_available That's good.
not_available That is good.
not_available The chemistry machine is down.
not_available Should be up in an hour.
not_available You can't say if it's a kidney problem? The urine dip shows four
not_available plus protein.
not_available We won't know until the labs come back.
not_available I told them to hurry.
not_available Honey, are you okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.
not_available Sweetie
not_available It was nothing.
not_available I told you it was too soon for her to drive.
not_available What were you thinking? 
not_available She's 16.
not_available She wants a permit.
not_available You never know when to stop.
not_available Let's not do this here.
not_available Please.
not_available I need more of Katie's family history.
not_available Could we step outside and give Katie a chance to rest? I'll be back, okay, sweetie? I've been sick for so long, it just got to be too much for them.
not_available She was on Dilantin for a long time but she didn't like it.
not_available It changed the way she looked.
not_available She was still having these seizures
not_available It was manageable.
not_available No, honey.
not_available She had them at school, in the movies.
not_available She hated it.
not_available So you switched her medication? 
not_available Three months ago we put her on Zarictal.
not_available It was not my choice.
not_available Zarictal? 
not_available It's new.
not_available And we can't afford it.
not_available Medicare does not cover it.
not_available I took a second job working night security at the Mallers Building.
not_available We lost our apartment.
not_available She's been doing great.
not_available Katie has been seizure
not_available free for three months.
not_available No infections? 
not_available No.
not_available No febrile illnesses? Have they switched her dosage of Zarictal? 
not_available Everything's been steady.
not_available But she was doing fine before.
not_available I don't know why
not_available She wanted to drive.
not_available Like other kids.
not_available With seizures, she couldn't get a license.
not_available We almost lost her and you're worried about her being able to drive? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, I don't want to fight, okay? I think it's time that we accept the fact she will never be totally healthyWhy? 
not_available That's reality! Not for me.
not_available I You have a neurologist? 
not_available Yeah, he's been great.
not_available Good.
not_available Why don't we give him a call.
not_available I'd like to talk to him about the medications.
not_available Sounds like a hard situation.
not_available Look up this new drug for me.
not_available I had a patient on that last year during my internal medicine rotation.
not_available Really? Never heard of it before.
not_available It's pretty new.
not_available Expensive, but very effective for seizure control.
not_available You kids and your fancy book learning.
not_available Yeah, well, I try to keep up.
not_available Do a PDR and check a Medline.
not_available See if there's renal dysfunction associated with the drug.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is George Guidry.
not_available He's got a skin breakdown around the shaft of his penis.
not_available No, he doesn't.
not_available I think I do.
not_available Any discharge? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Definitely.
not_available I'm not talking about that.
not_available No discharge, no fever, no blisters.
not_available Do you use a condom? Not since my girlfriend broke up with me.
not_available No vesicles, no chancre, no lymphadenopathy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's take a gander.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, I just thought of something.
not_available Could this be from too much? You know Too much what? Since Lily left, I've been lonely, you know? Really really lonely.
not_available How lonely? Six, sometimes seven times a day.
not_available I found a report in the Western Journal of Medicine.
not_available It suggests a correlation between renal failure and Zarictal.
not_available Well, that ain't much.
not_available No, but these might be.
not_available From the adverse drug coordinator from the Department of Health Services.
not_available Three possible cases they've forwarded to the FDA.
not_available Four? That could be a pattern.
not_available The Physician Relations number at Keating
not_available Ward Pharmaceuticals.
not_available They make Zarictal.
not_available Might as well see what they can tell us.
not_available Yes.
not_available Keating
not_available Ward Pharmaceuticals.
not_available This is John Carter.
not_available I'm a physician at County General in Chicago.
not_available How are you today, doctor? 
not_available Very well.
not_available I have a 16year
not_available old girl.
Status post
not_available renal transplant who's been on Zarictal for three months.
not_available You say that's three months? Could I talk to somebody about the incidence of renal failure? 
not_available Hold.
not_available Yes, I will hold.
not_available Does anybody even listen to that music? It's terrible.
not_available Carter, QRS is widening on our PKD girl.
not_available Lots of ectopy.
not_available I'll hold.
not_available Multifocal PVCs, runs of six.
not_available Push 80 of lidocaine, and mix up a drip.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available It's possible the elevated potassium is irritating Katie's heart.
not_available BUN, 98.
not_available Creatinine, 12.3.
not_available Potassium, 7.2.
not_available Most likely she might be in kidney failure.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Charge the paddles to 200.
not_available It's going to be okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available And everybody clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Procainamide's onboard.
not_available And clear.
not_available Sinus.
not_available There we go.
not_available Set up for a femoral Quinton.
not_available Call Dialysis for renal orders.
not_available Katie, honey? Katie, honey? 
not_available That's it.
not_available Yeah, she's responding.
not_available O2 on 15 liters.
not_available Are you sure she needs dialysis? It's the best way to remove the excess potassium from her system.
not_available She has to have another transplant? 
not_available That is a distinct possibility, yes.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Okay, Betadine the area.
not_available They said they'd be in contact in a week.
not_available And one percent lido.
not_available A week? 
not_available That's the standard procedure.
not_available What's that? 
not_available We telephoned the company that makes Katie's medication.
not_available So is it the drug? Is that why this is happening? The timing of the med switch makes me think that is a possibility, yes.
not_available But her kidney is being damaged by the Zarictal, is that
not_available ? Gabriel, Hannah, I came as soon as I heard.
not_available Was she in status? 
not_available No, it's her kidney.
not_available This is Katie's neurologist, George Henry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, I don't know if you remember me
not_available Yeah, how are you, Henry? What has it been, six years? Give or take.
not_available Can you take them to the family room? I'll be right in to see you.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Yeah, that's fine.
not_available I think I remember the way.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I gave pleasure boy some Neosporin, a therapist's number, and sent him packing.
not_available Well done.
not_available How about you? Is everything all right? Yes, I'm fine.
not_available Busy.
not_available Why? Well, last week when I ran into you on the El platform I didn't realize your situation.
not_available My situation? It's just that I I heard what you went through.
not_available I didn't want you to think I was insensitive.
not_available No, I was happy not to have to talk about it actually.
not_available Okay.
not_available Guess I'm blowing that now.
not_available I just I wanna make sure that there isn't anything that I can do.
not_available Well, that's
not_available That's nice.
not_available It is.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's I
not_available Here's an H &amp; P, and get back to me.
not_available Right.
not_available Why did you put me with this guy? When did everyone become schedule divas? I don't need a med student.
not_available I don't like them, and I'm better flying solo.
not_available Is there something wrong with him? 
not_available No, he's excellent.
not_available He's very good.
not_available He's excellent.
not_available I just
not_available Oh, no.
not_available You like him? 
not_available You know what, forget it.
not_available Yes, you do! You do! You're blushing.
not_available We never had this conversation.
not_available Hey, haven't you had enough of doctors? Put a message on the neurology and renal newsgroups, see if there's anything 
not_available on the drug's renal toxicity.
not_available That could cause a bit of a stir.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right just ask for any information that might help us best determine treatment.
not_available You heard what he said.
not_available I don't believe it's the drug.
not_available I think that there are other options.
not_available We have a dialysis tech coming down.
not_available I called UNOS.
not_available They're gonna put Katie on the list.
not_available John, that may be premature.
not_available Why don't we do a biopsy.
not_available This may be a case of rejection, not failure, and a biopsy would show us that.
not_available What's the difference? Well, a drug
not_available induced failure would require a transplant.
not_available But rejection Rejection could be reversed with immunosuppressive agents.
not_available Well, let's do the biopsy.
not_available Okay, I'll put that in motion.
not_available Dr.
not_available Henry, can I have a word with you outside, please? Excuse me one second.
not_available My intern's been doing research.
not_available She's found four cases 
not_available of renal failure in patients on Zarictal.
not_available Well, that doesn't prove causation.
not_available It gets you going that way.
not_available KeatingWard sponsored a series of phase
not_available three clinical trials.
not_available If there was any real risk, the FDA would never have approved the drug.
not_available What, you never heard of Vioxx or Rezulin? This is a successful anti
not_available seizure medicine.
not_available It has improved Katie's quality of life dramatically.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, dialysis is here.
not_available Page Dubenko to come down for the biopsy? Sure.
not_available These need your signature.
not_available Well, I hope you're right.
not_available Let's be certain.
not_available I was really surprised to find you still working here.
not_available Why is that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just guess I thought you would've moved on by now.
not_available I guess I'm just a masochist that way.
not_available How about you? I thought you wanted to go do bench research.
not_available Yeah, well, I got tired of it.
not_available You were good at it.
not_available Well, I've got a wife and two small children now.
not_available It changes one's priorities.
not_available You mean, money? My practice does offer me three times the salary of an academic position.
not_available Well, what about you, huh? Married? Children? Not yet.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll find you when the surgeon comes down.
not_available Are you moonlighting as a word processor? Our PKD girl's on a new drug we're trying to get information on.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Morning.
not_available Hi.
not_available Has anyone seen
not_available ? Is that your coffee? Sorry.
not_available It's a schedule, not a cocktail napkin.
not_available GCS, 12.
not_available BP, 60 palp.
not_available Brady at 52.
not_available Fell from the roof? 
not_available Taking down lights.
not_available He's going to need central access.
not_available Need help? 
not_available Come on down.
not_available Carter doesn't need you? Not at the moment, no.
not_available Okay, prime the rapid infuser.
not_available Can't find a vein.
not_available Pressure's only 50.
not_available Heart rate's 42.
not_available Blood in the belly.
not_available He needs access.
not_available He's about to arrest.
not_available Set up for a saphenous cutdown.
not_available Wouldn't a femoral be easier to find? And faster.
not_available Probably the same difference.
not_available But, okay, femoral tear.
not_available Cool, I've never done one.
not_available You'll do the next one.
not_available Scalpel to Neela.
not_available What? She's along for the ride.
not_available I promised her.
not_available You promised her? Ten centimeters, vertical flash.
not_available Starting here? Deep into the sub
not_available Q.
not_available Level one is primed.
not_available Okay, and now you tear Got any sterile surgical markers? There's the femoral vein.
not_available Cannulate it with the 9 French.
not_available Let me try.
not_available No, I'll get it.
not_available Just reach under.
not_available Neela, focus on the field.
not_available Seldinger technique.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Two units ready to go.
not_available Sam, can you ask Dubenko to come here when he's done? Yes, sir, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available That's the lower lobe of the kidney there.
not_available Mark the depth.
not_available Purple okay? 
not_available That's my favorite color.
not_available Me too.
not_available Three centimeters.
not_available They need you next door.
not_available What is this gonna do? It'll tell us if your body is rejecting the kidney.
not_available Lidocaine.
not_available That's a good thing, honey.
not_available All right, hold still.
not_available Little pinprick here.
not_available There you go.
not_available It's going to be, like, 20
not_available something before I can get another one.
not_available No, that's not going to happen.
not_available Biopsy gun.
not_available You just need to tell your immune system to stop being so picky.
not_available Firing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver's on the phone.
not_available She sounds kind of Kind of what? Weaver
not_available like.
not_available I'll call her back.
not_available Purple, huh? I've always been partial to azure myself.
not_available What's azure? 
not_available Like your eyes.
not_available Send that off for light microscopy, EM and IF staining.
not_available Pack the wound with a moist gauze.
not_available What do we have here? Belly bleed needs a post
not_available op head CT.
not_available We have FFP thawing.
not_available Send it upstairs.
not_available Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
not_available Heart rate's 90.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, I I never knew it was possible to transfuse that fast.
not_available Well, that's the beauty of the central venous cutdown.
not_available Now you know how to do it.
not_available What made you recommend Zarictal? 
not_available A luncheon at Northwestern.
not_available I heard a neurologist present on its efficacies.
not_available A neurologist who's a paid consultant of Keating
not_available Ward.
not_available So what? It stopped
not_available George? Dr.
not_available Carter? Is everything all right? If the biopsy doesn't give us what we want if she needs another kidney could I give her my other one? That would require you being on dialysis for the rest of your life.
not_available No, I understand that.
not_available I don't know it's even ethical for someone to donate their only remaining kidney.
not_available So it's not possible.
not_available I don't know of any responsible doctor that would agree to do it.
not_available Gabe, listen.
not_available I
not_available I know that you're scared.
not_available But let's just take this one step at a time.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Go in there and be with Katie.
not_available Carter.
not_available Some neurologist in Skokie sent this fax for you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's a "Dear doctor" letter from the pharmaceutical company.
not_available It says there have been isolated cases of renal failure on Zarictal.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available It recommends monthly monitoring of renal function which I've been doing with Katie.
not_available BUN, creatinine.
not_available You got one of these? 
not_available Yes, so did you.
not_available Letters were sent to every physician in the country.
not_available They're a caution.
not_available So you knew about this.
not_available Private practitioners get letters like that all the time.
not_available I followed its recommendations.
not_available But you know what the biopsy's gonna show, says so right here.
not_available Well, I'm hoping that's not the case.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, do you have a moment? Problem? No, Kerry just
not_available You posted a warning about Zarictal on an Internet message board? I posted a request for information.
not_available I'm getting a lot of phone calls.
not_available I hate phone calls.
not_available Neurologists, our head of nephrology, the director from KW Pharmaceuticals
not_available Just wanted to be better informed.
not_available By jumping to conclusions based on skimpy evidence? Tell it to the Milners, their daughter needs a new kidney.
not_available You have one sick girl, that's unfortunate.
not_available The drug companies have access to thousands of patients before they release a drugThey didn't use any renal patients when
not_available They can't document every side effect.
not_available You're working beyond your responsibility.
not_available You telling me how to do my job? I'm telling you the FDA has an Adverse Drug Event division
not_available Which is run by political appointees funded by the drug companies.
not_available The number one lobbyist in the country is the pharmaceutical industry.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Pick up a bottle.
not_available Kerry
not_available Do it.
not_available Pravastatin.
not_available Saves millions from heart attacks and strokes.
not_available Enoxaparin.
not_available Know what this is? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available It offers better PE prophylaxis and allows DVT patients to be treated at home.
not_available Linezolid.
not_available Fights off strains of MRSA that used to be fatal.
not_available I think he gets it.
not_available Does he? 
not_available Yeah, he does.
not_available These drugs save lives.
not_available The companies that make them donate $20 million to our academic programs.
not_available Without that, we have no hospital.
not_available We'd be standing in a mini
not_available mall.
not_available That makes it okay to suppress results? 
not_available Who says that's what they're doing? Putting these drugs out here, seeing how they work is how we learn.
not_available It's how medicine advances.
not_available And that's not naive? Your job is to take care of your patients, not start a crusade.
not_available Susan, you're the boss.
not_available Tell him to keep his eye on the ball.
not_available No more computer access for you.
not_available It's like I forgot where I was.
not_available I was just looking at him like he was a huge 
not_available cupcake.
not_available You want one? It's just a metaphor.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So you have a crush on Luka.
not_available That's kind of weird.
not_available It's just a crush.
not_available Crushes are by nature idealized, unrealistic.
not_available What about Dr.
not_available Gibson? That sounded real.
not_available Gross, but real.
not_available My God, you're right.
not_available It's a pattern.
not_available I'm a slut for authority.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Well, what about you? What about me? I heard you punched your med student? 
not_available So? He was bugging me.
not_available So you're hung up on a subordinate.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available I have a thing for a supervisor.
not_available So, what, I'm like the yin to your yang? What are we gonna do? Ignore it, hope it goes away.
not_available Right.
not_available No need to discuss it.
not_available No, denial works.
not_available Sam, dog bite in 3.
not_available I wrote for Unasyn.
not_available I'll get to it.
not_available You check on my biopsy results yet? 
not_available Yeah, Dubenko is on his way.
not_available What about my patient in Exam 2? 
not_available I'm waiting on a repeat CBC.
not_available Sam? Done and sent.
not_available Nice seeing you all.
not_available Isometric vacuolization of the renal tubular cells 
not_available consistent with drug toxicity.
not_available No chance that this is rejection? No tubulitis, no edema, no inflammation.
not_available The girl needs a new kidney.
not_available And it's from the drug? I'd say so 
not_available but I don't want to encourage you.
not_available Encourage me? Some of my colleagues were suggesting you've been all over the Internet with this.
not_available I was trying to be thorough.
not_available Word of advice? Don't piss off the money people.
not_available Hi, everybody.
not_available This is Katie's biopsy results.
not_available And unfortunately, they are not what we had hoped for.
not_available So it's not rejection? No.
not_available No, it's irreversibly damaged.
not_available And is this from the Zarictal? No, it could be from the tacrolimus she's been on.
not_available I doubt that.
not_available Her levels have been therapeutic for two years.
not_available So this drug I've been working two jobs to pay for just to make her life better has ruined her donated kidney? I'm afraid so.
not_available You told me
not_available You told us it was working.
not_available Sometimes drug interaction can only become apparent after the first year or two of release.
not_available This couldn't have been anticipated.
not_available So we're back to waiting? Well, UNOS will prioritize her for a new kidney.
not_available That will take three, four years, if we're lucky? In the meantime, I'm gonna recommend we get a surgeon down here to see about creating a forearm shunt to facilitate dialysis access.
not_available I can take care of that.
not_available Okay.
not_available We're back to where we started.
not_available She'll be on that machine all through high school? Through college? Just because it took a while to get the kidney
not_available No, it didn't take a while, there wasn't one.
not_available I gave her mine.
not_available We have given up a lot.
not_available Made a lot of sacrifices.
not_available You told me this drug was worth it.
not_available Okay, show me your incision.
not_available Fifth ICS, anterior axillary line.
not_available Go for it.
not_available Pulse ox is 92 on five liters.
not_available Push that in just superior to the rib.
not_available Okay, spread the clamp.
not_available Sats are coming up.
not_available And slip your finger into the pleural space.
not_available I lost the tract.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Keep your finger in there.
not_available Just guide the tube.
not_available I'm above the rib, but it won't pass.
not_available There you go.
not_available Okay.
not_available That is where you want to go.
not_available All right, I got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Keep advancing.
not_available A little bit deeper, because you want all the ports in the pleural space.
not_available Thora
not_available Seal's ready, so is suction.
not_available That's very good.
not_available Hello? Okay, sew it in.
not_available Somebody put something in the water today? Call it "pulseless electrical activity following trauma." 
not_available Right.
not_available Change "blade" into "scalpel." Don't say "torn," say "dissected." Call it the "field of exposure." You left out the size of the cordis.
not_available 9 French.
not_available Okay, write it down.
not_available And not "blood." "Packed red cells." Okay, good job.
not_available Just make the changes, and I'll co
not_available sign.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Neela.
not_available I hope I didn't give you the wrong impression.
not_available You're a Resident and I'm an Attending, and I want to help you learn
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, it's justI wouldn't want anything to get
not_available I got it, I got it.
not_available I got it, thanks.
not_available Vitals are stable.
not_available I need to grab an amp of bicarb.
not_available Okay.
not_available Katie's T waves are back to normal which means her potassium has come down.
not_available That's good.
not_available He went to work.
not_available Mr.
not_available Milner? He took a second job as a security guard over at the jewelry center just to try to help pay for everything, you know? Nothing means more to him than Katie getting well.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Her illness just changed him.
not_available Ruined our marriage.
not_available It's important to stay optimistic.
not_available A lot of good things could still happen, Mrs.
not_available Milner.
not_available MVC with passenger
not_available space intrusion.
not_available ETA, 7.
not_available Okay, we'll take it.
not_available What's MVC? Motor vehicle collision, another new protocol.
not_available No such thing as an accident.
not_available I liked MVA.
not_available I like walks in the springtime.
not_available John, a minute, please? I'll catch up to you.
not_available I was aware of the potential for toxicity.
not_available But it was only one case report in an obscure journal.
not_available Well, you could have found out more doing a simple Medline search.
not_available I can't do a Medline search every time I put a patient on a new drug.
not_available I've got 20 patients on Zarictal.
not_available Twenty? They're all doing well.
not_available What, are you on the Keating
not_available Ward payroll? Listen, as part of an ongoing study I send in a monthly update on each patient's progress.
not_available And they compensate you? A small stipend for my time.
not_available Hope your malpractice premiums are paid.
not_available There's nothing wrong with it.
not_available I am reimbursed for helping monitor a drug by doing thorough patient evaluations.
not_available That the company only pays attention to if it says what they want it to.
not_available Her seizures stopped.
not_available She was very happy.
not_available The father was thrilled.
not_available He's real thrilled now.
not_available Listen, I am trying to be a cutting
not_available edge clinician.
not_available That's what the patients want.
not_available Guys.
not_available I have to offer the most efficacious meds on the market.
not_available Well, the problem is that last part, isn't it? The market.
not_available What? Mr.
not_available Milner? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I was I was going to work, and I thought, "Why? " What is the point now? Gabe, put the gun away.
not_available I put everything in your hands.
not_available Everything.
not_available And you let her down.
not_available Listen, Katie can still live a long, productive life on dialysis.
not_available Okay, whoa.
not_available Come on, why shouldn't I? 
not_available Please.
not_available You know what we should do? Let's go inside and see your family.
not_available Come on, let's go inside and we'll see your family right now.
not_available I want to give my kidney to her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, maybe I was wrong about that.
not_available Maybe you can be the donor.
not_available You're lying.
not_available I know you're lying.
not_available Fix her, okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available For me.
not_available Yeah, we're gonna fix her.
not_available Sats down to 88.
not_available Can you see the cords? Lots of blood.
not_available All right, somebody go find his wife.
not_available Okay, tube.
not_available And get that girl out of here.
not_available Come on, move her to another room.
not_available Gray matter covers the occiput.
not_available Why the hell would he do this? 
not_available He was distraught.
not_available Pupils fixed and dilated.
not_available Pressure's only 80/60.
not_available Start dopamine at 10 mics.
not_available No gag when I tubed him.
not_available No.
not_available No corneal reflex.
not_available Can he regain any function? No, he's as brain
not_available dead as they come.
not_available I'll go talk to her.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no, wait.
not_available Let me.
not_available I'm her family's doctor.
not_available Transplant coordinator's down.
not_available Technically, there's nobody else who can give consent.
not_available The girl has a very rare tissue type, Amparo.
not_available The father is a match.
not_available I've made that clear to UNOS.
not_available Look, I'm trying to get them to allow us to proceed.
not_available For now, keep him on Fi02 of 100.
not_available Make sure the girl's NPO in the hope she goes to the O.R.
not_available Just do everything that you can, okay? 
not_available I will.
not_available Go back under your rock.
not_available I'm from the Trib.
not_available It's a good paper.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available You guys endorsed Bush.
not_available Man, a guy shoots himself.
not_available What's next, a plague of frogs? There's a gang of press outside.
not_available Someone has to go talk to them 
not_available get them the hell out of here.
not_available Obviously, the guy was depressed.
not_available All we know is he's in critical condition.
not_available We can't go into any details.
not_available "Heartfelt sympathy to the family.
not_available We're doing everything we can." Good? You want me to talk to them? 
not_available You treated these people.
not_available Just play up the fact we're respecting the family's privacy, okay? M.A.P.
not_available is only 90.
not_available Can we go up on the dopamine? We're maxed out.
not_available I got a p.
not_available r.n.
not_available for Levophed.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available Maybe we need to talk? No, we really don't.
not_available It's just he helped me to adjust coming back to work here.
not_available He made things a lot easier, and I guess I don't know, I got confused.
not_available I get confused every time I look at him.
not_available Did you work on this family? His daughter, yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Levophed's going at two mics.
not_available Does Gabriel Milner have a daughter being treated in ER? 
not_available Yes, he does.
not_available Now, is it true she's suffering from kidney failure? 
not_available I can't say.
not_available Didn't you indicate that earlier on a medical website? No, I made some general queries 
not_available Abby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available Do you want to go get something to eat? I know this awesome little Ethiopian place.
not_available They make you eat with your hands but I got sterile gloves in my bag, so it's okay.
not_available Dinner? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available But don't take it personally.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm not really a subtle guy.
not_available But I was under the impression that there's sort of a thing happening here.
not_available Maybe not a big thing, but still, a thing.
not_available A thing? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, maybe there's a thing but you know what, nothing's gonna happen.
not_available Why is that? 
not_available Well, a lot of reasons which I won't mention because I don't feel like sharing my checkered past.
not_available Why? 
not_available Or my various neuroses.
not_available But there's one really big reason that's a deal breaker for me.
not_available You miss the beard? No.
not_available You're my student.
not_available I'm grading you.
not_available Well, I think that that is not appropriate.
not_available And have a good night.
not_available You know, what if I was willing to take an F right now? Yeah, I forgot to mention to you that I'm dropping out of med school.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who wants to be a doctor anyway? It's incumbent upon you to share the information if you have possible fatal side effects of a popular new drug? Katie Milner was on Zarictal for three months and, yes, I believe the drug ruined her kidney.
not_available "Out of respect for the family, that's all I can say." Is that so hard? 
not_available They knew it all already.
not_available No, they didn't.
not_available You're alleging potential slander that could cost the hospital millions in support.
not_available What are you worried about, free pens, coffee cups and drug samples? I'm worried about research grants, a thing HIPAA calls "patient confidentiality." I didn't want to talk to them! 
not_available "Out of respect for the family." You wanna talk to them, then you do it.
not_available It's your damn ER.
not_available You're right, I will.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Oh, I wonder what she wants to talk to me about? It's true, right? You did a good thing.
not_available You say that like it matters.
not_available You ready to go? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available UNOS gave us the go ahead.
not_available We're gonna do the transplant.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available They're bringing Mr.
not_available Milner up.
not_available She doesn't know where the kidney's coming from.
not_available I haven't told her yet.
not_available That can wait.
not_available Let's go inside and talk with the anesthesiologist.
not_available You a medical student? First
not_available year Resident.
not_available How's that going? Some days are better than others.
not_available I like it well enough.
not_available What do you think they'll tell Katie? They'll tell her that her father loved her.
not_available Maybe too much.
not_available Transplant surgery's underway.
not_available I can't take responsibility for how the system works but I can try to do my job better.
not_available That's all any of us can do.
not_available I don't know why I was surprised to find you here.
not_available Of course you're still here.
not_available Hope we see each other again, under more favorable circumstances.
not_available You were always good to me when I was a student.
not_available I remember that.
not_available Anspaugh wants to see us and Weaver in his office tomorrow morning.
not_available Suture removal in Curtain 3.
not_available Hey if any of this rolls back onto you, I'm sorry.
not_available Mr.
not_available Klossey? 
not_available Hi, doc.
not_available How are you today? What are we looking at here? I did this skiing on Michigan Avenue, cross
not_available country, during the last big snow.
not_available Little fall, gashed my arm.
not_available But I hadn't done it in 10 years, so even that felt good.
not_available Why did you stop? 
not_available Arthritis.
not_available I had it bad.
not_available Couldn't bowl, couldn't sit in those seats at Wrigley take my niece for a walk.
not_available So, what happened? I saw an ad on TV for Renuvium.
not_available A doc at the clinic gave me a prescription.
not_available Fixed me right up.
not_available Renuvium? 
not_available Yeah, a little red pill once in the morning, let me do all those things I thought I had given up forever.
not_available That's something, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, this might hurt just a little bit.
not_available Damn miracle of medicine, that's what it is.
