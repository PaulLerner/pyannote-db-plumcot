not_available Yeah, hi.
not_available I Don't worry about it.
not_available This is always falling apart.
not_available Okay, actually, it goes like this.
not_available Are you sure you're a doctor? I was a surgical resident for a year.
not_available I guess it's easier taking things out than putting it back in.
not_available I was waiting and I accidentally eviscerated this guy.
not_available I heard about the shooting.
not_available Are you okay? Did you need something? I've been doing some thinking about you and me.

not_available There's only a two
not_available hour window to retrieve the eggs.
not_available I don't think that's gonna be possible now.
not_available Why, did I damage my ovaries? 
not_available Head CT looks normal.
not_available We think you may have had a small blood clot in your brain which caused you to pass out and crash your car.
not_available But I'm okay now? We need to give you blood thinners to prevent more clotting.
not_available I'll go to the clinic and come back.
not_available You need heparin now, which means you can't have an invasive procedure.
not_available When I come back, you can do whatever.
not_available I have to harvest these eggs.

not_available Does your mom know? 
not_available Maybe you should tell her.
not_available No.
not_available Don't tell her.
not_available She'll freak out completely.
not_available It's a big decision.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available All my life I wanted a baby.
not_available She's a good cop.
not_available Saved my ass a couple of times.
not_available No one ever wants to draw their gun.
not_available She was forced to make a split
not_available second decision.
not_available Was she? She followed the guidelines.

not_available She
not_available Look.

not_available Don't you think it's better to tell her now?

not_available No.
not_available Don't even bother.
not_available We really do.
not_available Well, what is it? You're in liver failure.
not_available How'd that happen? You need to huff pretty much 
not_available every day to hurt your liver.
not_available People drink every day.
not_available This is worse.
not_available We have to start looking for a donor.
not_available A donor? You could die if you don't have a liver transplant.
not_available Is this another one of your scare tactics? No.
not_available Mark, Laura's crashing.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She slumped over, stopped breathing.
not_available I should have heparinized.

not_available Number 8 ET tube, suction.
not_available No muscle tone in the legs either.

not_available What happened next? Mrs.
not_available Howard was startled, and she raised the gun.
not_available Pointed at anyone in particular? 
not_available No, no one specifically.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll notify you if we need anything else.
not_available That's it? Yeah.
not_available Something you'd like to add? 
not_available Yeah, they could have grabbed the gun.
not_available What makes you say that? 
not_available She was a frail, frightened, demented elderly woman.
not_available She didn't know what she was doing.
not_available But she still could have fired it.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But? They didn't need to shoot her.
not_available Was she huffing? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I've talked to her about drugs.
not_available But you never know.
not_available I don't think she does drugs.
not_available I shouldn't have let her go on that field trip.
not_available Why? 
not_available She's been sick.
not_available She tells me she's been throwing up every morning.
not_available Could that be gallstones? My mother had them.
not_available Do you know when was her last period? I don't keep track.
not_available She has a boyfriend? Is she pregnant? 
not_available That little slut.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Perault.

not_available Get her out.
not_available I need you to step outside.
not_available I need you to mind your own business.
not_available Mrs.

not_available You tell them I told you? 
not_available Didn't have to.
not_available They told us.
not_available They told you, or you asked? 
not_available Either way, it's not a problem.
not_available They think I squealed.
not_available Bo is gonna kick the crap out of me! Don't worry about Bo.
not_available Everything is gonna be all right.
not_available No.
not_available It won't.
not_available They saw me naked! 
not_available They just saw you from the waist up.
not_available They're gonna make fun of me forever.
not_available Listen, I knew a boy who was a little husky.
not_available He didn't have many friends all the kids used to make fun of him.
not_available So he spent most of his time studying.
not_available And he went on to college and he became a surgeon.
not_available And at his high
not_available school reunion, he took out his scalpel and he cut the tongues off of every kid who ever made fun of him.
not_available That supposed to cheer me up, doc? Okay.
not_available Help me immobilize the small intestine.
not_available Pancreas is fine.
not_available Take a look at this.
not_available It's a hematoma of the duodenum.
not_available Yeah.

not_available Fine.
not_available Shirley, call in another scrub tech.
not_available I need an extra pair of hands.
not_available Okay.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I won't go.

not_available Stuart, do one for me.
not_available Blink
not_available 182.
not_available Looks like he's found some new friends.
not_available How'd you do that? Well, I guess it's a little late for lunch.
not_available Well, we got busy with all these kids.
not_available How about dinner? I'll probably grab a Happy Meal on the way home.
not_available Okay, I deserve that.
not_available Now you can forgive me.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm starving.
not_available You, me, a couple of big steaks.
not_available I'm a vegetarian.

not_available I'll call you when I know something more specific.
not_available I thought you were over this age thing.
not_available I am.
not_available So, what was that about? Do you know Abby? 
not_available No, but she seems nice.
not_available She's nice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, she's just
not_available She's always had this thing for me.
not_available You used to go out with her? She's got some issues.
not_available She gets weird around other nurses and stuff, so it's probably best not to let her on
not_available Let on about us.
not_available I'll meet you down here after your shift.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sounds like a plan.
not_available Okay.
not_available When you have a chance, her family wants to talk to you.
not_available Peter.
not_available Hey.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Howard's sodium was 172.
not_available What? She was delirious because of profound dehydration.
not_available Did you check her mucous membranes? I examined her abdomen for post
not_available op complications.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Well, didn't you examine her? I shotgunned her labs and gave her to you.
not_available Come here.
not_available This whole thing was preventable.
not_available If I had recognized the problem and started an IV hell, given her a glass of water, she might still be alive.
not_available You don't know.
not_available Takes time to make a diagnosis when we're busy.
not_available She wouldn't have grabbed the gun.
not_available No reason for them to shoot her.
not_available You'll see a tube in her mouth hooked up to a ventilator.
not_available Well, she's not breathing? The stroke affected the part of her brain that controls breathing.
not_available Will that get better? We'll have to wait and see.
not_available Here.
not_available You can sit down.
not_available Laura? It's Greg.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available God, she's only 23.
not_available How could she have a stroke? We think the fertility drugs caused the blood clot.
not_available Fertility drugs? The injections.
not_available What are you talking about? I talked to her gynecologist.
not_available Your wife was trying to be an egg donor.
not_available She was selling her eggs? There was an infertile couple willing to pay $80,000.
not_available We have this little hardware store.
not_available Bills are stacking up.
not_available Business is down We're about to file for bankruptcy.
not_available I guess she was trying to help.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You didn't have to do this, honey.
not_available You didn't have to do this.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Carter around? 
not_available He was here a minute ago.
not_available Will you tell him I'll be late? There's a new admission to the PICU.
not_available No problem.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Rena.
not_available Abby.
not_available You're Dr.
not_available Carter's friend? 
not_available That's right.
not_available I hope you don't mind me spending time with John.
not_available Why would I? 
not_available Well, he told me.
not_available Told you what? About you and him.
not_available Me and him? I don't want there to be any hard feelings.
not_available I understand how some relationships take longer to get over than others.
not_available He told you we had a relationship? I find his honesty refreshing.
not_available He's different than most guys.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available He's special.
not_available Good view of the heartbeat.
not_available There's the head.
not_available "Explore new places.

not_available lifetime opportunity.
not_available " 
not_available That's so perfect.
not_available What? My horoscope.
not_available What's your sign? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, when's your birthday? Looks like you're about So when will I have it? 
not_available November.
not_available Early Christmas present.
not_available Look, how cute.
not_available Babies are a lot of responsibility.
not_available I know.
not_available It's hard work getting up in the middle of the night.
not_available It's easy if you love them.
not_available How old was your mom when you were born? Sixteen.
not_available Maybe if she had waited a couple years she would have been a better mother.
not_available I'm way more mature than she was at 16.
not_available I'm gonna have a social worker stop by to see you.
not_available Good.
not_available I need to sign up.
not_available For what? Money.
not_available When my friend Gina had her baby she started getting a check every month.
not_available Your wife wanted Randi, any word from the O.R.? 
not_available They're still working.
not_available No, no! I said no! 
not_available We won't harm her in any way.
not_available Stay the hell away from my wife! Dr.
not_available Alexander, Mark Greene.
not_available Could you keep her out of here, please? What are you doing? 
not_available Discussing his wife's condition.
not_available Right now you're a consultant.
not_available Talk to me first.
not_available I couldn't find you.
not_available I was reviewing her records when he walked in.
not_available You were twisting his arm because you want to harvest the eggs.
not_available I was presenting it as an option.
not_available He'll never let you do it.
not_available She's already given her consent.
not_available He just lost his wife.
not_available Leave him alone.
not_available She's gonna need a lengthy hospitalization.
not_available And then roundthe
not_available clock home care.
not_available That's a tremendous financial burden.
not_available Thanks to your fertility drugs.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I've been doing IVF for 12 years and I've never seen this happen.
not_available She must have a protein S or an anti
not_available thrombin deficiency.
not_available Those are pretty rare conditions.
not_available Not as rare as a vascular occlusion from FSH.
not_available I'll send up the labs.
not_available There's an hour left to retrieve the eggs.
not_available It's a 10
not_available minute procedure but it'll give them a nice financial cushion.
not_available Why don't you try and calm him down, discuss the situation.
not_available Another Vicryl.
not_available Why don't you go take a nap? 
not_available Because I've got my second wind.
not_available Well, it's about time.
not_available I'm happy to close.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available Skin stapler.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene called again.
not_available He'd like you to phone him when the case is over.
not_available How sweet.

not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I'm peachy.
not_available What's wrong? I don't know, maybe I'm still getting over our breakup.
not_available You talked to Rena.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I panicked.
not_available IWhat did you say to her? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available No, really.
not_available Really.
not_available Against my better judgment and everything I hold sacred in life I covered for you.
not_available So you owe me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Also, I told her I dumped you.
not_available You dumped me? She believe you? Of course she did.
not_available Why wouldn't she? Well, it's just You'd never dump me.
not_available I would dump you like a bad habit.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I definitely think I'd dump you first.
not_available In your dreams, maybe.
not_available I would dump you.
not_available No, you wouldn't.
not_available You're acting crazy now.

not_available She in any pain? No.
not_available Left ovary looks good.
not_available She wrote children's books.
not_available Did you know that? Those were our bedtime stories.
not_available I still can't believe this is happening.
not_available She's had dementia for such a long time.
not_available I know.
not_available Usually she's forgetful or thinks she's still living at home.
not_available But she's never been agitated or violent.
not_available I can't imagine her fighting with the police.
not_available So you're sure it's nothing from the surgery? No, no.
not_available Dementia is a progressive illness.
not_available Over time there's worsening psychiatric symptoms.
not_available You know, it's been so hard to watch her deteriorate.
not_available Even little things can lead to agitation.
not_available Sleep deprivation, a bladder infection.
not_available Actually, we think it was dehydration.
not_available From not drinking enough? There's too many people at that nursing home.
not_available They weren't even giving her water.
not_available I never should have moved her out.
not_available It was too much for you.
not_available I could have done it.
not_available I could have cared for her.
not_available I was the one who put her in there.
not_available This is not your fault.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I know she appreciated your kindness.
not_available I was looking everywhere for you.
not_available Is that Dermabond? How's he gonna get it off? Maybe he'll find some acetone.
not_available Carter, could you pitch in with some chart reviews? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available I promised Rena I'd help her study.

not_available I thought you'd never get out.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available How are you? If I don't get off my feet, my ankles are going to explode.
not_available Did your patient make it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How was your day? 
not_available The usual.

not_available Cherry Garcia.
not_available Let's go with the ice cream first.
not_available I had the most difficult case today, and I got through it.
not_available That's good.
not_available Have some.
not_available Now that it's over, I'm thinking why do I have to prove that a pregnant surgeon can be competent? I don't know.

not_available I'm going to rest I'm gonna take care of myself and my baby.
