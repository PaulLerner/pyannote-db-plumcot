not_available You notice? She's pregnant.
not_available How could you be so stupid? Are you gonna marry her? I don't know.
not_available Be a father to your child? She's not good enough for you? 
not_available I didn't say that.

not_available You're playing with fire here.
not_available I can juggle.
not_available Women can smell deceit.
not_available You ought to know.
not_available Those days are long gone, my friend.
not_available So what do you do now? Give advice.
not_available The form was very confusing.
not_available Evidently.
not_available What's going on? Haleh's playing nurse manager while Carol's away.
not_available I ordered 12 emesis basins.
not_available She ordered 12 gross.
not_available Anybody seen our paychecks? 
not_available Ask your friendly nurse manager.
not_available They always come in by noon.
not_available Hey, did you guys see this memo from Dr.
not_available Fischer? He wants to swab and culture everyone for resistant staph.
not_available What's this about? Eight patients got staph.
not_available They think we're spreading it.
not_available Any idea who? 
not_available Could be anyone.
not_available You, me Jerry, get these boxes out of here.
not_available You haven't filled this out.

not_available Dr.

not_available But I've got more experience, right? Dr.
not_available Benton? Ask Dr.

not_available Well, you're in luck.
not_available She has bilateral pneumothoraces.
not_available You can each put one in.
not_available I'll take this side.
not_available Fine.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Peter, are you okay? I like to make a subcutaneous tunnel to avoid an air leak.
not_available That's nice.
not_available Where'd you learn that? I don't remember.
not_available Kerry, you got this? Are you sure you're okay? Just a little indigestion.
not_available Try to avoid hitting the intercostal bundle.
not_available It's a common intern mistake.
not_available For surgical interns.
not_available Mine's in! How're you doing over there? This says that 40% of doctors don't wash their hands between patients.
not_available No kidding.
not_available And medical personnel pick their noses three times an hour.
not_available Many interns bathe twice a week I don't want to be that well
not_available informed.
not_available Doug, we've got a sick kid out front.
not_available All right.
not_available Nice technique.
not_available Could I interest you in some detective work? I'm tracking the culprit that's been spreading the staph.
not_available Good luck.
not_available I could really use your help.
not_available It's not an attractive proposition.
not_available We both know where staph comes from.
not_available Not washing their hands after using the bathroom.

not_available We can't wait.
not_available He doesn't want to.
not_available Does he have a DNR order? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Yes, he does.
not_available If he's DNR, we can't tube him.
not_available He'll die if we don't tube him.
not_available Jad, please.
not_available Please don't leave me.

not_available Mark Greene.
not_available He's one of our regulars.
not_available Archie, snap it! Thanks.
not_available That's amazing.
not_available Basic behavior therapy.
not_available Would it work on my daughter? 
not_available What's her problem? She started sucking her thumb when my wife and I got divorced.
not_available My 6year
not_available old wet the bed when I got divorced.
not_available You used behavioral therapy? No.
not_available Electroshock.
not_available Works like a charm.
not_available Kidding! I'm just kidding.
not_available I hate to interrupt.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Let's go upstairs and talk.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available You too.
not_available We're losing him.
not_available Any word on the DNR? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Found some weed in his socks.
not_available He's smoking dope with CF? Must be a death wish.

not_available Bless you.
not_available He's not sick.
not_available He's blowing off a date.
not_available I'm gonna get to bed early.
not_available So I'll call you tomorrow? Bye, Pol.
not_available What's wrong with Polly? 
not_available Don't start.
not_available He had to make room for Heather.
not_available So you got two on the line? Hi, Mark.
not_available I forgot Mr.
not_available Papillion's chart.
not_available That's a coincidence because I have it right here.
not_available A Freudian might say I forgot it on purpose.
not_available I was supposed to have dinner with a colleague and they canceled.
not_available Are you free? 
not_available I'd love to.
not_available I'm all jammed up.
not_available But I'd really like to.
not_available Well, it's just an impulse.
not_available Probably another time.
not_available Great impulse.
not_available I'm having dinner with a friend.
not_available My accountant, Roy.
not_available But we could do drinks.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Meet down here at 6? I'll see you then.
not_available All right.

not_available You want to fill me in? We were going to Mexico.
not_available We were gonna get a beach place and be together until the end.
not_available The doctors gave him three months.
not_available Why can't you be together here? His mom wants to put him in the hospital.
not_available Is he all right? His airway was blocked, but we got it cleared.
not_available Thank God! Sweetheart, I was so worried.
not_available Katy, I knew you'd be here.
not_available Are you trying to kill him? He'd rather be dead than be with you.
not_available Katy, would you give us a minute, please? He wants me to stay.
not_available Can we talk over here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I was taking the tube out.
not_available Already? Well, his lungs are fairly clear and he wanted it out.
not_available Listen, he didn't want to be intubated.
not_available He said he had a "do not resuscitate" order? He lied.
not_available Look, he has this romantic notion about dying.
not_available I just needed to know that if he stops breathing again Intubate him.
not_available All right, Jad.
not_available Let me get this tube out for you.
not_available Now, I want you to do me a favor.
not_available I want you to take a deep breath.
not_available As deep as you can.
not_available Now blow hard.
not_available Blow, blow, blow! Don't ever tube me again.
not_available Why are you taking our picture? 
not_available To keep track of the suspects.
not_available Two swabs? 
not_available Nasal and rectal.
not_available We need them back by 3.
not_available God, I feel like a convict! The number matches your lab slip.
not_available I hope the doctors get the same treatment.
not_available They have to swab too.

not_available Anyone seen a nursing schedule? 
not_available You were in charge of it.
not_available I better have this weekend off.
not_available I've got National Guard duty.
not_available God help us.
not_available Has anybody seen the ultrasound? Everything's disorganized without Carol.
not_available I would try Exam 2.
not_available When's she coming back? We just hope she is coming back.
not_available We need some plasma.
not_available Suction! She can't see a thing here! 
not_available Bullet must have nicked an artery.
not_available Satinsky.
not_available Intracardiac epi and calcium ready.
not_available This is jammed.

not_available Signed and in your box.
not_available Let's get him to the O.R., people.
not_available Come on, let's go! Look out.

not_available But that CF kid wants to talk to an Attending.
not_available All right, I'll be right there.
not_available Peter.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available It must be something.
not_available When did the pains start? 
not_available Last night.
not_available Location? Midepigastric.
not_available Shifted to the right lower quadrant this morning.
not_available Fever? Lie down.
not_available It's probably just a virus.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Lydia, can you assist? Dr.
not_available Benton? Just relax, Peter.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Alert the O.R.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton has a hot appendix.
not_available Is it true what they say about? Hey, have you guys seen Doug? Try the Admit desk.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available You busy? What's the recommended antibiotics for end
not_available stage cystic fibrosis? I'm sorry.
not_available So I took your advice, and I canceled with Polly.
not_available Good.
not_available And then I met Nina.
not_available Now it's drinks with Nina, then basketball with Heather.
not_available Great.
not_available Should I have Heather meet me at the stadium? I could spend more time with Nina.
not_available I'm busy with a sick kid.
not_available Can we talk later? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll catch you later.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available That's a tough case.
not_available You know, that kid with end

not_available If he had a jacks ball in his throat, maybe I could fix it.
not_available You know he wants to be made DNR.
not_available You talked to him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's my patient.
not_available He spoke to me.
not_available Maybe you haven't been listening to him.
not_available He's 17.
not_available It's his mother's decision.
not_available He'll be 18 in three weeks.
not_available So maybe we should consider his feelings.
not_available He's a teenager.
not_available He's mixed
not_available up.
not_available He ran away from home.
not_available He's terminally ill and doesn't wanna be on a respirator.
not_available I can't go along with letting him die.
not_available Whose problem is this? His or yours? Oh, my God! It's true.
not_available I thought the nurses were kidding.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks, I don't want any residents operating on me, okay? Don't worry.
not_available It's just your average runofthe
not_available mill appendectomy.
not_available So you'll do it, right? 
not_available I'll be there.
not_available I better go scrub.
not_available Sign this consent form.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks'll answer any questions.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available All right.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's get this thing over with.
not_available Okay, time to prep.
not_available Raise your gown.
not_available It's a mystery.
not_available Doesn't add up.
not_available Here are the patients with staph.
not_available None were treated by the same doctor.
not_available Where's the missing link? We could put cameras in the bathroom to see who doesn't wash their hands.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available What? All these charts have the same handwriting on top.
not_available You recognize it? Greg.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available Dr.
not_available Fischer.
not_available Can I offer you guys a brownie? No, thanks.
not_available What? Is something wrong? What are you doing? 
not_available Scrubbing in.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks said I could help out on that thoracotomy.
not_available You're interested in surgery? I've been thinking about doing an elective.
not_available Thank you again for warning me about that bullet.
not_available My dad's a cop.
not_available We talked ammo at the dinner table.
not_available Seriously? You should see my collection.
not_available I got a Beretta.687, Winchester Golden Quail.
not_available And I got a Tommy gun that belonged to Dillinger.
not_available Change in plans.
not_available Simon's got the gunshot.
not_available We're doing the appy.
not_available The appy? Disappointed? Yeah, they're kind of boring.
not_available You haven't seen the patient yet.
not_available Oh, there is a God.
not_available What are my chances of getting out of here? I can't say.
not_available Don't give me that crap.
not_available You still have some time.
not_available Three months, max.
not_available You could spend that time with Katy.
not_available Great.
not_available She can suction the snot out of my lungs while I stare at the ceiling.
not_available I've been in hospitals my whole life.
not_available I watched two friends die on a respirator slowly wasting away.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available It's not your decision.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available I'll be 18 in three weeks.
not_available Can't do it.
not_available Screw you! What about me? It's up to your mom.
not_available She's been telling me what to do my whole life.
not_available For once, let me do what I want.
not_available You know, she's afraid of losing you.
not_available She's gonna lose me anyway.
not_available Talk to her.
not_available Tell her to let me go.
not_available Hey, look who it is! Why are you here? 
not_available Pick up my paycheck.
not_available Not here yet.
not_available Thanks for taking our side against management.
not_available I guess you're paying for it.
not_available Why are all these boxes here? 
not_available Procurement screwed up.
not_available Oh.
not_available Some fool ordered by the gross, huh? 
not_available Here's my paycheck.
not_available Any idea when you're coming back? No.
not_available The hearing's in a few weeks though, so We've missed you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Well, I'm off to Pottery Barn.
not_available Gonna go buy some candles.
not_available See you.
not_available Someone order some hypodermics? This is ridiculous.
not_available I do not need hand
not_available washing lessons.
not_available Scrub hard to scrape off the bacteria.
not_available And wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.
not_available What, every time? You have the Roux retractor? 
not_available Yes, Peter.
not_available And the Army
not_available Navys and the Kocher.
not_available Listen, listen.
not_available Make sure you put an "X" on my right side.
not_available I don't want you taking out my left kidney.
not_available We're putting you to sleep now.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Hicks? There's been a last
not_available minute substitution.
not_available Carter? Don't worry, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I'll take very good care of you.
not_available He hates me.
not_available I know he loves me, but he also hates me.
not_available Is he an only child? After he was diagnosed, we decided not to risk passing it on.
not_available I spoke to Jad.
not_available He wants you to sign his DNR papers.
not_available Of course he does.
not_available He's got a pretty convincing argument.
not_available He just wants to hurt me.
not_available I don't think that's true.
not_available Shouldn't you give him a chance to make this decision? He's almost 18 years old.
not_available He was a beautiful baby, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available When the doctors told us that he had cystic fibrosis it was like somebody plunged a knife into my heart.
not_available And now he's grown up.
not_available He wants to take control of his life and he doesn't want to die hooked up to a respirator.
not_available And you agree with him.
not_available He doesn't have much time left.
not_available It seems a shame to spend it fighting with your son.
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available Well, he does.
not_available How are we doing on the board? Actually, there's a psychotic wrestler in 2.

not_available Working while you're sick.
not_available Polly, I can't talk.

not_available Let's irrigate one more time.
not_available We don't want to give Dr.

not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle, you want to suction out Dr.
not_available Benton? Can I have OPDS on a CT

not_available But since Dr.
not_available Benton is available Hold the suture in your left hand.
not_available And don't let go.
not_available You take it between your thumb and your forefinger around and through.
not_available Pretty nifty.
not_available Can Dr.

not_available Benton wouldn't mind.
not_available After all, we are a teaching hospital.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks for all your help today.
not_available We make a good team.
not_available Maybe we should go out again.
not_available I don't think so.

not_available Really? You've heard of the cocktail? My doctor put me on it.
not_available I haven't felt this good in a long time.
not_available That's great.
not_available It's weird.
not_available It's like I was on death row, and the governor called.
not_available It takes a little getting used to but it is a hell of a lot better than dying.
not_available Peter, I'm pregnant.
not_available I'm pregnant.
not_available Dr.

not_available I still have dinner reservations.
not_available Where? La Soir Áe.

not_available What are you doing? Practicing one
not_available handed sutures.
not_available What's that? An eggplant.
not_available Did they run out of pigs' feet?

not_available You doing anything later? Actually, I got plans.
not_available Well, maybe some other time.
not_available If you want, you could come with me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd love to.
not_available Where? How could you forget about our timecards? 
not_available I didn't forget.
not_available Then why didn't we get our paychecks? I don't know.
not_available Someone in Administration must have screwed up.

not_available So you lost all three, right? I told you.
not_available And your day? 
not_available I don't wanna talk about it.
not_available So what do you want to do after dinner? We could see a movie.
not_available Go bowling.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Let's just get more champagne.
not_available I like that idea.
not_available I had a really nice time.
not_available I hope it is the first of many.
not_available There's my car.
not_available Wanna get some coffee? I know a great place.
not_available It's getting late and I gotta work early tomorrow.
not_available That's the real reason? Well, I'm afraid.
not_available Of what? Of liking you too much.
not_available What's wrong? Nobody's done that in a really long time.
not_available Aren't you afraid?
