not_available I already started looking for a new place.
not_available New place? 
not_available For me and Alex.
not_available What, you're moving out? You said it'd be good for us to spend time apart.

not_available I need to think things out by myself.
not_available Where are you going now? 
not_available I'm looking at an apartment before work.
not_available So, what, that's it? We don't talk about this?

not_available Well, maybe for you.

not_available They look very comfortable.
not_available They match your backpack.
not_available Just ignore them.
not_available They're on a bulimia high.

not_available If you're a doctor, I want a second opinion.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart, would you care to give a second opinion? Sure.
not_available Your ankle may be broken, and you're a bitch.
not_available All three of them are a liability.
not_available Look at them.
not_available Huddled together like prairie dogs.
not_available This is the best we have to work with? 
not_available Should've made me chief long ago.
not_available And why's that? For one, I'd be a little pickier in choosing our residents.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available Abby, Ray, Neela.
not_available No brain, no courage, no heart.
not_available They need a trip to see the Wizard.

not_available You present to the residents, they to Pratt and me.
not_available They present to the attending.
not_available That's a lot of presenting.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, you got a patient in the cath lab? Yeah, why? 
not_available I think he might have died.
not_available If you'll step over to the board I'll show you how I like things done here.
not_available This applies to you as well.
not_available I'm implementing changes.
not_available I'd like to stick an implement in his eye.

not_available Not now.
not_available HemoCue, 14.1.
not_available Pretty normal.
not_available I don't think you're bleeding internally.
not_available I should hope not.
not_available Yeah, I think my water broke.
not_available Premature rupture of membranes.
not_available Is that bad? No, but there's a good chance you could be having your baby today.
not_available Oh, I wanted to have another home birth.
not_available This is your second pregnancy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Zoe's 2.
not_available This one's a boy.

not_available Welcome to County, Inez.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sit tight, Claire.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available We'll have you upstairs before you get comfortable.
not_available I feel it'll be several hours before I'm comfortable.
not_available Okay.
not_available Clemons, what's next? A bimanual exam? 
not_available Not before the ultrasound.
not_available Why not? Third trimester.
not_available You rule out previa before the exam.
not_available Most important thing to remember in the ER is if you don't get it, just fake it.
not_available Not enough time to ask all the questions and patients don't wanna see you scratching your head.
not_available So in the meantime, can you go get me some Nitrazine paper? Come on.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett wanted me to get some Nitrazine paper.
not_available But I don't know what it is.
not_available You didn't ask? He said if I didn't know something
not_available Listen, number one rule of the ER is if you don't know something, ask.
not_available Okay? You're not gonna learn this stuff by yourself and that's why we're here.
not_available What do I do with the
not_available ? Dr.
not_available Rasgotra, can you tell me how to use a Nitrazine paper? Not until I finish suturing a very fidgety 6year
not_available old.
not_available You're an intern now.
not_available If you don't know something
not_available I know, fake it.
not_available What? No, of course not.
not_available I already asked
not_available Look things up yourself.
not_available When someone gives you the answer, you forget five minutes later.
not_available Read it and it sticks.
not_available Your primary responsibility, educate yourself.
not_available No one else is gonna do it for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Great.
not_available Do you have any questions? 
not_available No.
not_available Terrific.
not_available Uh Anything to present? 
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can I make a suggestion? Unless your patient has situs inversus, her heart should be on the left.
not_available Just came back from the girl in 4? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Looks like she's gonna need amphotericin B.
not_available Your intern picked up histoplasmosis? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He just doesn't know it yet.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available I don't think he likes me.
not_available Everybody likes you.
not_available Not this guy.
not_available He's acting like I killed his dog or something.
not_available Probably he's just nervous.
not_available I don't think I'll be real great at teaching the interns.
not_available Yes, you will.
not_available You did a great job with Jake.
not_available Too bad he didn't match here.
not_available Yeah, too bad.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, can you get on the MICN.
not_available Paramedics need you to pronounce a GSW in the field.
not_available Sure.
not_available Abby! Got one.
not_available Munson, we're up! Unidentified kid.
not_available Looks about 10.
not_available Found down at the food court at City Center Mall.

not_available Still hypotensive after 500 cc's.
not_available Mental status waxing and waning.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.

not_available His buddies split when we got there.
not_available Sats only 92.
not_available What's your plan? 
not_available CBC.
not_available Chem
not_available 7.
not_available Tox screen? And? Head CT? And? Try to find next of kin? 
not_available ABG.
not_available LFT's.
not_available Oxygen.
not_available Normal saline, activated charcoal.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available You'll get the hang of it.
not_available I know.
not_available Okay, 57.
not_available I concur.
not_available We can pronounce.
not_available What's the status on number two? All right, sounds good.
not_available We'll be waiting for you.
not_available County clear.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Yeah? Guy out there says he knows you.
not_available Which guy? 
not_available Sitting next to the old lady.
not_available He a friend of yours? 
not_available Not really.
not_available So you want me to bring him in or no? No.
not_available He can wait.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available I need this Trauma Room in a couple minutes.
not_available How are we doing in here? I don't know about you, but I'm having contractions.
not_available Nitrazine is positive.
not_available Which means your water did break.
not_available Follow it caudad.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is everything okay? Looks like a breech presentation.
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett, can I get your advice on something? This doesn't feel any different from my last pregnancy.
not_available The baby's been active.
not_available You're doing good, Claire.
not_available The baby's heart rate is right on target.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, could you come and take look at this, please? Doctor Pratt.
not_available What is it? It looks like you've delivered the feet.
not_available But that's okay, right? I have a friend who delivered breech and her baby was okay.
not_available Page OB and get them down here right now.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll take good care of you and your baby.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, this is Toni Stillman.
not_available She's here to check on Claire's condition.
not_available The pregnant MVA.
not_available Somebody said she was in a car accident.
not_available Yeah, but she was uninjured.
not_available Thank God.
not_available What about the baby? A family friend? 
not_available She's our gestational surrogate.
not_available She's lived with my husband, Rod, and me for six weeks.
not_available She's having your child.
not_available Yes, we had IVF.
not_available She was implanted with our embryo.
not_available So is our baby gonna be okay? I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
not_available Not without Claire's consent.
not_available She is carrying my baby.
not_available Sorry, I need the patient's consent.
not_available We're best friends.
not_available She'll see me.
not_available Sam.
not_available This is Toni Stillman.
not_available She's a friend of Claire's.
not_available Right.
not_available I spoke with you on the phone.
not_available I'm Sam.
not_available Come on in.
not_available She's been asking for you.
not_available Sam, how's she doing? 
not_available Pretty good.
not_available Uh 
not_available When I get a chance, okay? I was so worried about you.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available But you shouldn't be driving.
not_available I can take you anywhere you need to go.
not_available It was just a tiny fender
not_available bender.
not_available Sam, you have activated charcoal here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bottom shelf.
not_available There's a guy in the waiting room
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know him.
not_available Thanks, Malik.
not_available Claire? Claire, are you okay? What's happening? Another contraction? What is? She's in labor? 
not_available Yup.
not_available But are you gonna stop it? Because she's not due for another week.
not_available But she's 39 weeks.
not_available Junior's ready to make an appearance.
not_available His feet are already popping out.
not_available Feet? He's breech? You'll do a Csection? 
not_available We're waiting an OB to weigh in.
not_available GSW's two minutes out, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Come find me when they get here.
not_available You, you're with me.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I got it.
not_available Have you been in a GSW Trauma before? 
not_available I grew up in the Bronx.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, can we present? Not now.
not_available I got a trauma rolling in.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's next? Exam 3.
not_available Possible talar fracture.
not_available I should warn you she already took my head off for how long she's had to wait.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Can this day get any worse? This is Drew Filmore.
not_available We've met.
not_available Greg.
not_available You figured me out, huh? Five minutes after you left, I knew it was you.
not_available I can't talk to you right now.
not_available Looks like you're busy.
not_available I am.
not_available What do you want? I don't know.
not_available What were you looking for when you came to find me? I guess I just had to see for myself.
not_available And now I have.
not_available So how do we do this? 
not_available We don't.
not_available I'm sorry I bothered you.
not_available I had no idea you were in Chicago.
not_available I heard you were still in Detroit.
not_available I'm not in Detroit no more.
not_available I can imagine what you think about me.
not_available There's a lot of things that you probably need me to explain.
not_available No.
not_available I don't need anything from you.
not_available I never have.
not_available I made a mistake going to see you that night, so forget I came by.
not_available Don't come back anymore.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I can understand you're mad, but I can accept some of that.
not_available Some of it? 
not_available Hey.
not_available You have a half
not_available brother and sister and they are your family too.
not_available Now family's important to you.
not_available Single GSW left chest during a carjacking.
not_available Jocelyn's at U of I.
not_available Chaz is a senior at South Geary.
not_available BP 100, systolic.
not_available Decreased breath sounds on the left.
not_available He'll probably get a scholarship from Loyola if he wins at the swim meet.
not_available Entry wound left parasternal.
not_available No exit.
not_available I need intubation tray, 32 French.
not_available Let's notify the O.
not_available R.
not_available I'm sorry I walked away.
not_available Don't make the same mistake I made.
not_available CT's good.
not_available No blood, no mass effect.
not_available Barbecue's ready.
not_available What? Charcoal's in.
not_available Resps down to 14.
not_available Shallow but clear.
not_available Another 0.
not_available 5 of Narcan.
not_available I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Is that 140 or 114? Uhuhuhuh
not_available uh.
not_available If you do that, we'll have to restrain you, okay? Malik, give him two of Ativan.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Are you sure? I thought benzos could cloud the neurological picture.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fine.
not_available Soft restraints then.
not_available Narcan's in.
not_available Come on.
not_available Talk to us, doctor.
not_available White count is 12.3 
not_available You guys still in here? I got a GSW to the chest.
not_available I need you out of here now.
not_available This kid's ready to go to PICU.
not_available He's not.
not_available He's getting worse.
not_available Head CT's fine, labs, normal.
not_available From ER standpoint, workup's done.
not_available Could have encephalitis.
not_available We should tap him.
not_available They can do it upstairs.
not_available Sounds good to me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Put him in sutures till I can get PICU.
not_available Come on.
not_available Need a hand? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Did I do something wrong in there? 
not_available No.
not_available Am I not handling this patient correctly? Nope.
not_available Are you okay? Sam's moving out.
not_available Why? I've got a feeling it's a communication problem.
not_available Well, if you're not sure, it probably is.
not_available Sorry.
not_available If you wanna talk about it 
not_available No.
not_available And if I wanted to talk about it, Sam probably wouldn't be moving out.
not_available Thanks, Luka.
not_available I always thought it was my fault that things didn't work out between us but now I know it was you.
not_available Hey.
not_available No problem.
not_available She's gonna need a C
not_available section.
not_available Oh, I don't want surgery.
not_available My friend Julia had a breech.
not_available Probably a frank breech, which is butt
not_available You've got a footling breech.
not_available If your cervix doesn't dilate enough, the head can get stuck.
not_available Umbilical cord will compress with each contraction jeopardizing the oxygen supply.
not_available You need to do what's best for the baby.
not_available What happens if I don't have surgery? We allow the baby to be delivered up to the umbilicus to give the cervix time to dilate.
not_available Then use maneuvers to deliver head and shoulders.
not_available Then let's do that.
not_available That's not a good idea.
not_available Right, with a footling breech, there's a 25 percent chance of major complications.
not_available It's less than 2 percent with a C
not_available section.
not_available That's a 75 percent chance that the baby will be born without any problems.
not_available Okay.
not_available We can wait while the labor proceeds.
not_available But if the baby's heart rate gets too low, you may still need a C
not_available section.
not_available I don't want surgery.
not_available I'll send somebody down as soon as we have a room ready.
not_available Can you please find Toni for me? You know what? I'll get her.
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn, are you really not gonna consent for surgery? I can't do it against her will.
not_available What if the baby's in trouble midway through labor? 
not_available I still can't do it.
not_available Are you kidding me? What about the intended parents? This is Toni's baby, isn't it? She's the genetic mother and the intended mother but it's still Claire's body, and she has the right to refuse surgery.
not_available Abby! PICU on line three.
not_available What? What's the status on that kid brought in from the mall? I'm hoping this is the PICU calling for him.
not_available Why? 
not_available His buddies are asking about him.
not_available Don't let them leave.
not_available Yeah, this is Abby
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Okay.
not_available Great.
not_available We'll send him right up.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is he okay? 
not_available No.
not_available He's not okay.
not_available Did he take something? You guys, you need to tell me if he took something, okay? 
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Hey! Hey! Hey! Chuny! Wait a minute.
not_available Not so fast.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Hold it.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Let me grab him.
not_available Let me go.
not_available Settle down, here.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Your friend is very sick.
not_available What's his name? Liam.
not_available And what did he take? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available No drugs? 
not_available No.
not_available Then why did you run away when the paramedics showed up? 
not_available We were skipping school.
not_available Has Liam been sick? 
not_available He hasn't been in school much.
not_available Why not? His parents are getting divorced and he has to go back and forth.
not_available That's why we ditched, so we could hang out.
not_available Does he have any medical disorders? Like what? 
not_available Anything.
not_available His family are vegetarians.
not_available Was he acting different today? 
not_available Not really.
not_available He was kind of bummed maybe.
not_available He ate two jumbo cheeseburgers.
not_available I thought he was a vegetarian.
not_available Abby! He's getting worse.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Kid's backpack.
not_available Find out what's in it.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available He seems pretty unresponsive.
not_available Okay, check his gag reflex.
not_available Liam? Liam? Hold it.
not_available Liam? You gotta wake up, big guy, okay? 
not_available He moved his hand a little bit.
not_available Barely has a gag.
not_available All right.
not_available This way.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know the VITAMIN mnemonic? Vitamins? 
not_available Yes, for altered mental status.
not_available V is vascular.
not_available Strokes or clots.
not_available We ruled that out with CT.
not_available I is for? Infection.
not_available What, this game's only for interns? Infection.
not_available No pneumonia.
not_available Normal white count.
not_available Urine's clean.
not_available We're waiting on the cultures.
not_available T? 
not_available Trauma.
not_available Toxins.
not_available Utox is negative, doesn't mean he didn't take something we can't test for.
not_available What am I looking for? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Drugs.
not_available Meds.
not_available Wait.
not_available What? It's M.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available M.
not_available The M in "VITAMIN " stands for metabolic.
not_available This kid could have a metabolic disease that keeps him on a restricted diet.
not_available What diet? 
not_available His buddy told me that he was a vegetarian.
not_available What buddy? 
not_available Then today, he had two cheeseburgers.
not_available I'm lost.
not_available We need to get this guy upstairs, Abby.
not_available No, what we need is an ammonia level.
not_available Go get some ice.
not_available Ammonia has to go to the lab cold.
not_available Run.
not_available That's my frappuccino.
not_available They could do this upstairs, Abby.
not_available Yeah.
not_available After they do their assessment, review labs and repeat x
not_available rays.
not_available Meanwhile, his brain is being pickled by whatever metabolite is going in there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Get that to the lab.
not_available Go.
not_available Hang in there, Liam.
not_available Good signal.
not_available Fetal heart rate 158.
not_available Well, that's still good, right? 
not_available For the time being.
not_available But if your baby gets in trouble and is deprived of oxygen every second counts.
not_available But that's not happening.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Are you trying to scare me? No.
not_available I'm just trying to prepare you for what might happen.
not_available Listen, thousands of C
not_available sections are performed in this country every day.
not_available It's a simple procedure.
not_available I wanna have more kids of my own one day.
not_available Naturally.
not_available And lots of women go on to have vaginal births after having Caesareans.
not_available Excellent variability of the FHR.
not_available Could I consent, but only as a last resort? Only if the baby's in serious danger? Absolutely.
not_available Sam has a consent form right here.
not_available Okay, but only as a last resort.
not_available You need to be made aware of the risks.
not_available What sort of risks? 
not_available Sam.
not_available Bleeding, infection, paralysis, stroke
not_available Sam! These are minimal risks.
not_available Can I speak with you outside, please? 
not_available I don't want this.
not_available No, just
not_available Look, think about it, okay? What is going on in there? She needs to be aware of the risks.
not_available That's why it's called informed consent.
not_available You made it sound like Frankenstein's
not_available You made it sound like a pedicure.
not_available It's not your job to explain the proced 
not_available No, that's your job.
not_available Look out! What's going on? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available Jeez.
not_available How are we on the packed cells? Units five and six, infusing.
not_available What about Kovac? 
not_available No, I got this.
not_available Okay.
not_available What can I do? Nothing.
not_available Internal paddles again, charge to 30.
not_available You're shocking asystole? It's fine V
not_available fib.
not_available Clear.
not_available How long has she been down? 
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available Greg.
not_available Hang another unit, charge the paddles.
not_available Shouldn't we save the blood for someone who's got a chance? 
not_available Probable great vessel injury.
not_available She's down too long.
not_available What, now that you're residents, you're experts? If we restore her volume, we'll be able
not_available It's time to call it.
not_available Call it.
not_available Me? Call it.
not_available Death at 1440.
not_available What's the survival rate in patients who reach this hospital alive after penetrating chest trauma? When you two can answer that, you can start second
not_available guessing me.
not_available You wanna do something, notify her next of kin.
not_available Abby, sats are down to 76.
not_available Can't get a good seal.
not_available He needs a tube.
not_available Get me a miller tube and a 65.
not_available What? What's wrong? What's going on?

not_available Is this the mall kid? 
not_available I told you to send him to PICU hours ago.
not_available Suction.
not_available Abby.
not_available I wanna check one more thing.
not_available Great, so you kept him down here just long enough for him to crash.
not_available Tube.
not_available I got some history that suggested further workup.
not_available You should give it to the team upstairs.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Good chest rise.
not_available Equal breath sounds.
not_available Ammonia's back.
not_available Two
not_available fourteen.
not_available You were right.
not_available The kid has a metabolic disorder, some protein intolerance.
not_available Okay.
not_available Run to the pharmacy, see if the sodium phenylbutyrate is ready.
not_available Sodium what? 
not_available It's a nitrogen scavenger.
not_available It'll help bring down ammonia, reverse encephalopathy.
not_available Got it.
not_available The kid's family are strict vegetarians.
not_available His friends told me today he had two cheeseburgers because he was depressed.
not_available Because his parents are getting a divorce.
not_available So it was probably some sort of fast
not_available food rebellion.
not_available Only he can't handle protein.
not_available Any family members to confirm this? 
not_available Chuny's still trying to track them down.
not_available Can you switch him to D10 half at 150 an hour? 
not_available You got it.
not_available Luka? 
not_available We got a hot Ml on its way in.
not_available Be right there.
not_available So lower the ammonia get him out of his catabolic tailspin, he'll wake up, right? Nice pick
not_available up.
not_available Lockhart comes up big.
not_available You call that a jump shot? Hey, Luka.
not_available I hear your mom's looking at apartments.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who knows? Might be even close enough to walk to my place.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's only a few blocks from here.
not_available You know it's not my idea.
not_available Back to work.
not_available We'll still go camping again on your birthday.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgoata? 
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Neela's fine.
not_available Filmore's freaking out about how long she's waited to have her ankle splinted.
not_available Maybe you could help with this one.
not_available How are we doing, Drew? I've been here for six hours.
not_available Is there anybody here who knows what the hell they're doing? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then what the hell are you waiting for? I've got a national sales conference I'm supposed to be at.
not_available I'm sorry you had to wait.
not_available Sometimes we lose track of time when we're trying to save people's lives.
not_available Is that sarcasm? Because I don't need that.
not_available I'm a customer here.
not_available If I'm not happy with the service or the way I'm treated I will go to your supervisors.
not_available We have a contract.
not_available I didn't agree to surgery.
not_available You agreed to consent to all medically necessary procedures associated with the pregnancy.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available This is my husband, Rod.
not_available Are you the OB? 
not_available No.
not_available ER.
not_available She needs a C
not_available section and I have a legal document permitting to do so.
not_available Can we go out to discuss this? If you don't do this it's a breech of contract, you won't get paid.
not_available Look, I just wanna have the baby naturally! I'll get a court order forcing her to get a C
not_available section.
not_available I don't think you can do that.
not_available Watch me.
not_available She's endangering our unborn child.
not_available I'm doing everything I can to convince her to get the surgery, but I can't force her.
not_available She's carrying our baby.
not_available We've been trying to have kids for five years.
not_available We spent a fortune on three tries at IVF, and every time I miscarried.
not_available We gave the last of my embryos to Claire.
not_available I'm sorry, but we can't do it like this.
not_available Let me go talk to her again.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm still getting a court order.
not_available Ray, she had a late decel.
not_available How low? 
not_available Hundred and eight.
not_available That means?

not_available What's happening? 
not_available You guys need to wait outside now.
not_available We're taking her to Labor and Delivery.
not_available How are we doing? 
not_available Are you moving me? Yup, we're going upstairs.
not_available Inez, go hold an elevator.
not_available Okay.
not_available Baby's heart rate dropped in the last contraction which could mean a sign of cord compression.
not_available The baby could be in trouble.
not_available What's the heart rate now? One
not_available twelve.
not_available But that's still okay though, right? Claire? 
not_available We're doing okay.
not_available Fifteen liters by mask.
not_available You need to have a C
not_available section, Claire.
not_available You know that.
not_available You have to trust me.
not_available I know my own body.
not_available We wanna go with her.
not_available No! We wanna be there when our baby is born.
not_available No! I don't want them to be there.
not_available Dr.

not_available You treated her mother.
not_available GSW.
not_available Oh.
not_available Right.
not_available Thanks, Chuny.
not_available No one will tell me what happened.
not_available I mean, what's GSW? Is that gastro something? Is she okay? Would you like to sit down? 
not_available I Okay.
not_available GSW stands for gunshot wound.
not_available Your mother was shot during a robbery attempt.
not_available She was shot? Yes.
not_available We gave her blood transfusions, emergency surgery Everything we could to save her.
not_available She's dead? I'm afraid that her injuries were too severe.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available How did you find me? We found your name in her address book.
not_available Did she say anything? Well, she talked a little when she was brought in but she'd lost a lot of blood and lost consciousness as we were trying to save her.
not_available Would you like to see her? Too late.
not_available We haven't spoken in a long time.
not_available We had a falling out a while back.
not_available We were both waiting for the other one to give in and admit they were wrong.
not_available I guess I win.
not_available I need to push.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Just breathe, you're doing great.
not_available FHR's 120.
not_available Where's Pedes? 
not_available On their way.

not_available Baby's heart rate's below a hundred.
not_available Ninetyseven, 90, 85 We need to put on What's wrong? He okay? 
not_available Baby's heart rate's dangerously low.
not_available The umbilical cord compressed, he's not getting enough oxygen.
not_available Sixty
not_available eight.
not_available It should rebound between contractions.
not_available But we can still do a Caesarean, Claire.
not_available No.
not_available We can push him back in, in two minutes, start surgery.
not_available He's almost out.
not_available But we don't know that.
not_available His head could be entrapped.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is it.
not_available Big push, Claire.
not_available Between two and five minutes of low oxygen could be the difference between a normal and a brain
not_available damaged baby.
not_available Consent to the C
not_available section.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available I'm really trying.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available The head is stuck.
not_available We need to pull him out with forceps.

not_available No respiratory effort.
not_available Bag him.
not_available No femoral.

not_available You're out of here.
not_available I thought I could do it.
not_available Swimmers, on your board.
not_available Chaz! Let's do this! Set.
not_available Have you been in to see the baby? 
not_available They're still doing tests on him.
not_available It's been over an hour.
not_available It was a hard delivery.
not_available What aren't they telling us? Your son was deprived of oxygen during the birth.
not_available But he's gonna be all right.
not_available We'll know more in a few days.
not_available There's a good chance that he suffered neurologic damage.
not_available Well, did he or didn't he? I think that he probably did.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Go where? 
not_available Home.
not_available But what about our son? I'm not gonna leave him.
not_available Pediatrician will see you, he'll have more answers.
not_available You already gave us the answer.
not_available We didn't pay to have a brain
not_available dead baby.
not_available He is not brain
not_available dead.
not_available Rod.
not_available He's not normal.
not_available Which he would have been if you had done the C
not_available section.
not_available We were gonna call him David after Rod's father.
not_available Toni, you still can.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hey, Liam, how you feeling? Cruddy.
not_available Your parents are on their way.
not_available They were very worried about you.

not_available My friend thinks you're a MILF.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Excuse me? It's a MotherI'dLiketo
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, I'm not a mother.
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available Guess that makes you a DILF.
not_available Okay.
not_available See you later, Liam.
not_available Stay on your diet and wear your medic alert bracelet.
not_available Am I supposed to pretend I didn't see that? See what? Okay.
not_available Well, come on.
not_available I don't hear from him, he sends the ER a postcard.

not_available Where's Pratt? 
not_available He left.

not_available No.
not_available This is incomplete.

not_available Still at Labor and Delivery.
not_available Probably stayed upstairs to hit on the OB nurses.

not_available I'll show you how to do it.
not_available How's his muscle tone? Well, it's not too good.
not_available Is he over
not_available breathing the vent? No.
not_available Hypoxic brain injury.
not_available The chance for complete neurological recovery is slim.
not_available Has his mother been in to see him? No.
not_available Claire doesn't consider him her child.
not_available And the Stillmans don't want a ventilator baby.
not_available There's nothing else you can do for him.
