not_available The school will handle it.
not_available Well, that's not really their job.
not_available You don't understand.

not_available 'Cause I want to get healthy.
not_available Hey, do you need some help here? Do these people know what you did? It's under control, it's okay.
not_available I came in here with a cough, and I went out like this.
not_available I gave you the best treatment possible.
not_available While I was having a stroke, you ignored me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ames, that's You ignored me! You did!

not_available mail telling me that this was too much.
not_available This
not_available me pursuing you, pursuing this, it was it was too much.
not_available She thought that that nothing was ever going to come of this, and that if I couldn't move on, then
not_available she was going to have to move on without me.
not_available in an E
not_available mail.
not_available I figured that I just win this, you know, I win this case, and I'd send that E
not_available mail back and then then she'd come back home.

not_available I want things back the way they were.

not_available threatening condition, then the procedure doesn't become unnecessary just because the condition is ruled out.
not_available Huh? You lost me.
not_available Well, the E.R.
not_available keeps accusing us of performing unnecessary surgery, but we really believed the guy had a triple A.
not_available If we waited, he'd die.
not_available But he didn't have a triple A.
not_available Given his symptoms, we would've been right 90% of the time, and then surgery would have saved his life.
not_available Good.
not_available Do it like that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Your turn.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I know how to do this.
not_available I'll just pull some articles, I'll be fine.
