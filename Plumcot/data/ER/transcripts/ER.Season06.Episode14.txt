not_available Are you putting her on bypass? 
not_available Have a perfusionist.
not_available Don't bag so fast.
not_available We don't want her alkalotic.
not_available Need anyone else? 
not_available I hope not.
not_available Don't forget the drug box.
not_available Go! I can't believe this.
not_available You think we got it in time? 
not_available She has a good chance.
not_available Kerry? You're the one who found them? We got a problem with the Medevac chopper.
not_available Try to divert.
not_available I did but
not_available Whatever.
not_available Peter! I just heard.
not_available What happened? This is O
not_available neg.

not_available Hang in there, Dr.
not_available Carter! How many units is that? 
not_available Five, but you shouldn't be counting.
not_available It's bad, isn't it? Well, we're having problems keeping your crit up.
not_available That's from the renal lac.
not_available I'm giving you Versed to relax you before I intubate.
not_available It could be the aorta.
not_available Or mesenteric vessels.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll explore the abdomen and check out everything, okay? I'm glad it's you.
not_available I'm getting you through this, man.

not_available Keep her chest covered.
not_available You need a six
not_available inch butcher knife to cut a cake? They just told me that's what we use.
not_available We just leave it out? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available Was it in the lounge? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I couldn't find it.
not_available Go get Security to open up the personnel office.
not_available I need contact numbers for Carter and Lucy.
not_available I want you to bring the files down.
not_available He presented with a headache.
not_available Who? Paul Sobriki.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Lucy worked him up, Carter supervised.
not_available Who supervised him? 
not_available The LP came back negative.
not_available You could have rounded before leaving.
not_available I ran the board with Dr.

not_available For 30 seconds? 
not_available He was up to speed.
not_available You didn't say he was psychotic.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Did he present to you? 
not_available We wait on psych consults.
not_available Unless his status changes! 
not_available I was managing the whole board.
not_available You were having a party! We thought that Lucy and Carter had it covered.
not_available Well, they didn't.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We use the Residents to keep us informed.
not_available You're blaming Carter? 
not_available I'm not blaming anyone.
not_available I have Samantha Sobriki here.
not_available She's looking for her husband.
not_available I got a message from Lucy Knight.

not_available You'd better come with me.
not_available That chopper's landing right now.
not_available The Medevac from Whiting.
not_available Kerry, go and change.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available What happened? The air squad's here.
not_available Was there a bomb scare? 
not_available I wish.
not_available It's not true.
not_available I want to see him.
not_available He's not here.
not_available Paul couldn't hurt anyone.
not_available He needs help.
not_available There's been a mistake.
not_available We believe he may have schizophrenia.
not_available What? The first psychotic break can happen in your 20s.
not_available You're wrong, okay? You're wrong.
not_available The kidney won't tamponade.
not_available You couldn't get an IVP? I didn't want to chance it.
not_available The colon's lacerated, all right.
not_available There's blood welling in the hilum.
not_available Isolate the renal artery.
not_available Get a clamp on it.
not_available He's hypotensive.
not_available We gotta get this kidney out! Let me finish suturing before we do something drastic.
not_available I'll dissect out the arteries.
not_available Move! 
not_available I said wait! He's lost too much blood.
not_available His hilum's trashed.
not_available He's getting shocky.
not_available Pressure's 78 palp.
not_available We have time.
not_available We don't! Peter, calm down and listen to me! Let's check the source of the bleeding once more.
not_available Too many vessels are injured.
not_available Let's be sure.
not_available I can't identify the source of the bleeding.
not_available I'll pack off the liver.
not_available BP's 105/70.
not_available Angled Potts now.
not_available What're you doing? Pringle maneuver.
not_available Have to cut this blood loss.
not_available The spleen's still bleeding.
not_available Okay.
not_available BP's falling, 80/60.
not_available Run another unit.
not_available She loses it as fast as we give it.
not_available Then quickly! A and O times 4.
not_available BP, 132/82.
not_available Pulse 110.
not_available You sure there wasn't a projectile? Just oil.
not_available Must've been a loose fitting.
not_available A small stream at that pressure will cut through you like a.
not_available 22.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available What's going on? Get a trauma panel.
not_available Type and cross for 4, I'll be there in a minute.
not_available A couple of our staff were hurt.
not_available I heard.
not_available Who's that? I'm covering.
not_available Things are off
not_available balance.
not_available Where's Elizabeth? 
not_available She's up in Surgery.
not_available An MVA's coming, auto vs.
not_available pedestrian, in five minutes.
not_available Grab Chen and Malucci.
not_available Weaver should be around.
not_available What do I do with her mother? I'll drive you home in a half
not_available hour.
not_available Will they be okay? Who? 
not_available Your friends.
not_available I don't know, Dad.
not_available You're acting like you know he did it.
not_available You don't.
not_available You're right.
not_available But we still need to find him.
not_available He's not at home.
not_available Nobody's seen him at the diner.
not_available Is there any other place he would feel safe? He was depressed.
not_available It doesn't make him crazy.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But we have to assume he could be a danger to himself or others.
not_available If he was dangerous, why did they leave him alone? I understand.
not_available This doesn't make sense to any of us.
not_available But if Paul is in trouble, he needs help.
not_available And it's better if we can find him now.
not_available Sometimes he goes to the roof to be alone.
not_available The roof? 
not_available Of our apartment building.
not_available He didn't do this.
not_available Bleeding's under control.
not_available Pean clamp.
not_available Watch the pancreas.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll enlarge the incision in the peritoneum.
not_available Watch for splenic flexure.
not_available Got it.
not_available I'll clamp, you cut.
not_available Metz.
not_available Bastard sliced the hell out of it.
not_available It's senseless to cut up this poor girl.
not_available It's better than the alternative.
not_available Let the renal artery flush retrograde before closing the defect.
not_available There.
not_available Think we got it? There's one way to know.
not_available Release the clamp, let the kidney perfuse.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available No bleeding.
not_available Hilum's intact.
not_available And the kidney is pinking up.
not_available All right, we did it.
not_available You were right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He could've lived without a kidney.
not_available Pressure's still down, 80/62.
not_available We caught up on volume? 
not_available Almost.
not_available Why is he still hypotensive? There's swelling in the periaortic area.
not_available A hematoma's forming.
not_available From the lumbar artery? 
not_available I hope.
not_available It could paralyze him! 
not_available It's better than his aorta.
not_available Dissect down to the artery.
not_available Some kind of life.
not_available I hope this isn't normal.
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available You've got quite a girl there in Elizabeth.
not_available I can't take the credit.
not_available The boarding school raised her.
not_available I was teasing.
not_available Her father passed on? 
not_available He was alive, the last I heard.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available It wasn't your fault.
not_available Have you heard anything? 
not_available They're in the O.R.
not_available Think we should go up? 
not_available They'll call when everything's okay.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available John Doe hit by a van.
not_available No head trauma, repeated questions.
not_available I called a cab! I think we got a looney
not_available toon.
not_available Why? He was running around naked in the freezing cold.
not_available You can't do this! Are you sure? Yeah, it's him! Trauma panel, C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available Is he combative? 
not_available I'm not taking any chances.
not_available Get the police detective in here! Get X
not_available ray.
not_available Abdomen is soft, non
not_available tender.
not_available I won't talk! I made promises! Pupils equal and reactive.
not_available Paul, do you know where you are? Who told you my name?! Paul, do you remember what happened? You can't trick me! 
not_available No deformity.
not_available I'm not deformed! Temperature's 95
not_available Get off of me! Leave me alone.
not_available Don't stick me.
not_available You want some Haldol? Dr.
not_available Weaver, do you want some Haldol? Two liters of saline and five of Haldol.
not_available Where are you going? Can you take this patient? 
not_available You okay? He's the guy.
not_available He's the psych patient.
not_available He got hit by a car.
not_available Can you just take him? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available BP 120/82 after a liter.
not_available Probably venous oozing.
not_available Can you take him? Who's our surgeon? 
not_available Whoever's free.
not_available He has a chest tube and head CT.
not_available I don't want you to touch me! Stop sticking me! Let me go! 
not_available Keep that mask on him! Don't cut me! Don't cut me! No! Hell of a Valentine's Day.
not_available She's satting at 98 on 30% oxygen.
not_available Can't ask for better than that.
not_available Good work.
not_available How's Carter? Took a while to control the bleeding.
not_available They saved his kidney and are doing a colostomy.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available County supervisor's on the phone.
not_available He heard what happened.
not_available Tell him I'm in surgery.
not_available I told him you got out.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Appreciate that.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, she's waking up.
not_available Lucy Lucy, can you hear me? Do you know what happened? There's several stab wounds.
not_available One lacerated your proximal aorta.
not_available We performed a thoracotomy after you arrested.
not_available They gave you a trach to maintain your airway.
not_available Your liver was damaged, but we were able to repair it.
not_available However, we removed your spleen.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You can't speak.
not_available You can whisper if I plug the trach.
not_available Want to try? Remember, only whisper.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bring the proximal colon to skin surface.
not_available Hanging in there? You look ragged.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Metz.
not_available I think young Dr.
not_available Carter is very fortunate.
not_available Depends on how you see it.
not_available We need a surgeon in O.R.
not_available 3.
not_available What is it? Penetrating trauma.
not_available Something about oil.
not_available Where's Corday? Should I page her? 
not_available We're busy.
not_available Take a look.
not_available I can finish.
not_available I've come this far.
not_available Is the patient stable? Who's with the patient? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available Have her stay until Corday shows.
not_available They need me in the O.R.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Her sat's down to 82.
not_available What is it? Chest pain? Sudden onset.
not_available Put her at 100%.
not_available We must do a spiral CT now.
not_available PE is a possibility.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Sudden chest pain.
not_available Dropped her sats.
not_available We'll scan for a PE.
not_available Bolus 5000 heparin.
not_available Start a drip, 1000 an hour.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Come here.
not_available Don't thin her blood if we don't have to.
not_available I think she threw a massive clot.
not_available We don't want her to bleed out.
not_available If it's PE and we don't thin her blood, she'll throw another clot.
not_available We won't heparinize for more than two hours.
not_available I won't need that long.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Were you working on my husband? He was hit by a car.
not_available Collapsed lung, but we fixed it.
not_available No head trauma.
not_available He's with the psychiatrist now.
not_available Can I see him? You should wait a minute.
not_available We gave him a drug to calm him down.
