
not_available Previously on ER Carter, your first day? Somebody called for a surgeon.
not_available Don't you want to talk before sex? Not really.
not_available I tested positive.
not_available What was in the Trib? 
not_available They're squeezing the budget so they're shutting us down.
not_available That's a rumor.
not_available Benton dumped me back in the ER.
not_available Don't tell anyone you're HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Did you get your test back? 
not_available It was negative.
not_available I don't know! Somebody call a doctor! You are the doctor.
not_available It's another steamer today.
not_available Hot, muggy weather.
not_available High in the 90s with high humidity.
not_available They say never trust air you can't see, and you'// see it today with no end in sight for the hot, humid weather.
not_available I'm running over today.
not_available I hope I'm not making you late for work.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not on until this afternoon.
not_available I did my Residency at County.
not_available Three years of too many patients, too little time and no resources.
not_available Sounds about right.
not_available Hard to believe we had no CTs no MRIs and glass IV bottles.
not_available Glass? Well, your lab work's back and the results show a viral load of 15,000, which is good.
not_available Coffee? 
not_available I've already had too much.
not_available So have I.
not_available There's a fairly new HIV cocktail that I recommend you start on now.
not_available The three drugs? AZT, 3TC and a protease inhibitor.
not_available There is no long
not_available term research but the preliminary findings are positive.
not_available Not quite a cure.
not_available But more hope than we've had in a decade.
not_available There may be some side effects.
not_available Nausea, vomiting, rash.
not_available How much does it cost? Your insurance will cover it.
not_available Actually, I'm gonna stick with cash.
not_available That could cost up to $ 16,000 a year.
not_available I'm sure I can work that out.
not_available Afraid of letting the hospital know? I've heard of healthcare workers getting fired or reassigned for being HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Me too.
not_available I've got a couple of them as patients.
not_available But not from County.
not_available I don't know what their policy is.
not_available It's hard to ask without someone wanting to know why you're asking.
not_available I'll write the prescription, but these will get you started, okay? You're to take two of the 3TC and six each of the AZT and the protease inhibitor.
not_available Fourteen pills a day? The 3TC twice a day with plenty of water.
not_available The protease inhibitor before meals, always on an empty stomach.
not_available Two each of the AZT three times a day.
not_available Just follow these written instructions, okay? Does your watch have an alarm? Good.
not_available Get used to hearing it.
not_available Miss a couple of doses, and this virus could develop resistance.
not_available Do I need to worry about transmitting this to a patient? If you use universal precautions and are careful, there shouldn't be a problem.
not_available "Shouldn't." With the exception of one dentist there has been no case documentation of any health
not_available care worker transmitting HIV to a patient.
not_available None.
not_available So I'll see you in three weeks? Three weeks.
not_available There are a lot of diseases that can take your life.
not_available But this one can take over your life.
not_available Don't let it.
not_available Are you the doctor? I saw the name on the mailbox.
not_available John Truman Carter, M.D.? Well, I am Betty.
not_available From 318.
not_available Are you a doctor doctor? Because I'm feeling short of breath.
not_available You might want to lose the cigarettes.
not_available You think that might make a difference at my age? Just a wild guess.
not_available I tried one of those humidifiers.
not_available I stuck my whole head in the thing Wait! What time is it? I just turned off Regis and Kathie Lee.
not_available Oh, God! Benton is gonna kill me! I can't help you now.
not_available Sorry, I'm late, and I am going to die soon.
not_available Maybe you should try an albuterol inhaler.
not_available Maybe an atrovent inhaler.
not_available That kind of thing.
not_available Get off me! I want to get out of here! What happened? 
not_available I can't take these fat people on PCP! Broke out of her restraints.
not_available Where's Security? Where are the men? Get off me, you bitches! I want to get out of here! Sorry, sir.
not_available We gotta get her down! Keep her down! Sit on her! Are you okay? Is this psycho day? Some lunatic in 4 kept trying to lick me.
not_available Maybe it's the heat.
not_available Full moon? They know County's closing, and they're getting their last digs in.
not_available In here, right? What the hell kept you? We got the call five minutes ago.
not_available We ran all the way.
not_available You don't think County's really gonna close, do you? Can it? Have you read the papers? $ 150 million shortfall in the budget.
not_available Be tough giving this all up, won't it? Where's Carter? 
not_available Do I look like his mother? Randi! Have you seen Carter? He's a surgical intern now.
not_available We don't keep track of him anymore.
not_available Sorry you were late.
not_available We already saved him.
not_available I'm not late.
not_available You know Wayne Lentloff? Good to see you.
not_available You missed a good one! 
not_available Nobody called me.
not_available Thanks, Wayne.
not_available It was fun.
not_available We'll do it again.
not_available Listen, I wanted to talk to you about a fellowship in Cardiothoracic.
not_available I haven't made up my mind what specialty I know.
not_available I hear Vascular wants you, Trauma, Critical Care I talked to them, but you know But you need to talk to us.
not_available Cardiothoracic is a great specialty.
not_available Good man like you could finish up a fellowship in three years.
not_available Are you free Sunday? I'd like you to come out for brunch.
not_available Lake Forest.
not_available And you are gonna love it.
not_available Want a ride? 
not_available I think I can make it from here.
not_available So how did it go last night? How did what go? 
not_available Your blind date.
not_available Oh, God! You know better than to tell Doug.
not_available I only told him after he told me about your blind date.
not_available The girl with the retainer.
not_available I don't believe him.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Mine was worse.
not_available Nothing could be worse.
not_available This girl had an entire vegetable garden stuck in her teeth.
not_available That's the baby pool compared to Tad.
not_available Could I get a cup of coffee, black? 
not_available You got it.
not_available I can't believe you'd go out with a guy named Tad.
not_available I did.
not_available I made it fresh just for you.
not_available Fresh from yesterday's grounds.
not_available First of all, I order a Manhattan straight up, two cherries.
not_available He orders a fruity, yet selfless, glass of cabernet.
not_available What does that even mean? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Then he talks for 45 minutes about his ex
not_available girlfriend whose name also happens to be Susan.
not_available How he loved her and wanted to marry her how he wanted to father her And, by the way, do I want children? Do I want 5 or 6 children? Okay.
not_available Tad could be worse.
not_available I'm not even there yet, Mark.
not_available I look over, and he has this drop of red wine hanging from his nose.
not_available What? 
not_available A little blob just hanging there.
not_available Of course I cannot take my eyes off of it.
not_available Will it fall? Will it hang there all night? Is his skin going to absorb it? How did it get there? How do you get your nose that far into a wine glass? What, was he smelling it? What happened? I went to the bathroom and snuck out the window.
not_available You're kidding! Did he ask you to brunch? 
not_available How did you know? Wayne Lentloff is nothing if not predictable.
not_available That's why I like him, actually.
not_available He gets the Residents out to Lake Forest every year.
not_available Shows them the seven
not_available bedroom Colonial the tiered garden, the Olympic lap pool Very impressive.
not_available All the benefits of cardiothoracic surgery.
not_available Of course, we're only in it to help our fellow man, aren't we? What's your name? 
not_available Gant.
not_available Dennis Gant.
not_available Step in, Mr.
not_available Gant.
not_available Take a look
not_available see while I divide this anterior rectus fascia.
not_available Tonsil clamp.
not_available A little Bovie, please.
not_available Not you, Gant.
not_available Boys and girls in Vascular pull you aside? That's mostly diabetics and smokers.
not_available Not for me.
not_available How about a Pediatric fellowship? Surgery above and below the diaphragm.
not_available Very high
not_available tech.
not_available Actually, no one's asked me.
not_available Hard as it is to believe, some of the elite fellowships you'll have to go after yourself.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gant was kind enough to cover the ER seeing as you were nowhere to be found.
not_available Perhaps you should do the same for him.
not_available Let's yank this little hyperemic sucker.
not_available Pean clamp! Got it? The key to landing a good job is presentation.
not_available I'm not gonna dress like you, if that's what you mean.
not_available "Two summers, Assistant Night Manager at McDonald's." It's a bit of a lie.
not_available I just manned the drive
not_available through window.
not_available That's better.
not_available That's managing the communication and distribution system of an international Fortune 500 company.
not_available I like that.
not_available What you're saying is, make it a big lie.
not_available Semantics can be your friend, Jerry.
not_available Some guy's puking over at Chairs.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Did you get the liquor out of 4 yet? You can't bother him now.
not_available He's rephrasing his r Ásum Á.
not_available Going for the presidency of Chrysler? It's not necessarily County that'll close.
not_available There are three other hospitals.
not_available But what if it does? I only got eight hours' worth of savings.
not_available You ought to get E
not_available Ray to help you revise your r Ásum Ás.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available How many ways can you rephrase that? Mark said something about a couple of teenagers.
not_available Is there a chart on them? I haven't made one up yet.
not_available Two 15year
not_available olds.
not_available Mark said he'd see them.
not_available Who am I seeing? The 15year
not_available olds over at Chairs.
not_available Right.
not_available An 81 year
not_available old ALOC with abdominal pain coming in by private.
not_available Anything surgical? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Nada.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Abdominal pain at the back door.
not_available Susan, can you help me with a chest tube? I'm gonna see those kids.
not_available Did you get a chance to read that synopsis of Donald Anspaugh's speech at Northwestern? "Modern Architecture for Emergency Medicine Management"? Anspaugh? Isn't he the chief at Southside? Doug did his rotation there.
not_available He said the guy's a crackpot.
not_available You might want to consider the source on that evaluation.
not_available I found his ideas intriguing.
not_available Rearranging the physical layout here is not one of my priorities.
not_available Could we at least rearrange where our Security sits? Three nurses had to restrain a PCP patient this morning because they took too long to get there.
not_available Was anybody hurt? 
not_available Fortunately, no.
not_available You know, Mark, just because it's my suggestion it doesn't, by definition, make it a bad idea.
not_available She just has a way of making you feel really small, doesn't she? Sorry.
not_available I had no idea they'd send the bill to you.
not_available Your insurance company doesn't pay.
not_available You think the hospital's just gonna eat it? I don't know.
not_available What do they do with immigrants and poor people? They go after anyone who's legally responsible.
not_available That's me, Al.
not_available We're still married, remember? I screwed up when I changed jobs.
not_available This guy I'm working for, he's independent.
not_available Doesn't give benefits.
not_available CTA said I could stay on their plan.
not_available But there was this Cobra payment.
not_available I had no idea I missed it.
not_available It was real confusing.
not_available They're gonna let me know if I can get reinstated.
not_available Can it maybe go on your insurance? You're not on my insurance.
not_available I joined my plan after we separated.
not_available $3200 is what I'm supposed to pay for you? And in a week I get another bill? Thomas, time to come in! Where are you? Franklin Heath, 81.
not_available Sweet old guy looking for someone named Thomas.
not_available His private
not_available duty nurse, Mr.
not_available Travels, is over there bulking up.
not_available He looks dedicated.
not_available He's dumping him? It's not for me to say.
not_available He's done this a number of times.
not_available Always on a Friday.
not_available Thomas, it's getting dark.
not_available Carol, what happened to your car? What do you mean? 
not_available A tow truck hauled it off.
not_available Go, I'll take care of this.
not_available Strong old guy, isn't he? Where are you, Thomas? Wait, wait, wait! That's my car! 
not_available Stop beating on my truck.
not_available Stop stealing my car.
not_available You Carol Hathaway? Repossessed.
not_available That can't be right.
not_available You missed three payments.
not_available So I'm a little late.
not_available I made the other seven on time.
not_available I know that you did, which is why I thought tonight we could I understand.
not_available Your parents don't come into town that often.
not_available I'd love to meet them, but I'm working tonight.
not_available What time do they go to bed? I'm kidding.
not_available I'll talk to you soon.
not_available That's an old friend from college.
not_available Radiology called.
not_available The films on that Burman kid are back.
not_available You want to rephrase your r Ásum Á, you should talk to him, not E
not_available Ray.
not_available I heard your car got towed.
not_available It's a mistake.
not_available I know a couple guys who can track a repo man down like that.
not_available If you want.
not_available Carter said I should tell you he's in Curtain 3.
not_available Nurse Hathaway? You're still here.
not_available We've been sitting there like you told us.
not_available That doctor never showed.
not_available Lf you tell me, I could help you.
not_available We need to see a doctor.
not_available Where's Ross? 
not_available Radiology.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Trauma 2.
not_available Follow me.
not_available BP's 100 over 50.
not_available Pulse 120.
not_available Good bilateral breath sounds.
not_available Toes upgoing.
not_available Trachea's midline.
not_available ET tube's 71/2.
not_available You said you'd see these kids.
not_available We were diverted.
not_available They need a doctor, and I'd like to do your job for you Thank you.
not_available Perhaps they could wait a little longer? Let's get a noncontrast head CT.
not_available You know where you were waiting before? Go back there and wait again.
not_available BP's 90 over 60.
not_available Pulse 104.
not_available He's been agitated, complaining of abdominal pain.
not_available That is when he's not looking for Thomas.
not_available Who's Thomas? Who knows? Let's order a CBC, Chem
not_available 7, UA, abdominal series.
not_available And let's get an EKG.
not_available Lf you don't need me anymore 
not_available Have a nice weekend, Mr.
not_available Travels.
not_available Thomas, come on in.
not_available Dinner is ready.
not_available What are you doing? An 81 year
not_available old ALOC complaining of abdominal pain.
not_available No vomiting and yesterday had a normal bowel movement.
not_available Mild tenderness, no rebound or guarding.
not_available You have nothing here.
not_available Did someone dump him? 
not_available That's a possibility.
not_available I suggest you do the same.
not_available You're in Surgery, not Geriatrics, okay? I'm sorry about my blowup before.
not_available It was out of line.
not_available No excuses whatsoever.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Can I borrow your motorcycle after lunch? What? I have to be at my house at 3:00.
not_available My car got towed and I won't have time to catch the EI.
not_available We're gonna grab a drink.
not_available Walk with us.
not_available Talk to you later.
not_available I'll check on those kids.
not_available You know how to ride a motorcycle? 
not_available It's like a big moped, right? I guess.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available What seems to be the problem? A woman doctor? 
not_available Best I could do.
not_available We could call your parents if you prefer.
not_available We lost our condom.
not_available So you're trying to tell us the condom is Deeply, deeply lost.
not_available The decision wasn't being made for another week.
not_available That's what we thought until they called this meeting.
not_available They gave no indication as to what the outcome was going to be? Nada.
not_available Niente.
not_available Zip.
not_available Could be us, Southside or Central.
not_available Someone's closing down.
not_available I got this.
not_available Here you go, Manny.
not_available Three cans of pop.
not_available I didn't think they'd do it.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available Neither did Anspaugh.
not_available He called me about it.
not_available Sounded like he was having a psychosensory disturbance.
not_available He's afraid he's losing his job.
not_available You know him? I did two years of Residency at Hennepin with him.
not_available The guy's lumpy.
not_available Well, I rather like him.
not_available Give it time.
not_available He eats med students for breakfast Residents for lunch, and he chews up the Attendings for dinner.
not_available There was this guy, Michaelson.
not_available He was a new ER Attending when I was there.
not_available Anspaugh vetoed every research topic he submitted.
not_available What for? 
not_available He just didn't like him.
not_available Wanted to make sure he didn't get tenure.
not_available The meeting's at 5:00? 
not_available I want you two there.
not_available Don't mention it to the staff.
not_available They're nervous enough as it is.
not_available Could we possibly be out of Decadron? It's on one of the top shelves.
not_available They repoed your car, huh? You knew that, didn't you? 
not_available I didn't have the heart to tell you.
not_available You're such a coward.
not_available And you have a problem with that? I'm strapped right now.
not_available I could help you next month.
not_available Thanks, but I'm beyond a little help from my friends.
not_available I'm meeting a realtor today to sell my house.
not_available That's news.
not_available It needs so much work.
not_available I haven't paid for the roof and I don't know if I have a job next week.
not_available How's life with you? How's Gretchen? The one who went to Smith? 
not_available Gretchen is fine.
not_available And now I am armed with my trusty Decadron and I'm gonna go out and cure the croup.
not_available What did Morgenstern want? 
not_available I can't tell you.
not_available There's a meeting at 5:00 to announce whether we're shut down or not.
not_available That's the bad news, huh? 
not_available Don't worry about it yet.
not_available Well, if it affects my vacation 
not_available Vacation? I'm going to Hawaii.
not_available I decided.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available I thought you might be worried about your Residency.
not_available Any news yet? Are we jobless? No news.
not_available You can have the rumors if you'd like to hear them.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available This day's been bad enough.
not_available Call me crazy, but I think that woman's trying to get your attention.
not_available What is she doing here? Manny, what happened? 
not_available I think I ate something.
not_available You okay? 
not_available This day's getting worse.
not_available Great.
not_available Anybody seen E
not_available Ray? Mrs.
not_available Bradley? Alex? 
not_available Sorry to have kept you waiting.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Let's take a look here.
not_available That's not too bad.
not_available It didn't hurt.
not_available No, I wouldn't think so.
not_available How did you cut that? 
not_available On the top of a can of tennis balls.
not_available He's taking lessons.
not_available I hate them.
not_available How much? What do you mean? As much as doing your homework? As much as going to the dentist? Definitely as much as both.
not_available I hate it as much as taking the trash out, cleaning up after the dog.
not_available You wanted a dog.
not_available Well, I didn't want Robert.
not_available Don't talk like that about your brother.
not_available You know better than that.
not_available He loves you.
not_available I know.
not_available And who feeds the dog? Me.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Those shots you get at the dentist, Novocain, you're not allergic to those? They stuck these things in my nose and gave me this oxygen tank to take home with me.
not_available And that inhaler thing, it didn't work at all.
not_available Betty, you can't smoke in here.
not_available You can't smoke around this oxygen tank, even at home.
not_available It'll blow up.
not_available I want you to know that I asked for you specially.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Very flattered.
not_available Malik needs you in 3! It's about an old guy, a Mr.
not_available Heath? I'll be right back.
not_available Call Carol.
not_available And page Dr.
not_available Lewis or Greene.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Get a mask on him.
not_available What happened? He arrested.
not_available The monitor's flatline.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Lewis and Greene? 
not_available I paged them.
not_available Want me to call his nurse? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Travels has gone traveling.
not_available Let's give him 
not_available You're pumping too hard.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How about an amp of? 
not_available Epi! And a mg of atropine.
not_available I think I just broke his rib.
not_available I'm getting a faint pulse! That's about 1200 mics.
not_available Give him 500 mics of dopamine.
not_available Damn good job, Carter.
not_available I'll call for transfer.
not_available I can't believe I broke his rib.
not_available I knew he was frail, but 
not_available Better than letting him die.
not_available Transfer him up to Medicine.
not_available I got a hernia that needs an H &amp; P upstairs now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hello? Mrs.
not_available Puro? Hi there.
not_available I'm sorry I'm late.
not_available How did you get in? Your mother.
not_available She makes a killer cup of coffee.
not_available There you are.
not_available I was going to call the hospital.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Material for the kitchen curtains.
not_available I thought I'd drop it off.
not_available I'm glad you changed your mind.
not_available About what? 
not_available About selling.
not_available I told Elizabeth.
not_available First names only in my business.
not_available I told her you must have changed your mind.
not_available Why else would we put up curtains? 
not_available Not to sell it.
not_available No.
not_available It wouldn't help.
not_available Why don't you see how they'd look in the bedroom? You want the same in the bedroom? We'll talk about it later.
not_available I haven't changed my mind.
not_available I want to sell this place.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Is there a problem? How can I put this delicately? I couldn't sell this house if Chicago burned down around it.
not_available I know it needs work, but 
not_available The roof is The roof is new! I was going to say the roof is fine.
not_available But the furnace doesn't even turn on.
not_available Not to mention the asbestos.
not_available There's no central air, no window unit.
not_available Exposed 2by
not_available 4s, dry wall.
not_available There are holes in the carpet which, unfortunately, reveal the subterranean termites.
not_available The plumbing's not copper, the electrical's a fire waiting to happen.
not_available And as much as I hate to mention it, you live next to the El tracks.
not_available Frankly, I'm impressed someone managed to sell it to you.
not_available A month after the abscess was drained, she had to have a hysterectomy.
not_available My God was she in pain then! Weeks, weeks, weeks! And what's so unfair is that with all four of our kids, cesareans which is a lot of slicing couldn't stand up straight until 1987.
not_available You can see why with this hernia thing which is also somewhat in the middle I'm obviously a little nervous.
not_available Being able to talk to you is helping.
not_available I'm very grateful.
not_available I won't be able to do this when I'm out and Doctor What's his name? 
not_available Benton.
not_available That's it.
not_available Benton.
not_available When I'm under the knife, and he starts cutting Oh, my God! My God! What if I don't come out of this? I won't know what happened.
not_available Have you considered having a local anesthetic instead of a general? I didn't know I had a choice.
not_available The advantage to a local is that while you feel no pain, you're awake and you can talk to the surgeon.
not_available Can I ask questions? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton encourages it.
not_available In the middle of surgery? 
not_available All the way through.
not_available In fact, you could read up on hernias in this book.
not_available And anything you don't understand you can ask Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available That's great.
not_available Ross was looking for you.
not_available Some kid needs suturing.
not_available I have to go to Radiology and the cath lab.
not_available Have you seen Mark? 
not_available I believe he is lounging.
not_available Come on! All right, all right! My turn.
not_available Time's up.
not_available This is a There you are! 
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available You know, you made poor Tad very sad.
not_available What did he say? You don't even know him! 
not_available Gotcha! That's a low one, Doug.
not_available I take it you don't want me to tell anybody about your date tonight.
not_available You have another date? I hate this place.
not_available It's right there.
not_available She hit it with her hand.
not_available It would be better if we sewed them.
not_available Everything in this house could be better! Fine! Why are you mad at me? I didn't put holes in the floor, break the furnace.
not_available You're right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I really want to sell this place.
not_available I need to sell this place.
not_available Is it because of Shep? I mean, does it make you think of him? God, Mom! I never even thought of that.
not_available I feel good being on my own.
not_available I just can't afford it.
not_available The house, the car.
not_available Somehow I've accumulated the debt of a 50year
not_available old.
not_available We should call your Uncle Mykola.
not_available Uncle Myko? Why? He made all that money in real estate.
not_available He could advise you.
not_available It's not advice that I need.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available But spend some time there.
not_available Keep him company.
not_available You know, he has so much money and he has no children of his own.
not_available And, sadly, he has not been feeling well lately.
not_available Are you suggesting I ingratiate myself to Uncle Myko so he'll leave me money? Well, he's going to die.
not_available I can't help that.
not_available I mean, he has no children.
not_available What's the poor man going to do? This feels like surgery.
not_available It really does.
not_available And I'm floating, floating, floating.
not_available I thought you guys played music.
not_available Although, I don't miss it.
not_available Is this gonna hurt, Dr.
not_available Benton? I've made the incision, Mr.
not_available Hartley, and you didn't feel a thing.
not_available I mean, in a couple of days.
not_available It'll be tender.
not_available I mean, like, when I go back to work.
not_available Go back to work when you feel comfortable.
not_available When will that be? Are we talking Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? Another week? 
not_available What do you do? You know that drawbridge on Michigan? I send it up.
not_available Send it down.
not_available Send it up, send it down.
not_available Up, down up, down.
not_available Rain, shine, sleet, snow.
not_available Some days I count the boats.
not_available Some days I don't.
not_available By the way, what are the borders of Hesselbach's triangle? You might want to shift a little to the left.
not_available Manny threw up right around there.
not_available Manny? From the roachcoach? Food poisoning? 
not_available I told you.
not_available It wasn't the coffee, was it? Are you ever getting off that? 
not_available I'm on hold with the airlines.
not_available At least that's what the reservations department has told me 97 times.
not_available Mark, you ready? Or not, as the case may be.
not_available We'll be waiting.
not_available All right.
not_available I told Susan about the meeting.
not_available I told Jeanie, Malik and Carter.
not_available I figured if you don't tell Doug Ross, then you're okay.
not_available How are you doing, Mr.
not_available Heath? Thomas, where are you? Your dinner's ready.
not_available I bet those ribs hurt.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available You hear me? Get inside now.
not_available We'll get you something for the pain.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Listen to me! I'm listening to you, Mr.
not_available Heath.
not_available I'm listening to you.
not_available There he is.
not_available This is impossible.
not_available Maybe you should yell "fire." 
not_available No chairs.
not_available It's a little crowded.
not_available Every buzzard in the county showed up for this one.
not_available Present company excepted.
not_available Alice Wakely.
not_available She's from Health Services since the Paleolithic.
not_available You know her? 
not_available We went to school together.
not_available She was ahead of me, of course.
not_available Okay, okay, everybody.
not_available I'll spare you and make this quick.
not_available While we regret the need to close any county medical facility She's lying already.
not_available This isn't quick.
not_available our strapped budget's made it unavoidable.
not_available Two weeks from today Southside will close its doors.
not_available There's the good news.
not_available We're concerned about the loss of jobs so we'll consolidate as much of the staff as possible.
not_available There are people I'll introduce for those who might not know them.
not_available Harrison Holman is coming over as new Chief of Obstetrics.
not_available Bonnie Brown will share the CFO office with James Malkovitch.
not_available I've heard she's excellent.
not_available Did a great job at Deaconess.
not_available And with Mike Babcock taking early retirement Donald Anspaugh will become County's new Chief of Staff.
not_available I just was thinking how unusual it is to see our whole ensemble this happy.
not_available Especially about keeping a job where people puke on you.
not_available Is that the guy? 
not_available That's the guy.
not_available Which guy? He looks fairly normal.
not_available So did Morgenstern.
not_available They finally came down for Heath.
not_available Took him to the CCU.
not_available Poor old guy.
not_available Who do you think Thomas was? His son? I know this sounds crazy, but I think Thomas was his dog.
not_available His dog? At one point, he seemed to think I was Thomas.
not_available He pulled me in close ear to his mouth, and he 
whispers "Kibble, kibble, kibble, kibble." It was oddly touching.
not_available It was, Carol! How are you? Don Anspaugh.
not_available Lydia Wright.
not_available Pleased to meet you.
not_available E
not_available Ray.
not_available Please join us.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay, I'll let everybody know.
not_available That was Dr.
not_available Weaver calling from the lounge.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern will be unable to attend the party.
not_available I'm sure it won't be as bad as you think.
not_available Look how bad everybody thought it would be when I came aboard.
not_available True.
not_available Funny how life is so like surgery.
not_available Sometimes you can make that Rocky Davis in the right, lower quadrant.
not_available And then there are those days when your bowel ruptures spills into your peritoneum, and all you're left with is intense pain and sepsis.
not_available Oh, brother! My kingdom for a 10
not_available blade when that happens.
not_available Look, so today's not a total loss you want to grab some dinner, maybe catch a movie? The Music Box has some really fine independents.
not_available Sure.
not_available Maybe a midnight show at the Village.
not_available Have you seen Caligula? 
not_available Don't do this to me.
not_available Some of us have to date.

not_available It scared the daylights out of me.
not_available All right, I'm sorry.
not_available It'll never happen again.
not_available Let's go get a drink, you and I.
not_available Couldn't get anything going tonight? 
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Let's get a drink.
not_available It's never just a drink, Doug.
not_available Is that all that you want it to be? It'd be nice if you called the day before.
not_available Heather, you know my schedule.
not_available It's hard enough to plan two hours ahead, much less a day.
not_available Some really sick little kid would come in then I'd cancel on you, and you'd be mad at me for doing that.
not_available I am not mad at you.
not_available You look as though you've had a very long, very hard day.
not_available And I'd like to take you out and see you relax a little bit.
not_available I'll throw in a lottery ticket.
not_available I gotta drop these off at Neurology first.
not_available Did you actually give him an enema? 
not_available No.
not_available Compazine.
not_available Carter went home to bed.
not_available Benton's been beating up on him these days.
not_available I'm shocked and horrified to hear that.

not_available I gave myself plenty of time to go home and change, but I don't care.
not_available Really.
not_available So you live up on the Gold Coast? I'm renovating a three
not_available flat.
not_available Must be a lot easier when you're an architect.
