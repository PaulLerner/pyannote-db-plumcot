not_available Sure, yeah.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Hey, Rach! How's it going? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Your mom will be here real soon to pick you up.
not_available So who's winning? 
not_available She is.
not_available She's good too.
not_available Thanks for watching her.
not_available Hey, no problem.
not_available I had four sisters.
not_available Mark, can I steal you for a consult? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll be back in a second.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available I'll back as soon as I can.
not_available I remembered him.
not_available His father was in with respiratory and liver problems.
not_available Passed out in his own vomit.
not_available Noah called 911 and saved him.
not_available Father of the Year candidate.
not_available He's been in six times in two years.
not_available He's a real mess.
not_available The DCFS guy's here.
not_available Dad's a drunk, kids are playing outside on a school day.
not_available Who says the American family is in decline? How you doing? So how long will it take you to get these kids out of the home? Dave Donovan.
not_available Nice to meet you too.
not_available Their mother's MIA.
not_available Dad's been on a bender for three years.
not_available He's cleaned up pretty well now.
not_available AA, job.
not_available How's Kenny? Ruptured spleen, concussion, fractured thigh.
not_available He's gonna be okay.
not_available And Noah? We'll admit him until you find him a placement.
not_available Come on.
not_available Not looking for one.
not_available Father's on his way in.
not_available So what? The father lets his kids run wild.
not_available They're boys, screwed up.
not_available Played hooky.
not_available No, no, the father screwed up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe, maybe not.
not_available So that's all you're gonna do.
not_available Let's just wait and see.
not_available Okay.
not_available John, hold on! 
not_available I'm in a hurry.
not_available This will only take a sec.
not_available Okay.
not_available You haven't told Rubadoux his wife's condition is serious.
not_available I tried.
not_available I couldn't get a word in.
not_available He needs to know so he can say goodbye.
not_available Why does it have to be me? 
not_available He trusts you.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Karen Hardy.
not_available She's been there about 20 minutes.
not_available Her mother signed a DNR order.
not_available She hasn't budged.
not_available I'm afraid she may challenge the order.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hardy, this is Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Hi.
not_available This would be a good time to see her.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available This glass between us is just fine.
not_available Your mother's condition is very grave.
not_available We can't be sure she'll pull through.
not_available Did she ask to see me? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available She only ever wants to see the bottom of a bottle of booze.
not_available Your mother is dying and she's asked that no measures be taken to save her life.
not_available You understand the implications of her request? She wants to die.
not_available She can't face the truth that she's an alcoholic.
not_available Never admit that.
not_available I don't know why parents lie to their kids.
not_available Children know.
not_available Always.
not_available If there's a chance to make peace, you should talk to her.
not_available I don't want to see her.
not_available I believe you.
not_available But you have been standing there for 20 minutes.
not_available You said there were some papers I should sign.
not_available Yeah, they're at the desk.
not_available Rheumatology, no.
not_available Orthopedics, no.
not_available What are you doing? Trying to find a study to take Mrs.
not_available Rubadoux.

not_available Bingo! Dr.
not_available Carter This is Carter in the ER.
not_available I've got a patient for your nerve
not_available stimulation study.
not_available Post
not_available op ischemic myelopathy.
not_available You'll see her? You'll have to hurry.
not_available Cardiology is interested too.
not_available All right, I'll save her for you.
not_available She's admitted.
not_available Neurology.
not_available They're on their way down to see her now.
not_available You'll still be her doctor, right? I'll visit, but I'm assigned to the Surgical service.
not_available But the Neurology people are the ones to help her? 
not_available That's right.
not_available And she's gonna be okay? They're the people to see.
not_available Neuro.
not_available Bye now.
not_available God bless.

not_available Now, you know that you will always have a mom and a dad who love you very much.
not_available See my fish? When you move back home can we get another angelfish to keep Moby company? Yes.
not_available Moby can have a new friend.
not_available But Daddy's not moving back home.
not_available The truth is you are gonna have two homes from now on.
not_available One with Mommy, one with me.
not_available Mommy and Daddy aren't gonna live together anymore.
not_available I know you're sad and angry.
not_available But I want you to talk to me about anything, okay? Believe me Daddy wishes it could be any other way than this.
not_available Hey, Jen.
not_available Rach and I, we were having a talk.
not_available That's good, Mark.
not_available Hey, bananafish! I'm sorry I'm late.
not_available Mommy got her cast off today.
not_available Let's pack up your stuff and go.
not_available No! Come on, honey.
not_available You can do lanyards in the car.
not_available Stop it! 
not_available Put your knapsack on.
not_available Get away! 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Don't talk to your mother like that.
not_available I don't want to go! No! 
not_available Here you go.
not_available I don't want to go! 
not_available Come on, baby.
not_available Get away.
not_available Get away! I don't want to go! No! 
not_available Upsy.
not_available Get away! I don't want to go! No! Get away! 
not_available Hello.

not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available My guest should be arriving soon.

not_available Will you excuse me for a moment? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I thought your plans changed again.

not_available Looks like everyone's finally arrived.
not_available So dinner is served.

not_available He's still in surgery.
not_available But he's gonna be all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Can I talk to you out here? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Why aren't these kids in school? I talked to the social worker 
not_available Indulge me.
not_available I usually take them, but I got a new job this week.
not_available They're supposed to take the bus.
not_available How'd you lose your old job? I quit when they put me on nights.
not_available It's none
not_available It's my business when these boys are brought to the ER.
not_available They'll be punished.
not_available They've been punished enough.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? I don't know whatHow many times have you been in here drunk? 
not_available Doug.
not_available How many times have you been in drunk? What the hell are you doing? 
not_available My job.
not_available This guy was circling the drain.
not_available I think he's trying.
not_available People don't change.
not_available Sure they do.
not_available If you wanna beat up on a father, call your own.
not_available This guy's doing the best he can.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Disappointed.
not_available They'll be cutting the haggis about now.
not_available Do you hear that? 
not_available Yeah, I hear that.

not_available Mrs.
not_available Hardy.
not_available Hi.
not_available Are you all right? I used to watch her like this when I was little.
not_available Passed out on the sofa kitchen floor, front steps.
not_available I never waited around long enough for her to wake up.
not_available Too afraid when I was a child too angry later on.
not_available I don't seem to have the energy for fear or anger.
not_available I can't decide if that's a good sign or not.
not_available Here's to arteriosclerosis without which I could not be offering you this exquisite '85 Corton
not_available Charlemagne.
not_available Beware.
not_available The last time Carl uncorked a bottle I'd bought 5% of his miracle drug, Lazerol by the end of the evening.
not_available I'm Anne Adelstein.
not_available I don't believe we've met.
not_available I'm Peter Benton.
not_available I've read your work on dialysis.
not_available It was impressive.
not_available My husband, Martin.
not_available Are you the visiting Ortho fellow? 
not_available No, darling.
not_available He's Carl's newly anointed.
not_available Yes.
not_available The chosen one.
not_available The heir apparent.
not_available Carl has an eye for talent.
not_available To the heir apparent.
not_available Not after this afternoon.
not_available Why? What happened? 
not_available I made a fool out of myself in surgery.
not_available Vucelich was too polite to kick me off the team before dinner.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Jeanie? Where's the truffle? You got me.
not_available Maybe there.
not_available Thanks again for a lovely evening.
not_available Our pleasure.
not_available Bye.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Quite the evening.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had a good time.
not_available Me too.
not_available Well Peter! Peter, do you have a moment? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Good.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, please.
not_available There's something wrong.
not_available Her pulse ox is down to 70.
not_available She's in respiratory failure.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Heart rate's down to 40.
not_available Dobutamine and dopamine are maxed.
not_available Do something! Your mother signed a Do Not Resuscitate order.
not_available You have to help her! Breathing's agonal.
not_available No BP.
not_available Pulse down to 30.
not_available Aren't you gonna do anything? We have to respect her wishes.
not_available She was very clear.
not_available Brandy, or shall we have port? 
not_available I don't drink.
not_available Don't drink? Well, how are you going to enjoy your Cohiba? Castro's favorite.
not_available Rolled on the thighs of virgins.
not_available I don't
not_available I don't smoke either.
not_available Please, Peter.
not_available You're contributing to the appalling demise of social ritual.
not_available I tell you what.
not_available Let me just put this beside you.
not_available It will make me feel so much better.
not_available I'm sorry about this afternoon's surgery.
not_available I know it was disappointing for you.
not_available It was for me.
not_available It was.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks was absolutely right.
not_available I did overstep my bounds.
not_available You did.
not_available That's exactly what I expect of you.
not_available Angela Hicks is a superb surgeon.
not_available I've never known her to make a significant error.
not_available But the physician that is useful to me is the one who keeps one eye on the details while the other eye roams the horizons.
not_available To me, medicine is a challenge.
not_available It's full of highly
not_available skilled drudgery.
not_available There are plenty of talented surgeons out there who simply perfect the practice of what has already been accomplished.
not_available My interest lies beyond that.
not_available The impossibles, the risks.
not_available That's why it's been an honor to work with you.
not_available Is it? Really? To be honest, I haven't been able to tell whether you like it or not.
not_available Believe me, it's been the best and hardest work I've ever done.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available That's music to my ears.
not_available I'd begun to fear that I saw something in you that you didn't see in yourself.
not_available I want to see it.
not_available I'll drink to that.
not_available Hello? Who is this? What are you doing sitting in the dark? Don't ask.
not_available Mind if I join you? Tough day, guys? 
not_available Don't ask.
not_available Would a little single malt Glendronach help? I don't know.
not_available We'd have to do a linear
not_available regression analysis.
not_available Well, the regression part's guaranteed.
not_available Do we have anything to eat? 
not_available I think there's some haggis left over.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Don't ask.
not_available Cheers! Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I'm buried, Ruby.
not_available I've got all this data to tabulate I've got pre
not_available op histories to dictate, a.
not_available m.
not_available labs to order.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available What? The neurologist told me she'll never leave the hospital.
not_available He's your doctor now.
not_available You should respect his opinion.
not_available You knew all along.
not_available I gotta get back to work.
not_available You were our doctor! And our friend! No, I was a fourth
not_available year medical student who took care of your wife on the Surgical service.
not_available You gave me hope because I thought you cared.
not_available You should have told me the truth.
not_available I tried.
not_available I'm not a kid! You should have told me.
not_available Did her leaving the hospital today make her worse? I don't know.
not_available I trusted you.
not_available I spent two weeks treating her multiple medical problems.
not_available I dealt with Social Services and arranged for her convalescent care.
not_available I fought with Renal and Neuro to get her admitted here.
not_available I did all I could.
not_available We're not just old people.
not_available We have lives.
not_available You look at my wife and just see her problems.
not_available I see a 20year
not_available old dancer.
not_available A 27year
not_available old bride.
not_available A 30yearold mother What do you want from me? The truth! 
not_available She's dying, Ruby! Is that what you wanna hear? She's never gonna leave this hospital.
not_available Thank you! I'm sorry, Ruby.
not_available Call me Mr.
not_available Rubadoux.
