
not_available ER Previously on ER Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, it's true? 
not_available I've been trying to tell you.
not_available I'm not renewing my fellowship because I'm applying for an Attending position.
not_available You should have had some sense.
not_available Call your family! 
not_available It was not your decision, John.
not_available Sorry.
not_available And here are some condoms.
not_available Use them.
not_available I will.
not_available The Bone Marrow Registry found eight people who preliminarily match your marrow type.
not_available David! 
not_available I've got something in my eye.
not_available Could you? Who the hell was that? "Gut Reaction" Yosh, I need a hand! What have you got? 
not_available Boxes.
not_available Antibiotics, clinic expendables.
not_available Right here, Jerry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Right here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Heavy lifting is not in my job description.
not_available Where are we gonna put this stuff? 
not_available Put it in the lounge.
not_available Delivery dude's waiting on a check.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Carol? What is all this? Mrs.
not_available Carter came through with another donation for medical supplies.
not_available I thought I'd stash them in the lounge until I find a storage space.
not_available Far be it for me to want to impede the good work of the clinic.
not_available So tonight's the big night, huh? Need help? 
not_available Everything's under control.
not_available I'm impressed that you volunteered to do this year's ER banquet.
not_available Jerry's been helping me out.
not_available What's on the menu? We have herb
not_available roasted chicken.
not_available We have scalloped potatoes Dr.
not_available Greene, things didn't go quite as planned.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I didn't want to worry you.
not_available You're worrying me.
not_available The caterer couldn't do the spread for the money we had.
not_available So I had to make alternate arrangements.
not_available I hope it's not a buffet.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's a smorgasbord.
not_available Mark, do you have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Smorgasbord? 
not_available It'll be great.
not_available I got a great Swedish caterer, a friend of my Aunt Gretta's.
not_available What was that strange memo from the dean about? Apparently, he wants to explore hiring a Pediatric Emergency Attending.
not_available And whose dumb idea was that? 
not_available Doug's.
not_available Doug? Doug Ross went to the dean? And the dean thought it was worth investigating.
not_available You're telling me that Doug's actually interested in such a position? He might be.
not_available We are trained to handle anyone who comes through the door.
not_available We do not need a Pediatric Attending here.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It won't happen.
not_available They'll make a committee, determine that it's not cost
not_available effective.
not_available It'll all be history.
not_available Ms.
not_available Beavans, let us run some tests.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available She's got a fever and she's vomiting.
not_available If I don't get to work now, I'm gonna be fired.
not_available Just a few minutes.
not_available The nurse said that an hour ago! She could have a kidney infection or worse.
not_available Let us get a urine sample.
not_available I'll bring her back.
not_available I can't let you leave.
not_available You can't stop me! 
not_available Police would say I can.
not_available You'd call the cops on me? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available For endangering a child.
not_available I'll call the cops for kidnapping.
not_available What's going on? for two days.
not_available No source of infection.
not_available He threatened to call the cops! 
not_available We can work this out without police.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not letting you leave without giving this child tests.
not_available Like hell you won't! Bring her back or you're gonna be sorry! And he wants to be an Attending? Pedialyte.
not_available Make sure she gets plenty of that.
not_available Ibuprofen for fever.
not_available We'll call you with the test results.
not_available You don't want me to call your boss? 
not_available Don't bother.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available I hope it doesn't rain tonight.
not_available I'm wearing a new dress.
not_available Not to worry.
not_available It is not going to rain.
not_available The Channel 2 news said it was gonna storm.
not_available They don't know what they're talking about.
not_available No bursitis, no rain.
not_available Can I grab a ride with you and Anna to the banquet? 
not_available Doug's working late.
not_available I'm not going with Anna.
not_available Did you two break up? 
not_available We're just friends.
not_available I thought you were dating.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I mean, we've gotten really close, but no.
not_available You thought we were dating? 
not_available I thought I picked up on something.
not_available Something that she said? No.
not_available I thought I picked up on some chemistry between the two of you.
not_available I mean, there's been moments but you hate to screw up a good friendship.
not_available That's lame, Carter.
not_available Ask her out.
not_available I hope Romano doesn't page me.
not_available He keeps you on a short leash.
not_available I'd cut it in a heartbeat if I weren't afraid of losing my visa.
not_available Morgenstern might sponsor you.
not_available Out of the frying pan! What do you mean? 
not_available He's a strange fish, don't you think? No.
not_available Not really.
not_available You respect him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Why? I heard he was cutting up cadavers in the anatomy lab.
not_available So? 
not_available It's nothing.
not_available I suppose I'm looking for a convincing reason not to go back home.
not_available Why? Is your fellowship up? No.
not_available I've been offered Senior Lecturer at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I'm not sure I want to go back into that old boys' network again.
not_available Here a woman has a fighting chance.
not_available Ready? One, two three.
not_available Gently.
not_available T
not_available boned when a drunk ran a red.
not_available No LOC.
not_available BP, 150/98.
not_available Pulse, 90.
not_available Resps 25.
not_available Minor lacs to
not_available Allison? Look at you! How are you? I'm doing fine, Dr.
not_available Corday, thanks to you.
not_available She's been on the job three days.
not_available Wouldn't know she was a trainee.
not_available How's your leg? 
not_available I'm getting the strength back.
not_available I'm thrilled for you.
not_available Can we finish the bullet, please? BP, 150/98.
not_available Pulse, 90.
not_available Resps, 25.
not_available Minor lacs to the head and lower extremities.
not_available He noticed chest pains 
not_available after hitting the steering wheel.
not_available Well done.
not_available Anytime.
not_available See you.
not_available No evidence of pneumo.
not_available Good peripheral pulse without extremity tenderness.
not_available Pupils equal, disc margins clear.
not_available What are you thinking? Worst
not_available case scenario, cardiac contusion or an aortic tear.
not_available Start with a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Excuse me? Get a chest film.
not_available I've got a paraesophageal hernia.
not_available Probably torsed my stomach.
not_available Are you a doctor? 
not_available Pathologist.
not_available Rule out a volvulus.
not_available Lydia, call for a portable chest.
not_available Peter, what do you think? I think Dr.
not_available Swanson just beat us to the diagnosis.
not_available Are you going to this banquet tonight? It sounds kind of hokey.
not_available Actually, it was great fun last year.
not_available It was a nice dinner.
not_available It's good wine.
not_available Everybody ended up doing the limbo.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Come on.
not_available I guess.
not_available If you're gonna go.
not_available Would you like to go together? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Why not? 
not_available All right, I'll pick you up at 8:00.
not_available Great.
not_available Why didn't you say there was a deposit? I thought you were taking care of the band.
not_available If I had known there was a deposit, I would've paid it.
not_available I've got 60 people showing up there tonight.
not_available You cannot cancel
not_available Mark, telephone.
not_available Can you hold on? Is it important? It's the florist.
not_available I'll say you're with a patient.
not_available What does she want? She tried to deliver your centerpieces to the Shangri Lodge.
not_available Nobody was there to receive them.
not_available Have them deliver it here.
not_available To the ER? Look, you've gotta be able to find a band for me tonight.
not_available I have a couple of buddies
not_available Jerry, get back to work.
not_available What's that? The Machine? That sounds good.
not_available Fine.
not_available Book them.
not_available I'll pay the late fee.
not_available Damn it! Labs are back on Quinesha Beavans.
not_available She's got Gram
not_available negative rods in her urine.
not_available Her CBC shows a left shift.
not_available Urosepsis.
not_available Probably.
not_available It's good you had Mrs.
not_available Beavans stick around so you could run tests.
not_available Tell Kerry Weaver about that.
not_available Want me to call her and make sure she brings in Quinesha for IV antibiotics? I can be diplomatic, buddy.
not_available I know you can.
not_available Dr.
not_available Swanson made a correct self
not_available diagnosis.
not_available He's got a nasty
not_available looking volvulus.
not_available He's gonna need a gastrectomy.
not_available Have you ever removed the entire stomach? 
not_available No.
not_available What about you? 
not_available In a frog.
not_available Morning, folks.
not_available Good morning, Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available So, what's on the agenda? 
not_available A rather fascinating case.
not_available Pretty spiffy.
not_available Who is this? Lyle Swanson, Swanny? David Morgenstern, Dr.
not_available Swanson.
not_available I took histology from you.
not_available You inspired me to become a surgeon.
not_available You made the most beautiful axial slices of the brain.
not_available That means a great deal coming from you, sir.
not_available Dr.
not_available Swanson is a world authority on immunofluorescent tumor stains.
not_available I'm afraid you have a gastric torsion.
not_available I should've had that damned hernia repaired years ago.
not_available Well, I had an Ml six months ago.
not_available I ignored the symptoms for weeks.
not_available What's your plan? We'll do an open procedure.
not_available That way we can explore your belly.
not_available Can you operate laparoscopically? I believe your case is too complicated for that.
not_available Nonsense.
not_available A lap volvulus? It's less invasive.
not_available The recovery time is quicker.
not_available What do you think? Well, it's worth a try.
not_available We can always convert to an open procedure.
not_available Lily, book an O.R.
not_available in my name.
not_available Which one of you would like to assist? Elizabeth you're the skeptic.
not_available How about it? Terrific.
not_available Isn't a smorgasbord oldfashioned? 
not_available It's gonna be great.
not_available I'd like to see a menu.
not_available We are having pickled herring, Swedish meatballs, limpa bread.
not_available And my mom's making a tub of borscht.
not_available Wait.
not_available Your mother's doing the cooking? She's doing it for free.
not_available Did you page me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Got a bowel obstruction in 2.
not_available You sure it's not just constipation? 
not_available Yes, I'm sure.
not_available Hell of a job you ER docs have.
not_available You scout out the territory and call in the big boys to go in for the kill.
not_available You got a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available The National Bone Marrow Registry called.
not_available You gave some blood last week? In the drive for Dr.
not_available Anspaugh's son.
not_available Don't tell me that I matched.
not_available Unfortunately not for Scotty.
not_available But you matched an outof
not_available state patient.
not_available Wow! That's great.
not_available That's a tough procedure, isn't it? 
not_available It's not too bad.
not_available And if I can arrange it for today, would you be willing to do it? That soon? The patient needs the marrow.
not_available I'll give you some days off to recuperate.
not_available I can perform that procedure after I check out this bowel obstruction.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And what exactly does it involve? I'll drill about 50 small holes in your pelvis and suck out the marrow.
not_available We'll give you an epidural.
not_available You won't feel a thing.
not_available Piece of cake.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Be honest with me.
not_available Do you think I have what it takes to be an Attending? Of course you do.
not_available Think of me as diplomatic? What does that have to do with it? 
not_available Answer the question.
not_available It's not the first word that springs to mind.
not_available What would the first word be? Stubborn.
not_available Opinionated.
not_available Insouciant.
not_available Insouciant? 
not_available Look it up.
not_available You know this one? We've only played it about a billion times.
not_available Are you done eating this? 
not_available It's not very good.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available How about I order us a pizza? If you want.
not_available Maybe some rocky road for dessert? Is the pain getting worse? This thing isn't working as good as it used to.
not_available I'll get Dr.
not_available Ross to adjust it for you.
not_available Okay? Wait.
not_available Don't leave yet.
not_available This is the coolest part.
not_available Dr.
not_available Bad News.
not_available How are you feeling, son? Well, me and Jeanie were gonna share a pizza.
not_available We We need to talk.
not_available Your bone marrow failed to match the last two potential donors.
not_available You win some, you lose some.
not_available Hey, we'll come up with Plan B.
not_available Okay? Your dad and I have discussed some new therapies.
not_available There is something called a Phase One chemotherapy trial.
not_available But it's highly experimental.
not_available At least it's still a possibility, right? Yes.
not_available It couldn't be any worse than the nuke juice they've already given me.
not_available There could be some severe side effects.
not_available And the chemo could Make me croak.
not_available We don't have to make a decision right this minute.
not_available What do you think, Jeanie? I think it's a chance.
not_available Would you stay with me if I got the new chemo? Of course I would.
not_available I wanna do it.
not_available You sure lucked out getting that lap.
not_available Do you like working with Morgenstern? 
not_available Of course.
not_available He's one of the best.
not_available Why is it I don't feel comfortable around him? Can't imagine.
not_available Last week he bolted out midway through a pericardiocentesis.
not_available Claimed he had something in his eye.
not_available Then he must have.
not_available It seemed to me like he froze up.
not_available I can't believe that.
not_available Let me tell you something about Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available He's taught me more than all the other Attendings combined.
not_available Maybe I'm looking for an excuse to get out of this.
not_available I don't have much experience of laparoscopic procedures.
not_available See, that's it.
not_available Whenever you're nervous you go after the Attendings.
not_available Do I really? Well, I guess I do.
not_available Have you ever done a lap volvulus? 
not_available No.
not_available But I'd love to.
not_available In that case, be my guest.
not_available Are you serious? Yeah.
not_available I'll do your biopsy and then I'll come observe you.
not_available Perhaps I'll learn something.
not_available Well Okay.
not_available I owe you.
not_available David? I hope I'm not disturbing you.
not_available Oh, heavens, Kerry, you never disturb me.
not_available Is that a lap volvulus? Heard you're doing one on Dr.
not_available Swanson.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just looking at one of my old teaching tapes.
not_available Never hurts to review the finer points of establishing a pneumoperitoneum.
not_available He told me that you were one of his brightest students.
not_available Good old Swanny.
not_available He's from the old school of medicine.
not_available Cares about the science and the soul.
not_available I came up to bring you the minutes of the Blood Utilization Committee.
not_available Thought you might be interested now that you're back on staff.
not_available You're always looking out for me.
not_available Which reminds me, are you coming to the ER banquet tonight? You're part of the family.
not_available It sounds like great fun.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Right
not_available o.
not_available So I spoke to the pain management team.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's all right.
not_available We're gonna increase your morphine dosage.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where's Jeanie? She's probably down in the ER working.
not_available No.
not_available She promised to stay with me when I get the new chemo.
not_available I spoke to your dad about that.
not_available He's worried that you may not understand what it means to be in a Phase One treatment study.
not_available I know.
not_available The chemo could make me a lot sicker.
not_available Yeah, it can.
not_available You're willing to go through with that? Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Where have you been? I was down in the gift shop.
not_available I got you a little something.
not_available A new Hot Rod.
not_available You let me read that when you're done, all right? Scott and I were just talking about the pros and cons of a Phase One study.
not_available And I was telling Dr.
not_available Ross that we're gonna go for it.
not_available He's a pretty brave guy.
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available Very brave.
not_available Yes, I'll hold.
not_available So I talked to Anna, and we're going together.
not_available But don't call it a date.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available I have to speak to Mrs.
not_available Carter immediately.
not_available Well, page her out of her board meeting.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Carol wrote a bad check.
not_available Her medical supplies are getting repo'd.
not_available Your grandmother wrote me this.
not_available Could you please have her call me back? Thank you.
not_available She put a stop payment on her foundation check? What did you do? Nothing.
not_available Last week we had some bad press.
not_available We gave out birth control to teens.
not_available Gamma isn't anti
not_available birth control.
not_available She does hate publicity, though.
not_available What should I do? You could promise that you won't use her money for birth control.
not_available I would if I could reach her.
not_available Dr.
not_available C, eye exam in 1.
not_available I'm sure it's just a big misunderstanding.
not_available Is the patient ready? 
not_available He's asleep.
not_available Okay.
not_available The monitor goes at the head of the table.
not_available The endoscopic tower's on the wrong side.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern requested it this way.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yes, doctor.
not_available Quite sure.
not_available Shirley! How nice to see you! You still collecting old 45s? Just picked up a rare Buddy Holly.
not_available It's great to have you back.
not_available Well, it's good to be home.
not_available Peter? I thought your associate was going to assist.
not_available She's doing a biopsy, so she'll be by later to observe.
not_available So it's you and me! Just like old times.
not_available Shirley, I left a CD of some Peruvian panpipe music by the scrub sink.
not_available Would you mind putting it on? 
not_available Not at all, Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available You'll like this, Peter.
not_available The music is mysterious and yet soothing.
not_available You have a scratch on your cornea, Mr.
not_available Bartlett.
not_available I'll be right back with some antibiotic eye drops for you.
not_available Carter, do you have a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Is something wrong? 
not_available No.
not_available I matched for a transplant candidate from the blood we donated last week.
not_available You're gonna donate bone marrow? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I guess I won't make it to the banquet tonight.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available You should be sore for a couple of days.
not_available Why? It's a simple procedure, right? Not much to it.
not_available Have you ever done one? 
not_available About 12 or so last year.
not_available Would you do mine? Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't mean to sound like a wimp.
not_available I just feel a little nervous about it.
not_available I've never even seen you flinch.
not_available Not even in the bloodiest traumas.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available It's different when you're the patient.
not_available Just a big chicken, huh? 
not_available Don't rub it in, please.
not_available No.
not_available Hey, it's just 
not_available It's surprising.
not_available If you don't want to do it, fine.
not_available I'd be honored.
not_available I'll do it as soon as I'm finished with my patient.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Appreciate it.
not_available Bye.
not_available Mark, did Romano see that kid with the appy? Yeah.
not_available He's examining him now.
not_available Is everything set for the banquet? 
not_available Seems to be moving right along.
not_available The University Club put on such a lovely banquet last year.
not_available It's too bad it wasn't available.
not_available It was.
not_available I just thought the Shangri Lodge would be a different choice.
not_available You actually chose the Shangri Lodge over the University Club? 
not_available A little less pretentious.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available That appy kid's dry as a bone.
not_available Buff him up.
not_available Give him 200 cc's normal saline every 15 minutes.
not_available That's too much fluid for a kid.
not_available I already gave him two 500 cc boluses.
not_available I want you to give him then send him up to the O.R.
not_available You fluid
not_available overload these patients.
not_available Follow my orders on the chart.
not_available In my ER, I'll manage the patients the way I see fit! Hey, Greene! I guess you got some stones after all.
not_available You're the boss.
not_available We'll free up the esophagus with a harmonic scalpel.
not_available When I was a Resident, we didn't have cautery.
not_available We had to tie every vessel.
not_available Tell me, Peter.
not_available Where do you find the branches of the vagus at this level of the esophagus? They become the anterior and posterior.
not_available You cut them, the stomach won't empty.
not_available Right you are.
not_available Speaking of "empty" and "stomach," anyone try that new Mexican restaurant? I heard they make a great chimichanga.
not_available Shirley, turn down the thermostat.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Of course.
not_available I was doing laps back when those monitors were still blackand
not_available white.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern? 
not_available What? You're dissecting the edge of the esophagus.
not_available Thank you, doctor, but I don't need instruction.
not_available Boy, that phrenic ligament is really fibrous.
not_available Are you sure it's not mucosa? Damn it! Peter, your job is to assist me.
not_available Anticipate my moves.
not_available I am.
not_available But he's got varices.
not_available You could nick one.
not_available Turn the music off.
not_available Don't pull so hard with the Babcock.
not_available You'll tear the gastric artery.
not_available I'm not pulling.
not_available The hell you're not! Dr.
not_available Morgenstern, you're obscuring my field.
not_available Oh, son of a bitch! You tore the left gastric.
not_available I wasn't anywhere near it.
not_available Suction.
not_available Give me a 10 mm sucker, open
not_available ended.
not_available Let's move.
not_available I can't see what I'm coagulating.
not_available All right.
not_available We have to open.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available We can control the bleeding.
not_available Every time I suck, the abdominal wall collapses.
not_available I can't see a thing.
not_available Well, then stop sucking.
not_available What are you wearing? 
not_available My velvet dress.
not_available The one you wore last year? I didn't pass out and rip mine in the parking lot like someone I know.
not_available Jeanie, you going to the banquet? No, I'll finish some charts and stay with Scott.
not_available No luck with a donor match? 
not_available No.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Can I talk to you? I'm concerned about Scott.
not_available You sure he wants this experimental treatment? Why? Did he say he didn't? 
not_available No.
not_available What are you concerned about? 
not_available He's got this crush on you.
not_available Doug, the boy is 12 years old.
not_available He'll do anything to please you.
not_available He just wants a chance to get better.
not_available Have you seen how he looks at you? 
not_available You overreact.
not_available He lights up when you're around.
not_available I think that he's taking the chemo because he thinks you want him to.
not_available No.
not_available I want him to make his own decision.
not_available I know that you do.
not_available I don't know that he can.
not_available Pressure's dropping.
not_available He's lost too much blood.
not_available Let's open.
not_available Let's do a midline.
not_available Instrument tray.
not_available Two more units of cross
not_available matched.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Scalpel.
not_available Hemostat.
not_available He's a bloody mess.
not_available Get that liver out of the way.
not_available Deaver retractor.
not_available Let's move.
not_available His varices are bleeding.
not_available Suction! See the bleeder? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Bradying down.
not_available Two more units of blood.
not_available Okay, we gotta crack him.
not_available Let me suture.
not_available We've gotta stop the bleeding.
not_available Shove your hand in there and squeeze.
not_available We're losing him.
not_available I can't find the bleeder.
not_available We've gotta crack him.
not_available It's these damn varices.
not_available Doctor, it's been three minutes.
not_available Damn it! He's dying.
not_available Move! Ribspreader! Damn it, I said rib
not_available spreader! Let's move, people! Satinsky.
not_available Okay, aorta's clamped.
not_available Do we have a pulse? No pulse.
not_available He's in V
not_available fib.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm starting internal massage.
not_available Still in V
not_available fib.
not_available The lungs aren't expanding.
not_available Increase the volume.
not_available Lap pad.
not_available I can't get a grip.
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available Give me the epi.
not_available Come on! Let's move! Let's go! The tray is ready.
not_available Here are your gloves.
not_available Thanks, Kit.
not_available Call me if you need anything.
not_available Carter, are you ready? Epidural didn't hurt a bit.
not_available I told you, you had absolutely nothing to be nervous about.
not_available Sure.
not_available That's what they told me when I had my tonsils out.
not_available I was 12.
not_available I was in terrible pain after the operation, so they gave me Dilaudid.
not_available They gave me too much and I couldn't wake up.
not_available It was really weird, you know.
not_available I could hear the nurses' voices.
not_available And I couldn't speak or move.
not_available I thought I was gonna die.
not_available And then I made a promise to God.
not_available And I said, "If you let me live I'll be a good person for the rest of my life.
not_available " And you came to and decided to devote your life to medicine? Something like that.
not_available I'm really relieved you're doing this.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't tell me when you'll stick the needle in.
not_available I won't.
not_available I'll prep with a little Betadine.
not_available All right.
not_available Your drape fell off a little bit.
not_available All right.
not_available Here comes the Betadine.
not_available I can't let you examine him until after the autopsy.
not_available I know.
not_available I just want to review the anatomy.
not_available That's quite an unusual request.
not_available Why are you so interested? Well, you know, it all happened so unexpectedly.
not_available I just I've known Dr.
not_available Swanson for 20 years.
not_available It's not easy for me either.
not_available So do you think it would be possible to sit in on the autopsy? Sure.
not_available Tomorrow, 4 p.
not_available m.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You down here checking on the Swanson autopsy? Yeah.
not_available I assisted on the case.
not_available I know.
not_available David Morgenstern filled me in.
not_available Alice, when do you expect to have the report? In a couple of days.
not_available The sooner the better.
not_available I'm sorry about what happened.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available Not really.
not_available I spoke to David about the argument in the O.R.
not_available He downplayed it.
not_available Right.
not_available Understand Dr.
not_available Swanson had cirrhotic liver, varices, secondary to hep B.
not_available Yeah, he did have varices.
not_available No wonder you couldn't stop the hemorrhaging.
not_available We'll run an M and M, see if we can learn something from this tragedy.
not_available Why don't you take charge? Gather all the charts and the tape.
not_available The tape? We often tape laparoscopic procedures.
not_available See if the operation was recorded.
not_available If it was, you can take us all through it step by step.
not_available We shouldn't leave these here.
not_available What are these? 
not_available It's a miniature stethoscope.
not_available It's a theme.
not_available Dumb idea? No.
not_available Just tacky.
not_available Did you talk to Gamma yet? 
not_available She never returned my call.
not_available This might not be about you.
not_available What? 
not_available I'll go talk to her after I get off.
not_available Thanks.
not_available And by the way, Anna said she'd call you later.
not_available She was in a lot of pain, took a taxi home.
not_available Guess she's gonna miss the banquet.
not_available Viper convertible.
not_available It's pretty cool, huh? Yeah.
not_available I'm gonna get one just like it.
not_available Cobalt blue with a white racing stripe down the middle.
not_available Think you can handle it? You'll see when I take you for a ride.
not_available You haven't mentioned your friends lately.
not_available You want me to give them a call and maybe have some guys come visit? Not really.
not_available They're I don't know, just kids.
not_available I'd rather be with you.
not_available Look at those wheels.
not_available Magnesium.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Applying for a loan.
not_available What? If I can't depend on the foundation and until I get some new grants I'm taking out a loan to keep the clinic open.
not_available Am I losing my mind? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Sixmonth
not_available old twins in respiratory distress! Parents said they have the flu.
not_available They're down in the waiting room.
not_available Get me a Pediatric crash cart and clear Trauma 2! I got him.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available I know.
not_available Shirley, can you help me? I gave the nursing notes to Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available Was there a tape made? I didn't make one.
not_available But if there was a tape made, where would it be? Try the O.R.
not_available The equipment's still in there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Check the video recorder.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available Draw a racemic epi.
not_available Yosh, help Doug.
not_available I'll help Mark.
not_available Need a hand? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get the O
not_available 2.
not_available Carol, I need the line.
not_available This one is wheezing and retracting.
not_available Pulse ox, 92.
not_available Yosh, get me albuterol nebulizer, She's not breathing.
not_available Lily, intubation tray.
not_available Carol, I need that line.
not_available I can't get a vein.
not_available I'll go in interosseus.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's move her up.
not_available How's the other one? 
not_available Stable.
not_available Yosh, move her out of here.
not_available I can't see the cords.
not_available Laryngeal edema.
not_available Probably syncytial virus.
not_available She's cyanotic.
not_available Trach tray, suction.
not_available Hold the suction.
not_available Hang on.
not_available What? Wait for an air bubble.
not_available Follow it down with the tube.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right? I see the bubble.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Bag her.
not_available Peter I've been looking for you.
not_available You're one of the finest Residents I've ever worked with.
not_available What happened today has no bearing on those feelings whatsoever.
not_available I plan to support you in any way I possibly can.
not_available Support me? I'm prepared to review this case strictly on medical facts.
not_available Of course.
not_available I believe Dr.
not_available Swanson died from ruptured varices.
not_available That's not what happened.
not_available What do you think happened? Well You accidentally cut the gastric artery.
not_available I've been a surgeon for 20 years.
not_available I've never accidentally cut anything.
not_available Then how did he bleed out? You avulsed the left gastric with your clamp.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available The tape of the procedure will show that.
not_available What tape? I was hoping you made one.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Let's not let this escalate, Peter.
not_available I could make this an issue of your insubordination.
not_available I don't want to do that.
not_available I would've never taken over if I
not_available You did more than that! You pushed me away from the operating table! That's grounds for dismissal.
not_available If a man's life wasn't at stake
not_available A man's life was at stake.
not_available And that life was lost.
not_available I'd appreciate it if your preparation for M and M focused on the medicine and not hypotheticals and accusations.
not_available Dr.
not_available Swanson deserves at least that measure of dignity.
not_available The clinic's done a lot of good work in the family's name.
not_available I'm glad you feel that way.
not_available So doesn't it make sense to continue funding it? I think it's time Carol Hathaway looked for other funding sources.
not_available She's worked very hard to make a go of this clinic.
not_available It's not fair to pull the rug right out from underneath her.
not_available I'm surprised at your interest in the foundation.
not_available How many years have I tried to involve you in our family's charitable activities? This isn't about the foundation.
not_available What is it about? You're angry with me about Chase.
not_available You're taking it out on the clinic.
not_available I am angry that your cousin will be debilitated for the rest of his life.
not_available It's not something I would take out on others.
not_available Chase barely accepted my help! He didn't want the family to know.
not_available None of you wants the family involved in your lives.
not_available That's unfair.
not_available I care about the family.
not_available You certainly care about the money.
not_available What? You live off a family trust, John.
not_available Gamma, if that is all you think of me, then you can keep your money.
not_available As you wish, John.
not_available David? Hi.
not_available You know, I heard about Dr.
not_available Swanson.
not_available Hard losing Swanny like that.
not_available Why don't you come with me to the banquet? Thank you, Kerry.
not_available I just want to go home.
not_available Mark.
not_available You know, I've been thinking all day about the proposal for a Pedes Attending.
not_available I think we should fight it.
not_available I'm a little torn.
not_available I just saw Doug Ross save a 6month
not_available old's life.
not_available Doug is a good pediatrician.
not_available He's not management material.
not_available He's never been interested before.
not_available It's not just Doug.
not_available It's a policy change that would undermine our authority.
not_available I'm not worried about my authority.
not_available I think ER Attendings run the best emergency department.
not_available I agree.
not_available Good.
not_available All right, see, watch this.
not_available Let me get you right on the I'll be right back.
not_available Quinesha came back for IV antibiotics.
not_available I was just entertaining her.
not_available How's her mom's job? 
not_available I called her work.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available Good for you.
not_available You would've done the same.
not_available Listen, I'm serious about the Attending thing.
not_available You ought to give it a shot.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available Here we go, kiddo.
not_available Dr.
not_available Swanson taught half the Attendings here.
not_available Everybody loved him.
not_available I'd get all my ducks in a row if I were you, Peter.
not_available I did nothing wrong.
not_available Rumor has it you took over.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available That's your opinion.
not_available But justified or not, you're a Resident.
not_available And Morgenstern's the Chief.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available So much for your bursitis.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, hot borscht will be up in five minutes, all right? Has anybody seen the band? 
not_available I don't see any food either.
not_available Don't they usually serve hors d'oeuvres? Wouldn't wanna spoil your appetite for the smorgasbord.
not_available The bartender just asked me for a drink ticket.
not_available I didn't bring any cash.
not_available Here.
not_available One each? 
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available Hey! Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Kind of an unusual place.
not_available It's different, you know.
not_available But it's great.
not_available It's a disaster.
not_available I wouldn't say that.
not_available You want another drink? It's really nice, Mark.
not_available Mark Greene? I'm The Machine.
not_available Band's here.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Great.
not_available You guys need some help bringing your stuff in? No guys.
not_available Just me.
not_available You're The Machine? The whole Machine? Hey! Carter! Over by the moose! I couldn't get my grandmother to listen.
not_available Somebody did.
not_available She messengered over another check.
not_available Whatever you said really worked.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available Watch your head on the moose.
not_available Why aren't you home in bed? What? And miss my first ER banquet? How's the pain? It's okay now after a couple of Percodan.
not_available Makes for a very pleasant banquet.
not_available I should pass them around.
not_available Well, you look Thanks.
not_available So do you.
not_available You know, we've kind of been dancing around this thing a little bit.
not_available And this afternoon during the bone marrow A couple of points during the year I kind of felt like we had chemistry.
not_available Or not.
not_available No.
not_available No, you're right.
not_available I mean, there's definitely been, you know All right.
not_available Well, let me say this.
not_available I haven't made a move because I didn't want to screw up our friendship.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know.
not_available You've been a great friend.
not_available The only real friend I've made here, actually.
not_available But? But? But there's this other guy.
not_available That guy you told me about in Philly? The guy with the drug problem? Well, I think that's past him now.
not_available So I'm We were together for a long time.
not_available We've not been together for a while.
not_available So it's not completely over.
not_available I guess I'm just not quite there yet.
not_available You know? But 
not_available Hey, I understand.
not_available You do? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I understand.
not_available What are friends for? Dr.
not_available Greene, the crowd's getting restless.
not_available Give them some drink tickets while The Machine is setting up.
not_available Alrighty.
not_available Saved by the smorgasbord! Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served! What happened? 
not_available He's arrested.
not_available Fever's 104.
not_available Is he septic? That's what happens when they get to this state.
not_available He was about to start a Phase One.
not_available Poor kid.
not_available Let's give him two of epi.
not_available Would you mind taking over the bagging? Somebody should call his father.
not_available Why don't these parents just let these poor kids go? We've got a rhythm.
not_available Okay, let's give him tobra and ceftaz.
not_available Do you want hydrocortisone? 
not_available Yes, please.
not_available Good work, everyone.
not_available We have got him back.
not_available Carol, are your meatballs frozen? I think they' re just a little cold.
not_available What is this? Jerry says it's called pyttipanna.
not_available What's that? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hello.
not_available I just wanted to say thank you for coming tonight.
not_available I organized this event in hopes to show my appreciation for all of your great work.
not_available So try not to hold tonight against me.
not_available Each day we work together as a family.
not_available Because we're a family, it's no secret that it's been a rough year for me.
not_available So I want to thank each of you for helping me through some hard times.
not_available You stuck by me when I needed you.
not_available And you've given your best to make our ER a place that we can all be proud of.
not_available So thanks for being my family.
not_available I couldn't have made it without you.
not_available Here we go! I had the Babcock on the lesser curvature of the stomach.
not_available There's no way I could've been near the left gastric.
not_available Any way you could've caught the artery? No.
not_available Morgenstern was dissecting the esophagus.
not_available My clamp was on the stomach the entire time.
not_available Then it's your word against his.
not_available So how much did you see on the monitor? I got there just before you performed the thoracotomy.
not_available In time to see me push him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm willing to express my concern about his competency.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I don't want you to jeopardize your career over this.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe my clamp did slip.
not_available You just told me you had the clamp on the stomach the entire time.
not_available I'm sure I did.
not_available Peter, if you're sure that's what happened Yeah.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available The food was terrible.
not_available The music stinks.
not_available The drinks are watered down.
not_available But you sure know how to throw a great party.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Are you feeling better? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available The antibiotics are working.
not_available You got a big decision to make.
not_available I told you what I want to do.
not_available I know.
not_available Just hear me out.
not_available I'm gonna love you and respect you no matter what you decide.
not_available And I'll always be there for you.
not_available So if you want to take this chemo, you have to do it for yourself.
not_available Not for your dad or for your sister or for me.
not_available Understand? 
not_available I think so.
not_available A man has to make decisions for himself.
not_available I don't want any more chemo.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know what I want? I want to get in that Viper.
not_available Cobalt blue with the racing stripe.
not_available Put the top down and drive.
not_available And where would we go? California.
not_available Surfing? Ride the curl at Zuma Beach.
not_available Sounds like fun.
not_available And we'll stay for the sunset.
not_available Sure.
