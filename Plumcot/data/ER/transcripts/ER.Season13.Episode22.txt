
not_available Previously on ER So you quit your job and get married in the same week? I'm a new guy now.
not_available Maybe some of that love will rub off on all of us here and help us find someone as special as you two have.
not_available I got them the honeymoon suite at the Ritz for a few nights, but they say they can't use it on account of Joe and everything.
not_available Oh, it's go time.
not_available You're a real prick, you know that? Stop it! Tony! I don't love you.
not_available So that's it? We're done? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Because Ray couldn't get over you? Have you seen my other sock? I just bought these.
not_available Nobody wears socks in Hawaii.
not_available Ugh, I can't believe it's almost 9:00.
not_available I can't believe Joe's still asleep.
not_available Couldn't find anyone to cover your shift for today? No, that's the problem with surprise weddings.
not_available It's hard to plan.
not_available I'll stop by later.
not_available I have to tie up loose ends with Anspaugh.
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
not_available What? Married five days and I'm already getting mail addressed to Mrs.
not_available Luka Kovac.
not_available Nice.
not_available You know, being married isn't gonna change the fact that I don't cook 
not_available or sew or keep track of your socks.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's fine in Chicago, but on our honeymoon you're going to be serving me Martinis wearing only this.
not_available Got me a bikini.
not_available I'm a liberated modern husband.
not_available I like to shop.
not_available Abby and Luka are crazy.
not_available Who turns down three free nights in the honeymoon suite at the Ritz? Hope? Oh, my Oh You know, when I was eight, I found this book in my parents' bedroom, Sex and the Christian Marriage.
not_available And the very first page, it said, "Orgasms bring a couple closer to God." So that night at the dinner table, I asked my parents what an orgasm was.
not_available What'd they say? An orgasm is a very special kind of prayer.
not_available Which is fine and actually kind of sweet, but, like, later that week, I had my first sleepover at a friend's house.
not_available So her mom asks me what my bedtime routine is and I said, "bath, toothbrushing, orgasm, sleep." 
not_available You did not.
not_available I did.
not_available I was never invited back.
not_available Champagne? It's 8:00 in the morning.
not_available I have no sense of time in this place.
not_available Arch, you got to be at work in, like, an hour.
not_available Dirty word.
not_available What is? 
not_available Work.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, I don't have to be in till 4:00, so you go ahead and then I'll check us out of the room.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available We're staying another night.
not_available Another three nights.
not_available What? That's crazy.
not_available This room must be like a thousand dollars a night.
not_available They comped us.
not_available Why would they do that? I guess we're spending so much on room service, we made it worth their while.
not_available Now mimosa? 
not_available Nimosa.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Hey, hey, Betina, hey.
not_available Hold up.
not_available All right, all right, look, look.
not_available I got it now.
not_available I figured you out.
not_available Figured me out? You've had it with the guys who are trying to be cool and you're ready for someone real.
not_available Got someone you want to set me up with? Come on now, help me out, okay? I've seen the light.
not_available Or maybe you're just saying what you think I need to hear to go out with you? Oh, it's not like that.
not_available Really.
not_available Really.
not_available Greg I like you.
not_available But I have been dating guys like you for years.
not_available You will do whatever it takes to get the girl, but in the end, it's just about the chase.
not_available Betina, I'm not like that anymore.
not_available I've changed.
not_available This is it? They closed the ER for a paint job? Well, it's only been a few days.
not_available You can't expect a drastic change overnight.
not_available Mine point exactly, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available See you later.
not_available I've got radiology rounds in the ICU.
not_available Wait! Pratt 
not_available I got a hypotensive patient here, 87/45.
not_available All right, what's the baseline? 
not_available She runs low.
not_available Always has.
not_available Why is it that you know that an I don't? 
not_available She's febrile, too, 103.
not_available Okay, any vomiting, any coughing? Just a little belly pain.
not_available I could see my doctor tomorrow when I get home.
not_available Where's home? 
not_available Boston.
not_available We're here for her physics conference.
not_available I'm gonna cut his eyes out and send him home in a box! 
not_available Need some help here! Sam, liter of saline, find her a monitored bed, and I'll be in as soon as I can.
not_available Can't you just give me an antibiotic? We've been waiting in triage nearly three hours.
not_available I know, I'm sorry, that's the way it goes around here.
not_available You know what, let me see if there's an open bed.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Sam meet my parents, Barb and Len.
not_available They're visiting from Long Island.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Hey, Weston, come on, man, you're up.
not_available This guy needs a chest tube.
not_available I'll find you guys later.
not_available Well, you must be very proud of Larry.
not_available Have a good tour.
not_available You're even prettier than he said you were.
not_available We're so happy he finally found a girlfriend.
not_available Let me out of here, you bastard! 
not_available Where had they move the ortho stuff? I'm sorry for springing my parents on you like that.
not_available I am not your girlfriend, Larry, you know that, right? Oh, come on.
not_available Sam We made out at a wedding.
not_available That's what drunk single people do at weddings.
not_available Doesn't mean we're an item.
not_available Well, I'm not the type to take sex casually, Sam.
not_available We did not have sex.
not_available Depends on how you define sex.
not_available Larry, we did not have sex.
not_available Outercourse doesn't count? 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What? Ace or splint? 
not_available Ace is cool.
not_available So where are all the so
not_available called improvements you guys did while you were closed? Oh, what, you didn't see the new admit desk? Or how about our electrical outlets? They are a new shade of red.
not_available All right.
not_available How did you hurt your ankle? Running all over the hospital with Dr.
not_available Moretti.
not_available Who? Dr.
not_available Moretti.
not_available He's head of the ICU.
not_available I'm doing a month up there with him.
not_available Wiggle your toes.
not_available I'm wearing a pager for the Rapid Response team.
not_available The what? 
not_available It's Moretti's latest invention.
not_available When nurses get a bad feeling about the patients, they call us and we run.
not_available Like a code team.
not_available More like a pre
not_available code team.
not_available Why don't you let me have the docs take a look at your ankle just to be sure? 
not_available As long as it's not Ray.
not_available Yeah, you got it.
not_available Okay, Morris you finally close the deal with Hope or not? Hey, all I can say this is the first time I left our hotel room in three days.
not_available Mostly we're just praying.
not_available Lot of special prayers, huh? Hey, what about you and our favorite radiologist? Come on, you got to respect a woman's privacy, right? 
not_available You sly dog.
not_available Anybody seen Ray around? No.
not_available He's a couple hours late.
not_available He's probably still hung over from the wedding.
not_available He was in pretty bad shape.
not_available And, Sam, whoo, baby, wild night, huh? 
not_available Please shut up.
not_available Katey Alvaro's in curtain two.
not_available She twisted her ankle.
not_available Doesn't look broken, but take a look.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Larry? I'm gonna kill him.
not_available Hey, anybody see our physicist in curtain three? Yeah, I got to slow down in SVT, but she's next for sure.
not_available Excuse me, we're still waiting for a doctor.
not_available I'm sorry, we're really busy.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Run down.
not_available I've been working my ass off for the last six months prepping for this conference.
not_available Six months? Try 20 years.
not_available You've been working on quantum processing your entire career.
not_available Quantum processing? 
not_available Oh, theory in physics which says that an atom can exist in two places at the same time and I showed that it can work in a larger matrix.
not_available I have no idea what you just said, but it sounds impressive.
not_available It pretty much blew the lid off the entire field.
not_available Well, I think what you've got is probably viral, but I'm going to send some blood tests to be safe.
not_available Sam, we're gonna do dinner at 8:00 at Osteria Angelo.
not_available Great! Have a good time.
not_available Yeah, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't mean to sound like uptight mainlander, but I find it hard to believe that you can't rent a car with a car seat in it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Right, we'll bring our own.
not_available Yes, mahalo for nothing.
not_available Sophia Van Brummellen, 35, fell down a 15
not_available foot flight of stairs.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Can you tell me your name? 
not_available I'm gonna be sick.
not_available Okay, roll her on her side.
not_available Please be okay.
not_available Let her be okay.
not_available Abby, need some help here.
not_available Um, hello.
not_available What happened? She fell down stairs 
not_available I want to hear it from her.
not_available She slipped and she fell down
not_available her head was bouncing down the stairs; when she got to the bottom, she wasn't moving and she wasn't talking.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart, any medications or allergies? 
not_available No, she's healthy.
not_available My Okay, hang in there, 
not_available we're going to take care of you.
not_available What's her access? 
not_available 18 gauge in the right antecube.
not_available She's seizing.
not_available Ativan, two migs, let's get Trauma down here.
not_available I need a second line and 50 of Manninol right away.
not_available We've got a dilated stomach with exaggerated incisura.
not_available Call Ultrasound.
not_available Why? Caterpillar sign; could be pyloric stenosis.
not_available Pratt, I need an antibiotics order for our physicist in Three.
not_available Micro called, she's got gram positive cocci on the stain.
not_available That's probably just contaminated, she looks too good to be septic.
not_available She's still febrile and tachy, and how would you know how she looks? You haven't seen her since we brought her back an hour ago.
not_available I've got an obstructed newborn, a perfed ulcer on his sixth unit of blood, and my aphasic boxer just dropped his pressure in CT.
not_available Give her two grams of Ceftriaxone and I'll see her as soon as I can, okay? Guess what? I'll be house
not_available sitting for Luby while they're away.
not_available Luby? 
not_available Luka and Abby.
not_available You know, like Brangelina, Bennifer, Tomkat.
not_available I hear it's a nice place, and Abby says it's okay if you sleep over.
not_available What? Are you for real? I didn't think it would be right to have sex in their bed without at least asking.
not_available Load with a gram of Dilantin.
not_available What is that? A medicine to keep her from seizing again.
not_available If you want to be here, you're going to have to step back.
not_available More suction.
not_available It's cranked all the way up.
not_available Nothing's coming out.
not_available Come on, Gates.
not_available I'm trying, I can't see crap.
not_available Sat's are down to 86.
not_available Is that bad? 
not_available Abby, switch with Gates.
not_available I haven't even tried yet.
not_available Exactly.
not_available I'm being blamed for equipment failure? Don't make this about you, please.
not_available What are you doing? The tube will protect her airway 
not_available and allow us to breathe for her.
not_available Is he still mad about the Propofol? Yeah, that or the thing that happened at the wedding.
not_available What happened at the wedding? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Yeah, it's the propofol.
not_available Wants me to kiss the ring.
not_available Why don't you just apologize and get it over with? 'Cause I have nothing to apologize for.
not_available Post
not_available op morbidity and mortality are up seven percent this year.
not_available Really? Why? 
not_available I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
not_available I'm conducting an internal audit into the post
not_available op unit.
not_available I want every med, every hiccup meticulously recorded.
not_available Nurses are going to hate you.
not_available No, they're going to hate you.
not_available You're in charge of the investigation.
not_available ER Trauma call.
not_available Not you, Dusty.
not_available I want you hands
not_available on at the PACU unit.
not_available You're not doing consults till the audit's over.
not_available Oh, boo.
not_available Surgery's here.
not_available What do you got? A 35year
not_available old fell down a flight of stairs.
not_available Head trauma, intubated, FAST negative, labs pending.
not_available Came in altered, five
not_available centimeter scalp lac.
not_available Access? First crit 37, second one cooking.
not_available Want me to bag for you? 
not_available No, I got it.
not_available Bolus is done.
not_available Hey, Run D five half at 75 an hour.
not_available You don't want a fluid overload till we know what's going on in her head.
not_available It was a nice wedding.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sorry I got so crazy.
not_available I think because I knew I was leaving.
not_available I let it all hang out.
not_available I mean, you hardly even know me, and then I had to go and be like that.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, your TPA patient is seizing.
not_available I'm busy here.
not_available Find Pratt.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I got it.
not_available Go.
not_available Mae Lee, call CT.
not_available Tell 'em we're coming up.
not_available Is there a Megan Strand here? 
not_available That's me.
not_available Neighbors heard screaming in your house this morning.
not_available We were having an argument.
not_available Where the hell is my Ceftriaxone? No, it's Pratt.
not_available PRAT
not_available T.
not_available Hell, no, I'm not new! Are you? Listen, just send the stuff down, all right? I ordered the antibiotics over an hour ago.
not_available Learned helplessness is pervasive in the ER.
not_available Can't have a home
not_available schooled pharmacy tech wag the dog.
not_available You rang? What's going on? Who are you? I'm Dr.
not_available Kevin Moretti.
not_available I'm the clinical director of the ICU.
not_available They called me down here 'cause your wife's condition is deteriorating.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Fever to 103.
not_available Stain showed gram positive cocci.
not_available Yeah, we thought it was a contaminant.
not_available Which is stupid.
not_available Katey, set up for a subclavian, prime the line and get a CVP monitor.
not_available Draw a lactate now, you, and, uh, give me six units of packed blood cells standing by in the blood bank.
not_available Who was the attending on this case? 
not_available Me.
not_available Really? Well, you dropped the ball, didn't you? Excuse me? 
not_available She's septic.
not_available It's obvious.
not_available You should have anticipated this.
not_available She's young, she's healthy.
not_available She had no reason She doesn't need a reason.
not_available A reason.
not_available Breathe, please.
not_available Katey, do you see any signs of impending shock here? Tachycardia out of proportion with the fever, widening pulse pressure.
not_available See that? Even a medical student could see it coming from a mile away.
not_available Must be some new
not_available attending thing.
not_available We'll take care of your wife, sir.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I can manage my own patients, thank you.
not_available Really? Then why did one of your nurses activate my team? Excuse me.
not_available I knew you were getting slammed.
not_available She needed attention.
not_available The Rapid Response team doesn't even cover the ER! Well, if you can't handle slam dunk cases like this, maybe we should.
not_available Give me one percent lido.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Explain this again.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available My wife is healthy.
not_available All right, calm down, sir.
not_available Look, the bacteria could have seeded the bloodstream through the lungs, 
not_available a cut in the skin, her intestines.
not_available Second liter's in.
not_available Goal
not_available directed resuscitation for septic shock is so easy, yet so difficult for you ED types.
not_available She's in shock? 
not_available Systolic's only 82.
not_available That would be a yes.
not_available The key is to preserve effective tissue perfusion while avoiding excessive myocardial oxygen consumption.
not_available Translation
not_available get oxygen to the body without stressing the heart.
not_available We need CVP monitoring and continuous central venous sats to keep track of that.
not_available See that? He's learning already.
not_available That requires ICU
not_available level monitoring.
not_available We're too busy down here.
not_available We can't do that.
not_available Really? You can't? You can, and you will.
not_available Watch.
not_available We don't have the nursing capacity.
not_available Patients come in, we stabilize them, then we send them up.
not_available That's how it works.
not_available Yeah? You forget about that eight hours that they sit around in triage.
not_available And wait another five to get a bed.
not_available Look, it's not great, but it's the reality.
not_available Reality is nothing more than a persistent illusion.
not_available Einstein said that.
not_available I'm a physicist.
not_available Memorized everything that guy ever wrote.
not_available See that? Even more reason not to sit around and let your 
not_available organs rot away like rancid meat.
not_available Nobody's organs are rotting.
not_available Free air under the diaphragm.
not_available Probably a perfed diverticulum.
not_available What's that mean? 
not_available Um, what that means is, an infection in your intestines has eroded through the wall.
not_available We need to get in there, clean up and repair the hole.
not_available Lucien, don't you tired of ER docs waiting around for the surgeons to come down and save the day? Give 'em a break, Kevin.
not_available You know what it's like down here.
not_available I'm going to call the OR, tell them we're bringing her up.
not_available It's true
not_available I know that we're just monkeys on a minor planet on an average star, but let's not pretend that sepsis is beyond our reach.
not_available If you're trying to quote Hawking, you mangled it.
not_available I think I'm in love.
not_available Alison! What are you doing here, Blake? Hey, look, she called me, all right? Hey, whoa, guys, hey! You don't get to do this! 
not_available Hey, hey, come on.
not_available She wants me here, okay? Take it easy, all right? Stay away from my wife! Where are you taking her? 
not_available CT scan.
not_available Can I go, too? 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Why don't you stay here? Dr.
not_available Gates will be with her the whole time.
not_available Is everything okay? No, my girlfriend's in a coma.
not_available It's all my fault, so, no, everything is not okay.
not_available All your fault? How is that? I left my roller blades at the top of the stairs.
not_available It's polished concrete.
not_available It's very slippery.
not_available We were fighting, and she tripped.
not_available Well, did you explain to the cops what happened? 
not_available I'm sure they'll sort it out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, it's been a bad year.
not_available How so? Moved to Chicago five months ago for my job.
not_available Ever since, we've been fighting constantly.
not_available These huge, dish
not_available breaking fights.
not_available And we never used to do that.
not_available You know? It's like the city's changed her.
not_available Well, transitions are hard.
not_available Been together ever since college.
not_available Been through a lot.
not_available You know, us coming out to her family, and her brother dying.
not_available You think you can make it through that kind of stuff, you think you can make it through anything.
not_available Who knew, after 15 years, and everything would turn so much? It's scary.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Quantum information processing, teleportation.
not_available You know, we've been chasing the same questions since grad school.
not_available I'm sorry if he feels threatened by it, but there are certain conversations she can only have with me.
not_available Vice versa.
not_available But it's only work, right? Yeah, we're both married.
not_available Happily married.
not_available Can't say that the idea has never crossed my mind, but Alison and I just really click.
not_available I don't know anybody else, male or female, who challenges me like she does.
not_available They have this thing.
not_available They're together in the lab all day, and then she gets home, and everything's, "Blake said this, Blake did that." Something about it has always felt weird.
not_available He's her work husband.
not_available Yeah, people spend more time at work than they do at home.
not_available Share experiences, develop a verbal shorthand.
not_available Of course, some intimacy develops.
not_available The two men in my life
not_available they don't get each other.
not_available Really? Never would have noticed that.
not_available The OR's ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available Two planets revolving around the same sun.
not_available Collision is inevitable, right? They try to stay out of each other's orbits to keep the solar system in order, but it's a useless exercise.
not_available Disorder rules.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available The universe always reverts to equilibrium.
not_available I'll see you upstairs, okay? 
not_available Wait! Honey, I'm sorry.
not_available I went a little crazy.
not_available James.
not_available James.
not_available I want you to do something for me.
not_available So, am I going to have a scar? 
not_available No.
not_available The edges came together nicely.
not_available It'll be small.
not_available Hey.
not_available I have to head back up to the ICU, but I wanted to suggest that you write this case up for M and M next week.
not_available What's M and M? Uh, it's a conference where we present our mistakes and learn from them.
not_available You made a mistake with Alison? 
not_available No.
not_available Will you please excuse us for a minute? Whatwhat are you trying to do? 
not_available Trying to wake you up.
not_available Why are you talking like that in front of a patient? How does that help anyone? Where'd you go to medical school? 
not_available Here.
not_available And your residency? 
not_available Here.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Your internship? Why are you asking? You know it was here.
not_available Because I think that you have been lulled into complacency by too many years in this place.
not_available You know what? You got a problem with the ER, you talk to Kovac.
not_available Well, no, it's too late for Kovac.
not_available He's the old guard.
not_available I think you could really turn things around here.
not_available You know what? Now, you're really starting to bore me.
not_available How about this? How about you go up and harass your own department, and stay out of mine? It's always nice to talk to you, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Will someone please make this jerk disappear? Who? 
not_available The guy is toxic.
not_available What guy? Oh, hey, excuse me.
not_available Excuse me? Can you hold up? Did you finish interviewing Megan Strand? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're just waiting to see if we can get a statement from Sophia when she wakes up.
not_available Oh, that might be a while.
not_available She's intubated, but, listen, I was talking to Megan, and her affect seems totally appropriate.
not_available The injury matches her story, and I'm just I don't know.
not_available I'm not getting that abuse vibe.
not_available Thanks, Doc.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Make sure you write that in the record.
not_available It'll be helpful if this goes to court.
not_available Right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How much ? No
not_available no promotional rate? What about frequent flyer programs? Triple A? Fine.
not_available Uh, three more nights at the honeymoon suite.
not_available Charge the card.
not_available Don't get snarky.
not_available I'm too fragile.
not_available Oh, I thought things were going well with you and Hope.
not_available Yeah, they are.
not_available Really well.
not_available Staircase girl has a head bleed.
not_available Frontal parenchymal bleed? Yeah, less common than a sub or epidural, but consistent with a fall.
not_available Okay, I'll call Neurosurge.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Neela, hey.
not_available Have you heard anything from Ray yet? 
not_available Why, no.
not_available I thought he'd be here.
not_available Yeah, well, I mean, that the ER closed, maybe schedules got confusing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll try paging him again.
not_available Hey, Mayday, I hear you're taking the gastroschisis kid up.
not_available Yeah, I'm just about to write the admission orders.
not_available Operating on adhesions create new adhesions? Possibly, but we don't have a choice if he's acutely obstructed.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll keep him NPO.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Morris, you got a snake breeder with a fang in her leg.
not_available Nice seeing you, Tony.
not_available Thanks for the consult.
not_available Hey, what? What did I do? This is easy for you, isn't it? 
not_available What? "Hey, Mayday, did you see my gastroschisis kid?" Like nothing happened.
not_available Come on, Neela, you're not being fair.
not_available I mean, how can you be so casual? Hey, you're the one that broke up with me, remember? 
not_available Everything just rolls right off of you.
not_available All right, you know what? Why don't you tell me how upset you want me to be? On a scale of one to ten, what, a seven? And then, when you're feeling needy, we'll crank it up to an eight, put it down to a five when you want to get your work done.
not_available Now you're just being an ass.
not_available You think this doesn't upset me? It does.
not_available This is painful for me, but you want what you want.
not_available You know, so I just We're trying to figure how to work without the drama.
not_available But now I realize something
not_available you, you like this.
not_available You want the drama.
not_available That's not true.
not_available It is true.
not_available I don't want the drama.
not_available No matter how I act, 
not_available you're gonna be upset.
not_available You're the one at the wedding being Because that's the only way you can maintain this stupid, narcissistic game.
not_available Wow.
not_available I hope that never happens to us.
not_available They managed to repair her damaged intestine, but her blood pressure dropped very low.
not_available It'll be a while before we know anything.
not_available Six hours ago she was giving a talk in front of hundreds of people.
not_available How did she end up here? Well, sometimes things just happen.
not_available There's really no way to make sense of it.
not_available She's not in pain? I'll make sure she has a morphine order.
not_available How's she doing? Still needs dopa to keep her systolic above 85.
not_available And I think she's third spacing.
not_available She had a touch of DIC, lost two liters in the OR.
not_available Hey, um, why didn't you scrub in? Well, I wasn't sure that you'd want me to.
not_available Why wouldn't I? 
not_available Men are impossible.
not_available Listen, Neela, about Do you think I'm a narcissist? Well, to a certain extent, all surgeons are.
not_available Yeah, it's good for the job.
not_available Hey, guys, uh, Mae Lee's off to the airport.
not_available I just wanted to thank you guys for an amazing experience.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Mae Lee.
not_available Yeah, strong work this month, Mae Lee.
not_available It's the ER.
not_available One final consult before you go? Call me if you're ever in San Francisco.
not_available Little freak tried to kiss me at the wedding.
not_available What's she still doing here? Get her to the ICU.
not_available Oh, runs of v
not_available tach, she's not ready to move.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available It's a hundred feet of corridor, and it'd be better for her to code in the ICU instead of here.
not_available Well, for her or for us? 
not_available I'm serious, Neela.
not_available You know, we got five full ORs, we need to make room.
not_available Let's go.
not_available She loves tulips.
not_available uh yellow.
not_available No, no, no, no, no, uh, white.
not_available White.
not_available Two, two dozen white tulips Hey, newlyweds, to be delivered to room 1258 at the Ritz.
not_available How, how's it feel, guys? You know Morris is staying in our honeymoon suite? What? 
not_available Yup.
not_available With Hope.
not_available They won't leave.
not_available Did you wake up the next day feeling different? 
not_available Uh, not really.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just a little.
not_available Well not that much.
not_available Well, your wedding was awesome.
not_available I just hope that thing I did didn't make you lose your security deposit.
not_available What thing? 
not_available What? Hey, everyone, in the ER, for the first time, Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Luka Kovac! Oh, sorry, Abby, Dr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Luka Kovac.
not_available Doctor and doctor.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hey, Chief, aren't you supposed to be in Bora Bora by now? Uh, Hawaii.
not_available And I just attended my last department head meeting 
not_available so I'm officially no longer your chief.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available It's like your wedding happened and now everything's changed.
not_available You're married, uh, I'm with Hope, uh, you're not the chief anymore, there's new ramps in the bathroom
not_available It's a brave new world.
not_available Gates is still a pain in the ass, though.
not_available At least there's something you can count on.
not_available You done, Morris? You had enough? Tony, there's a lawyer out there who says he needs to talk to you.
not_available Thanks, Dawn.
not_available Hide, Gates.
not_available I'll tell him you went home sick.
not_available I'm going.
not_available See you at home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh being married does feel a little different.
not_available Yeah, it does.
not_available Aww look at that.
not_available Lucien.
not_available Hey, Luka.
not_available Abby, I saw the Cheetos bezoar.
not_available Send him home on Miralax, have him follow up with GI.
not_available Okay, done.
not_available Nice wedding, by the way.
not_available I offered to replace the bidet.
not_available What bidet? Abby! Your head injury in Trauma Two lost her pulse.
not_available Clear! Still v
not_available fib.
not_available Going again.
not_available And clear! I was on the phone, they paged me.
not_available What's going on? Sophia's heart went into a dangerous rhythm.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Epi's in.
not_available All right, back up, back up! Clear! 
not_available Resuming CPR.
not_available Oh, no, no, baby, don't do this.
not_available Lidocaine's ready.
not_available Okay, is neurosurge involved? No, there's nothing to evacuate, the bleed's parenchymal.
not_available You can't leave me now, you hear me? 
not_available Go ahead, give the lido.
not_available Things that we said and the way we were, it's not us, right? 
not_available You're my rock, always calm.
not_available Another epi, charge 360.
not_available Megan, when you said Chicago changed her, what did you mean? That she's so testy, and, and paranoid.
not_available Please don't die.
not_available Okay, clear.
not_available Please clear.
not_available Watch out.
not_available We have a pulse.
not_available She's back.
not_available What do you think of this film? Uh Frontal lobe bleed, no shift.
not_available You think it could be a preexisting AVM exacerbated by the head trauma? I mean, a frontal lobe mass would explain the personality and the behavioral changes
not_available You're a romantic, Abby.
not_available What? You don't want to believe that after years of partnership, they started hating each other.
not_available Call Radiology.
not_available If you're right, she needs angio.
not_available The girl's lived with you for ten years.
not_available You're the closest thing she's had to a father.
not_available So, that's gotta count for something, right? It does.
not_available Given the situation, I'd say you have equal standing to seek custody.
not_available Equal? The same as her grandparents? Even though I'm not a blood relative? Yep.
not_available Especially if Sarah wants to stay with you.
not_available Wow.
not_available Well, I just thought because I wasn't related This is good.
not_available All right, okay, good, good.
not_available What, what else? What's next? Well, first thing is to talk to Sarah.
not_available Make sure she wants to stay.
not_available She does.
not_available I know she does.
not_available I've got two adolescents at home.
not_available Talk to her.
not_available All right, then what? Then call the grandparents and let them know.
not_available So, that's it? 
not_available That's it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Injecting the cyanoacrylate.
not_available Amazing pickup, Abby.
not_available What made you think of AVM? Well, her girlfriend kept going on about how she'd become like a totally different person lately.
not_available Lots of couples go through that, they don't all have arterio
not_available venous malformations in their brain.
not_available Well, it was just a hunch, I guess.
not_available Congrats on the wedding.
not_available You think it's going to be strange to be a husband and wife working together? No, it's definitely strange to have people refer to us that way.
not_available Get used to it.
not_available Contrast.
not_available Are you married? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Only people I ever meet are doctors.
not_available And doctors make crummy husbands.
not_available No offense.
not_available You know, I used to think it'd be cool to end up with a composer or an artist, someone that would bring something totally different to the dinner table, but you know, it's really nice to go home to somebody who understands all this.
not_available I can see that.
not_available Look.
not_available No more antegrade opacification of contrast.
not_available So the embolization worked? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Great.
not_available Very nice.
not_available What are you doing here? Oh, I just came to check on the patient.
not_available Uh wait a minute, I thought that Morris was the attending, so you Okay, uh, thanks, Betina.
not_available I'm going to give Megan the good news.
not_available I was on a little break, so I thought I'd bring you some coffee.
not_available Oh, don't drink coffee.
not_available Well, that's, uh good to know.
not_available Now, listen, Betina I just want to hangout with you for a while.
not_available No plans, no games, just me.
not_available And the patient here on the table.
not_available You can stay but don't touch anything.
not_available Hospital day 12 for this Vitals stable overnight, pressures in the 90 to Who was the first person to measure blood pressure, anybody? It was a clergyman in the year 17 blah, blah, blah.
not_available And he took a glass tube and he stuck it into the carotid artery of a horse and he was very surprised to see the blood rise up into the air about nine feet.
not_available Why he did this exactly, I have no idea.
not_available I mean it's very, you know, impractical for human beings.
not_available And I'm sure the horse didn't appreciate it.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available Go ahead, go ahead.
not_available F
not_available Finish, Katey, go.
not_available Uh next we have a 64year
not_available old presenting Hi, we need a room! This is Alison MacKenzie, our septic with the bowel perf.
not_available Lost a lot of blood, having some ectopy, and didn't tolerate the trip down the hall too well.
not_available Tachy, on two pressors.
not_available CVP is only six.
not_available Run of v
not_available tach.
not_available Can I ask you a question? Why didn't you stabilize this patient in postop instead of bringing us this shocky, fragile mess? Well, she got four units of blood and Look, I'm not an idiot, I know about the post
not_available op audit that Dubenko's doing.
not_available He doesn't want this patient in his PACU because it'll mess up his data.
not_available No, that's not what's happening here.
not_available He'd rather have her code and die 
not_available in the ICU than on his watch.
not_available Die? Yeah, well, we'll try to avoid that.
not_available You tell Lucien this can't happen again.
not_available You know, this wasn't his idea.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available You know, I 
not_available I thought she was ready to move.
not_available V
not_available tach! No pulse.
not_available Starting compression.
not_available Oh, no, this can't be happening.
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available Nice job, Neela.
not_available Let's just stay focused on the patient, shall we? Clear.
not_available Katey, someone on the phone says they've got to talk to you right now, 
not_available it's an emergency.
not_available I'm in the middle of a code.
not_available No, go, just go, just go.
not_available And there's a guy outside begging to come in to see this patient.
not_available He's not family.
not_available He can't be here.
not_available You might want to rethink that.
not_available What? Look, your wife is doing everything she can not to die right now.
not_available She could probably use all the support she could get.
not_available Epi's in.
not_available Okay, going again.
not_available Clear.
not_available Well, her heart is beating at a normal rhythm, but her blood pressure is still dangerously low.
not_available Isn't there something you can do about that? We've maxed out the medications.
not_available They're not helping.
not_available It's possible that the part of her brain that controls the blood pressure isn't functioning properly.
not_available What? 
not_available Why not? Because she received 45 minutes of CPR.
not_available Her brain was deprived of oxygen during that time.
not_available And when that happens, we often see some degree of neurologic injury.
not_available She walked in here today with a stomach ache and now you're telling me her brain is damaged.
not_available Look, I don't want to take away all hope, but I want to be realistic here.
not_available If she survives there most likely will be neurologic deficits.
not_available When will we know? 
not_available Well, there's no way to predict.
not_available It's a waiting game now, I'm afraid.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I see.
not_available You can go.
not_available Please go.
not_available Before she went into surgery, she asked me to give this to you.
not_available James.
not_available I resented it for so long this thing you two have.
not_available Even now I've got to share her with you.
not_available What did he give him? I don't know.
not_available Data.
not_available Some kind of treasured lab secret.
not_available Well, how do you know? Well, you work in the ICU long enough, you start to recognize these scenes are frighteningly familiar.
not_available They kiss their spouse, their kids, they say good
not_available bye to friends A certain percentage have a deep, dark secret, like an illegitimate child or a secret debt or something, but occasionally you see something like this.
not_available Practicalities.
not_available Information that must be passed on.
not_available A computer password or a combo to a safe or something.
not_available You're pretty jaded.
not_available Many long, tortuous cases.
not_available You know, the human psyche was not designed to deal with this.
not_available Cave dwellers had to deal with a lot more actual death, but they were not subjected to the slow, mechanized torture that is the ICU.
not_available Well, why do you do it then? To save the salvageable and to give the rest a dignified death.
not_available Just a little low on dignity these days.
not_available Well, I'd have a hard time working here.
not_available Surgeons just like to get in, do their job, and get out.
not_available Yeah, well, that's your job, but we are left to deal with the dregs and it's not pretty.
not_available I just want us all to do better.
not_available I'm sick of seeing people die.
not_available She had what's known as an arterial venous malformation in the part of her brain that's responsible for mood and personality.
not_available That explains why she seemed different to you.
not_available And it's fixed now? Yes, the radiologist was able to clot off the veins using a special kind of glue.
not_available And she'll go back to the way she was? 
not_available Uh, that's the hope, yeah.
not_available Did you hear that, baby? It's all going to be okay.
not_available All right, she's waking up, so we're going to take out her breathing tube now.
not_available Nifs are good and she's following commands perfectly.
not_available Okay, I'll need you to cough on the count of three.
not_available Okay? Ready? One, two, three.
not_available Megan I'm sorry.
not_available I am so, so sorry.
not_available I was upset.
not_available I just I didn't mean to push you.
not_available Chocolate
not_available covered strawberries, room 1258.
not_available No.
not_available No, nn
not_available no, I haven't checked out.
not_available No, there must be some mistake.
not_available There's not a mistake.
not_available I checked out of the hotel.
not_available What? No.
not_available WWhy? I
not_available I paid for three more nights.
not_available I know you did, which is crazy.
not_available I got them to refund your card.
not_available I don't, I don't want a refund.
not_available Let's call them.
not_available Archie, stop.
not_available No, look the flowers, the spa treatments
not_available it's all lovely, but I don't need it.
not_available Time to get back to real life.
not_available I don't want real life.
not_available II
not_available I like fake life where we, where we wake up together and take bubble baths and eat bonbons for breakfast.
not_available I don't want our crazy wedding fling to end.
not_available Who said anything about it ending? I wasn't sure if Dr.
not_available Morris, I have not done this with anyone in a long, long time, and it's not because I haven't had the opportunity.
not_available I decided to sleep with you because it means something.
not_available This isn't a fling.
not_available At least not for me.
not_available She snapped; she had a momentary lapse.
not_available It's not like she's a chronic abuser.
not_available We don't know that, and even if we did, it doesn't matter.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Did Ray ever show up? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Well, did he call? It's not like Megan was trying to throw her down the stairs.
not_available Oh, please, give me a break.
not_available She pushed her.
not_available If this didn't happen, Sophia's AVM wouldn't have been diagnosed.
not_available Excuse me, is Dr.
not_available Pratt still in? Nurses' station.
not_available All I'm saying is one incident doesn't make it abuse.
not_available She responded to anger with violence.
not_available That's, like, the definition.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available I thought I was done with you already.
not_available Millicent Lawford.
not_available MI in the ER waiting room, sat there seven hours without being triaged.
not_available Gertie Minton.
not_available Renal failure, 12 hours to be seen, and then arrested from hyperkalemia.
not_available Derek Shank, in the ER three days without DVT prophylaxis, dieddied
not_available of a PE before he made it to the floor.
not_available We can do better for these people.
not_available Okay, look, look, I get your point, okay? But the problems are systemic.
not_available Too many people, not enough resources.
not_available Now, how do you suppose that we address that? Well, first, I think we start by not believing that this is the best we can do.
not_available Because it's not.
not_available Right.
not_available These are for you.
not_available So I could totally tell that Melissa was copying off my paper, but if I tell on her, then I'm a snitch, and if I don't, then I'm like an accomplice, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available And I know, I know, she's just cheating herself, but it still seems like she wouldn't do that.
not_available Yeah, and, uh, we learned in chemistry today how to freebase cocaine.
not_available Really? Tony, you're totally not listening to me.
not_available Sarah, when your grandparents wanted you to move in with them, I thought that, maybe, it was the best thing.
not_available I don't want to go to a new school, Tony.
not_available I don't want to go and live with them.
not_available I was scared and I I just didn't think I had what it takes to do this, but then when we took the test, I realized that I wish it had gone the other way.
not_available I wanted to be your dad.
not_available I wanted that, too.
not_available So I work a lot and I'm messy and I may embarrass you at father
not_available daughter dances but I really love you, Sarah.
not_available You're my family.
not_available And it turns out that if you want to stay with me, you can, if you
not_available I mean, if you still want to.
not_available I missed you guys.
not_available Missed you, too.
not_available How was your shift? Oh who cares? It's done.
not_available No work for two weeks, the honeymoon starts now.
not_available Does that mean you're ready to change into the bikini? 
not_available Maybe after Joe goes to bed.
not_available Joe, go to bed now.
not_available I got him.
not_available Sweetie You playing soccer? Hello.
not_available Hey, Donald, it's Kevin.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, I'm glad I caught you.
not_available Do you remember the thing that we discussed earlier about the ER? Yeah, well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, um, I think I've changed my mind.
not_available I have changed my mind.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Have a good one.
not_available Oh, good night.
not_available Oh, good night, good night.
not_available Stay out of the ICU.
not_available That guy's a dick.
