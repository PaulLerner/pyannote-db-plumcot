Previously on ER 
not_available Well, that must be tough.
not_available What? 
not_available Competing with your boyfriend.
not_available Not boyfriend, just competing.
not_available Any indecision you're feeling about your future, I can help.
not_available Say the word and I will take the cardiothoracic off the table.
not_available Feel free to apply for the trauma fellowship.
not_available You're a little closed
not_available off for my taste.
not_available Emotionally withdrawn.
not_available Roxanne called twice.
not_available So? So? So what? You plan on going through with the pregnancy? 
not_available I was hoping to.
not_available What does Doug think? Do we even pretend to be living in a democracy anymore? It's just a power play between career Republicans and Democrats and who hates who more.
not_available If there were still guillotines and burning at the stake they'd be doing that to each other.
not_available Hey, this is where I do two reps of 10.
not_available You want to go first? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I didn't know anybody stopped at these.
not_available End of your first trimester you get energy.
not_available I have to keep my heart rate under 140.
not_available So did you read it? What did you think? It's a good letter.
not_available You're very clear about what you want and don't want from him.
not_available I had to write it all out.
not_available But you're gonna talk to him? 
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Sure.
not_available I just After he reads it I know Doug's gonna go on his gut reaction.
not_available I don't want him running back here.
not_available You don't? When are you gonna send it? I'm gonna fax it.
not_available I got his fax number a couple days ago.
not_available What do you think he'll do? Honestly? He'll be on the first plane.
not_available Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I'm late.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Thanks for meeting me.
not_available I didn't mean to sound so mysterious.
not_available I didn't know what you drink.
not_available I gave up caffeine for Lent.
not_available Let me get right to the point.
not_available We're both busy people.
not_available It's about John.
not_available Carter? I've tried to bring this up with him and got nowhere fast.
not_available Let me try you.
not_available If you two are involved, flirtation or twicea
not_available day sex in the lab someone needs to let me know and I'll get out of the way.
not_available There's nothing going on between me and Carter.
not_available Okay, maybe at one point I thought there might be.
not_available But no.
not_available We haven't really spoken in the last few months.
not_available So much for that theory.
not_available Honestly, he works so hard I doubt he has time to cheat on you.
not_available You mean our relationship has stalled out on its own? 
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available It has.
not_available I mean, it has.
not_available We have been at the lotof
not_available laughs phase for too long.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available You were my last resort for an obstacle I could tackle.
not_available I wish I had better news for you.
not_available You know, I don't envy you.
not_available He's one mixed
not_available up guy.
not_available He is.
not_available Sweet, but mixed
not_available up.
not_available A deadly combination.
not_available I think about your breasts all day.
not_available I think about you.
not_available I'll come to work with you.
not_available Do.
not_available I want you to.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Here we go again.
not_available I lost power twice last night.
not_available We didn't.
not_available It's the weather.
not_available The humidity.
not_available It's arcing at the substation.
not_available I can't be late.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you.
not_available It's spring.
not_available No, really.
not_available I admire you.
not_available I like emergency medicine.
not_available It takes guts.
not_available What takes guts? To tackle something that got the best of her the first time around.
not_available Good, because you're gonna get a second chance to supervise her.
not_available What am I supposed to do with this? I called UPS.
not_available If they're not here by this afternoon, let me know.
not_available The Oriental? It's gotta be in Bangkok by Sunday.
not_available Good boy, Carter.
not_available Mother's Day.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available This week? You forgot your mothers? I better call the bowling alley.
not_available That's what she likes.
not_available What are your kids doing? Every year, runny eggs and burnt toast in bed two hours before I want to wake up.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available I never let Mother know what's in store.
not_available Last year it was a helicopter ride and a concert.
not_available And this year I'm taking her to the places she liked to take me as a kid.
not_available The zoo, the Adler, a little tearoom back in our old neighborhood.
not_available Didn't think I had a mother, did you? Just trying to picture her.
not_available So, what do we got here today? 
not_available We? Didn't IKerry tell you? I'm spending the day down here.
not_available IKerry just asked for the day off.
not_available As Acting Chief, I wanted a better understanding of what goes on here.
not_available You want oozing pustules or projectile vomiting? I don't want to see patients, I just want to watch and marvel.
not_available So, together again.
not_available Bet you were about to call.
not_available We got a late start.
not_available Hey, Reece.
not_available Is Carla's van in the shop again? 
not_available No.
not_available She just had a big day today.
not_available Next time she gets stuck, tell her to call.
not_available We weren't stuck.
not_available I love being with Reece.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get him in here.
not_available I'll pick him up at 3, right? I'll bring him home after speech therapy.
not_available I thought you were going the signing route.
not_available I'm just doing what's best for my son.
not_available Be good, son.
not_available hypotensive, febrile, purulent sputum.
not_available See? The doctors came right in.
not_available Septic.
not_available We had to tube him.
not_available Brought his pressure up with dopamine and gave him some cefotaxime.
not_available Why don't you get him to ICU? We're waiting for beds upstairs.
not_available Can you tell us what you have? Temp's a little elevated at 99.9.
not_available Well, she fell out of her wheelchair down the back stoop.
not_available I was ringing the doorbell up front.
not_available And I heard the bang and my heart sank.
not_available I'm the Armstrong's neighbor.
not_available I insisted on driving them in.
not_available BP's 160/90.
not_available Mr.
not_available Armstrong reports symptoms of disorientation.
not_available Alzheimer's.
not_available They don't want to call it that.
not_available He frets about his health plan.
not_available Gladys doesn't have her hearing aid.
not_available I do the best I can looking in on them.
not_available She's such a dear.
not_available Army's not much of a cook.
not_available Okay, I get the picture! Have Carter and Lucy take a look.
not_available Are they done? Is she okay? And that is why I prefer my patients anesthetized.
not_available Is she putting on weight, Nurse what'shername? Carol Hathaway? 
not_available Is she porking out? I've had some fantasies about that one.
not_available Okay, in Exam Four we have a recurrent DVT on a heparin drip.
not_available You ever dream about Lizzie? What? 
not_available It'd be understandable.
not_available It's one motive I could follow for the ER trying to poach her away.
not_available The trauma fellowship is not about poaching, Robert.
not_available How long's it been, Mark since you had a trauma come in? What? Today? Five, six hours.
not_available Usually If you actually had a trauma fellow, for the last five or six hours that highly skilled Surgical Resident would've been sitting on her hands.
not_available Or maybe babysitting gorks waiting for ICU beds.
not_available We got a partial scalping on the way.
not_available Fell down an escalator at O'Hare.
not_available Not a moment too soon.
not_available Well, timing is everything.
not_available "Pher
not_available Catch." That's what I need.
not_available That one has no perfume enhancement, just pure synthetic pheromones for those who want to maximize biologic signals.
not_available I should try this on Al.
not_available If you're in a committed relationship, "Full
not_available Pher" is for you.
not_available It has a sandalwood fragrance but with a dopamine
not_available like boost.
not_available And I'm not one for perfumes.
not_available This isn't perfume! It's biochemical
not_available awareness therapy.
not_available They say pheromones are responsible for who you're attracted to.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Medical professionals always understand.
not_available Looking for me? This is Phyllis Farr.
not_available And she experienced some shortness of breath this morning.
not_available She has a history of A
not_available fib and had an embolic CVA two years ago.
not_available And she is now on Coumadin and Dig.
not_available One teeny, tiny little stroke.
not_available And I was smoking like a chimney then.
not_available Some men are inherently less receptive.
not_available I think it was just anxiety.
not_available I have a meeting with Marshall Fields.
not_available Miss Farr thinks she doesn't need to stay.
not_available I'd like her admitted.
not_available Her dyspnea was relieved by nitro.
not_available It could be angina.
not_available Darling, I am entirely too young for that.
not_available I don't think we need to admit you yet.
not_available But we should get you on an EIKG and monitor you here in the ER.
not_available Also check a troponin with a CPIK.
not_available You're saying to cancel Marshall Fields? They want you more when they know you're busy.
not_available Did you send it? I am.
not_available Today.
not_available I'm ravenous.
not_available You really do get cravings.
not_available Can you get to the cafeteria? Do they have a surf 'n turf? That's what I feel 
like A big, buttery lobster and a thick, raw steak.
not_available Morton's after the shift.
not_available My treat.
not_available No, I want it now.
not_available You have a patient for me? Sweet lady.
not_available Watch out for the husband.
not_available Where's the ruleout thoracic aneurysm? Maggie's patient? 
not_available Peter told me to take it.
not_available I think she died.
not_available Check in Sutures.
not_available Thoracic aneurysm? Is that the patient? No.
not_available She's back from X
not_available ray.
not_available Where do they want her? Sorry.
not_available Check at the desk.
not_available Peter's already been paged on this, but you'll want to see.
not_available It takes more than a scalp avulsion to get my heart pumping.
not_available I had stuff in my hands.
not_available Somebody shoved me from behind.
not_available I hate escalators.
not_available How about here? Yeah.
not_available That hurts.
not_available Elizabeth, nice to see you.
not_available Scalp injury? Ms.
not_available Price tried to get to baggage claim headfirst.
not_available Am I bleeding a lot? 
not_available The scalp likes to gush.
not_available Would you like to help me tie it off? 
not_available Oh, I'd be delighted.
not_available Curved IKelly, 3
not_available 0 Vicryl.
not_available I need some suction.
not_available They had our plane circling for two hours because of the wind.
not_available It's about to storm.
not_available There it is.
not_available Think you can put a clamp on it? With your help.
not_available Holding steady There you go.
not_available That's it.
not_available Got it.
not_available Now, show me your tip.
not_available You two want me to leave? Actually, it's surgeon talk.
not_available He elevates his clamp so that I can slide my suture That sounds worse, doesn't it? Well, you know what they say Power's out.
not_available Okay, folks.
not_available In a few seconds, the auxiliary generator will switch on.
not_available Who's charge nurse for internal? 
not_available Power failure.
not_available Make sure all vents are plugged into the red outlets Okay, like I said, false alarm.
not_available Power's been restored.
not_available I never heard no generator kick in! It takes a few seconds.
not_available Your family would've been taken care of.
not_available You hope.
not_available My uncle's connected.
not_available The machines are on a battery backup.
not_available I wasn't talking about machines! A little excitement? Did Roxanne find you? She wants lunch.
not_available It's a little busy.
not_available She was in Chairs.
not_available Can you help me reboot Miss Farr's EIKG monitor? I think it shut off when we lost power.
not_available Yeah, I'll try.
not_available It's the perfect time.
not_available But we haven't gone public yet.
not_available All the more reason to act now.
not_available Some companies won't consider clients with high
not_available risk profiles.
not_available Especially those with pre
not_available existing conditions.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I seem to be powerless.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I'll take care of that in a minute.
not_available I had a free hour and I thought You hawking my patient? She might have suffered an MI.
not_available Lydia said her EIKG was good.
not_available Are you selling her insurance? It was a countermove.
not_available She was selling me 100 shares of a pheromone It is unethical to prey on people while they're vulnerable.
not_available "Prey" on people? I sold insurance before I met you.
not_available I sold you some before we went out.
not_available Why are you picking a fight? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available Why would I want to fight? I don't know.
not_available But maybe you want to break up.
not_available It'd be easier over some failure of mine.
not_available Wrong.
not_available If you want to break up, say so.
not_available Okay.
not_available I want to break up.
not_available I think it's sleazy to push insurance on people when they're patients.
not_available Who left this patient in the hall?! I saw an X
not_available ray tech.
not_available Did he just leave her? There's no chart.
not_available Oh, God! What the hell happened? She's not breathing! Let's get her to Trauma! We need a hand here! 
not_available What's going on? Female patient, no I.D.
not_available Respiratory arrest.
not_available I think she's been beaten.
not_available Put her on a monitor.
not_available We need help! What is going on? 
not_available A woman found in the hall.
not_available It looks like she's been beaten.
not_available And sexually assaulted.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Bag her.
not_available I need postintubation film.
not_available Is Peter still next door? 
not_available He took Price to Radiology.
not_available BP's 110/80.
not_available Pulse ox is 97.
not_available Order a head and belly CT.
not_available Fractured ribs.
not_available Where'd you find her? She was outside Exam Four on a gurney.
not_available I saw a tech bring her down from X
not_available ray.
not_available An X
not_available ray tech or someone from Transpo? I don't know.
not_available I'd never seen him before.
not_available From Medicine? 
not_available Sulla Andrews.
not_available When was she found? 
not_available Couple hours ago.
not_available When did you last see her? make any sense that she disappeared.
not_available She was a patient? 
not_available Medical ward.
not_available No wonder the cops are everywhere.
not_available I hope Dr.
not_available Corday got a good look.
not_available Pretty scary.
not_available I'm looking over my shoulder.
not_available Police say we should alert all staff to the possibility of a tech or someone who looks like one who may be dangerous.
not_available Let's not panic.
not_available You mean not tell the patients? 
not_available It doesn't seem necessary now.
not_available The guy probably bolted.
not_available Don't leave any patients unattended.
not_available Don't relinquish patients to anyone who doesn't have proper hospital I.D.
not_available What if you're not sure? There's a policeman stationed in every hallway.
not_available Call them.
not_available All right? Oh, that smarts.
not_available We're trying to be gentle.
not_available Did you change these dressings? I thought you might want to x
not_available ray her.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just suddenly got tired.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available I need the right hip.
not_available Did she break anything, doctor? That's what this x
not_available ray will tell us.
not_available I knew as soon as I heard that bang.
not_available I knew she'd fallen.
not_available Oh, this is a waste of time.
not_available I think it would be best if we come over here away from the x
not_available ray, okay? It won't matter.
not_available Gladys, get your car.
not_available Have you had anything to eat? You've been here for hours.
not_available Shooting.
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available Get the car! I'm not hungry.
not_available Army never eats.
not_available Look at him.
not_available Like a scarecrow.
not_available I'm taking her home.
not_available No one can help.
not_available How's everything going? Well, there certainly are plenty of doctors on hand.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available No one can help.
not_available You put her on IV antibiotics? She had a bleeding sacral decubitus with surrounding cellulitis.
not_available She has what? 
not_available Bed sores.
not_available And she's in pain after a fall.
not_available I'm guessing it's a fractured hip.
not_available Her leg is internally rotated.
not_available I'm Gladys, their neighbor.
not_available I brought her in.
not_available Good work, Gladys.
not_available Okay, everything looks under control.
not_available You need any help with her husband? I was thinking about calling Psych.
not_available He seems depressed.
not_available You might want to stay focused.
not_available But he's her primary caregiver.
not_available Her situation won't improve unless he's able to help.
not_available Do you really think he's gonna talk to Psych? Give it a try.
not_available Also Carol needs a break.
not_available Her name is Laurie Heller.
not_available Ward nurse said her bed was empty after rounds.
not_available She's talking to the detective now.
not_available Unfortunately, no one up in Medicine saw anyone resembling the man I saw.
not_available She hasn't regained consciousness? I don't think she will.
not_available She's been admitted since a traffic accident 10 days ago in a vegetative state.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Her family has just been persuaded to extubate her and transfer her to long
not_available term nursing care.
not_available They've been hoping for a miracle.
not_available It's barbaric.
not_available Here I am, the worst eyewitness in history.
not_available I could hardly tell them anything.
not_available I didn't pay attention to the guy.
not_available I'm sure you helped.
not_available Average height, I think.
not_available White, but with a dark complexion.
not_available Maybe Latino, maybe Middle Eastern.
not_available But he didn't have an accent, as far as I remember.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm afraid that what I do remember I'm making up because I don't want to be of no help.
not_available Maybe talking to him scared him off.
not_available CT confirmed a splenic laceration.
not_available Romano wants to do an ex
not_available lap.
not_available He's gonna operate? Not that an operation's gonna mean much to Miss Heller.
not_available Robert says she's a liability.
not_available What do you think? I think it's better than doing nothing.
not_available She already got pushed down an escalator.
not_available It wasn't intentional.
not_available You want her to sit here while I get my badge? You're supposed to wear your I.D.
not_available Since when does the P.D.
not_available Care? 
not_available I can vouch for him.
not_available You'd think I was a felon! Is this Mark Greene's scalp lac? CT gave the green light to stitch.
not_available Put her in Sutures.
not_available Wear your I.D.
not_available How come? 
not_available Because I said so.
not_available Carter, I heard a terrible rumor.
not_available Apparently a patient got assaulted.
not_available That is true.
not_available I was asking about Roxanne.
not_available Did you break up? Who told you that? 
not_available She did.
not_available Yeah, it's true.
not_available She won't be coming around anymore? Can't you think of the rest of us? You liked her? 
not_available What's not to like? Miss Farr's a little altered.
not_available Lucy wants to send her for a head CT.
not_available Doesn't Lucy have her own patient? What's this one called? Oh, shoot! What is that? It's right on the tip of my tongue.
not_available Did you get that hip x
not_available ray result back on Mrs.
not_available Armstrong? It's not done yet.
not_available Psych is on the way down.
not_available I'm a little worried.
not_available Miss Farr seems a bit confused.
not_available I'll check it out.
not_available I think she should have a head CT.
not_available I'll see you later, Miss Farr.
not_available Sex.
not_available What? That's the name of the scent.
not_available "PherSex." So your head hurts? 
not_available It may be stuffy in here.
not_available We should put your perfumes away.
not_available Some of them are a little strong.
not_available You have a very slender nose.
not_available Do I? 
not_available Makes common sense.
not_available The size of the VNO would correspond to the size of the nasal cavity.
not_available VNO? Vomeronasal organ.
not_available Picks up messages from other people's glands.
not_available Do you find yourself affected by the opposite sex? Oh, I'd say I notice them.
not_available What about your ability to bond? 
not_available Follow my finger.
not_available Are you experiencing weakness or numbness? People with deficient VNOs often have trouble appreciating oxytocin which is the hormone that evokes deep Intimacy.
not_available I think we should set Miss Farr up with a head CT.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, were you breastfed? 
not_available So I missed another trauma.
not_available A tragic case, actually.
not_available Is Romano doing the exlap? 
not_available You needn't join us if you're busy.
not_available Well, he'll need an assist.
not_available We both know I can handle that.
not_available You're an Intern.
not_available Stop seeing every move I make as a competition, okay? Right.
not_available It looks as though you're going for the trauma fellowship.
not_available I haven't made up my mind.
not_available How many surgical heavyweights does it take to screw in a light bulb? Depends on what's at stake, I guess.
not_available I heard you were zonked
not_available out in the lounge.
not_available I closed my eyes for two minutes.
not_available I was on a break.
not_available I'm entitled to 15 minutes every four hours.
not_available I know.
not_available I've just never seen you take one.
not_available Well, I'm gonna start.
not_available I need to fax this.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available Or you want me to? It's kind of personal.
not_available I'll do it myself, if that's okay.
not_available Do I look like IKerry Weaver? Looks like we're out again.
not_available I wish I hadn't made that incision.
not_available I can see enough to suction.
not_available I've got nothing.
not_available Everybody, hold on.
not_available The auxiliary power will kick in.
not_available Don't worry, Mrs.
not_available Farr.
not_available We keep flashlights by all the What did I spill? Damn it! Auxiliary power is online.
not_available Come on.
not_available Damn it! Damn it! I need you on task.
not_available Hit every room.
not_available Make sure all vents are in redundant plugs.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available What's going on? Do you have any batteries? Leave it to the cops to be prepared.
not_available Is this all the lighting we get? 
not_available Lighting is not priority.
not_available Jerry, could you get my letter out of that damn thing? We're gonna follow the plan.
not_available Critical equipment first, patient concerns second.
not_available I wish it weren't getting dark.
not_available What about the rapist? 
not_available Still missing.
not_available Everyone, please calm down.
not_available Everything is under control.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We do have a loss of power.
not_available Our backup generators will supply power to the ventilator and to the pump that delivers your meds.
not_available We need some light over here! I think Lucy's getting a flashlight.
not_available Oh, there we go! Oh, no, Gladys.
not_available The red plugs are for priority medical use.
not_available Why? We need to conserve our auxiliary power.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's looking for you.
not_available The ICU wants to send down six criticals.
not_available They have this new backup generator that never came on.
not_available Oh, boy! Here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Armstrong? This is Dr.
not_available Myers from Psych.
not_available He just wanted to talk to you in another room for a few minutes.
not_available Everyone can stay, but until power's restored we won't be starting any noncritical cases.
not_available It's 670, I'm telling you! 
not_available 670 is not transmitting.
not_available Jerry? Static is all I can hear.
not_available I'm not getting a line.
not_available Outside lines don't work.
not_available This is hard
not_available wired to the ICU, isn't it? We can't take six more criticals.
not_available I'm trying to offer the ICU four of our Life
not_available Paks instead.
not_available That'll only give us two! 
not_available What can I do? Can you get radio contact to the ICU? I can.
not_available B3 to 740.
not_available What's that noise? Sounds like a low battery.
not_available I'll check.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available Slow down.
not_available What's that smell? No retroperitoneal bleeding.
not_available The liver, duodenum and pancreas look okay.
not_available This makes you hopeful about Y2IK.
not_available It's out everywhere in the building.
not_available Did you call? 
not_available I couldn't get through.
not_available Go check on the little nipper, Peter.
not_available Reece has this thing about the dark.
not_available It is just the spleen.
not_available Do you have an extra flashlight? 
not_available We'll fix you up.
not_available I want a smoke! 
not_available We would love to let you out, okay? I've got the code here.
not_available Is that it? The key pad's not getting juice.
not_available Fine! I'll smoke in here! Jerry, walk that guy out the employee entrance.
not_available And call Engineering.
not_available You need an hour to get a ProTime? I can't wait that long.
not_available Did an animal die around here? Anyone see where Psych took Mr.
not_available Armstrong? She has a history of embolic CVAs and now she's altered.
not_available Miss Farr's worse? 
not_available Who? I knew she needed a CT.
not_available Aren't we closed to internal disaster? 
not_available Maybe they didn't get the news.
not_available Get it done! What's with the doors? 
not_available The generator's on a magnetic lock.
not_available The key pad which releases the door is on nonessential power.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available It means we're screwed.
not_available Open up! 
not_available Yeah, we're trying to.
not_available You have anything to pry open the doors? I'll check! We got a 33yearold repairman Can you hear me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go on! A possible electrocution and a 15
not_available foot fall.
not_available He was found unconscious at the foot of a power pole.
not_available Frequent PVCs in the field.
not_available Normal sinus now.
not_available Let me try.
not_available He may have been struck by lightning.
not_available His coworker said it went close.
not_available Okay, people.
not_available We're gonna take him in through the window.
not_available We need you to get up and move to the other side of the hall.
not_available Let's get all these chairs out of here.
not_available Eric, can you give me a hand? Can we get this window off? 
not_available Lift.
not_available Why don't we smash it? No, no, no.
not_available We got it.
not_available Just the backboard.
not_available We need a gurney in here.
not_available Lengthwise.
not_available Are you ready? Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Everybody grab hold.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available How're you doing? Welcome to County General.
not_available Get on the radio to Dispatch and tell them we are closed to trauma.
not_available Got it.
not_available She's crashing! 
not_available Miss Farr? Get on it, both of you.
not_available Jerry, page Benton.
not_available Reece? Where's her bottle? Reece, where are you? 
not_available It's Daddy.
not_available Right over here.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing? What is that? You're looking at the sky.
not_available Is this fun? 
not_available Penny for your thoughts.
not_available I hesitate to say.
not_available We're ready to close.
not_available I was just thinking Miss Heller's body's been through quite enough.
not_available An accident, a coma a brutal attack.
not_available The kindest thing might be to let her go in peace.
not_available Of course, we can't.
not_available Careful what you ask for.
not_available She's bradying down.
not_available Don't tell me that.
not_available EIKG looks good.
not_available Looks like a lightning strike.
not_available I was up the pole.
not_available That's all I remember.
not_available A flashover effect.
not_available I want to keep this shirt.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Full
not_available thickness burns.
not_available What have we got? What have you got? 
not_available Hi, Reece.
not_available He took a hit of lightning, fell 15 feet.
not_available No guarding or tenderness.
not_available Let's prep for a lavage.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Hang on, man.
not_available Why are you doing a nasotrach? 
not_available So I won't paralyze her.
not_available All right, I'm in.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Bag her.
not_available Good job.
not_available Not really.
not_available Without a CT, I have no idea what to do next.
not_available Don't you think she threw a clot? If she's inadequately anticoagulated.
not_available She needs heparin to thin her blood and prevent further clotting.
not_available What if she's overanticoagulated? Then she needs IK and FFP.
not_available Heparin would kill her.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available Hook her up.
not_available That's why you needed a ProTime.
not_available Bingo.
not_available Is an AC of 14 okay in the vent? 
not_available We're dead.
not_available I'll bag her.
not_available What the hell?! Oh, we just lost backup.
not_available This is still on.
not_available It's on battery.
not_available Patients on vents have to be bagged.
not_available Get them started.
not_available I lost my monitors for a 62year
not_available old.
not_available History of CVA and heart disease.
not_available Auxiliary power is out.
not_available LifePaks? 
not_available We gave the extras to ICU.
not_available Go.
not_available I'll take care of this.
not_available What do you think? She can take that one.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What happened to the generator? I thought it was supposed to be foolproof.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available Can you take Reece? Jerry can look after him.
not_available Mark, Carter needs you! Okay.
not_available Go, Mark.
not_available I got this one.
not_available Okay.
not_available Another unit in.
not_available Still no pressure.
not_available Damn it! Damn it! I can't think without the alarms blaring.
not_available Try phenyl ephedrine.
not_available Wait! Her neck veins are distended.
not_available No pulse in the aorta.
not_available Tamponade? 
not_available Exactly.
not_available You're going in blind? Okay.
not_available Retract the left lobe of the liver.
not_available Pericardiocentesis without monitors.
not_available Careful not to puncture the ventricle.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Got it.
not_available Give me a minute to check the pressure.
not_available I think it's coming up.
not_available All in a day's work.
not_available We're boned.
not_available The wrong treatment could kill her.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We're here with you.
not_available We need the CT.
not_available Watch her chest expansions.
not_available Whole
not_available blood clotting time.
not_available What? 
not_available Something from the Dark Ages.
not_available Do you have an extra red top on you? Of her blood? Yeah.
not_available I always hold one.
not_available How long ago did you draw it? 
not_available About 45 minutes ago.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No signs of clotting.
not_available I'll say she's overanticoagulated.
not_available So we treat her? We do an LP first.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, I'll take over.
not_available Lavage is negative.
not_available Blood in the urine.
not_available Could be ruptured bladder or kidneys.
not_available No CT.
not_available You want to do an ex
not_available lap? Let me see this.
not_available Let's get a specimen cup and set up a microscope.
not_available I've lost his pulse.
not_available I think he's in Vtach! Move! Let's get the defibrillator back! Carol, where's Haleh's patient? 
not_available Exam One.
not_available You okay in here? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Get away from her.
not_available What the hell? 
not_available Step back.
not_available Security! 
not_available Hey, relax.
not_available Who are you? Tom Frawley.
not_available I'm an RN at Mercy, but I live down the block.
not_available Do you have I.D.? I came in to help.
not_available They said to irrigate her scalp lac.
not_available He's doing a real nice job.
not_available Okay, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't know you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Good pickup.
not_available I've got him on Ativan.
not_available He seemed pretty depressed.
not_available He's having suicidal ideation.
not_available Really? 
not_available It happens more than people know.
not_available A lot of thoughts about pulling the trigger.
not_available He's a danger to himself.
not_available What about others? I need that! 
not_available I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
not_available No pulse.
not_available I'll hook up the lead.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available I'll take a quick look.
not_available He's in fib.
not_available Let's shock him at 200.
not_available Set.
not_available Clear! Damn! 300.
not_available Clear! 
not_available It's not charged yet.
not_available Batteries take longer.
not_available We'll be lucky if there's a charge left.
not_available Set.
not_available Clear! Got it.
not_available Thank God! Push lidocaine to 100 and keep an eye on him.
not_available Where's the microscope? How am I doing? 
not_available Great.
not_available Maybe I'll take the MCATs.
not_available Such a long way down.
not_available I know, Dottie.
not_available You said you heard a bang when you walked up to the door? I did.
not_available You heard Dottie fall down the stoop even without your hearing aid? Well, I heard a bang.
not_available Can you see okay? Yes.
not_available That bedsore's a bad one, isn't it? That's not a bedsore.
not_available IKerry? Anyone want fried chicken? You read my mind! Who fixed the doors? 
not_available They opened as we lost the generator.
not_available You lost the generator? Scary.
not_available It's been 40 minutes.
not_available Our battery packs are guaranteed for 45.
not_available This chicken smells great.
not_available Everything in my freezer's gone to mush.
not_available It was cook it or lose it.
not_available You made this? 
not_available Always cook with gas.
not_available So, what can I do? I've checked all the exam beds.
not_available See if Benton needs help in Trauma One.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available It's so good.
not_available Prep with the vitamin IK? And mannitol, in case she herniates.
not_available Don't worry, Carter.
not_available I'm using a 22
not_available gauge needle.
not_available You holding up, Lydia? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Strong hands.
not_available Don't be afraid to let Carter know if you need to be spelled.
not_available Let's get the FFP.
not_available Give vitamin IK, 10 milligrams, slow IV push.
not_available How are the pupils, Carter? Equal and reactive.
not_available Thanks for the backup.
not_available No problem.
not_available He zapped the guy back with a shock to spare.
not_available He puts urine under the microscope And it's bright red! 
not_available He says it's not blood.
not_available Rhabdomyolysis? And myoglobinuria.
not_available He was breaking down muscle, probably from the lightning and trauma.
not_available Sounds like you didn't need me.
not_available Didn't you say something about some chicken? Well done, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd be remiss if I didn't say this.
not_available You are an exceptional surgeon.
not_available It would be tragic for you to waste your talents on a trauma fellowship.
not_available I'm aware that you don't relish working with me.
not_available I'm in your face.
not_available I can't resist.
not_available But know this.
not_available I would do anything in my power to have you stay in Surgery.
not_available Including making myself as scarce as possible.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Think about it.
not_available I'll take over.
not_available The cops want to see you.
not_available The facility engineers found him in the switch room.
not_available He hung himself.
not_available Is that the guy? That's him.
not_available Get everybody back on vent.
not_available Reboot all monitors! You got it! This place is a mess! 
not_available CT's holding a table.
not_available How are you doing, Mrs.
not_available Farr? We'll take that out when you come back.
not_available I was very careful with your VNO.
not_available So, Carter, I need to ask you, what was going on in there? I was worried that she'd herniate.
not_available I mean between you and me.
not_available I was getting a weird energy.
not_available I mean, I couldn't tell if you were being territorial or admiring me I don't want to say that you were flirting.
not_available Obviously You weren't flirting with me, were you? Oh, man! You know, I spilled those pheromones on me, like a whole bottle.
not_available Is that what I smelled? 
not_available Maybe you picked up on a chemical.
not_available That's pretty far
not_available fetched.
not_available I mean, I admired you when you went for the LP.
not_available But that was it.
not_available I better get these to the lab.
not_available Get him? 
not_available Got him.
not_available Ten months after I retire, they're bought out.
not_available Health plan's kaput.
not_available She can't get out of bed.
not_available I wrote my pension wrong.
not_available If I go first, she gets nothing.
not_available I had to take care of her.
not_available I know.
not_available But what I don't know about is the bullet.
not_available What kind it was and whether you were firing from above.
not_available In that case, it might've hit her bladder.
not_available Or if you were aiming directly at her spine.
not_available It was a Walther automatic.
not_available I took it off a German officer.
not_available The Army gave me papers for it.
not_available At the end of the war pistols were the only thing they let us Gls keep.
not_available I see.
not_available God, what a day! ComEd says there was arcing at the substation.
not_available According to Facilities, our backup generator shut down because of a failed bearing in the cooling fan.
not_available That makes it all clear.
not_available I'm not 100o/o comfortable in the dark.
not_available I guess a candle
not_available lit dinner would not be an enticing offer? I'm afraid not.
not_available I'm heading home.
not_available Some 
advice I wouldn't do that.
not_available Rule number one of 
trauma After a day like today you should shift gears, not take it home.
not_available So, what do you suggest? We're out of here.
not_available Hope you have power at home.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available Looking for this? 
not_available You got it out.
not_available It didn't go through and I didn't have a number.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I'll fax it later.
not_available Did you read it? 
not_available No, you said it was personal.
not_available So it was a suicide pact.
not_available I wouldn't exactly call it that.
not_available The wife wasn't in on it.
not_available Myers said it's not unheard of.
not_available Depression over aging Ioss of control, a downward spiral.
not_available How long were they married? Fifty
not_available four years.
not_available Makes you wonder if something was always missing.
not_available I'm not the one to ask what makes a lasting relationship.
not_available Never had a lasting relationship.
not_available Not that I don't want to find that someone.
not_available Just haven't.
not_available I know.
not_available Your parents stayed together, but they shut you out.
not_available They lived like childless jet
not_available setters and made marriage a mystery to you.
not_available My problem, on the other hand, is that I was raised by such a capable, self
not_available sufficient single mom that it's hard for me to see the need for a partner at all.
not_available How long was that Psych rotation? Go, go, go! 
not_available Hang in there.
not_available That's the hard part.
not_available You just gotta watch out.
not_available Here.
not_available You have a go.
not_available No, after a fall like that 
not_available I'd be in traction for the season.
not_available You've gotta get back up on your skis, on the slope.
not_available Okay.
not_available I can do this.
not_available You can do anything.
not_available Three, two, one! Go! Go! Thank God for electricity! Why did I have to bring that up? Just give it a minute.
