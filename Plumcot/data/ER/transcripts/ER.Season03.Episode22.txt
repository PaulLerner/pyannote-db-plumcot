not_available What happened? My God! Where do I find a Ccollar? A garage
not_available door opener.
not_available Go ahead and try it.
not_available You carry a gun? 
not_available Under the front seat of my car.
not_available So what is all this about? This little dance you did today.
not_available If I can find a way to do what my patient wants then I think that's what I should do.
not_available I shouldn't cut somebody open just because I can.
not_available It's still raining, I see.
not_available It's Bangladesh out there, Jerry.
not_available How are you? 
not_available You go for a swim? Something like that.
not_available You're in early.
not_available I couldn't sleep.
not_available The couple next door at the motel were working on a record.
not_available Motel? 
not_available I haven't had time to find a place.
not_available I heard the West Side's nice.
not_available Not too pricey.

not_available seven grand.
not_available But second year, it jumps all the way to 30 grand.

not_available eight.
not_available Carol grew up on the West Side.

not_available It's raining.

not_available Marla doesn't get in until 7.
not_available What's on your mind, doctor? Now? I was hoping for an appointment this afternoon.
not_available There's no time like the present.
not_available I'd prefer to come back later, if that's okay with you.
not_available Are you intentionally trying to irritate me, Dr.
not_available Carter? No, sir.
not_available Then speak up.
not_available I've been contemplating leaving the Surgical Program.
not_available I've been considering it for quite some time, and I feel that I've made an error in selecting surgery as my specialty.
not_available For the most part, the training has been excellent but I just feel that ultimately I don't belong in surgery.
not_available And I would suspect that you would agree with me.
not_available I certainly do not! You don't? You entered into a contract, doctor.
not_available A contract with this institution.
not_available We agreed to give you the finest surgical training in exchange for six years of your best effort.
not_available I understand, but I think I do not give a damn what you think! This is not summer camp.
not_available You cannot just run home to mommy.
not_available You're going to suck it up and stick to it! That's what men do.
not_available Are we communicating here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good! And if I ever hear this crap coming out of your mouth again the only medicine you'll be practicing is picking out a cough suppressant for yourself down at the Jewel! Hey, Dr.
not_available Greene, Dr.
not_available Weaver's looking for you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, you okay? I'm fine, Jerry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available West Town's great.

not_available You can still find a place.
not_available How much do you want to spend?

not_available boy, let's take a look at this, okay? You like sports? You slide into home trying to beat the throw from center field? His temp's 99.8.
not_available Did you fall off your skateboard? Anything that might've hurt your hip? I don't have a skateboard anymore.
not_available He wouldn't wear his wrist pads, so I took it away.
not_available Your mom's right about that.
not_available Licorice? Has he had any kind of penetrating wound or injury? Been in the woods camping, nature hikes at school, anything? CBC with a diff, Chem
not_available 7, sed rate, ultrasound, blood cultures.
not_available And let's get an arthrocentesis.
not_available I'm gonna have to call down Ortho.
not_available I don't think it's any big deal.
not_available We just gotta make sure.
not_available I talked to Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Did she tell you about it? Talked about what? I'm hoping to leave my Surgical Residency.
not_available You're what? I'd like to be considered for Emergency Medicine.
not_available What did Anspaugh say? 
not_available He was less than enthusiastic.
not_available Doyle has a chest pain in Curtain 2.
not_available You've missed this year's match.
not_available I was hoping for a spot outside the match.
not_available And that you'd put in a good word with Anspaugh.
not_available Was Dr.
not_available Weaver supportive? Weaver has a better relationship with Anspaugh.
not_available She could probably be more persuasive.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tell me how it goes.
not_available Sure.
not_available Retract the liver inferiorly, and rotate it medially.

not_available It went away.
not_available Do you smoke? Hell, no! 
not_available His BP and pulse are low.
not_available Yeah, but he's an athlete.
not_available Am I having a heart attack? It's probably just muscle strain.
not_available But with your family history, we're not taking any risks.

not_available old kid with hip pain.
not_available Del Amico's worried it might be septic arthritis.
not_available A lot of tests for a kid getting over an upper

not_available What's he saying? 
not_available The structures of the brain are okay.
not_available Thank God.
not_available So there'll be no developmental problems or disabilities, right? Well, there can be problems associated with anoxia.
not_available What's anoxia? Your baby was deprived of oxygen in the womb.
not_available So there's always the possibility that there could be brain damage.
not_available Will he be able to play with other kids and learn to read? If you're asking will he be a doctor or a lawyer I can't say.
not_available Chances are, your baby will be fine.
not_available But a certain percentage do have neuro
not_available developmental problems and/or learning disabilities.
not_available What percentage? Infants delivered at 32 weeks with no complications have a better than 98 percent chance of being normal.
not_available What about the ones with complications? Your child had several serious complications at birth.
not_available No one can give you an accurate percentage.
not_available It's not an exact science.

not_available Can I talk to you for a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I talked to Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available Is he gonna let you out? A few words from you would help.
not_available You're still interested in pursuing Emergency Medicine? Yeah.
not_available I asked Dr.
not_available Greene about it.
not_available He seemed supportive but he thought it might be difficult to find a spot.
not_available I've got an LOL in 6.
not_available Weak and dizzy all over.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's probably right about finding a slot.
not_available We only have so much salary budgeted for next year.
not_available That's okay.
not_available You don't have to pay me.

not_available He didn't talk to you about it? No.
not_available Do you have any idea where he is? I think he's in the lounge.

not_available I game him Advil.
not_available I supervise you.
not_available It could have been septic arthritis.
not_available I looked at the CBC.
not_available It was synovitis.
not_available What if it's earlystage? You want to put an 8year
not_available old boy through a painful procedure on the remote possibility he's suffering from a rare diagnosis your tests don't even indicate.
not_available You can gamble with your patients' lives, but don't do it with mine.
not_available He's in heart block! Pulse ox? Eighty

not_available Mrs.
