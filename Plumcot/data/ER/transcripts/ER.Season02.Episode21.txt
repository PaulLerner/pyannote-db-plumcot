not_available You haven't by any chance heard from your dad today, have you? I feel like I just plucked the virtue of a virgin.
not_available I'm so glad you did.
not_available Stay off! Yeah, he fell right over backwards onto it.
not_available He really didn't fall, did he? He put in a freaking incident report against me! but I think you did a wonderful thing.
not_available You mean taking care of Susie? I didn't have a choice.
not_available You have children? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available "Take These Broken Wings" I didn't wanna give up fighting for her.

not_available I mean, little Susie's almost a year old.
not_available She's been with me forever.
not_available Her birthday's next week.
not_available Did I mention that? She fell in love with our neighbors little puppy, JoBo.
not_available So I got her this stuffed little animal, black and white, floppy ears.
not_available Did I tell you the daycare center called? Seems I still have an outstanding bill.
not_available Gotta love that whole insultto
not_available injury thing.
not_available I kind of hate going up there, but It's Susie's birthday next week.
not_available Did I mention that? I've got to remember to send her a present.
not_available Anyway, I suppose things are okay.

not_available Well, they can't be cold and dead.
not_available I thought we were gonna do something fun.
not_available I'm having fun.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is this what you and Dad used to do every morning? If it makes you feel any better, Dad couldn't keep up if he were driving.
not_available You're the first woman I've jogged for.

not_available Not necessarily.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Like this.
not_available Is this helping at all? Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I really am sorry.
not_available I'm not saying that she

not_available foot crane, right into the lake.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Last epi?

not_available I'm only saying that this candidate has had some serious personal difficulties of late.
not_available Which were handled quite well, considering all things.
not_available Gave two atropine in the field.
not_available Pupils fixed and dilated.
not_available I could consider supporting this individual if there were more supervision involved.
not_available No BP.
not_available No pulse.
not_available By the new ER Attending Morgenstern wants to bring in? 
not_available It's a possibility.
not_available And the candidates for that job are? 
not_available I think it's still pretty wide open.
not_available It's warmed up.
not_available He's dead.
not_available So whoever I support for that position will support my choice for chief? 
not_available It's possible.
not_available Mark, excuse me.
not_available Whenever you're done talking in code about Dr.
not_available Lewis being Chief Resident and Dr.
not_available Weaver becoming Attending, can we call the time of death? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Time of 
death 8:53.
not_available Let me know when the family gets here.
not_available And call the Eye Bank.
not_available Girl, that's pretty.
not_available Finally popped the question, huh? Yep.
not_available He really wanted me to have his mother's ring, but she's still alive.
not_available Oh, Susan.

not_available Where is everyone? Field trip to the park.
not_available Spring at last, thank God.
not_available Well, I have a bill to pay.

not_available Of course we get there, and no one's there but an OB nurse.
not_available And Chloe is screaming for The Beatles, "The White Album! " Carter's fumbling, can't find it anywhere.
not_available Chloe doesn't want to breathe, but she thinks singing will help.
not_available So there we are, like a bunch of crazies.
not_available And there I am, in between verses, telling 
her "Push, Chloe! Push! Come on.
not_available You can do it, girl.
not_available You can do it! " And I cut the cord and wrapped the little, warm baby all up and put it on her chest.
not_available Oh, this brand
not_available new life.
not_available Chloe was crying.
not_available I was crying.
not_available She was so beautiful.

not_available " And you know what she said? She said, "No, we did it.
not_available We did it.
not_available " Our baby girl.

not_available They moved the antibiotics down there.
not_available This is adorable.
not_available Yeah, I had to clear out some of Susie's stuff from upstairs at daycare.
not_available Susan, if there's anything I can do, if you want to talk about anything
not_available You were right, here it is.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm with Pickman.
not_available I know.
not_available Shep's off today.
not_available I'd be with Pickman even if he wasn't.
not_available You shouldn't have filed that complaint with IAD.
not_available He shouldn't have slammed that kid.
not_available It's not what happened.
not_available You think he was just doing his job? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I believe the job doesn't have to be done that way.
not_available Who made you the voice of experience? 
not_available Raul.
not_available That's who.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean that.
not_available You know, Shep's been working at this job for almost eight years.
not_available If you ever step off that high moral ground, you might learn something.
not_available Yeah, I already have.
not_available You should tell the IAD investigator.
not_available I already have.
not_available Abdominal pain for how long? 
not_available A couple of days.
not_available I feel so bloated.

not_available Don't worry.
not_available Jerry's probably showing them educational pictures of open
not_available heart surgery or something worse.
not_available I'll check back when the tests are back.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, there you are.
not_available Hi, how'd it go? Man, that guy was a real son of a bitch.
not_available It's an interview, not a military inquest.
not_available Yeah, but he asked 1000 questions.
not_available He already talked to Reilly.
not_available I know.
not_available Little peckerhead.
not_available He hasn't seen half what I've seen.
not_available Calm down, it'll be fine.
not_available You'll tell them you were there the whole time? You saw everything? Yes, I was there.
not_available The guy stumbled into the table.
not_available That simple.
not_available Anyone could see it was kind of a tough situation.
not_available Shep, you're driving me crazy.
not_available I'm gonna speak to this investigator guy and this whole thing's gonna go away.
not_available Will you please go away? It's my day off.
not_available I don't really have anything else to do.
not_available Well, it's spring, you know? Plant flowers.

not_available Her folks live in Penrose.
not_available Penrose? Like 150 miles from here?

not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Come with me.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available Cats! Burmese, Cornish Rex, Japanese Bobtail.
not_available God, my hatred for them knows no bounds.
not_available Short hair, long hair, I hate them.
not_available I think you're allergic to them.
not_available I never used to be.
not_available My brother had a cat growing up, and I hated Sometimes your allergies get worse when you get older.
not_available Or maybe that's completely false.
not_available I'm shooting the Chicago Cat Show, and suddenly I'm Tippi Hedren in The Birds.
not_available They're everywhere! Iris.
not_available Iris.
not_available Iris, stop.
not_available Okay, we're just gonna get you your own room.

not_available Just getting over the flu.
not_available Any fever or seizures? 
not_available Temp's normal.
not_available She was jerking.
not_available I couldn't get her to stop.
not_available I need a 3.5, not a 4.0.
not_available Use a 4.0.
not_available Susan, I'll do it.
not_available Please, just tell me what is wrong with her.

not_available Think she'll be able to play? 
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Let me know when the LFTs, BUN and creatinine are back.
not_available And, Carter, she's in here alone, so stay close.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yuck.
not_available What are you kids doing in the hall? Why is it that Chloe always called Mom "Cookie" and I always called Mom "Mom"? She was such a great kid that way.
not_available Funny and fearless.
not_available Just one big party all wrapped up and We'd dress up and put on these plays at the top of the stairs.
not_available Chloe, of course, went straight for Mom's best dresses, best jewelry best shoes.
not_available I was afraid they'd get mad, so I was the one in the bathrobe and sneakers.
not_available But they never did.
not_available Never.
not_available Not once.
not_available Chloe went for the good stuff, and I went for being the good girl.
not_available She was such an accomplished adult by the time she was 9.
not_available And so lousy at it by the time she was 19.
not_available I mean, if she could just go back to some of that then if she wanted to be a mother What am I saying? She is a mother.
not_available Boy, when you buy somebody lunch, you go all out.
not_available How's your knee? If it's still bothering you, I can get you something for that.
not_available I heard from Ray.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Well, not from him actually.
not_available About him.
not_available How's the good life in the Caymans? 
not_available He never went there.
not_available He's in Mexico.
not_available Kind of sends a message, doesn't it? Like what? Like he's not coming back? Well, what does it look like to you? Well, I'm used to him disappearing.
not_available He doesn't tend to mention it in advance.
not_available Yeah, I guess not, considering he took my money with him.
not_available Well 
not_available Thanks for all the sympathy.
not_available No I'm sorry.
not_available It's just, I'm disappointed.
not_available Well, don't be.
not_available It wasn't your money.
not_available He bolted on me year after year.
not_available But I just didn't think with you in the picture What's that got to do with it? 
not_available I'd think he would want to see you.
not_available Come back and see me.
not_available Come back, see us.
not_available Is that what you mean? He doesn't know about us, Karen.
not_available Well, maybe it's your idea of fun, to watch him find out.
not_available Is that what this is about, Doug? What we're about? Getting back at Dad, stealing his girlfriend? 
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available Is it? For three weeks, you've been telling me how you can't stand the guy.
not_available Now you're disappointed he's not coming back? That is ridiculous.
not_available My motto 
is "Think Jordan.
not_available " I'm just saying that you can't rule out Orlando.
not_available What do they know about basketball in Florida? Does this hurt? 
not_available Yeah, a little.
not_available TC's right.
not_available Orlando's got a good record.
not_available Push comes to shove, they'll choke.
not_available Only one NBA leader in scoring and zip in rebounds.
not_available Okay, I give up.
not_available Carter.
not_available Liver's enlarged and firm upon examination.
not_available Lab tests show elevated LFTs, leukocytosis, and a prolonged PT consistent with ascending cholangitis.
not_available Start her on one gram of cefotaxime IV Q
not_available 6.
not_available She on the list for a liver transplant? 
not_available Status 3.
not_available Move her up to Status 2.
not_available She'll have to stay hospitalized until we find a liver.
not_available I better brush up on my basketball trivia.
not_available You should do that anyway.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? Al Boulet.
not_available How are you doing? I got some kind of flu or something.
not_available Yeah? Well, take care.
not_available Sorry about those kids and the camera.
not_available I'm glad I got it back.
not_available I'm sorry about snorting all over your hand.
not_available That's just another adventure.
not_available Speaking of which, I was thinking maybe 
not_available Bless you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Lily.
not_available Where do you come from? 
not_available The bus stop.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I can't get him off.
not_available Is that a hermit crab? Herman.
not_available My dad named him.
not_available I'm afraid we're gonna have to cut him off.
not_available But he'd die, right? I can't kill Herman.
not_available No, of course you can't.
not_available Cats you can kill.
not_available But not Herman.
not_available It's just water, honey.
not_available There you go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available I produced this cheesy Jacques Cousteau rip
not_available off thing a couple of months ago.
not_available Anything on Grace Ramsey? 
not_available She's breathing spontaneously.
not_available We' re waiting on the CT.
not_available Okay, let me know.
not_available They're seriously backed up up there.
not_available Just let me know.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Hi.
not_available Your name's Al Boulet? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We've got a Jeanie Boulet here.
not_available Any relation? She's my wife.
not_available Actually, we're separated.
not_available You've been losing weight, having fevers, sweating? Yeah, I think I've got the 24day flu instead of the 24
not_available hour.
not_available A lot of stuff's been going around at work.
not_available Deep breath.
not_available Your shortness of breath, how long's that been going on? About a month or so.
not_available Mr.
not_available Boulet, I'm gonna get a chest x
not_available ray and I'll talk to you about some blood tests I'd like to order.
not_available Seen Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available He snuck out for some lunch.
not_available Radiology screwed up the films on Loretta Sweet.
not_available We have to redo them.
not_available What happened? Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Teach this SOB to grapple with a soontobe
not_available married man.
not_available Let's pour a little cold peroxide on those cuts.
not_available You don't look so good.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Nothing will to ruin our celebration at the Ritz
not_available Carlton.
not_available Let's clean you up.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available I didn't know you were here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm just getting a little checkup.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing really.
not_available Just a little tired lately.
not_available Breath feels kind of short or something.
not_available Working too much, that's all.
not_available Did they say anything? No.
not_available They just took a bunch of blood, did some x
not_available rays.
not_available Look, I've got some other patients.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Go do your thing.
not_available They've got me in good hands.
not_available I'll try and stop by later.
not_available Hi, this is Jeanie down in the ER.
not_available We've been waiting on some lab tests forever.
not_available Boulet.
not_available Al Boulet.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you could put a rush on them, I'd appreciate it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Carol Hathaway? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available I'm David Haskell from IAD.
not_available That's Investigations and
not_available Audit Division, yes, I know.
not_available Sorry to have kept you waiting.
not_available You said that.
not_available Must have really meant it then.
not_available So you saw Ahn stumble.
not_available Who? 
not_available Ahn Nguyen.
not_available Vietnamese boy.
not_available Saw him hit his head on a coffee table? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Just lost his balance? 
not_available Must have.
not_available Which would make sense, after Mr.
not_available Shepard gave him
not_available What did he call it? "A light shove.
not_available " Is that how you'd describe it? Light shove? Well, the kid wasn't falling very fast.
not_available So, yeah, it was probably pretty light.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brown says you helped him unstrap a board.
not_available He was nervous and frustrated, so I helped him do it.
not_available Then you both took the board back into the kitchen.
not_available No, Reilly took it.
not_available That's right.
not_available He says he was headed to the kitchen with the board.
not_available That's when he saw Mr.
not_available Shepard
not_available "Slam" is the word he used.
not_available Slam Ahn Nguyen across the room.
not_available So you must have gone back into the kitchen at pretty much the same time.
not_available No, Reilly moved in first.
not_available He carried the board ahead of me.
not_available But if you both saw the incident, which obviously you did since you think it was a light shove, and Mr.
not_available Brown thinks it was a slam then both of you had to be there the whole time.
not_available Yes, that's right.
not_available I was there the whole time.
not_available No, we had a fight, and I feel like a jerk.
not_available My dad did take her money, and I wasn't all that sympathetic.
not_available She was accusing me of wanting him to come back.
not_available What is this all about? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What kind of question is that? 
not_available It's not your fault he stole her money.
not_available Except that he gave the money to me.
not_available So give it back.
not_available I can't.
not_available I only have $10,000.
not_available I gave This is way too complicated for me.
not_available Kerry, the CT's are back.
not_available Subdural hematoma, loud and clear.
not_available You found retinal hemorrhages and didn't bother to tell me.
not_available You were already upset about the intubation.
not_available This mother's abusing her child.
not_available I want to talk to her.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Not yet? A subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages are the hallmarks of Shaken Baby Syndrome.
not_available She could have brain damage! 
not_available I've ordered a Neurosurgical consult.
not_available I wanna talk to the mother.
not_available She's the problem! 
not_available I called Children and Family Services.
not_available They have 1000 cases.
not_available Who keeps tabs? I've also notified the police.
not_available It's the best we can do.
not_available You know that if this mother doesn't get it and that baby starts crying she picks her up and the baby doesn't stop she's just going to start shaking her and shaking her! We can't solve this, Susan.
not_available I wish we could, but we both know we can't.
not_available So we're gonna take care of the child, okay? We're gonna do everything we can for the child.
not_available They took the baby up to Pediatrics ICU.
not_available Children and Family Services came down to talk to the mother.
not_available The police are looking into it.
not_available And that's the last I know.
not_available That's the last I'm gonna know.
not_available Sometimes that's the good thing about being an ER doc.
not_available Treat them and street them.
not_available Turf them upstairs.
not_available I've gotta hand it to that Kerry Weaver, though.
not_available She surprises you.
not_available Just when you think she's completely clueless she hangs in there.
not_available Stalling, arguing with me, agreeing with me
not_available "We can't solve the problem.
not_available We can take care of the child.
not_available " Until I finally let go.
not_available Getting bored sitting in your room? Hey, your fever's down.
not_available Come on, bounce me one.
not_available The good news is that once you get a new liver the disease won't come back.
not_available And you're official now.
not_available You're all signed up on the transplant list.
not_available We don't need it right away.
not_available If it takes a few months, you're still gonna be fine.
not_available Unfortunately, you're gonna have to stay here.
not_available Well, not here.
not_available You're gonna be upstairs.
not_available But I'll come visit you, whenever I can.
not_available And you can educate me on the finer points of the point guard.
not_available Maybe we can watch the playoffs together.
not_available That sounds pretty cool, doesn't it? But I can't play in my tournament, can I? No.
not_available No, I'm sorry, TC.
not_available You can't play in your tournament.
not_available Thought I'd never get out of there.
not_available I'm glad you didn't wait.
not_available Tuna on whole wheat with lettuce and tomato.
not_available You want it? I'm not hungry.
not_available Right after I finish my cheese steak.
not_available I know I've said this before, but you have to get Kerry Weaver off my back.
not_available What? Sixmonth
not_available old baby girl came in cyanotic.
not_available Kerry thinks I can't do the intubation.
not_available But you did? 
not_available No! She took over.
not_available Yes, it was a baby.
not_available Yes, it was hard.
not_available But I've done this 100 times.
not_available How's everything else? You mean therapy? That is what you mean, right? Well, do I feel terrific? Not really.
not_available Am I marginally better? Not really.
not_available Am I happy I'm spending my money on therapy and not Gymboree or a stroller? Not really.
not_available So everything's going okay.
not_available Want to walk back? 
not_available They didn't page me.
not_available I wish there was something I could do.
not_available Something I could say.
not_available So do I.
not_available It would be so much easier if this bad news were happening to some patient.
not_available I shouldn't be drinking this.
not_available I'll never get to sleep.
not_available I never sleep anyway.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, we actually had a class in medical school.
not_available A sort of "How to deliver the bad news.
not_available " We even had to make videotapes and perform it.
not_available "I'm very sorry, sir, but your wife was hit by a Mack truck and we did everything possible, but she died.
not_available " Then some actor playing the husband would go into convulsions on the floor and start crying out in agony.
not_available That's not usually how they react.
not_available They shake.
not_available Then they start to cry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I remember the first time I had to do it.
not_available It was this elderly man.
not_available And his wife had just died.
not_available No big accident, just old age.
not_available And he looked at me for about a minute.
not_available And then walked away.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was the one left shaking.
not_available Practice makes perfect, though.
not_available Now I can deliver that speech in a heartbeat.
not_available And it's not that I don't feel badly, because I do.
not_available But I get the words out, and I move on.
not_available The healers are always taught to move on.
not_available And for the life of me, I can't seem to do that now.
not_available This hurt is so strong and so present, it makes me feel her.
not_available And to still be able to feel her I don't want to move on from that.
not_available You need something? 
not_available Your interview must have gone well.
not_available Got a lot of work, Reilly.
not_available Haskell called.
not_available They dropped the investigation.
not_available It seems your answers confirmed Shep's side of the story.
not_available Well, now we can all get back to work.
not_available I like you.
not_available But whatever you said in there I don't think you're doing Shep any favors.
not_available Maybe it's the Raul thing and he'll come through this but right now, he doesn't belong out there.
not_available He's dangerous.
not_available I can't keep doing this.
not_available You can.
not_available You made it through the last surgery, you can make it through this.
not_available It's the kids.
not_available They never know what's going on from one day to the next.
not_available Where I'm gonna be, where they're gonna be.
not_available They're gonna be at my house tonight, okay? My parental skills can use a little brushing up.
not_available I don't know what to tell them.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available I've hardly even seen them all day.
not_available Well, I can tell you one thing.
not_available They've been pretty busy.
not_available Take a look.
not_available Look, Mom, they turned us into doctors.
not_available Officer, I'm so sorry.
not_available Are you kidding? He was the center of attention.
not_available He loved it.
not_available Are you sure you can't stay for dinner? Mom, look.
not_available Thank you, but I can't eat dinner at 5:30 in the afternoon.
not_available Pathetic, isn't it? How Howard comes back from the office grabs dinner, rushes back to the office.
not_available I thought tax season was over.
not_available What happened to April 15th? Does the word "extension" mean anything to you? As a matter of fact, I think I have one of those.
not_available All right.
not_available Listen, Mom 
not_available So how much do you need? You can't possibly know that.
not_available I haven't said anything about money.
not_available You're not here for dinner, are you? 
not_available No.
not_available You don't drop by a lot to play bridge.
not_available I don't play bridge.
not_available My point exactly.
not_available Doug, there are three reasons kids come back home.
not_available One, to announce they're getting married.
not_available Two, they're depressed and they need a place to sleep for three years.
not_available And three, they need money.
not_available My money's on the money.
not_available So were you always so smart? Right up until the day I married your father.
not_available Doug.
not_available All those years you were growing up, not knowing about your dad I couldn't help you then.
not_available Nothing would make me happier than to help you now.
not_available Don't you wanna know what I need the money for? You really wanna tell me? 
not_available Bring the carrots over here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Broken tib
not_available fib.
not_available Jeanie, do you have a minute? If I call Ortho now, they ought to make it down by summer.
not_available It's about Al, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And is it AIDS? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pneumocystis pneumonia.
not_available I saw his chart, and when he told me how he was feeling, his symptoms I need to give him the news.
not_available I thought it might be easier for him
not_available No, I'll do it.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available I know you're separated.
not_available But he may have been HIV
not_available positive for a few years.
not_available Have you ever been tested? How many married people get tested? I checked for you at the hotel suite.
not_available It doesn't seem to be mine anymore.
not_available Something about when you lose company money.
not_available You're gonna have to let me write you something for that.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I've gotta say, I much prefer your place.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Some of what you said, I don't know if it's true or not.
not_available But you made me think about it.
not_available And I I don't know.
not_available I realized that I want to be with you, Karen.
not_available You don't see me kicking you out the door.
not_available You're gonna have to let me do this because I have a very low threshold for your pain.
not_available Up, and there you go.
not_available Karen.
not_available Doug? 
not_available I have a confession to make.
not_available You're not married, are you? 
not_available No, it's worse than that.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know the money that my father took from you? He gave it to me.
not_available What? Yeah, I
not_available I mean, he never gave me a dime when I was in medical school and he just handed me a bunch of cash before he took off.
not_available Twenty
not_available five thousand dollars.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I want you to have it.
not_available Twenty
not_available five thousand dollars? Ray stole over 250 grand.
not_available Two hundred and fifty grand? 
not_available You got it.
not_available This is nothing.
not_available This is a drop in the bucket.
not_available No, it's everything.
not_available It's the sweetest thing anybody's ever done for me.
not_available I could get fired tomorrow, but I gotta love you for this one.
not_available Great news, huh, baby? They dropped the whole thing! Whatever you said in there made the difference.
not_available We are home free.
not_available Let's celebrate.
not_available Let's go do something.
not_available Shep, I got a lot of paperwork.
not_available You can do this later.
not_available This can wait.
not_available No, I really need to do this now.
not_available Okay, we go to dinner, then.
not_available Dinner, maybe a club.
not_available No.
not_available They're playing basketball outside.
not_available I'll join you when I'm finished.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't be too long.
not_available Al, I need to talk to you.
not_available It's cold in here tonight.
not_available Maybe Chloe is getting it together.
not_available Or maybe Joe can keep it together.
not_available Sometimes I dream that they call and 
say "Hey, Suze, why don't you take her again for a while? " And in my dream I say, "Yes, Chloe.
not_available I will take her forever.
not_available " Then I wake up, and I know it's not true because my arms hurt from feeling so empty.
not_available I always knew you loved your children.
not_available I just never realized how much you fell in love with them.
not_available Little Susie was like a storybook.
not_available One you never wanted to put down.
not_available Every smile was some new page to be pored over.
not_available Studied.
not_available Touched.
not_available Remembered.
not_available I loved my storybook.
not_available For the first time in a long time I didn't feel alone.
