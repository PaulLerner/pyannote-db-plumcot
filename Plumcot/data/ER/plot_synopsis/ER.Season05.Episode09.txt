"General Lee" (Mare Winningham) reports for her first day as the new ER Chief. Carter is handpicked to entertain a local celebrity - a woman born at the (then) newly opened County General Hospital, both of whom are celebrating their 100th birthday. Doug treats a young boy, "Wilson," who was hit by a car while trying to get away from a man who was chasing him and a friend who is soon brought in with a GSW (gunshot wound) to the abdomen. Corday prepares to present her notes on the patient that she accidently overdosed. The boy with the GSW does not survive his injuries, and Wilson is interviewed by the police about the incident. Peter has an opportunity to watch an implant performed on a young boy that promises to allow the child to hear sounds. Carter and the 100 year old woman ditch her family for fresh air and a lively discussion about growing old. During the M&M, Corday delivers a compelling speech about the risk to patients when interns are expected to work 36 hours with no sleep. Carol finds ammunition in Wilson's belongings. After Carol starts talking to Wilson, she uncovers the truth - Wilson won a bet and shot his friend for not paying up. Once the truth is out, Carol is frustrated that the judicial system refuses to take the boy, who is showing no remorse for the shooting, into custody. After watching the surgery to place a hearing device in a young patient, Benton decides against immediately pursuing the same for his own child. Benton and Corday mutually agree that their love relationship no longer exists and they would be better off as friends. When the elderly woman is found unconscious and not breating, Carter extracts a piece of candy from her throat, thus enabling her to live to see another day. In the end, her family legacy lives on as one of her grandchildren arrives just in time to deliver a baby girl, which they name after the centenarian.
