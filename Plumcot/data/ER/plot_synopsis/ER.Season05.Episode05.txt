It's halloween at the ER. The ER stiffs are griping about the antics of other staff who have dressed up for the occasion. Mark shows ER Chief candidates around. A mentally unstable woman brought in by ambulance claims she is having labor pains, but winds up being relieved of a bag full of urine instead. Mark treats with Haldol without confirming whether or not there is a pregnancy. New ped's attending Doug Ross begins churning out policies, including an order that all children's cases must be signed off by the attending (which means Kerry has to come to him to sign off any child she treats). A drunk comes into the ER asking for detox, disappears, then reappears drunker than before, and disappers again. Corday continues to be bombarded with meaningless tasks. Rachel gives Mark a bombshell - her mother is moving her to St. Louis. An exploratory procedure on a teen MVA [moving vehicle accident] results in a big surprise for the surgeons. Carter leaves Lucy in charge of a dorm party that gets out of control. Later when unconscious students are found,Carter finds out they were mixing alcohol and ecstasy. Peter lets loose with Corday, giving into his inner 'Shaft'. Kerry finds out she did not get the ER Chief job. Carter puts the blame on Lucy for the near deaths of two med students.
