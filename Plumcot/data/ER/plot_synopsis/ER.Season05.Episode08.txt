In order to save the life of a young girl who needs a transfusion, Lucy and Carter search Chicago to locate her father, who is a perfect match for her rare blood.The ER staff discover a parental kidnapping after an MVA (moving vehicle accident) severely injures a child. After the father takes off, the staff find out the child has a rare blood type that only the missing father can supply. As the ER struggles to keep the child alive, Carter and Lucy are consumed with finding the missing father. Meanwhile, a groom arrives at the ER claiming short term amnesia followed closely by his upset bride. Even while pursuing a common goal, Carter and Lucy are still not getting along. Carter continues to blame Lucy for the problems at the ER (like "letting" the father walk away from the ER). As they search the projects of Chicago, Carter runs across a woman with an active, communicable case of TB that may have infected her entire neighborhood. Carter narrowly misses the father while Benton and Aspaugh, who are trying to prepare the child for surgery, get more bad news. Blood that had been flown in for the child arrived contaminated. Carter confesses to Lucy that she is the first intern that he has supervised who has promise. As they continue to scour Chicago, Carter falls and dislocates his shoulder, leaving Lucy to relocate the bones. The child survives the surgery, but is in critical condition as Carter and Lucy continue their hunt for the father. After a city-wide search, a burned out Jeep, and an $84 cab ride, Carter and Lucy finally find the father at the eatery across the street from the hospital. In the end, the two finally start seeing eye to eye.
