Carter loses his job as RA. Mark continues to ride with EMTs in an effort to smooth things out between the ER and paramedics. During the ridealong, he witnesses a shooting, and with gunfire going on, he puts himself and the EMTs in danger as he tries to treat a beating victim. Carters affair with Roxanne progresses. Mark treats the beating victim, who turns out to be a 16 year old gay male prostitute; the good news is that he's not HIV positive (yet). Harvey Korman hassles the staff after 'schleping in the rain' to get to the Free Clinic to be tested for insulin levels. Peter gives Carter some good advice on how to deal with Lucy, but then blows it with Corday when he shows concern about being her attending. Peter continues to seek treatment options for his deaf son, including a discussion with a physician who also happens to be deaf. A man brings his daughter in with suspicious injuries. He explains that they got hooked on breaking world records and that the latest injury was sustained while she was riding a unicycle backwards while playing a violin. Carol and Lynette differ on opinions after Carol denies a Free Clinic patient medication unless she takes it with birth control pills. The first choice ER Chief turns down the job (he was using the ER interview as a bartering chip for the job he actually wanted). Anspaugh informs Mark that Kerry is still not going to get the ER Chief job. Two workers come in glued together and wind up getting some of the ER staff stuck to them. Mark helps the 16 year old evade the police who have a warrant for his arrest. Carter continues to be harsh with Lucy. Jeanie steps in as a surrogate for a world record breaking trampoline event.
