A woman returns to Cook County General to claim the baby she had abandoned there, the baby that Cate and her husband are considering adopting. The ER doctors and nurses assist at a camp for children recovering from open heart surgeries where Morris pre-proposes to Claudia and Brenner befriends a kid who doesn't want to join in with the activities. The staff rotates through their shifts on the floor and volunteering at the camp, which is held in the hospital.
