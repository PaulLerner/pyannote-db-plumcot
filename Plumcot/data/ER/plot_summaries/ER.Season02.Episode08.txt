Doug gets the opportunity to stay at the ER thanks to the publicity surrounding his rescue of a drowning boy last week. He will even be given an award. Later, Doug and Mark have a disagreement about two patients and Mark sends Doug home. Shep finds out about Carol's suicide attempt a year earlier and Carter tells Benton something about Jeanie he didn't know. Susan is still looking for a babysitter when she gets a lovely old woman who's good with children as a patient.
Now that Doug Ross is a hero, the hospital offers to renew his fellowship at County General for another year. He and Mark Ross however, continue to argue over Doug's cavalier approach to hospital rules and procedures. Susan is having trouble finding a babysitter for little Suzie for when she's on the night shift. An ER patient she is treating seems to be the ideal candidate. When Shep has disparaging remarks about a suicide victim he's brought in, he learns of Hathaway's suicide attempt. The reason for the young woman's attempt to take her life puts her and her brother in a potentially dangerous situation. Fearing that he may have misdiagnosed an earlier patient, Carter goes overboard and orders a long list of tests for someone participating in Dr. Vucelic's study. Doug is shocked when he receives a phone call from someone he hasn't seen or heard from in years. Benton learns Jeanie Boulet is separated from her husband.
