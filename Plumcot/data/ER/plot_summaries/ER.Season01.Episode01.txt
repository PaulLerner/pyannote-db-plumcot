The pilot for the popular TV series is set during 24 frantic hours in the lives of a group of doctors, nurses, and staff members of a busy emergency room at a Chicago hospital. They deal with the seemingly endless casualties that stumble into their place of employment. The central characters are the chief resident and family man Dr. Mark Greene, who is considering a job in private practice due to pressure from his demanding law student wife Jennifer; outgoing Dr. Doug Ross, who deals with cases in his own personal way; straight-arrow Dr. Susan Lewis, trying to get by another long 36-hour shift; inexperienced third-year med student John Carter; cocky surgical resident Dr. Peter Benton; and troubled chief nurse Carol Hathaway.
In the introductory episode to the long-running series, the doctors, nurses and students at County General Hospital Emergency Room are introduced. Dr. Mark Greene is the Chief Resident and, like other residents, works long hours in a highly stressful environment. He has difficulty balancing his work and home life and his wife, Jenn, a law student, urges him to take a better paying job in private practice that will result in a more balanced lifestyle. Mark, however, realizes that he loves his work too much to join a quiet practice. Doug Ross is the ER pediatrician, and something of a ladies' man who is prone to drink on his days off. During his shift he has to deal with a severely beaten baby. Dr. Susan Lewis has to tell a 40-year old patient that he likely has cancer and only few months to live. Dr. Peter Benton is a brilliant surgical resident who feels restrained by his more senior colleagues. He gets an opportunity to shine, however, when a patient requires immediate surgery and he is the only person available to do it. The staff is shocked when well-liked head nurse Carol Hathaway is brought in after a suicide attempt. Into this mix comes third year medical student John Carter, for whom everything is a new experience.
