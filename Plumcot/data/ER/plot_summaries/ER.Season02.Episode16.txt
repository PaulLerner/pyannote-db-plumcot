Shep and Raul go in a burning house without the proper equipment to save three children.
Shep and Raul get a call about a burning house and are the first ones on the scene. When they find out there are three children inside, Shep goes in, ignoring the fact they don't have the proper equipment. At the ER victims of the fire keep coming in and when somebody says Shep and Raul where there first, everybody starts worrying about their fate, especially Carol. Meanwhile, Susan's sister Chloe has returned and Doug has made an appointment with his father to see a basketball game.

The team, especially Carol Hathaway, are concerned when they learn that paramedics Shep and Raoul may have been trapped in the building. It turns out one of them is severely injured and will not make it through the night. John Carter has trouble performing a procedure on one of the burn victims and Greene has to take over. Doug Ross continues his attempt at reconciliation with his long-absent father, but when he doesn't show up for a planned outing, Doug has had enough. Susan Lewis is making final arrangements to adopt her niece when a surprise visitor shows up
