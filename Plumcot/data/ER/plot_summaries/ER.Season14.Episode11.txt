Dr. Pratt applies for the job of ER Chief and gets turned down. This causes him to give 2 weeks notice. A female soldier, home 2 weeks from Iraq, is 2 months pregnant and her husband demands an explanation. Neela's cousin has arrived from London for an extended visit and gets pursued by both Dr. Morris and Harold Zelinsky. After 9 years absence, a fall in gym by her son brings Jeanie Boulet back to the ER. Not only is she troubled because of her son, but the disorientation of knowing virtually no one on the current staff does not help.
Jeanie Boulet returns to the ER when her young son is injured at school. She is a stranger to most of the staff but several of the nurses remember her. She is now separated from her policeman husband and works full-time counseling HIV patients. Dr. Pratt has bad news for her however when he analyzes the results of her son's CT scan. Pratt is still upset at not being named interim head of the ER and with Dr. Anspaugh's assessment of his leadership skills, he considers leaving. A colleague suggests he fight on.
