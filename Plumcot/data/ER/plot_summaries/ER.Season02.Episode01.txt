While victims of a gang shootout are being brought in, Carter is late and a new group of third year medical students arrives.
The ER is busy with victims of a gang shootout while Carter is late because he's just back from a holiday and stuck in traffic. When he arrives, he can't answer Benton's medical questions, who was already annoyed with Carter because he was late. Mark has his first staff meeting, a new group of third year medical students arrives and Kerry Weaver is made the new chief resident. Meanwhile, the air conditioning doesn't work.
Carter returns to the ER to take up is surgical sub-internship under Dr. Benton. Unfortunately, he is unprepared having spent little or no time preparing and Benton informs him that this rotation will be the most difficult yet. As the new attending, Dr. Greene has to select his replacement as Chief Resident. Dr. Morgenstern dissuades him from his first choice and suggests Kerry Weaver as someone who will complement his weaknesses. A new group of students arrive and one in particular, Harper Tracy, catches Carter's eye. In addition to treating a group of gang-bangers who have been shooting each other up, Greene also treats Loretta Sweet a working girl who is struggling to raise her two kids.
