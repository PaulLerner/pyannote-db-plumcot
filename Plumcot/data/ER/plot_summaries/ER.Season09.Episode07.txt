Carter and Chen treat a frightened Chinese immigrant nanny, Tong-Yi, whom they suspect was impregnated by her employer. Meanwhile, new surgical resident Paul Nathan, who is struggling to overcome a physical disability (Parkinson's disease), tries to help in the emergency room but his fellow doctors do not appreciate his advice to patients. Unable to quench his sexual appetite, Kovac also gets into trouble in his professional life, despite his admirable resolve to find an eye specialist to treat a young gunshot victim. Gallant and fellow medical student Erin Harkins engage in an escalating competition of medical knowledge. And Weaver gets some much-needed good news.

Afterwards, she informs Nathan that at his current rate, he will not get a positive evaluation. Drs. Carter and Chen treat a nanny who has been impregnated by her employer but has a special reason for not leaving her employment. Dr. Kovac returns to work after his suspension. Dr. Lewis is having a bad run having lost several patients.
