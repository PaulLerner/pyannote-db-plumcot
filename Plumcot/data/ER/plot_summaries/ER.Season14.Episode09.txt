Dr Wexlar is made interim ER chief while staff deals with an industrial accident that leads to a hate crime.
A white man is brought to the ER after having caught his arm in a machine at work. Also brought in is a Hispanic cleaning woman with minor injuries she received trying to save the man. But the man's son is so angry that he looks to her as an object of blame. Meanwhile Dr. Wexlar is made ER chief, to the dismay of Pratt, and Abby continues to drink in secret and vent about Luca's absence for the previous few months.
