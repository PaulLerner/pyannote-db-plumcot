On Neela's last day at County, she has doubts as to whether she is making the right decision.
On her last day, as she stands before the wall with ex-ER staff's name tags on it, Neela thinks back to when she first began at County and how she progressed. The gang throws her a party, and Frank tries to make up for years of racial stereotypical jokes at her expense. As she waits at the airport, Simon shows up to clear the air between them and thank her for helping him make the first step toward facing his past. Meanwhile Archie realizes Claudia's job is no more dangerous than his.
