The Last One Before Christmas Break. The one in which Frank and Drs. Sanchez and Wade accidentally get brownies with cannabis in it. The one with the Christmas party. Archie's cousin brings Archie's deceased father's storage container to the ER bay. An injured pregnant Latino woman is brought in. There is something wrong with her baby?. Plus, the Immigration Office wants to deport her.
Alex remains in hospital after the accident, and the doctors have trouble extubating him. Sam realizes she'll have trouble trusting Tony again. Jerry returns to the ER looking for a job and also finds time to help Archie get rid of a container full of his late father's belongings. A Latino woman giving birth in the ER turns out to be on the run from immigration services, and Neela is conflicted about her obligations as a doctor. Several staff members are incapacitated after eating cannabis brownies. And, oh yeah, there's also a Christmas party.
