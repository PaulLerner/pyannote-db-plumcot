Benton tries to save someone who, according to the other surgeons, can't be saved while the ER gets crammed with pregnant women.
Benton feels he's not taken seriously ever since the Vucelich debacle and when a man who jumped in front of the metro after a bad Valentine's day comes in, he does everything he can to save him - even though all the other surgeons agree it's a hopeless case. Carter has an important interview, Doug goes to see his father and Jerry tries to convince everybody basketball player Scottie Pippen visited the ER. And while pregnant Conni is past her due date, eight women from the maternity ward come down to the ER because the sprinklers on that ward have burst.
