Mark has to deal with the fact he can't see Rachel during the holidays and takes care of a Holocaust survivor whose grandchild is missing.
Carol tries to get the ER staff to sing for another ward of the hospital but nobody wants to. Mark is angry with Jennifer for staying in Dayton with Rachel during Christmas and takes care of a Holocaust survivor whose car has been stolen while her grandchild was in it. Weaver gets a visit from a close friend and Benton and Carter get in Vucelich's good book when Carter convinces Jules 'Ruby' Rubadoux to let his wife undergo a new surgery technique Vucelich is studying and experiment with.
It's proving to be a less than happy Christmas-time for Mark Greene who has to give his deposition in the lawsuit against him in the death of Jodi O'Brien (see episode 1.19) and he learns that his daughter may not be able to join him as planned. Greene also treats an elderly victim of a carjacking who tells them her infant granddaughter was in the car with her. Carol Hathaway is appalled at the lack of Christmas spirit and takes inspiration from a very familiar man who injured himself making toys. Carter is enjoying his surgical sub-internship, but his interest in the patients, as opposed to the surgical procedure, seems to be at odds with the approach of his colleagues.
