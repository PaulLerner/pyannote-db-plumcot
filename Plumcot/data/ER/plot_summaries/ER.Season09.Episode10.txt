Dr. Kovac's speeding causes a crash on an icy road. The ER staff treats angry elves and a female hockey player with a head injury.
Dr. Kovac has a particularly bad shift on what was supposed to be his day off. It starts with a party at Susan's house where he drinks too much and ends up leaving with medical student Erin Harkins. After only a few hours sleep, he's called in to work. There, he makes a series of critical errors that leads to the mis-diagnosis of a young man, with catastrophic consequences. At the end of his shift, he gets into a serious car accident injuring Harkins. Elsewhere Frank and Jerry argue over who should be playing Santa and the team has to treat angry elves.
