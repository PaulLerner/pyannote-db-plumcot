Ross and Greene travel to a near-deserted stretch of California to investigate circumstances surrounding a death in Doug's family.
Accompanied by Mark Greene, Doug Ross travels to California after being informed that his father has died. He learns that his drunken father ran a stop sign killing not only himself but the female occupant of his own vehicle as well the man in the other vehicle, a hard working family man who leaves behind a widow and several children. All of Doug's unhappy childhood memories come flooding back as he learns of his father's last days. A surprise visitor lifts his spirits, however. When he learns that Mark's parents live only a few hours away in San Diego he insists that they visit. Mark's relationship with his own father, a retired US Navy Captain, is strained and distant.
