Mark has to work for the fourth night in a row while a lot of the staff are absent and the number of patients is towering.
Weaver asks Mark to do a night shift. It's his fourth in a row and he's very unhappy about it. To make things worse, Doug has a whiplash and can't work, Susan has an appointment with her lawyer and Weaver has other business to attend to. Meanwhile, traumas keep coming in and the waiting room is getting more and more crammed with people.
Mark Greene finds himself the only attending physician during a very busy night shift in the ER. He wants to close the hospital to trauma cases but Dr. Morgenstern refuses, concerned that County officials are looking for any reason to close them down. No matter how hard they work, the team seems unable to make any headway, so Greene takes drastic action to clear the waiting room. John Carter is also working the ER night shift, his penance for having celebrated his placement while still on duty. Greene and Peter Benton continue to clash. Dr. Susan Lewis fires her lawyer after he suggests that her sister Chloe may have a case in her attempt to regain custody of baby Susie. Doug Ross is out of commission, suffering from whiplash as a result of a car accident.
