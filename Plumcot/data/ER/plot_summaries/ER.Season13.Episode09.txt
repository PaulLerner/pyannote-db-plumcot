Thanksgiving at County is quiet, with the normal number of routine (or nearly so) emergencies. But Abby makes up for the lack of excitement while returning to the hospital as the doctor on a helicopter transport.
It's Thanksgiving in the ER but all is far from being quiet. Abby is forced to respond to a bus crash accident on the side of a ravine and risks her life to save a mother trapped inside. Meanwhile, Neela accepts Gates' offer to spend the holiday together, while Sam brings her son Alex to volunteer at the hospital, and Pratt seeks Weaver's advice about his half-brother's sexual secret.
