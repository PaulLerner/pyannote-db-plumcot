Mark Greene's wife Jen gets a position clerking with a Federal judge. Unfortunately, it's in Milwaukee, 2 hours away and she wants Mark to look for a job there. Greene and Susan Lewis treat Samuel Gasner, a man who has been waiting for a heart transplant and who will not survive the night unless a donor can be found. John Carter is worried that his latest paramour may have left him with a souvenir of their sexual encounter. Doug Ross treats a young girl suffering from severe asthma but whose mother can't afford her medication. Benton treats Ivan the liquor store owner who is shot for the third time in as many weeks.
Ross and Carter are woken up at 16:00 to continue their long-haul shift. Dr. Green's wife Jennifer has found a job in Milwaukee, and Carter feels the memory of the girl with the interesting rash. While the night drags on they have to deal with a premature baby and a man with a weak heart who will probably not see the light of day.
