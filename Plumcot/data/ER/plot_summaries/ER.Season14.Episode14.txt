Abby deals with her upcoming reunion with Luka in Croatia, a heart transplant patient is admitted when her body rejects the new heart, and a new doctor ruffles feathers.
Abby prepares to travel to Croatia to join Luka, but has deep reservations about confessing to him about her brief affair, which she confides to her AA sponsor. Meanwhile a brash new doctor butts heads with Greg when it seems he isn't interested in teaching his med students anything; and a young woman who recently had a heart transplant is admitted and discovers her body is rejecting her new organ. In addition, Archie needs a willing subject for his taser experiment but can't seem to buy the cooperation of anyone.
