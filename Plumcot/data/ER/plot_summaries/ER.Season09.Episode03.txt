Dr. Carter leads a walk-out of staff protesting lack of security in the ER.
It's madness in the ER as they deal with an overflow of patients. Dr. Carter treats a 12 year-old hooker who is spirited away by her pimp just when he's convinced to go into a drug program. Abby's brother drops in while on his way to his new Air Force assignment. Gallant treats a woman who is an ER regular. When Dr. Pratt refuses to give a drug-addicted patient the medication he is demanding, the man returns and holds Dr. Chen at gun point until he gets what he wants. They resolve the problem of the patient and Dr. Chen is quite shaken but Dr. Carter, who had once been attacked in the ER and seriously injured, is fed up with the constant delays in installing the promised security barriers. He walks out despite the large number of patients and most of the staff join him. Several of the female staff decide to have a girls' night out and Carter is worried about Abby drinking again.
