Neela experiences alternate versions of the same day.
Neela's day is filled with three significant events: the arrival in the ER of a man who acts out his dreams, and this time jumped through a window thinking he was escaping a plane; the deterioration of a young girl who has been her patient for a while and with whom she has a special bond, and job interviews, set up by Lucien, who also tells her he wants her to stay at county. But which version of the day is the true one? The one in which both the dream runner and the girl die because decisions turn out to be wrong, the one in which both of them die even though the decisions were right (and in which Neela blows off an interview conducted by ex-ER doc Corday)? Or the one where both patients live and she is offered the job by Corday?
Neela experiences three different versions of a day depending on her actions: A girl we met in the last episode needs Neela's best judgment in deciding on the best course of action in her case. An advanced sleepwalker who crashed through a window while dreaming he was flying is brought in, and the right decision has to be made about how to diagnose and treat him. Neela has job interviews with top-class hospitals, but does Dubenko really want her to leave? Simon returns from Australia eager to reconnect with Neela.
