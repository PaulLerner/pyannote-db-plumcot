Doug saves a kid who's stuck in a flooded culvert and becomes a local hero when a TV helicopter films part of the rescue operation.
Doug accepts an offer to work in a private pediatric practice. After his last ER shift he's on his way to a fund raiser when he gets a flat tire. In the pouring rain a boy comes up to his car because his brother is stuck in a flooded culvert. Doug doesn't hesitate and does everything he possibly can to save the kid. A news TV helicopter films part of the rescue attempt and Doug becomes a local hero. Meanwhile the ER staff plays Doom II and Benton, Carter and Harper try to save a young girl who was the victim of a hit-and-run.
Having been told that his contract will not be renewed, Doug Ross reluctantly accepts an offer in a pediatric practice. Fate intervenes however when he tries to rescue a 12 year-old trapped in a culvert during a severe rainstorm. When he commandeers a news helicopter to transport the child to County General, his heroics and willingness to break the rules puts him in a new light. Harper and Carter treat a young accident victim who is more concerned that her parents have split up.
