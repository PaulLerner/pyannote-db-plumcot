Patients include a pregnant teacher whose student/lover was critically injured while driving; a man who is hiding a gunshot wound and a brilliant young boy who knows he is dying, but hides it from his mother. Dr. Moretti continues to remake the ER to his liking, Neela is recovering, Luka's absence is reinforced (back in Croatia and not coming back) and Sam may be starting a new relationship with a police officer.
Moretti continues to implement new measures that cause the doctors to dislike him. Abby treats a patient with a stomachache only to find he's hiding a bullet that detectives need. Morris and Sam treat a teacher and student who were involved in a car accident and they are shocked to discover why they were together. Pratt speaks out on his dislike for Moretti to Anspaugh and suggests himself for the Chief position. Gates befriends a precocious boy in the ICU, who is hiding a deadly illness from his mother. Meanwhile, a recovering Neela is anxious to be discharged.
