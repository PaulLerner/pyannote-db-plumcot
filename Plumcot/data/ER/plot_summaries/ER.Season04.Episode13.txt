Another elderly rape victim is brought in. So is the rapist.
The police bring in another elderly rape victim but this time they also get the rapist. The ER staff is in no mood to treat him and Anna Del Amico takes John Carter to task for not giving the man the best care and letting his emotions take over his duties as a physician. Realizing she has made a major mistake, Dr. Weaver lines up support to oppose the take over of the ER by Synergix and accuses Ellis West of using her to win the contract. Carol Hathaway is having doubts about her commitment to Doug Ross while he resents her hesitation. Cynthia Hooper suggests to Mark that with her lease coming due, she should perhaps move in with him but he is obviously reluctant. Benton and Corday go out on another date.
