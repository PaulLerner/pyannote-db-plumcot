An elderly man is brought into the ER after being mugged, and sees things as if it were the 1960s.
A usually eventful day or two at the ER includes admittance of an old man who has flashbacks of the hospital ER as it was 40 years before. His caretaker arrives and turns out to be a former ER staff member. Meanwhile a mother dying of cancer is given some tests after the old man indicates he thinks she has been mis-diagnosed. Sam's sister Kelly visits and tries to get Sam to agree to take on the care of their sick mother. A man who has lived most of his life in an iron lung needs an operation and a poor epileptic woman is brought in after shoplifting.
