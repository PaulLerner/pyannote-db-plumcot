Susan Lewis has a run-in with the cardiologist on duty, Dr. Kayson, when he disagrees with her treatment of a heart attack victim. At a case review session, she gets very little support from her colleagues. She also treats a woman who is dying of leukemia and who has good advice for Hathaway. Greene treats a woman who has obviously been beaten by her husband but can't get to agree to get help.
Nurse Hathaway plucks up the courage to go back to work after her suicide attempt and gets a warm reception. And while an unidentified singing lady keeps the staff busy, Dr. Lewis is overruled on a cardiac case. A Chinese woman with a bruised eye might be the victim of battery but refuses to speak up. The owner of the liquor store is back, as well as Carter's interesting girl.
