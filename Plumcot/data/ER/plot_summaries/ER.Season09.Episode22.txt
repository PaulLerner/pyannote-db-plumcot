John Carter arrives in the Congo to find that Luka Kovac is away at a distant clinic administering vaccinations to the local population. He also finds appalling medical conditions. Too few nurses and doctors, limited equipment and few medical supplies are par for the course. That aside, he gets s great deal of satisfaction from the work he does. He meets Gillian, a Canadian nurse, and learns that she and Luka have become close. He tries desperately to save the life of a severely wounded man which pays later dividends when their camp is invaded by rebel troops and their lives are threatened.
