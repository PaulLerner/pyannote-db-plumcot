Carter feels guilty about Gant's death. Benton doesn't want to talk about it.
John Carter can't help but wonder if he could have done something to prevent Dennis Gant's death. He is particularly exasperated at Dr. Benton's apparent indifference and his refusal to acknowledge that he may have been too hard on Gant. Carter arranges for a memorial service with Dennis Gant Sr. attending. With labor negotiations looming, all of the nurses stage a walk out leaving Nurse Manager Carol Hathaway as the only experienced ER nurse on duty. It all takes on serious overtones when Carol makes a mistake that costs a patient his life. Charlie the 14-year-old street kid is being held in the hospital for observation and asks if Doug can become her guardian. Mark Greene and nurse Chuny Marquez start seeing each other. Jeanie Boulet ends up on a date with Dr. Greg Fischer but feels she has to tell him about her HIV status.
