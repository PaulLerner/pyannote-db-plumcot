threepio Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
threepio We're doomed!
threepio There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
threepio What's that?
threepio I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
luke Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
threepio Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
threepio At last! Where have you been?
threepio They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
threepio Wait a minute, where are you going?
imperial_officer The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
vader Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
vader What have you done with those plans?
rebel officer We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
vader If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador?
vader Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
trooper There she is! Set for stun!
trooper She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
threepio Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..
Artoo beeps
threepio Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
threepio Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
threepio I'm going to regret this.
chief_pilot There goes another one.
captain Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited.
threepio That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
threepio Are you sure this things safe?
woman I've told you kids to slow down!
fixer Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
camie It was just wormie on another rampage.
luke Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
luke I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
biggs Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
luke The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
biggs Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... I just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
luke I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!
deak Not again! Forget it.
luke There they are!
biggs That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
luke But there was a lot of firing earlier...
luke Hey, easy with those...
camie Don't worry about it, Wormie.
fixer I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude.
leia Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
vader Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
leia I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
vader You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!
commander Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
vader I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
commander She'll die before she tells you anything.
vader Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
second_officer Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
vader She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time.
commander Yes, sir.
threepio How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
threepio I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
threepio What a desolate place this is.
threepio Where are you going?
threepio Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.
threepio What makes you think there are settlements over there?
threepio Don't get technical with me.
threepio What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
threepio And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
threepio No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
Artoo beeps 
threepio That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
threepio Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!
threepio Over here! Help! Please, help!
Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and the others can be heard working inside.
luke ...so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic.
biggs You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
luke Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
biggs I've missed you kid.
luke Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet.
biggs Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
luke What are you talking about?
biggs I made some friends at the Academy. ...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
luke Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
biggs Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
luke I'm sorry. I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me...
biggs My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
luke You're crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.
biggs I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in.
luke And I'm stuck here...
biggs I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
luke Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
biggs Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
luke I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
biggs I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
luke It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock.
biggs Things always change.
luke I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?
biggs No, I'm leaving in the morning...
luke Then I guess I won't see you.
biggs Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
luke Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
biggs So long, Luke.
threepio Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
first_trooper Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
SECOND_trooper Look, sir -- droids.
threepio Wake up! Wake up!
threepio We're doomed.
threepio Do you think they'll melt us down?
Artoo beep
threepio Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?
beru Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
luke It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
owen I have no need for a protocol droid.
threepio Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
owen What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
threepio Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
owen Do you speak Bocce?
threepio Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce...
owen All right shut up! I'll take this one.
threepio Shutting up, sir.
owen Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
luke But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
owen You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!
luke All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.
luke Uncle Owen...
owen Yeah?
luke This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
owen Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
threepio Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
luke Uncle Owen...
owen Yeah?
luke What about that one?
owen What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
luke Yeah, take it away.
threepio Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.
luke Okay, let's go.
threepio Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
threepio Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
luke It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
threepio Is there anything I might do to help?
luke Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
threepio I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
luke Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
threepio I see, sir.
luke Uh, you can call me Luke.
threepio I see, sir Luke.
luke Just Luke.
threepio And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
luke Hello.
Artoo beeps 
luke You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
threepio With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
luke You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
threepio That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
luke Have you been in many battles?
threepio Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
luke Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
luke What's this?
threepio What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that?
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
threepio Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
luke Who is she? She's beautiful.
threepio I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
threepio I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...
luke Is there more to this recording?
threepio Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
threepio He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
luke Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
threepio I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
luke Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
luke I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
threepio He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
luke H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
luke There you go.
luke Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
threepio What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
aunt_beru Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
luke All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
threepio I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
luke Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.
threepio Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
threepio No, I don't think he likes you at all.
Artoo beeps.
threepio No, I don't like you either.
luke You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
owen What makes you think that?
luke Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
owen That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
luke But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
owen He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
luke He knew my father?
owen I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
luke Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
owen You mean the next semester before harvest?
luke Sure, there're more than enough droids.
owen Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.
owen You must understand I need you here, Luke.
luke But it's a whole 'nother year.
owen Look, it's only one more season.
luke Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
aunt_beru Where are you going?
luke It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
aunt_beru Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.
owen I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
aunt_beru Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
owen That's what I'm afraid of.
luke What are you doing hiding there?
threepio It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
luke Oh, no!
threepio That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.
luke How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!
threepio Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
luke It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning.
owen Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
luke All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.
luke You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
threepio Oh, he excels at that, sir.
owen Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!
owen Have you seen Luke this morning?
aunt_beru He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
owen Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?
aunt_beru I think so.
owen Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!
luke How's that.
luke Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
threepio Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
luke Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
threepio Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
luke Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
luke Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
threepio Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
luke Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
threepio If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
luke No, he's not going to try anything.
luke What's wrong with him now?
threepio Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
luke Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.
luke There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.
ben Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.
ben Don't worry, he'll be all right.
luke What happened?
ben Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
luke Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
ben The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
luke Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
ben Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
luke I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
ben Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.
luke You know him!
ben Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
luke Then the droid does belong to you.
ben Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...
ben I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
luke Threepio!
threepio Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
luke Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
threepio I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
luke No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?
Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.
ben Quickly, son... they're on the move.
luke No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
ben That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
luke You fought in the Clone Wars?
ben Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
luke I wish I'd known him.
ben He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...
ben I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
threepio Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
luke Sure, go ahead.
luke What is it?
ben Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
ben An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.
Luke hasn't really been listening.
luke How did my father die?
ben A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
luke The Force?
ben Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
ben Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.
luke I saw part of the message he was...
ben I seem to have found it.
leia General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
ben You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
luke Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
ben I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
luke I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
ben That's your uncle talking.
luke Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
ben Learn about the Force, Luke.
luke Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
ben You must do what you feel is right, of course.
tagge Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.
motti Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
tagge The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
tarkin The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
tagge That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
tarkin The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
tagge And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
vader The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
motti Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!
vader Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
motti Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
vader I find your lack of faith disturbing.
tarkin Enough of this! Vader, release him!
vader As you wish.
tarkin This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
luke It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
ben They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
luke These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
ben And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
luke Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
luke If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!
ben Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.
luke Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
vader And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
ben There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.
luke I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
ben Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
trooper How long have you had these droids?
luke About three or four seasons.
ben They're for sale if you want them.
trooper Let me see your identification.
ben You don't need to see his identification.
trooper We don't need to see his identification.
ben These are not the droids your looking for.
trooper These are not the droids we're looking for.
ben He can go about his business.
trooper You can go about your business.
ben Move along.
trooper Move along. Move along.
threepio I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
luke Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.
ben The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.
luke Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
ben Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.
luke I'm ready for anything.
threepio Come along, Artoo.
bartender We don't serve their kind here!
Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift.
luke What?
bartender Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.
luke Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble.
threepio I heartily agree with you sir.
creature Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
human He doesn't like you.
luke I'm sorry.
human I don't like you either.
human Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems.
luke I'll be careful than.
human You'll be dead.
ben This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...
bartender No blasters! No blaster!
ben This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
threepio I don't like the look of this.
han Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
ben Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.
han Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
ben Should I have?
han It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
han I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?
ben Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
han What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
ben Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
han Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
luke Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
han But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
luke You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...
ben We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
han Seventeen, huh!
han Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
ben Ninety-four.
han Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. The bartender points to the booth.
trooper All right, we'll check it out.
han Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.
ben You'll have to sell your speeder.
luke That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.
greedo Going somewhere, Solo?
han Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
greedo It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.
han Yeah, but this time I got the money.
greedo If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
han I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
greedo Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
han Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
greedo You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
han Over my dead body.
greedo That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
han Yes, I'll bet you have.
han Sorry about the mess.
vader Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
imperial_officer The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?
tarkin Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
vader What do you mean?
tarkin I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.
trooper With pleasure.
threepio Lock the door, Artoo.
trooper All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door.
threepio I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
Artoo beeps
threepio You watch your language!
luke He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand.
ben It will be enough.
ben If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth.
jabba Come on out, Solo!
han I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
jabba I expected you would be.
han I'm not the type to run.
jabba Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.
han You sent Greedo to blast me.
jabba Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you.
han I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
jabba Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business.
han You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.
jabba Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
han Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.
luke What a piece of junk.
han She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself.
han We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
threepio Hello, sir.
trooper Which way?
trooper All right, men. Load your weapons!
trooper Stop that ship!
Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship.
trooper Blast 'em!
threepio Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
han It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
han Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
luke Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.
han Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
han Here's where the fun begins!
ben How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
han It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
luke Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...
han Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
luke What's that flashing?
han We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
motti We've entered the Alderaan system.
leia Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
tarkin Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
leia I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
tarkin Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
leia The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
tarkin Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
leia No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
tarkin You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
tarkin I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?
leia Dantooine.
leia They're on Dantooine.
tarkin There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
leia What?
tarkin You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
leia No!
vader Commence primary ignition.
luke Are you all right? What's wrong?
ben I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
ben You'd better get on with your exercises.
Han Solo enters the room.
han Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.
han Don't everyone thank me at once.
han Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
threepio Now be careful, Artoo.
threepio He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.
han Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
threepio But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
han That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
threepio I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.
ben Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
luke You mean it controls your actions?
ben Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
han Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
luke You don't believe in the Force, do you?
han Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
han It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
ben I suggest you try it again, Luke.
ben This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
luke With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?
ben Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
ben Stretch out with your feelings.
ben You see, you can do it.
han I call it luck.
ben In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
han Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else.
han Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
luke You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
ben That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.
tarkin Yes.
officer_cass Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
tarkin She lied! She lied to us!
vader I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
tarkin Terminate her... immediately!
han Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.
han What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.
luke What's going on?
han Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
luke What do you mean? Where is it?
han Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.
luke What? How?
ben Destroyed... by the Empire!
han The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
han There's another ship coming in.
luke Maybe they know what happened.
ben It's an Imperial fighter.
luke It followed us!
ben No. It's a short range fighter.
han There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?
luke It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
han Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions.
ben It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
han Not for long...
ben A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
luke It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
han Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
luke Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.
han I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
ben That's no moon! It's a space station.
han It's too big to be a space station.
luke I have a very bad feeling about this.
han Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
luke Why are we still moving towards it?
han We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
luke But there's gotta be something you can do!
han There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!
ben You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.
voice_over_death_star_intercom Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field.
officer To you stations! Come with me.
officer Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields!
tarkin Yes.
voice We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
vader They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.
Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.
voice Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
officer There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
vader Did you find any droids?
officer No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
vader Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
officer Yes, sir.
vader I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
officer Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!
luke Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
han I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
ben Leave that to me!
han Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
ben Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
trooper The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go.
han'S_voice Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
GANTRY_officer TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
GANTRY_officer Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.
luke You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
han Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
threepio We found the computer outlet, sir.
ben Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
threepio He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
threepio The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
ben I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
han Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.
luke I want to go with you.
ben Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
luke But he can...
ben They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you... always!
han Boy you said it, Chewie.
han Where did you dig up that old fossil?
luke Ben is a great man.
han Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
luke I didn't hear you give any ideas...
han Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...
luke Who do you think...
luke What is it?
threepio I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here."
luke Well, who... who has he found?
threepio Princess Leia.
luke The princess? She's here?
han Princess? What's going on?
threepio Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
luke Oh, no! We've got to do something.
han What are you talking about?
luke The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her.
han Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.
luke But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
han I'm not going anywhere.
luke They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.
han Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
luke But they're going to kill her!
han Better her than me...
luke She's rich.
Chewbacca growls.
han Rich?
luke Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
han What?
luke Well more wealth that you can imagine.
han I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
luke You'll get it!
han I better!
luke You will...
han All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.
luke All right.
han What's your plan?
luke Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
luke Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.
Chewie growls
luke Okay. Han, you put these on.
Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
han Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
threepio Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
luke Lock the door!
han And hope they don't have blasters.
threepio That isn't very reassuring.
Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.
Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance.
luke I can't see a thing in this helmet.
han This is not going to work.
luke Why didn't you say so before?
han I did say so before!
officer Where are you taking this... thing?
Chewie growls 
luke Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.
officer I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.
han Look out! He's loose!
luke He's going to pull us all apart.
han Go get him!
han We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here.
han Everything is under control. Situation normal.
INTERCOM_voice What happened?
han Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?
INTERCOM_voice We're sending a squad up.
han Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.
INTERCOM_voice Who is this? What's your operating number?
han Boring conversation anyway.
han Luke! We're going to have company!
leia Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?
luke What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.
leia You're who?
luke I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
leia Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
luke Come on!
vader He is here...
tarkin Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?
vader A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
tarkin Surely he must be dead by now.
vader Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
tarkin The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
tarkin Yes.
INTERCOM_voice Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three.
tarkin The princess! Put all sections on alert!
vader Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
tarkin If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
vader Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.
han Chewie!
Chewbacca growls
han Get behind me! Get behind me!
han Can't get out that way.
leia Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
han Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
luke See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
threepio Yes sir?
luke We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy!
threepio I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted.
trooper voice Open up in there!
threepio Oh, no!
Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.
luke There isn't any other way out.
han I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
leia This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
han He's the brains, sweetheart.
luke Well, I didn't...
han What the hell are you doing?
leia Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
han Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it.
han Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!
han Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...
luke No! wait!
luke Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!
leia Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.
han Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
leia It could be worse...
han It's worse.
luke There's something alive in here!
han That's your imagination.
luke Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?
han What?
luke Help!
han Luke! Luke! Luke!
leia Luke!
leia Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
luke Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.
han Where?
luke Anywhere! Oh!!
han Luke! Luke!
leia Grab him!
leia What happened?
luke I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
han I've got a very bad feeling about this.
luke The walls are moving!
leia Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something.
luke Wait a minute!
luke Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?
first_trooper Take over!
See to him! Look there!
threepio They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST_officer Follow me! You stand guard.
threepio Come on!
threepio Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
trooper All right.
luke Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
han Get to the top!
leia I can't
luke Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?
threepio They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured.
threepio Hurry!
han One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!
leia I'm trying!
threepio Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be?
Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
threepio Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!
threepio Are you there, sir?
luke Threepio!
threepio We've had some problems...
luke Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?
luke Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
threepio No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
threepio Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!
luke Threepio, we're all right!
luke We're all right. You did great.
luke Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?
han Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
han If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
luke Well, let's get moving!
han Where are you going?
leia No, wait. They'll hear!
han Come here, you big coward!
han Chewie! Come here!
leia Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?
han Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me!
leia It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
han No reward is worth this.
officer Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
first_trooper Give me regular reports.
All but two of the stormtroopers leave.
first_trooper Do you know what's going on?
SECOND_trooper Maybe it's another drill.
SECOND_trooper What was that?
first_trooper Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
han There she is.
luke See-Threepio, do you copy?
threepio For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
luke We're right above you. Stand by.
leia You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.
han Nice! Come on!
first_trooper It's them! Blast them!
han Get back to the ship!
luke Where are you going? Come back!
leia He certainly has courage.
luke What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!
luke I think we took a wrong turn.
leia There's no lock!
luke That oughta hold it for a while.
leia Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
luke Oh, I think I just blasted it.
leia They're coming through!
luke Here, hold this.
leia Here they come!
leia For luck!
threepio Where could they be?
Artoo beeps
trooper Close the blast doors!
trooper Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
vader I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete.
vader When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
ben Only a master of evil, Darth.
vader Your powers are weak, old man.
ben You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
han Didn't we just leave this party?
Chewbacca growls 
han What kept you?
leia We ran into some old friends.
luke Is the ship all right?
han Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group's vantage point.
luke Look!
Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's Imperial docking bay.
threepio Come on, Artoo, we're going!
han Now's our chance! Go!
luke No!
han Come on!
leia Come on! Luke, its too late!
han Blast the door! Kid!
ben's_voice Run, Luke! Run!
han I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!
Chewbacca growls 
han We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
luke I can't believe he's gone.
leia There wasn't anything you could have done.
han Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
han You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!
Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as the ship bounces slightly.
Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as Han reaches for controls.
leia Here they come!
luke They're coming in too fast!
Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft.
threepio Oooh!
leia We've lost lateral controls.
han Don't worry, she'll hold together.
han You hear me, baby? Hold together!
luke Got him! I got him!
han Great kid! Don't get cocky.
leia There are still two more of them out there!
luke That's it! We did it!
leia We did it!
threepio Help! I think I'm melting!
tarkin Are they away?
vader They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
tarkin You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.
han Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
leia That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
han Easy... you call that easy?
leia Their tracking us!
han Not this ship, sister.
leia At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
han What's so important? What's he carrying?
leia The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!
han It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!
leia You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!
leia Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
luke I care!
luke So... what do you think of her, Han?
han I'm trying not to, kid!
luke Good...
han Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
luke No!
Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder.
willard You're safe! We had feared the worst.
willard When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
leia We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here.
tarkin Yes.
DEATH_STAR_INTERCOM_voice We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.
dodonna The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
gold_leader Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
dodonna Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
dodonna The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
dodonna Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
wedge That's impossible, even for a computer.
luke It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.
dodonna Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
DEATH_STAR_INTERCOM_voice Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
vader This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
MAN'S_voice All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
luke So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
han That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you.
luke Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
han What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide.
luke All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
han Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!
han What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.
leia What's wrong?
luke Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
leia He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
luke I only wish Ben were here.
biggs Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
luke Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
red_leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born leader.
red_leader Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
biggs Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
red_leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter.
red_leader I met your father once when I was just a boy, he was a great pilot. You'll do all right. If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
luke Thank you, sir. I'll try.
red_leader hurries to his own ship.
biggs I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?
luke I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
biggs You did, all right. It's going to be like old times, Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!
chief This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?
luke Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
chief Okay, easy she goes!
threepio Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back.
Artoo beeps
threepio You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
All final preparations are made for the approaching battle. The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.
ben's_voice Luke, the Force will be with you.
MASSASSI_INTERCOM_voice Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.
red_leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights, looking to each side at his wing men.

red_leader Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field.
red_leader Switch your deflectors on. Double front!
wedge Look at the size of that thing!
red_leader Cut the chatter, Red Two.
red_leader I copy, gold_leader.
gold_leader We're starting for the target shaft now.
red_leader We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.
leia listens to the battle over the intercom. Threepio is at her side.
wedge Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.
red_leader I see it. Stay low.
luke This is Red Five; I'm going in!
biggs Luke, pull up!
luke I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
ASTRO-officer We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
vader We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.
red_leader Luke, let me know when you're going in.
luke I'm on my way in now...
red_leader Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
luke I'm on it.
leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working over a screen speaks into his headset.
CONTROL_officer Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.
luke My scope's negative. I don't see anything.
red_leader Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.
biggs I can't see it! Where is he?!
Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying to avoid him.
biggs He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.
luke Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.
luke Got him!
vader Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me!
biggs Pull in! Luke... pull in!
wedge Watch your back, Luke!
wedge Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!
luke I'm hit, but not bad.
luke'S voice Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there.
Green laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his head turns.
Luke nervously works his controls.
red_leader Red Six...
red_leader Can you see Red Five?
red_ten There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?
luke I can't shake him!
wedge I'm on him, Luke!
wedge Hold on!
luke Blast it! Wedge where are you?
luke Thanks, Wedge.
biggs Good shooting, Wedge!
gold_leader Red Leader...
gold_leader This is gold_leader. We're starting out attack run.
red_leader I copy, gold_leader. Move into position.
vader Stay in attack formation!
gold_leader The exhaust post is...
gold_leader ...marked and locked in!
gold_five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is buffeted by Imperial flak.
gold_leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to bounce about.
gold_leader Switch power to front deflector screens.
gold_leader How many guns do you think, Gold Five.
gold_five I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers.
MASSASSI_INTERCOM_voice Death Star will be in range in five minutes.
gold_leader pulls his computer targeting device down in front of his eye. Laserbolts continue to batter the Rebel craft.
gold_leader Switching to targeting computer.
gold_two Computer's locked. Getting a signal.
gold_two The guns... they've stopped!
gold_five Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
gold_leader They've coming in! Three marks at two ten.
vader I'll take them myself! Cover me!
wingMAN'S_voice Yes, sir.
gold_leader looks over his shoulder at the scene.
gold_leader panics.
gold_leader I can't maneuver!
gold_five, the old veteran, trys to calm gold_leader.
gold_five Stay on target.
gold_leader We're too close.
gold_five Stay on target!
gold_leader Loosen up!
gold_leader's ship is hit by Vader's laser.
gold_five moves in on the exhaust port.
gold_five Gold Five to Red Leader...
gold_five Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.
gold_five They came from behind...
officer We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?
tarkin Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!
voice Rebel base, three minutes and closing.
red_leader Red Group, this is Red Leader.
red_leader Rendezvous at mark six point one.
wedge This is Red Two. Flying toward you.
biggs Red Three, standing by.
red_leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run.
red_leader'S voice Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal... to start your run.
red_leader This is it!
red_ten We should be able to see it by now.
red_ten'S voice Red Five, can you see them from where you are?
luke No sign of any... wait!
luke Coming in point three five.
red_ten I see them.
red_leader I'm in range.
red_leader Just hold them off for a few seconds.
vader Close up formation.
red_ten You'd better let her loose.
red_leader Almost there!
red_ten I can't hold them!
red_nine'S voice
red It's a hit!
red_leader Negative.
red_leader Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface.
red_leader, we're right above you. Turn to point...
luke ...oh-five; we'll cover for you.
red_leader Stay there...
red_leader ...I just lost my starboard engine.
red_leader Get set to make your attack run.
DEATH_STAR_INTERCOM_voice Rebel base, one minute and closing.
luke Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle.
wedge Right with you, boss.
luke It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
biggs We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
wedge My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it?
luke Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle!
wedge What about the tower?
luke You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower!
luke Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down!
Leia and the others are grouped around the computer board.
wedge I'm hit! I can't stay with you.
luke Get clear, Wedge.
luke You can't do any more good back there!
vader Let him go! Stay on the leader!
biggs Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them!
luke Artoo, try and increase the power!
biggs Hurry up, Luke!
biggs Wait!
DEATH_STAR_INTERCOM_voice Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.
vader I'm on the leader.
threepio Hang on, Artoo!
ben's_voice Use the Force, Luke.
ben's_voice Let go, Luke.
ben's_voice Luke, trust me.
BASE_voice His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong?
luke Nothing. I'm all right.
Artoo beeps
luke I've lost Artoo!
MASSASSI_INTERCOM_voice The Death Star has cleared the planet. The Death Star has cleared the planet.
DEATH_STAR_INTERCOM_voice Rebel base, in range.

DEATH_STAR_INTERCOM_voice Commence primary ignition.
vader I have you now.
vader What?
Han and Chewbacca grin from ear to ear.
han Yahoo!
wingman Look out!
han You're all clear, kid.
Leia and the others listen to Solo's transmission.
han Now let's blow this thing and go home!
INTERCOM_voice Stand by to fire at Rebel base.
INTERCOM_voice Standing by.
han Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.
ben's_voice Remember, the Force will be with you... always.
leia Luke! Luke! Luke!
han Hey! Hey!
luke I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!
han Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
leia Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
luke Oh, no!
threepio Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
technician We'll get to work on him right away.
threepio You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
luke He'll be all right.
