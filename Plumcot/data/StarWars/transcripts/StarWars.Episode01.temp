qui-gon Captain.
captain Yes, sir?
qui-gon Tell them we wish to board at once.
captain Yes, sir.
captain With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
nute Yes, yes, of course. As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.
pk-4 They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them.
tc-14 I'm tc-14 at your service. This way, please.
eg-9 A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?
pr-4 I'm not made to think.
tc-14 I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master will be with you shortly.
obi-wan I have a bad feeling about this.
qui-gon I don't sense anything.
obi-wan It's not about the mission, Master, it's something... elsewhere... elusive.
qui-gon Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs.
obi-wan But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
qui-gon ...but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.
obi-wan Yes, Master... how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?
qui-gon These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.
nute What?!? What did you say?
tc-14 The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
dofine I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me, we're done for!
nute Stay calm! I'll wager the Senate isn't aware of the Supreme Chancellor's moves here. Go. Distract them until I can contact Lord Sidious.
dofine Are you brain dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi! Send the droid. dofine turns to tc-14, who lets out a squeaky sigh. INTERIOR FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM. qui-gon and obi-wan sit at the large conference table.
obi-wan Is it their nature to make us wait this long?
qui-gon No... I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.
dofine ...This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished! We dare not go against these Jedi.
darth-sidious You seem more worried about the Jedi than you are of me, Dofine. I am amused.
nute Yes, My Lord.
darth-sidious Viceroy. I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again... 
darth-sidious This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans, Viceroy. Begin landing your troops.
nute Ahhh, My Lord, is that...legal?
darth-sidious I will make it legal.
nute And the...Jedi??
darth-sidious The Chancellor should never have brought them in to this. Kill them, immediately.
nute Yes...yes, My Lord. As you wish.
pilot Captain!? Look!!
captain No! Warn...
tc-14 Ahhh...Sorry sir. The Viceroy...
qui-gon Gas! qui-gon and obi-wan each take a sudden deep breath and hold it. The exotic bird-like creatures in the cage drop dead. INTERIOR FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY. A hologram of nute, surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference room hallway.
nute They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.
tc-14 Oh, excuse me, so sorry.
owo-1 Not sure exactly what...
nute What in blazes is going on down there?
rune Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
nute Well, not exactly, but I don't... Seal off the bridge.
rune That won't be enough, sir.
nute I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
rune We will not survive this.
nute Close the blast doors!!!
rune ...They're still coming through!
nute Impossible!! This is impossible!!
rune Where are those destroyer droids?! INTERIOR FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE. Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their battle configuration. qui-gon can't see them but senses their presence.
qui-gon Destroyer droids!
obi-wan Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.
p-59 Switch to bio...There they are!
obi-wan They have shield generators!
qui-gon It's a standoff! Let's go!
rune We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer droids.
tey how Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.
qui-gon Battle droids.
obi-wan It's an invisible army.
qui-gon It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.
obi-wan You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short.
tey how Sir, a transmission from the planet.
rune It's Queen Amidala herself.
nute At last we're getting results.  Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is pleased.
amidala You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy... Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.
nute I was not aware of such a failure.
amidala I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours.
nute I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
amidala Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have been commanded to reach a settlement.
nute I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.
amidala Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
nute Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much.
amidala We will see.
rune She's right, the Senate will never....
nute It's too late now.
rune Do you think she suspects an attack?
nute I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.
palpatine ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor... his Ambassadors did arrive. It must be the... get... negotiate...
amidala Senator Palpatine?!? What's happening?
capt-panaka Check the transmission generators...
bibble A malfunction?
capt-panaka It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
bibble A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
amidala Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not dare go that far.
capt-panaka The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.
amidala We must continue to rely on negotiation.
bibble Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend ourselves.
capt-panaka This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
amidala I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war. EXTERIOR SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT  Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo. EXTERIOR NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT. Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation warships land in the eerie swamp. obi-wan's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist. obi-wan takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy swamp. Troop Transports emerge from the landing craft. EXTERIOR NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT . The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain. OOM 9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the rolling hills. A small hologram of rune and nute stands on the tank.
rune ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one of your landing craft.
oom-9 If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of the swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.
nute Excellent. EXTERIOR NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT. qui-gon runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run past him in a panic. An odd, frog-like Gungan, jar jar INKS, squats holding a clam he has retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. jar jar's greta tongue snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp. jar jar looks up and sees qui-gon and the other creatures running like the wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a charging locomotive. jar jar stands transfixed, still holding the clam shell in one hand.
jar jar Oh, noooooooooo!  Hey, help me! Help me!!
qui-gon Let go!
jar jar Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!
qui-gon Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
jar jar I spake.
qui-gon The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta here.
jar jar No...no! Mesa stay... Mesa yous humble servaunt.
qui-gon That wont be necessary.
jar jar Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa culled Jaja Binkss.
qui-gon I have no time for this now...
jar jar Say what?  Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....
qui-gon Stay down!
jar jar ...dieeee!
obi-wan Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.
qui-gon You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?  It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I hope you've learned, my young Padawan.
obi-wan Yes, Master.
jar jar Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
obi-wan What's this?
qui-gon A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.
jar jar Mure? Mure did you spake??!?  Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.
qui-gon A city! Can you take us there?
jar jar Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.
qui-gon No??!
jar jar Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my goen back dare.
qui-gon You hear that.  That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way...
obi-wan When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
jar jar Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!
qui-gon Much farther?
jar jar Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?  My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't expict a wern welcome.
obi-wan Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes. jar jar jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the water. Breath masks on, qui-gon and obi-wan wade in after him. EXTERIOR NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER. qui-gon and obi-wan swim behind jar jar, who is very much at home in the water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct. They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. jar jar swims magically through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. obi-wan and qui-gon follow. INTERIOR OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE. GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The GUARDS, led by captain TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping trio.
jar jar Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!
capt-tarpals Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big dudu this time.
jar jar How wude. INTERIOR OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM. The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. obi-wan and QUI- GON stand facing boss nass, who sits on a bench higher than the others.
boss nass Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new weesong!
qui-gon That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
boss nass Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big.
obi-wan After those droids take control of the surface, they will come here and take control of you.
boss nass No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of uss-en.

boss nass Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no caren about da Naboo.
qui-gon Then speed us on our way.

obi-wan Master, whats a bongo?
qui-gon A transport, I hope.
jar jar Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
qui-gon Thank you, my friend.
jar jar Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.
obi-wan We are short of time, Master.
qui-gon We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This Gungan may be of help.  What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
boss nass Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be pune-ished.
qui-gon He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will not be too severe.
boss nass Pounded unto death.
jar jar Oooooh...Ouch!
qui-gon We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. I have saved Jar Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
boss nass Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?
qui-gon Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.

qui-gon Full speed ahead.
jar jar Oooops.
obi-wan Give me the controls.
jar jar Wesa free!
nute The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
darth-sidious Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to accept your control of the system.
nute The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
darth-sidious Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.
nute Thank you, My Lord.
rune You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
nute No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.
obi-wan .....we're losing power.
qui-gon Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.
jar jar What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
obi-wan Power's back.

qui-gon Relax.
obi-wan You overdid it.  This is not good!

qui-gon Head for that outcropping. EXTERIOR THEED - MAIN ROAD
nute Ah, victory!

qui-gon Get this thing started.

obi-wan What is it?

obi-wan Get up here!
jar jar No a mighty no!  Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!
obi-wan That was close.
battle droid 3b3 Drop your weapons!  I said drop your weapons.
jar jar Whoa!!!
bibble ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
nute The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by the Senate.
amidala I will not co-operate.
nute Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander. Process them.
oom-9 Yes, sir! Take them to Camp Four.
jar jar Yousa guys bombad!
qui-gon Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor.
bibble Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
qui-gon The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make contact with the republic.
capt-panaka They've knocked out all our communications.
qui-gon Do you have transports?
capt-panaka In the main hanger. This way.
capt-panaka There are too many of them.
qui-gon That won't be a problem. Your Highness, under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.
amidala Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
qui-gon They will kill you if you stay.
bibble They wouldn't dare.
capt-panaka They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
qui-gon The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
bibble Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
capt-panaka Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness. Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
bibble Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you must leave...
amidala Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
padme We are brave, Your Highness.
qui-gon If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
amidala Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. Be careful, Governor.
capt-panaka We need to free those pilots.
obi-wan I'll take care of that.
guard droid Where are you going?
qui-gon I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those people to Coruscant.
guard droid You're under arrest!
ric olie ....our communications are still jammed.
obi-wan Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.
jar jar Ello, boyos. Disa wanna longo trip...hey?  Tis opens?...Oooops!  Yoi! Just yoken!
ric olie Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.
ric olie There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive is leaking.
qui-gon We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.
obi-wan Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The Trade Federation has no presence there.
capt-panaka How can you be sure?
qui-gon It's controlled by the Hutts...
capt-panaka The Hutts??
obi-wan It's risky...but there's no alternative.
capt-panaka You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are gangsters... If they discovered her...
qui-gon ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us an advantage.
nute We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any other settlements...
darth-sidious Destroy all high-ranking officials, Viceroy...slowly...quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
nute She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade.
darth-sidious Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
nute My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
darth-sidious ...not for a Sith...  ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He will find your lost ship.
nute Yes, My Lord.  This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
rune We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi become aware of these Sith Lords?
capt-panaka ...An extremely well put together little droid. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
amidala It is to be commended...what is its number?
capt-panaka R2-D2, Your Highness.
amidala Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!  Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our gratitude... Continue, Captain.
qui-gon Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
captain PANAKA Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on this.
qui-gon You must trust my judgement, Your Highness. amidala and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID. 
jar jar Hidoe!  Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.
padme That's all right.
jar jar I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
padme Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.

obi-wan That's it. Tatooine.
ric olie There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like.
qui-gon Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.
jar jar Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!
obi-wan Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious.  The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new one.
qui-gon Don't let them send ant transmissions. Be wary...I sense a disturbance in the Force.
obi-wan I fell it also, Master. qui-gon goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and jar jar. They head to the exit ramp. 
jar jar Dis sun doen murder tada skin.
capt-panaka Wait!  Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you. She wishes for her to observe the local...
qui-gon No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant...
capt-panaka The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
padme I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself.
capt-panaka Don't make me go back and tell her you refuse.
qui-gon I don't have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay close to me.
qui-gon ...moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for those who do not wish to be found...
padme ....like us.
jar jar Dissen berry berry bad. Ooooh...icky...icky...goo.
qui-gon We'll try one of the smaller dealers.
watto Hi chuba da naga?
qui-gon I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
watto Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk? Peedenkel! Naba dee unko
qui-gon My droid here has a readout of what I need.

qui-gon Don't touch anything.
anakin Are you an angel?
padme What?
anakin An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most hardened spice pirate cry.
padme I've never heard of angels.
anakin You must be one...maybe you just don't know it.
padme You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
anakin Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto, who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
padme You're...a slave?
anakin I am a person! My name is Anakin.
padme I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. This is a strange world to me.
anakin You are a strange girl to me.  Hit the nose! jar jar hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair. 
watto ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this?
qui-gon I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
watto Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real...
qui-gon I don't have anything else. But credits will do fine.
watto No they won'ta.
qui-gon Credits will do fine.
watto No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that. 
anakin ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing things. I'm making my own droid...
qui-gon We're leaving.
padme I'm glad I met you,....ah...
anakin ...Anakin.
padme Anakin.
anakin Anakin Skywalker.
padme Padme Naberrie.
anakin I'm glad I met you too.
watto Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia.
anakin La lova num botaffa.
watto Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko.
qui-gon ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on board?
obi-wan A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe. Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking about.
qui-gon All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back.
jar jar Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un crunched.
qui-gon Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem. 
vendor Hey, that will be seven truguts!!
sebulba Chuba!!

jar jar Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
qui-gon Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble. Thank you, my young friend.
jar jar Mesa doen nutten!
anakin Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you...be less afraid.
padme And that works for you.
anakin To a point.
obi-wan This storm's going to slow them down.
capt-panaka It looks pretty bad. We'd better seal the ship.  Yes? We'll be right there.
anakin How are you feeling today, Jira?
jira The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
anakin Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for. It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I promise.
jira You're a fine boy, Annie.
anakin I'll take four pallies today. You'll like these...  Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not hungry.
jira Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd better get home quick.
anakin Do you have shelter?
qui-gon We'll hed back to our ship.
anakin Is it far?
padme On the outskirts.
anakin You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry! The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street. 
anakin Mom! Mom! I'm home.
jar jar Dissen cozy.
shmi Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?
anakin These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know any of your names.
qui-gon I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks.
padme ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
anakin I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
shmi Anakin! Why are they here?
anakin A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.
qui-gon Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
anakin Come on! Let me show you Threepio!
qui-gon I have enough food for a meal.
shmi Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll never get used to Anakin's surprises.
qui-gon He's a very special boy.
shmi Yes, I know.
anakin Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
padme He's wonderful!
anakin You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!
threepio How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you?
padme He's perfect.
anakin When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a Podracer!
threepio I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?  My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How embarrassing!
bibble ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...
obi-wan It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.
obi-wan ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent.
qui-gon It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
obi-wan What if it is true and the people are dying?
qui-gon Either way, we're running out of time.
darth-maul Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.
darth-sidious Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
darth-maul At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.
darth-sidious You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command. The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as darth sidious looks out over the city.
shmi All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
anakin I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck.
shmi Any attempt to escape...
anakin ...and they blow you up...poof!
jar jar How wude.
padme I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws...
shmi The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.
anakin Have you ever seen a Podrace?
qui-gon They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
anakin I'm the only human who can do it.  Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's never heard of a human doing it.
qui-gon You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.  Don't do that again.
anakin I...I was wondering...something...
qui-gon What?
anakin Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
qui-gon What makes you think that?
anakin I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
qui-gon Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
anakin I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
qui-gon I wish that were so...
ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves...have you come to free us?
qui-gon No, I'm afraid not...
anakin I think you have...why else would you be here?
qui-gon I can see there's no fooling you... You mustn't let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept secret.
anakin Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
padme Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.
anakin I can help! I can fix anything!
qui-gon I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we need...
jar jar Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
padme These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
shmi Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.
qui-gon Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used properly.
anakin I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
shmi Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
anakin Watto doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
shmi I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
anakin But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
jar jar Wesa ina pitty bad goo.
qui-gon Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us?
anakin We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other...
shmi Anakin, don't...
padme I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will find another way...
shmi No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but he can help you...he was meant to help you.
anakin Is that a yes? That is a yes!
padme Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve.
qui-gon The Queen does not need to know.
padme Well, I don't approve. qui-gon turns and starts into the shop. 
watto Patta go bolla!
anakin No batta!
watto Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
anakin Bayno, Bayno!
watto The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think.
qui-gon My ship will be the entry fee.
watto Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
qui-gon It's in good order, except for the parts we need.
watto ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it.
anakin Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
watto That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
qui-gon I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever built."
watto I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think.
qui-gon Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.  Either way, you win.
watto Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya.
obi-wan What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a long time.
qui-gon A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and there i
qui-gon You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward.
shmi He knows nothing of greed. He has...
qui-gon He has special powers.
shmi Yes...
qui-gon He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
shmi He deserves better than a slave's life.
qui-gon The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father?
shmi There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
qui-gon I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the way. But it's too late for him now, he's too old.
anakin Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and Wald.
kitster Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
anakin This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow!
kitster What? With this??
wald Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.)
amee You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to run.
seek Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be bug squash.
anakin Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
jar jar Who, mesa?
anakin If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.
jar jar Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho.
kitster But you don't even know if this thing will run.
anakin It will.
qui-gon I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge.
anakin Yes, sir!!
qui-gon Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
anakin There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
qui-gon Most of them.
anakin Has anyone been to them all?
qui-gon Not likely.
anakin I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!
qui-gon There, good as new...
shmi Annie, bedtime!
anakin What are you doing?
qui-gon Checking your blood for infections.
anakin I've never seen...
shmi Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
qui-gon Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. Goodnight.  Obi-Wan...
obi-wan Yes, Master.
qui-gon Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
obi-wan Wait a minute...
qui-gon I need a midi-chlorian count.
obi-wan All right. I've got it.
qui-gon What are your readings?
obi-wan Something must be wrong with the transmission.
qui-gon Here's a signal check.
obi-wan Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the reading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.
qui-gon That's it then.
obi-wan Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
qui-gon No Jedi has.
obi-wan What does it mean?
qui-gon I'm not sure.
padme I hope you're about finished.
anakin You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
padme I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and clean up. We have to leave soon.
anakin Hook 'em up, Kitster. I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?
padme He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.
watto ...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
qui-gon Patience, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set, and we'll be far away from here.
watto Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny business.
qui-gon You don't think Anakin will win?
watto Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
qui-gon Why?
watto He always wins. I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
qui-gon I'll take that bet.
watto What??!! What do you mean?
qui-gon I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his mother.
watto A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, perhaps. Just one...the mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.
qui-gon The boy is small, he can't be worth much.  For the fastest Pod ever built?!  Both, or no bet.
watto No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or nothing.
qui-gon The boy, then...
watto We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...  You won the small toss, outlander, but you won't win the race, so...it makes little difference.  Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd.
anakin What did he mean by that?
qui-gon I'll tell you later.
threepio Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.  I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!
kitster This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time, Annie.
padme Do what?
kitster Finish the race, of course!
padme You've never won a race?
anakin Well...not exactly...
padme Not even finished?!
anakin ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.
qui-gon Of course you will.
fode/beed a Toogi! Toogie! Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos azalus ooval Poddraces.

qui-gon He's fine.

qui-gon The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.
padme You assume too much.
fode/beed b Start your engines.
fode/beed a An dare ovv!
fode/beed b Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.
fode/beed b And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders today.
fode/beed b Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn.

fode/beed b He's catching Sebulba.

fode/beed b It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah
watto You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow you knew it! I lost everything.
qui-gon Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose. Bring the parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release the boy.
watto You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
qui-gon Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts...I'm sure they can settle this.
watto No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!
anakin Ah, gee...enough of this...
shmi It's so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you...
padme We owe you everything.
anakin Just feeling this good was worth it.
qui-gon Padme. Jar Jar, let's go, we've got to get these parts back to the ship.  I'll return the eopies by midday.
qui-gon Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I'm going back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.
obi-wan Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
qui-gon It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts.
qui-gon What's this?
anakin He said I cheated.
qui-gon Did you?
anakin No!
qui-gon Do you still think he cheated?
greedo Yes.
qui-gon Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his opinion, fighting won't change it.
wald Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.
qui-gon These are yours. We sold the Pod.
anakin Yes!
anakin Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!
shmi Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
qui-gon And Anakin has been freed.
anakin What?!?
qui-gon You're no longer a slave.
anakin Did you hear that, Mom? Was that part of the prize, or what?
qui-gon Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about gambling.
shmi Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
qui-gon Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident. You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.
anakin A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your starship and everything?!
qui-gon Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
anakin But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go, Mom?!
qui-gon This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it is yours alone.
anakin I want to go.
qui-gon Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
anakin Yippee!!  What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't you, Mom?
qui-gon I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.
anakin But the money from selling...
qui-gon It's not nearly enough.
shmi Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
anakin I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
shmi You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.
anakin I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...
shmi I love you, Annie...now hurry.  Thank you.
qui-gon I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
shmi He was in my life for such a short time.
anakin Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...
threepio Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although I'd like it better if I were a little less naked.
anakin I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.
threepio Sell me?!?
kitster There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You're a hero.
anakin I... I... have to go.
kitster Well.
anakin Well.
kitster Thank's for every moment you've been here. You're my best friend.
anakin I won't forget.  I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.
shmi Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase the Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?  This is one of those times when you have to do something you don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you can do this...
anakin Will I ever see you again?
shmi What does your heart tell you?
anakin I hope so...yes...I guess.
shmi Then we will see each other again.
anakin I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I promise.
shmi No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and don't look back... don't look back.
anakin I love you so much.
anakin I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.
jira Can I give you a hug?
anakin Sure.
jira I'll miss you, Annie.. there isn't a kinder boy in the galaxy. You be careful...
anakin What is it?
qui-gon Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I've seen before. Come on.
anakin Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!
qui-gon Anakin, drop!  Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go!
anakin Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
capt-panaka Who are you?
padme He's a friend.
capt-panaka Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!
ric olie I don't see anything.
obi-wan Over there! Fly low!
anakin Are you all right?
qui-gon I think so... that was a surpirse I wont soon forget.
obi-wan What was it?
qui-gon I don't know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is he was after the Queen...
anakin Do you think he'll follow us?
qui-gon We'll be safe enough once we're in hyperspace, but I have no doubt he knows our destination.
anakin What are we going to do about it?
qui-gon We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
anakin Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?
qui-gon Let's hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn't get the last laugh.
nute When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!
bibble This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.
oom-9 My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long. 
padme Are you all right?
anakin It's very cold.
padme You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is cold.
anakin You seem sad.
padme The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen.
anakin I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll ever see you again.. I made this for you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune.
padme It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always remain.
anakin I care for you too. Only I...miss...
padme ...You miss your mother.
ric olie Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is one big city.
anakin Wow! It's so huge!
palpatine It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
valorum Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position.
amidala I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.
palpatine There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it...
jar jar Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. Pitty hot!
qui-gon I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor. The situation has become more complicated. 
jar jar Dissen all pitty odd to my.
anakin Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.
palpatine ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility, only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
amidala Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
palpatine If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
amidala What options do we have?
palpatine Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
amidala He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
palpatine Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts...
amidala There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
palpatine To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.
amidala There is something I cannot do.
qui-gon ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
mace windu A Sith Lord?!?
ki-adi Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
yoda The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
mace windu I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
yoda Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must.
ki-adi I sense he will reveal himself again.
mace windu This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the Queen is the target.
yoda With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
mace windu We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
yoda May the Force be with you.  Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
qui-gon With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in the Force.
yoda A vergence, you say?
mace windu Located around a person?
qui-gon A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.
mace windu You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
qui-gon I don't pressume...
yoda But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
qui-gon I request the boy be tested.
yoda Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
qui-gon Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that. There is too much happening here...
mace windu Bring him before us, then.
yoda Tested he will be.
guard May I help you, son?
anakin I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.
guard The boy is here to see Padme.
rabe Send him in.
anakin I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
rabe I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.
amidala Who is it?
rabe Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.
amidala I've sent Padme on an errand.
anakin I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.  I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say goodbye.
amidala We will tell her for you. We're sure her heart goes with you.
anakin Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
palpatine If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty, Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
amidala I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
palpatine You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance... Your Majesty, our only, chance.
amidala You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion to a vote?
palpatine He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.
valorum The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.
palpatine Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the Trade Federation.
lott dod This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
valorum The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your station.
palpatine To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.
amidala Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force. Invaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the Trade...
lott dod I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
valorum Overruled.
lott dod Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without reasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.
aks moe The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
valorum The point...
palpatine Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.
valorum The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?
amidala I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a "vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
valorum What?...No!
mas amedda Order! We shall have order...
bail organa Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
mas amedda The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.
bail organa There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must be voted upon in this session.
lott dod The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures committee for study.
assembly Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!
palpatine You see, Your Majesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
mas amedda The Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will begin the vote.
valorum Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have betrayed me! How could you do this?
obi-wan The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know it. He is far too old.
qui-gon Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
obi-wan Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
qui-gon I will do what I must.
obi-wan Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
qui-gon You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.
anakin A ship...a cup...a speeder.
yoda Good, good, young one. How feel you?
anakin Cold, sir.
yoda Afraid are you?
anakin No, sir.
mace windu Afraid to give up your life?
anakin I don't think so.
yoda See through you, we can.
mace windu Be mindful of your feelings...
ki-adi YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.
anakin I miss her.
yoda Afraid to lose her..I think.
anakin What's that got to do with anything?
yoda Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
anakin I am not afraid!
yoda A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you.
anakin I am not afraid.
yoda Then continue, we will.
jar jar Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
amidala To motivate us, I imagine...
jar jar Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
amidala I don't know.
jar jar Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
amidala I hope not.
jar jar Gungans do die'n without a fight.... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.
capt-panaka Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
palpatine A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
amidala Who else can be nominated?
capt-panaka Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
palpatine I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
amidala I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
palpatine I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
amidala With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do here...Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
palpatine Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
amidala I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from that of our people. Captain!
capt-panaka Yes, Your Highness?
amidala Ready my ship!
capt-panaka Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.
amidala No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.
yoda ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
mace windu His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
ki-adi The Force is strong with him.
qui-gon He's to be trained, then.
mace windu No. He will not be trained.
qui-gon No??!!
mace windu He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
qui-gon He is the chosen one...you must see it.
yoda Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
qui-gon I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.
yoda An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
mace windu The code forbids it.
qui-gon Obi-Wan is ready...
obi-wan Iam ready to face the trials.
yoda Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
qui-gon Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force, but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn from me.
yoda Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has...
mace windu Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new Supreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
yoda And draw out the Queen's attacker.
ki-adi Events are moving fast...too fast.
mace windu Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.
yoda Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
qui-gon I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere else to go.
mace windu He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
yoda Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
mace windu Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war until we have the Senate's approval.
yoda May the Force be with you. obi-wan It is not disrespect, Master. It is the truth.
qui-gon From your point of view....
obi-wan The boy is dangerous... They all sense it. Why can't you?
qui-gon His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous. The Council will decide Anakin's future. That should be enough for you. Now, get on board.
anakin Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.
qui-gon You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
anakin Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
qui-gon Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all living cells and communicates with the Force.
anakin They live inside of me?
qui-gon In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
anakin Symbionts?
qui-gon Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force.
anakin They do?
qui-gon When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you.
anakin I don't understand.
qui-gon With time and training, Annie...you will.
 Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.
amidala I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means to destroy me.
qui-gon I promise you, I will not let that happen.
jar jar Wesa goen home!
darth-sidious The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
nute Yes, my Lord.
darth-sidious Viceroy, is the planet secure?
nute Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
darth-sidious Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
nute Yes, my Lord.
rune A Sith lord here with us?!!
anakin ...and that one?
ric olie The forward stabalizer.
anakin And those control the pitch?
ric olie You catch on pretty quick.
capt-panaka The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty.
qui-gon I agree...I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
amidala I'm going to take back what's ours.
capt-panaka There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no army.
qui-gon I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
amidala Jar Jar Binks!
jar jar Mesa, Your Highness?
amidala Yes. I need your help.
capt-panaka The blockade's gone.
obi-wan The war's over...No need for it now.
ric olie I have one battleship on my scope.
obi-wan A droid control ship.
capt-panaka They've probably spotted us.
obi-wan We haven't much time.
anakin Hi! Where have you been?
padme Annie! What are you doing here?
anakin I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi. I'm too old.
padme This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
anakin Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
padme To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficult decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a peaceful people...
anakin I want to help...I'm glad you're back.
obi-wan Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.
qui-gon Good.
obi-wan Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
qui-gon The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our power to help her.
obi-wan I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the trials.
qui-gon You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than I am, Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.
jar jar Ello! Where das everybody?
jar jar Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink. Sorry, no Gungas...no Gungas.
capt-panaka Do you think they have been taken to camps?
obi-wan More likely they were wiped out.
jar jar No...mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go to sacred place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
qui-gon Do you know where they are?
jar jar Dissen it.  Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.
capt-tarpals Binks!! Noah gain!
jar jar We comen to see da boss.
capt-tarpals Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for all-n youse.
boss nass Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who's da uss-en others??
amidala I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo...I come before you in peace.
boss nass Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die'n, mesa tink.
amidala We wish to form an alliance...
padme Your Honor...
boss nass Whosa dis?
padme I am Queen Amidala This is my decoy...my protection...my loyal bodyguard.  ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace...until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I beg you to help us.  We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.
boss nass Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis. Maybe wesa bein friends.
nute ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
darth-sidious This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive.. Lord Maul, be mindful.
darth-maul Yes, my Master.
darth-sidious Be patient... Let them make the first move.
gungan lookout Daza comen!
anakin All right. They're here!
boss nass Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
jar jar Oh, no, no, no...
boss nass So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
jar jar General??! Oh, no..
padme What is the situation?
capt-panaka Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
padme The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.  What do you think, Master Jedi?
qui-gon The Viceroy will be well guarded.
capt-panaka The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
qui-gon There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be killed.
boss nass Wesa ready to do are-sa part.
padme We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless.
qui-gon A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
obi-wan And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.
padme That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it.
darth-sidious ...she is more foolish than I thought.
nute We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do not expect much resistance.
oom-9 I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
darth-maul I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be using the Queen for their own purposes.
darth-sidious The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that covenant.... This will work to our advantage...
nute I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
darth-sidious Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them.
general ceel Energize the shields.
qui-gon Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe place to hide and stay there.
anakin Sure.
qui-gon And stay there!
nute I thought the battle was going to take place far from here...this is too close!
rune What is going on?
darth-maul I told you there was more to this...the Jedi are involved.
padme Get to your ships!
FIGHTER pilot Better find a new hiding place, kid. I'm taking this ship.
padme My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.
qui-gon I agree.
anakin Hey! Wait for me.
qui-gon No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are.
anakin But, I...
qui-gon Stay in that cockpit.  We handle this...
anakin Oh, no...  We gotta do something, Artoo.  All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over. Let's see...  Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....  Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster." Yeah!
anakin Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on the right.  I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.  Oops!! Wrong one.  I'm not doing anything!  I know...I didn't push anything.
ric olie Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on the transmitter.
bravo two Roger, Bravo Leader.
ric olie Enemy fighters straight ahead!
anakin The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?  There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire it or something.  Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is taking us.
padme We don't have time for this, Captain.
capt-panaka Let's try the outside stairway.
general ceel Retreat! Retreat!
anakin Whoo, boy! This is tense!  Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!
anakin I've got control?  Okay, let's go left!  Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!
anakin Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!  Oops! Whoa!  I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.
anakin I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this mess is the way we got into it.
anakin Which one? This one?
ric olie Bravo flight...go for the central bridge.
bravo two ROger, Bravo Leader.
ric olie Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through it.
anakin I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!  We're hit!  Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!
anakin I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!  All right! All right! Get the system started!  Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.
padme Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
capt-panaka But we can't....
padme Captain, I said throw down your weapons.
jar jar Dissa bad, berry bombad.
general ceel Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.
nute Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.
sabe I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!
nute After her! This one is a decoy!  Your Queen will not get away with this.
padme Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
nute Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.
obi-wan Master! Master!
qui-gon It is too late...It's...
obi-wan No!
qui-gon Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
obi-wan Yes, Master...
qui-gon He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!
anakin Uh oh. This is not good.  The systems are still overheated, Artoo.
BATTLE DROID captain Where's your pilot?
BATTLE DROID captain You're the pilot?
BATTLE DROID captain Let me see your identification!
anakin Yes...we have ignition.
BATTLE DROID captain You! Come out of there or we'll blast you!
anakin Not if I can help it! Shields up!  This should stop them. ...and take this!  Darn...I missed!  Let's get out of here!  Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!
tey how Sir, we're losing power... There is some problem with the main reactor...
dofine Impossible!! I don't...
bravo two What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside.
ric olie I don't know, we didn't hit it.
bravo three Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!
jar jar Wierdind...
bravo two He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted the main reactor...
bravo three Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy.
ric olie We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship?
anakin I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?
padme Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and explain all this.
capt-panaka I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.
amidala Congratulations on youer election, Chancellor. It is so good to see you again.
palpatine It's good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.
yoda Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
obi-wan Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
yoda The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
obi-wan Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the Council if I must.
yoda Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.
obi-wan He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go.
anakin What will happen to me now?
obi-wan I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise.
mace windu There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
yoda Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an apprentice.
mace windu But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?
