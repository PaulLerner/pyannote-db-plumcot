shuttle_captain Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. 
death_star_controller	 The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. 
shuttle_captain We're starting our approach. 
officer Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. 
operator Yes, sir. 
jerjerrod Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. 
vader You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. 
jerjerrod I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. 
vader Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. 
jerjerrod I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 
vader The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. 
jerjerrod But he asks the impossible. I need more men. 
vader Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. 
jerjerrod The Emperor's coming here? 
vader That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. 
jerjerrod We shall double our efforts. 
vader I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 
threepio Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. 
threepio Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. 
threepio Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. 
threepio There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. 
strange VOICE Tee chuta hhat yudd! 
threepio Goodness gracious me! 
threepio Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. 
threepio I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. 
threepio Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. 
threepio Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! 
threepio Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 
bib Die Wanna Wanga! 
threepio Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt. 
threepio ...and a gift. Gift, what gift? 
bib Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. 
threepio He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. 
threepio I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. 
bib Nudd Chaa. 
threepio Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. 
threepio Good morning. 
jabba Bo Shuda! 
threepio The message, Artoo, the message. 
luke Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. 
threepio What did he say? 
luke ... Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 
threepio This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. 
jabba There will be no bargain. 
threepio We're doomed. 
jabba I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. 
threepio Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. 
threepio What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! 
ninedenine Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? 
threepio I am See-Threepio, human-cy... 
ninedenine Yes or no will do. 
threepio Oh. Well, yes. 
ninedenine How many languages do you speak? 
threepio I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... 
ninedenine Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. 
threepio Disintegrated? 
ninedenine Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. 
threepio Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! 
ninedenine You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely. 
jabba Da Eitha! 
oola Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... 
jabba Boscka! 
boushh I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. 
threepio Oh, no! Chewbacca! 
jabba At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. 
threepio Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! 
threepio Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. 
boushh I want fifty thousand. No less. 
threepio Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. 
threepio Because he's holding a thermal detonator. 
jabba This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. 
threepio Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. 
boushh Zeebuss. 
threepio He agrees! 
boushh Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite. 
boushh Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. 
han I can't see. 
boushh Your eyesight will return in time. 
han Where am I? 
boushh Jabba's palace. 
han Who are you? 
leia Someone who loves you. 
han Leia! 
leia I gotta get you out of here. 
han What's that? I know that laugh. 
han Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. 
jabba It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. 
han Look... 
jabba Take him away! 
han Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! 
jabba Bring her to me. 
leia We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... 
jabba I'm sure. 
leia Ugh! 
threepio Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. 
han Chewie? Chewie, is that you? 
han Ah! Chew--Chewie! 
han Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? 
chewie
han Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. 
chewie
han A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. 
chewie 
han I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. 
luke I must speak with Jabba. 
luke You will take me to Jabba now! 
luke You serve your master well. 
luke And you will be rewarded. 
threepio At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. 
bib Master. 
bib ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. 
jabba I told you not to admit him. 
luke I must be allowed to speak. 
bib He must be allowed to speak. 
jabba You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. 
luke You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. 
jabba Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. 
luke Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. 
threepio Master Luke, you're standing on... 
jabba There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. 
jabba Bascka! 
threepio Oh, no! The Rancor! 
jabba Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. 
luke Han! 
han Luke! 
luke Are you all right? 
han Fine. Together again, huh? 
luke Wouldn't miss it. 
han How are we doing? 
luke The same as always. 
han That bad, huh? Where's Leia? 
leia I'm here. 
threepio Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. 
han Good, I hate long waits. 
threepio You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. 
han Doesn't sound so bad. 
threepio In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. 
han On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? 
chewie
luke You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make. 
han I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. 
luke There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. 
han You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. 
luke Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. 
han Oh... great! 
jabba Soon you will learn to appreciate me. 
threepio Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? 
threepio Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! 
threepio Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. 
threepio Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas. 
han Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? 
chewie 
luke Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. 
jabba Move him into position. 
jabba Put him in. 
luke Easy, Chewie. 
lando Whoa! Whoa! Help! 
han Chewie, you okay? Where is he? 
han I'm okay, pal. 
lando Han! Chewie? 
han Lando! 
chewie 
han Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? 
han Lando, grab it! 
lando Lower it! 
han I'm trying! 
han Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. 
han Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! 
han Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! 
lando Hold it! Whoa! 
han Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. 
han Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. 
lando No, wait! I thought you were blind! 
han It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. 
lando All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! 
han Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up! 
leia Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. 
threepio Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! 
luke Get the gun! Point it at the deck! 
luke Point it at the deck! 
threepio Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. 
luke Come on! 
luke Let's go! And don't forget the droids. 
lando We're on our way. 
han I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand! 
leia That's all any of us can see. 
han Then I guess I'm getting better. 
han I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there. 
luke I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it. 
han No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing! 
luke I'll see you back at the fleet. 
han Why don't you leave that crate and come with us? 
luke I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend. 
han Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando. 
lando Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later. 
leia He means "You're welcome." 
lando Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball. 
luke I'll meet you back at the fleet. 
leia Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. 
luke I will. 
han Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. 
luke That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend. 
emperor Rise, my friend. 
vader The Death Star will be completed on schedule. 
emperor You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. 
vader Yes, my Master. 
emperor Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. 
vader As you wish. 
emperor Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. 
yoda Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? 
luke No... of course not. 
yoda I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? 
yoda Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. 
luke Master Yoda, you can't die. 
yoda Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. 
luke But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. 
yoda No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. 
yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed. 
luke Then I am a Jedi? 
yoda Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. 
luke Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? 
yoda Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. 
luke Yoda, I must know. 
yoda Your father he is. 
yoda Told you, did he? 
luke Yes. 
yoda Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... 
luke Unfortunate that I know the truth? 
yoda	 No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. 
luke Well, I'm sorry. 
yoda Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. 
yoda Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker. 
luke I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. 
ben Yoda will always be with you. 
luke Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? 
luke You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. 
ben You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. 
luke A certain point of view! 
ben Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 
ben I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault. 
ben Anakin was a good friend. 
ben When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy. 
luke There's still good in him. 
ben I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. 
luke I can't do it, Ben. 
ben You cannot escape your destiny. 
luke I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. 
ben Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared. 
luke But I had to help my friends. 
ben	 And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear. 
luke I found out Darth Vader was my father. 
ben To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again! 
luke I can't kill my own father. 
ben Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. 
luke Yoda spoke of another. 
ben The other he spoke of is your twin sister. 
luke But I have no sister. 
ben Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. 
luke Leia! Leia's my sister. 
ben Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. 
ben When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. 
ben The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate. 
luke But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her. 
ben She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader! 
han Well, look at you, a general, huh? 
lando Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. 
han Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. 
lando I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. 
han Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? 
mon_mothma The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. 
mon_mothma The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. 
mon_mothma Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please. 
ackbar You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. 
ackbar General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack 
han Good luck. 
han You're gonna need it. 
ackbar GENERAL_MADINE. 
general_madine We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. 
threepio Sounds dangerous. 
leia I wonder who they found to pull that off. 
general_madine General Solo, is your strike team assembled? 
han Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. 
han Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. 
han That's one. 
leia Uh, General... count me in. 
voice I'm with you, too! 
leia What is it? 
luke Ask me again sometime. 
han Luke. 
luke Hi, Han... Chewie. 
threepio "Exciting" is hardly the word I would use. 
han Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. 
lando All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? 
han Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. 
lando Look, would you get going, you pirate. 
lando Good luck. 
han You, too. 
han You got her warmed? 
luke Yeah, she's comin' up. 
han No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. 
leia Hey, are you awake? 
han Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. 
leia Come on, General, let's move. 
han Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? 
luke All set. 
threepio Here we go again. 
han All right, hang on. 
vader What is thy bidding, my Master? 
emperor Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. 
vader What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? 
emperor It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. 
vader Yes, my Master. 
han If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. 
controller We have you on our screen now. Please identify. 
han Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. 
controller Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. 
han Transmission commencing. 
leia Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. 
han It'll work. It'll work. 
luke Vader's on that ship. 
han Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. 
han I don't know. Fly casual. 
luke I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. 
han It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here. 
lord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star. Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach. 
vader Where is that shuttle going? 
piett Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? 
pilot_voice    Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. 
vader Do they have a code clearance? 
piett It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. 
piett Shall I hold them? 
vader No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. 
piett As you wish, my lord. Carry on. 
han They're not goin' for it, Chewie. 
controller Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. 
han Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem. 
threepio Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. 
their POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked nearby. 
leia Shall we try and go around? 
han It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. 
han Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. 
luke Quietly, there might be more of them out there. 
han Hey... it's me. 
scout #1 Go for help! Go! 
luke Great. Come on. 
leia Over there! Two more of them! 
luke I see them. Wait, Leia! 
but Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her. 
luke Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! 
han Hey, wait! Ahhh! 
luke Move closer! 
luke Get alongside that one! 
luke Get him! 
luke Keep on that one! I'll take these two! 
threepio Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! 
han Luke! Where's Leia? 
luke What? She didn't come back? 
han I thought she was with you. 
luke We got separated. 
luke Hey, we better go look for her. 
han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer. 
han Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. 
luke Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. 
threepio Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. 
threepio And you said it was pretty here. Ugh! 
leia Cut it out! 
leia I'm not gonna hurt you. 
leia Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is. 
leia Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. 
leia I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. 
leia All right. You want something to eat? 
leia That's right. Come on. Hmmm? 
sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him. 
leia Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? 
leia What is it? 
scout_l Freeze! Come on, get up! 
scout_1 Go get your ride and take her back to base. 
scout_2 Yes, sir. 
leia Come on, let's get outta here. 
guard Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment. 
vader The Emperor will see me, now! 
guard The Emperor will see you, now. 
emperor I told you to remain on the command ship. 
vader A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. 
emperor Yes, I know. 
vader My son is with them. 
emperor Are you sure? 
vader I have felt him, my Master. 
emperor Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. 
vader They are clear, my Master. 
emperor Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. 
vader He will come to me? 
emperor I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me. 
vader As you wish. 
han Luke! Luke! 
threepio Oh, Master Luke. 
luke There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this. 
threepio I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. 
han I hope she's alright. 
chewbacca  
han What, Chewie? What? Chewie! 
han Hey, I don't get it. 
han Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. 
chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat. 
luke Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! 
han Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. 
luke Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber? 
han Yeah, sure. 
threepio Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o- op!! 
han Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. 
han Hey! 
luke Han, don't. It'll be all right. 
luke Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. 
threepio Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! 
luke Do you understand anything they're saying? 
threepio Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. 
han What are you telling them? 
threepio Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god. 
han Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? 
threepio I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. 
han Proper?! 
threepio It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. 
han Why, you-- 
han My mistake. He's an old friend of mine. 
han I have a really bad feeling about this. 
han What did he say? 
threepio I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. 
han/LUKE Leia! 
leia Oh! 
threepio Your Royal Highness. 
leia But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. 
han Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. 
luke Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. 
threepio But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- 
luke Just tell them. 
threepio You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... 
threepio ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! 
threepio Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! 
threepio Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. 
luke Thanks, Threepio. 
threepio I...I never knew I had it in me. 
threepio Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. 
han What's going on? 
leia I don't know. 
threepio Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. 
han Just what I always wanted. 
han Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.  Thank you. Okay. 
threepio He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. 
chewie 
han Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. 
han And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day. 
leia Luke, what's wrong? 
luke Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? 
leia Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. 
luke What do you remember? 
leia Just...images, really. Feelings. 
luke Tell me. 
leia She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? 
luke I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. 
leia Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? 
luke Vader is here...now, on this moon. 
leia How do you know? 
luke I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. 
leia Why? 
luke He's my father. 
leia Your father? 
luke There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. 
leia Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. 
luke You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. 
luke Yes. It's you Leia. 
leia I know. Somehow...I've always known. 
luke Then you know why I have to face him. 
leia No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. 
luke No, you don't. You've always been strong. 
leia But, why must you confront him? 
luke Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. 
han Hey, what's goin' on? 
leia Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. 
han Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? 
leia I...I can't tell you. 
han Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? 
leia I... 
han Ahhh... 
han I'm sorry. 
leia Hold me. 
commander This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. 
commander He was armed only with this. 
vader Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. 
commander Yes, my Lord. 
vader The Emperor has been expecting you. 
luke I know, father. 
vader So, you have accepted the truth. 
lure I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. 
vader That name no longer has any meaning for me. 
luke It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. 
vader I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. 
vader Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. 
luke Come with me. 
vader Obi-Wan once thought as you do. 
vader You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. 
luke I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. 
vader If that is your destiny. 
luke Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate. 
vader It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. 
luke Then my father is truly dead. 
leia The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. 
han Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. 
leia What's he saying? 
threepio He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge. 
lando Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. 
ackbar Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. 
lando Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time...  or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. 
ackbar All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. 
lando All right. Stand by. 
han Back door, huh? Good idea. 
han It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. 
leia Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. 
han	 Then we'll do it real quiet-like. 
threepio Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! 
leia Quiet. 
threepio I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. 
leia Oh, no. 
han There goes our surprise attack. 
scout Look! Over there! Stop him! 
han Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. 
threepio I have decided that we shall stay here. 
emperor Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. 
emperor You no longer need those. 
emperor Guards, leave us. 
emperor I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. 
luke You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. 
emperor Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. 
vader His lightsaber. 
emperor Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. 
luke You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me. 
emperor Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. 
emperor Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. 
luke Your overconfidence is your weakness. 
emperor Your faith in your friends is yours. 
vader It is pointless to resist, my son. 
emperor Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.  Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon... 
emperor ...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. 
emperor Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. 
han All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. 
leia Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. 
han Charges! Come on, come on! 
threepio Oh, my! They'll be captured! 
threepio Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. 
commander Freeze! You Rebel scum. 
lando All wings report in. 
wedge_red_leader standing by. 
gray_leader Gray Leader standing by. 
green_leader Green Leader standing by. 
wedge Lock S-foils in attack positions. 
ackbar May the Force be with us. 
lando We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. 
lando Break off the attack! The shield is still up. 
red_leader I get no reading. Are you sure? 
lando Pull up! All craft pull up! 
ackbar Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. 
controller Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47. 
ackbar It's a trap! 
lando Fighters coming in. 
rebel_pilot There's too many of them! 
lando Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. 
wedge Copy, Gold Leader. 
emperor Come, boy. See for yourself. 
emperor From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. 
emperor You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. 
luke No! 
emperor It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine! 
stormtrooper All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! 
threepio Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? 
bunker COMMANDER Bring those two down here! 
stormtrooper Let's go! 
threepio Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? 
stormtrooper Freeze! Don't move! 
threepio We surrender. 
threepio Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. 
leia The code's changed. We need Artoo! 
han Here's the terminal. 
leia Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. 
threepio Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back! 
lando Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! 
wedge_red_three, RED_TWO, pull in! 
red_two Got it! 
red_three Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! 
wedge Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. 
navigator Pressure's steady. 
lando Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. 
commander We're in attack position now, sir. 
piett Hold here. 
commander We're not going to attack? 
piett I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping. 
emperor As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. 
jerjerrod Fire! 
lando That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!  Home One, this is Gold Leader. 
ackbar We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. 
lando You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. 
ackbar We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. 
lando Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time. 
threepio We're coming! 
han Come on! Come on! 
threepio Oh, Artoo, hurry! 
threepio My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? 
han Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. 
leia I'll cover you. 
lando Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range. 
ackbar At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. 
lando We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. 
rebel_pilot She's gonna blow! 
y-wing_pilot I'm hit! 
emperor Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. 
emperor Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete. 
walker_pilot_1 Look! 
pilot_2 Get him off of there! 
han I think I got it. I got it! 
threepio Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? 
han Let's see. 
leia It's not bad. 
stormtrooper Freeze! 
threepio Oh, dear. 
stormtrooper Don't move! 
han I love you. 
leia I know. 
stormtrooper Hands up! Stand up! 
han Stay back. 
han Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea. 
emperor Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. 
vader Obi-Wan has taught you well. 
luke I will not fight you, father. 
vader You are unwise to lower your defenses. 
luke Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. 
vader There is no conflict. 
luke You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. 
vader You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. 
emperor Good. Good. 
lando Watch out. Squad at .06. 
rebel_pilot I'm on it, Gold Leader. 
wedge Good shot, RED_TWO. 
lando Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down. 
han/PILOT It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. 
control_room_commander Send three squads to help. Open the back door. 
second_commander Yes, sir. 
han Throw me another charge. 
vader You cannot hide forever, Luke. 
luke I will not fight you. 
vader Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... 
vader Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. 
luke Never-r-r! 
emperor Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! 
luke Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. 
emperor So be it...Jedi. 
han Move! Move! 
ackbar The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. 
lando We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it! 
emperor If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. 
emperor Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. 
emperor Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. 
luke Father, please. Help me. 
emperor Now, young Skywalker...you will die. 
wedge I'm going in. 
lando Here goes nothing. 
lando Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. 
wedge Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. 
lando Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. 
pilot Copy, Gold Leader. 
lando That was too close. 
nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer. 
ackbar We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer. 
admiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the battle. They look concerned. 
controller Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. 
piett Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. 
piett Intensify forward firepower! 
commander It's too late! 
vader Luke, help me take this mask off. 
lure But you'll die. 
vader Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. 
anakin Now...go, my son. Leave me. 
luke No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. 
anakin You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. 
luke Father...I won't leave you. 
wedge There it is! 
lando All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. 
wedge Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. 
ackbar Move the fleet away from the Death Star. 
threepio They did it! 
han I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew. 
leia He wasn't. I can feel it. 
han You love him, don't you? 
leia Yes. 
han All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way. 
leia Oh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother £
