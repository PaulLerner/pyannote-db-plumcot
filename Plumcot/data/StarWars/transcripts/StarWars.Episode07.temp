poe We've got company.
poe You have to hide.
lor-san-tekka You have to leave. Go!
poe Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
poe I see 'em!
poe You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me?
poe I'll come back for you! It will be alright.
him_senior_trooper Stay here. Our Trooper nods.
kylo-ren Look how old you've become.
lor-san-tekka Something far worse has happened to you. Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other stormtroopers.
kylo-ren You know what I've come for.
lor-san-tekka I know where you come from. Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.
kylo-ren The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order.
lor-san-tekka The First Order rose from the dark side... you did not.
kylo-ren I'll show you the dark side.
lor-san-tekka You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family.
kylo-ren You're so right.
poe So who talks first? You talk first?
kylo-ren The old man gave it to you.
poe It's just very hard to understand you with all the...
kylo-ren Search him.
poe ... Apparatus.
stormtrooper #1 Nothing, sir.
kylo-ren Put him on board.
captain_phasma Sir, the villagers.
kylo-ren Kill them all.
captain_phasma On my command!
captain_phasma Fire!
stormtrooper #2 Nothing here. Go ahead!
poe All right. All right!
captain_phasma fn-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection.
fn-2187 Yes, Captain.
captain_phasma And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?
fn-2187 I'm sorry, Captain.
captain_phasma Report to my division at once.
phasma heads off. Shattered, fn-2187 replaces his helmet.
unkar What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion.
rey Tal'ama parqual!
rey Parqual zatana!
rey NOMA. The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" , Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.
rey Shhhh.
bb-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off. Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.
rey That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. Where do you come from?
rey Really? Me too. Big secret. Niima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge.
rey Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand.
bb-8 BEEPS
rey Don't follow me. Town is that way.
rey No! 
rey In the morning, you go.
rey You're welcome. The two disappear behind a dune.
kylo-ren I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable?
poe Not really.
kylo-ren I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.
poe Might wanna rethink your technique.
kylo-ren Where is it?
poe The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.
kylo-ren Where... is it?
kylo-ren It's in a droid. A BB unit.
general_hux Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.
kylo-ren I leave that to you.
bb-8 is dropped to the sand.
rey Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting.
bb-8 BEEPTALKS a question.
rey For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on.
unkar These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion.
rey Last week they were a half portion each.
unkar What about the droid?
rey What about him?
unkar I'll pay for him.
unkar Sixty portions.
rey Actually... the droid's not for sale.
rey Come on. 
unkar Follow the girl and get that droid. He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.
stormtrooper Ren wants the prisoner. TIGHT ON poe, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him.
stormtrooper Turn here. Poe turns into a narrow passageway --
stormtrooper Listen carefully you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.
poe If -- what--?
fn-2187 This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter?
poe You with the Resistance--?!
fn-2187 What?
fn-2187 No no no! I'm breaking you out. Can you fly a TIE fighter?
poe I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me?
fn-2187 Because it's the right thing to do.
poe You need a pilot.
fn-2187 I need a pilot.
poe We're gonna do this.
fn-2187 ... Yeah?
fn-2187 Okay, stay calm, stay calm.
poe I am calm.
fn-2187 I'm talking to myself.
poe Not yet. Okay, go. This way.
fn-2187 walks quickly toward the far wall -- Poe follows -- up the stairs to a two-man SPECIAL FORCES TIE FIGHTER --
fn-2187 and Poe drop into the back-to-back cockpit. fn-2187 pulls off his helmet as Poe removes his cuffs and jacket, fires up the ship with excitement.
poe I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot?
fn-2187 Blasters, I can!
poe Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire!
fn-2187 This is very complicated FWOOOOOOM! The TIE FIGHTER LURCHES FORWARD --
poe I can fix this.
fn-2187 opens fire.
fn-2187 TEARS UP PARKED TIE FIGHTERS and GUN EMPLACEMENTS WITH WELL-AIMED, STRATEGIC LASER BLASTS! Hits the CONTROL room!
poe I got it!
poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it.
poe Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far!
fn-2187 All right!
poe I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp!
poe flies toward the CANONS --
poe Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?
poe I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot.
fn-2187 Okay, got it.
fn-2187 gets a target, FIRES!
fn-2187 YELLS in celebration
fn-2187 YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE THAT?
poe I saw it! Hey, what's your name?
fn-2187 fn-2187! 
poe FN-whaa?
fn-2187 That's the only name they ever gave me!
poe Well I ain't using it! FN, huh?
poe Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right?
finn "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that!
poe I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.
finn Good to meet you, Poe!
poe Good to meet you too, Finn!
lieutenant_mitaka Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--
general_hux Use the ventral cannons.
lieutenant_mitaka Yes, sir. Bringing them online --
kylo-ren General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot?
general_hux Yes, and he had help.
general_hux From one of our own. PUSH IN ON REN 
general_hux We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was.
kylo-ren ... The one from the village. 
fn-2187. Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.
lieutenant_mitaka Sir. Ventral cannons hot.
general_hux Fire.
poe One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it?
finn Hold on! I see it!
poe Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm --
finn Where are you going?
poe We're going back to Jakku. That's where.
finn No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system!
poe I got to get to my droid before the First Order does!
finn What - a droid?!
poe That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white one of a kind.
finn I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!
poe This one is, pal.
finn We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die!
poe That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker!
finn Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT!
captain_phasma fn-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.
general_hux No prior signs of non-conformity?
captain_phasma This was his first offense. A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux.
technician #1 General. They've been hit.
general_hux Destroyed?
technician #1 Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands.
general_hux They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage.
finn Poe! Poe!
finn Poe!!! poe!
finn poe!!! poe!!! It becomes clear fast if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER as it SINKS
general_hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.
general_hux Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must.
kylo-ren How capable are your soldiers, General?
general_hux I won't have you question my methods.
kylo-ren They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.
general_hux My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth--
kylo-ren Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.
general_hux Careful, Ren. That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.
kylo-ren I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Ren heads off. Hux hates him.
finn Water... water... water.. He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.
finn -- Awgh, GAH! But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, rey kneels with an emphatically
rey Who? Him?
rey What's your hurry, thief?
finn What--?! Thief?
finn OW! HEY! What?!
rey The jacket! This droid says you stole it!
finn I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!!
finn stop it!
rey Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master.
finn It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right?
finn He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. Poe didn't make it. Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry...
rey So you're with the Resistance?
finn Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. I'm with the Resistance. 
rey I've never met a Resistance fighter before.
finn Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different.
rey BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base.
finn Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it.
rey Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth.
rey What is it?
rey What are you doing?!
finn Come on! 
finn and rey holding hands, the three race, zigzagging through a maze of tents
finn Come on, BB-8!
rey Let go of me!
finn No, we gotta move!
rey I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way!
stormtrooper Call in the air strike! rey, finn AND BB-8 duck into another tent
rey They're shooting at both of us!
finn Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked!
rey Well, thanks for that!
finn I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?!
rey Are you okay?
rey Stop taking my hand!
rey Hey!
finn -- Are you okay?
rey Yeah. Follow me. Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off.
finn We can't outrun them! Rey PO
rey We might in that quad-jumper!
finn We need a pilot!
rey We've got one!
finn You?! What about that ship?
rey That one's garbage!
rey The garbage'll do!
rey Gunner position's down there!
finn Y'ever fly this thing?
rey No! This ship hasn't been flown in years!
finn Great. Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--
rey bucks herself up. doesn't believe her quick words
rey I can do this, I can do this--
rey pulls the yoke
unkar HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!!
rey pilots, headed for the sky!
finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS.
finn Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low!
rey WHAT?
finn Stay low! It confuses their tracking!
rey BB-8, hold on!
rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.
rey I'M GOING LOW!!!
rey What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?!
finn flicks switches -- the gun targeting lights up
finn I'm working on it! Are the shields up?
rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.
rey Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR
finn Try sitting in this thing!
finn We need cover, quick!
rey hits switches, pilots the best she can
rey We're about to get some!
rey I hope.
finn Damn it!
finn SWOOPS into frame, FIRES --
finn Come on... come on...
rey Nice shot!
finn I'm getting pretty good at this!
finn The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em!
rey Get ready!
finn Okay! For what?
finn ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?!
rey Oh no!
finn Whooo!
finn Good shooting! 
rey Thanks! I-- Now that was some I don't know! -- I've flying! How did you flown some ships but I've do that?! No one never left the planet! trained you? No one? Your last shot was dead That was amazing! on. You got him with one blast! You set me up for it! It was perfect! That was pretty good.
rey You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will.
rey I don't know your name.
finn Finn. What's yours.
rey I'm Rey.
bb-8 really?  
finn Rey...
rey Help me with this! Quick!
finn Whoa! What's going on?
lieutenant_mitaka Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.
lieutenant_mitaka It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.
kylo-ren The droid... stole a freighter?
lieutenant_mitaka Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.
lieutenant_mitaka We have no confirmation, but we believe fn-2187 may have been helped in the escape--
kylo-ren Anything else?
mitaka hates to say the following, but
lieutenant_mitaka The two were accompanied by a girl.
kylo-ren What girl?
rey It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there!
finn How bad is it?!
rey If we wanna live, not good!
finn They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system!
rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.
rey BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know!
finn This?
finn You gotta tell us where the base is.
finn I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay?
finn -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! Droid, please.
rey Pilex driver, hurry!
finn moves for the tool.
rey So where's your base?
finn Go on BB-8, tell her.
finn Please!
rey The Ileenium system?
finn Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can.
rey I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry!
finn What about you?
rey I gotta get back to Jakku!
finn BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! !
rey No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas!
bb-8 has moved to finn -- tips his head, shows him the tool. he throws her the tape, she disappears below
finn This?
rey Yes!
finn Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend?
rey None of your business, THAT'S WHY!
finn ... That can't be good.
rey -- No it can't be --
rey Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden.
finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out.
rey Get off. Get off! See anything?
finn ... Oh no.
finn It's the First Order.
rey What do we do-- there must be
something -- Finn's mind races -- then
finn You said poisonous gas --
rey -- Yeah, but I fixed that --
finn Can you unfix it?
rey C'mon BB-8.
finn I got it.
rey Oooh...
finn I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...
rey You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers?
finn Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins.
finn Hurry!
rey I'm hurrying!
han Chewie, we're home.
han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED.
han Where are the others? Where's the pilot?
rey ...I'm the pilot...
han You?
chewie MOANS/TALKS
rey No, it's true we're the only ones on board.
finn You can understand that thing?
han And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there.
han Where'd you get this ship?
rey Niima Outpost.
han Jakku?! That junkyard?
finn Thank you! Junkyard!
han Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches!
han Who had it, Ducain?
rey I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.
han Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.
han walks away, takes in the ship it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.
rey This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?
han I used to be.
finn Han Solo? The Rebellion General?
rey No, the smuggler!
finn Wasn't he a war hero?! Chewie replies "Yeah, I guess, kinda..." Rey calls out
rey This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...!
han Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS
him han Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor.
rey Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on
han -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet.
rey Wait! No -- we need your help!
han My help?
rey This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!
finn He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup Han stops in his tracks.
finn You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him.
han Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.
han Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten
finn Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey!
finn You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?
han I'm hauling Rathtars.
han Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon.
han heads off as
rey What's a Rathtar?
han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo containers.
han They're big and dangerous...
finn Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!
rey No.
finn Good. They turn a corner
han I got three of 'em going to King Prana.
finn THREE?! How'd you get them on board?
han I used to have a bigger crew. Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.
co are there.
han Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon.
rey What about BB-8?
han He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.
finn What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them?
han There's one.
rey What are you gonna do?
han Same thing I always do talk my way out of it.
chewie MOANS/TALKS Yes, I do. Every time.
bala-tik Han Solo. You are a dead man.
han Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
bala-tik The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job.
rey Can you see them?
finn No. They start crawling down the crawl space.
bala-tik I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub.
han You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other?
rey and finn arrive under the gang. they whisper
rey They have blasters...
finn A lot of 'em. We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance.
bala-tik The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We want our money back now.
han Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.
bala-tik Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too.
han I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
bala-tik Tell that to Kanjiklub. The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.
han Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE
tasu_leech Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you.
han Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before?
bala-tik Yeah.
tasu_leech Twice! Han realizes he's right.
han What was the second time?
bala-tik Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle.
tasu_leech Nowhere left for you to hide.
bala-tik That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives.
finn and rey suddenly stop crawling, tense. bb-8 hides behind han's leg. push in on han as he realizes
finn and Rey are in real trouble.
han First I've heard of it.
razoo-qin-fee Search the freighter. One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor, AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for
finn AND rey, in a quiet PANIC BELOW THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.
rey Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!
finn Close the blast doors from here?
rey Resetting the fuses should do it.
han ... I got a bad feeling about this...
rey Oh no.
finn Oh no, what?
rey Wrong fuses.
bala-tik Kill them! And take the droid!
rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks.
finn This was a mistake!
rey Huge!
rey What do they look like?
finn They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE! finn This way!
rey Are you sure?
finn rey!
rey finn!!!!
rey Finn!
finn It had me! But the door--!
rey That was lucky!
han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL.
han I got the door. Cover us!
chewie MOANS/TALKS GROAN-AGREES. 
han Chewie! You okay?
han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS, badass!
han Wow. Come on! Come on!
run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward the Falcon.
rey Han! Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey
han You, close the door behind us!
han You take care of Chewie!
han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie, who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!
han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat.
han Hey, where are you going?
rey Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.
han I hate that guy.
han sits as, rey hitting buttons
rey And you could use a co-pilot.
han I got one, he's back there.
han and rey in the seats
han Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed --
rey From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?
han I never ask that question until after I've done it.
han This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there!
finn No problem!
han Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.
han What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.
rey Compressor.
han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we
bala-tik Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.
snoke The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance...
kylo-ren and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at someone addressing them. We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME LEADER snoke. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five feet tall. All of him a STONY Grey. Old, wounded, fragile and powerful, all at the same time.
snoke ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.
general_hux Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th--
snoke General! Our strategy must now change.
general_hux The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then
snoke Go. Oversee preparations.
general_hux Yes, Supreme Leader.
snoke There's been an awakening. Have you felt it?
kylo-ren Yes.
snoke There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo.
kylo-ren He means nothing to me.
snoke Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.
kylo-ren By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.
snoke We shall see. We shall see.
rey I can fix that!
han The coolant's leaking!
rey Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank--
han -- Secondary tank, I got it!
finn Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!
han You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!
finn Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times!
finn Which is fine.
han This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems.
han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.
han What'd you do?
rey I by-passed the compressor.
han Move, Ball.
han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.
han Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest.
han Good job, kid. And thanks.
finn You're welcome.
finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off.
han So, fugitives, huh?
rey The First Order wants the map.
rey Finn is with the Resistance...
finn ... I'm just a scavenger.
han Let's see whatcha got.
rey Go ahead.
han This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.
rey Why'd he leave?
han He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything.
finn Do you know what happened to him?
han There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.
rey The Jedi were real?
han I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light.
han 'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true.
han No, you rest. You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop.
rey ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him.
finn Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here --
han D'you just call me "Solo"?
finn Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers?
han Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth.
han Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.
han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the castle.
han You might need this.
rey I think I can handle myself.
han I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it.
rey picks it up. Grips it.
han You know how to use one of these?
rey Yeah, you pull the trigger.
han There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?
rey Rey.
han Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon.
rey Are you offering me a job?
han I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.
rey You're offering me a job.
han I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross.
han Well?
rey If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly.
han Jakku?
rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.
rey I've already been away too long.
han Chewie, check out the ship as best you can.
han It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.
han walks them to the castle.
finn Solo, why are we here again?
han To get your droid on a clean ship.
rey Clean?
han Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.
finn We can trust her, right?
han Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare...
rey AND finn At what?
han Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And... we enter the loud, crowded mess of a hall -- pushing past a room full of rough and odd aliens and humans, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the back of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall alien, who suddenly starts, as if sensing something -- the alien turns to us she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES. This is maz KANATA.
maz Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. It's ALL quiet in here.
han Oh boy. Hey, Maz!
maz Where's my boyfriend?
han Chewie's working on the Falcon.
maz I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it.
maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen bazine NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. A SMALL DROID , who turns its head to see BB-8
ga-97 Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here!
bazine Inform the First Order... I've found the droid.
kylo-ren Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started.
maz A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess.
han Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.
maz Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home!
han Leia doesn't want to see me.
finn Please, we came here for your help.
rey What fight?
maz The only fight against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us.
finn There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE.
finn What's this? What are you doing?
finn Solo, what is she doing?
han I don't know, but it ain't good.
maz If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.
finn You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen.
finn You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run.
rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.
maz You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear.
rey Finn!
finn Come with me.
rey What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.
finn I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.
han Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han.
maz Who's the girl?
finn I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim.
rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.
rey What are you doing?
finn Don't leave without me.
rey You can't just go. I won't let you.
finn I'm not who you think I am.
rey Finn, what are you talking about?
finn I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.
finn Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing...
finn But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran.
finn Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me.
rey Don't go.
finn Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it.
young_girl NO! She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to
young_girl No, come back!
unkar PLUTT Quiet, girl!
rey What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.
maz That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you!
rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.
rey I have to get back to Jakku.
maz Han told me. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could.
rey Luke.
maz The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.
maz The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it.
rey suddenly stands.
rey I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this.
general_hux Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic!
general_hux FIRE!
finn It was the Republic.
han and chewie turn as finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. with dread
finn The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey?
rey What are you doing?
rey You have to go back.
rey BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! 
maz leads han, finn and chewie down the hall, fast
maz I've had this for ages...
maz Kept it locked away.
han Where'd you get that?
maz A good question for another time.
maz Take it! Find your friend!
finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.
maz Those beasts! They're here!
rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!
stormtrooper FN-417, hold position!
rey Safety!
stormtrooper #4 Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl.
rey You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --
han Come on, Chewie!
maz Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go.
finn I need a weapon.
maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.
maz You have one!
han AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out!
han Hey, can I try that?
han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying.
han  I like this thing. finn SURPRISES A stormtrooper WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One Stormtrooper has a MACE --
stormtrooper Traitor!
finn and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS finn DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE stormtrooper IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up.
han You okay, Big deal?
finn Thanks! But TEN stormtrooperS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.
stormtrooper Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody!
chewie MOANS/TALKS
stormtrooper We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position!
han It's the Resistance.
poe Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you!
jess Copy that!
snap We're with you, Poe!
chewie MOANS/TALKS 
finn Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot!
poe WOOHOO!
kylo-ren The girl I've heard so much about.
kylo-ren The droid.
kylo-ren Where is it?
stormtrooper Request air support!
kylo-ren The map. You've seen it.
stormtrooper_#5 Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops.
kylo_ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.
kylo-ren Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need.
stormtrooper Pull back the tree line!
finn NO!! rey!!! 
finn No, no, no, no... rey!!
finn He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone!
han Yeah, yeah, I know...
c-3po Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. Look who it is! Did you see who?
c-3po Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.
c-3po Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled.
han You changed your hair.
leia Same jacket.
han No, new jacket.
chewie MOANS/TALKS 
han ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke. This is D'QAR.
finn Poe. Poe Dameron.
finn You're alive!
poe So are you!
finn What happened to you?
poe What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing--
bb-8 BEEPS 
poe BB-8 says that you saved him.
finn No, no, no. It wasn't just me.
poe You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?
finn Oh here.
poe No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.
finn Poe -- I need your help.
poe General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to YOU --
leia And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life --
finn Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--
leia Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
finn is startled -- poe jumps in
poe Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.
leia We're desperate for anything you can tell us.
finn That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast.
leia And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know.
chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. DR. KALONIA uses a device to help heal his shoulder. Chewie TALKS.
dr._kalonia That sounds very scary.
dr._kalonia You must be so brave.
chewie MOANS/TALKS 
c-3po General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.
leia I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.
han Leia...
leia Don't do that.
han Do what?
leia Anything.
c-3po Princesses.
han I'm trying to be helpful!
leia When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
han 
c-3po BB-8. You're wasting your time.
c-3po It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.
c-3po I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again.
han Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.
leia You think I want to forget him? I want him back!
han There was nothing we could've done. There was too much Vader in him.
leia That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
han We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at.
leia We both did.
han We lost our son, forever.
leia No.
leia It was Snoke. Han takes this in.
leia He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.
han If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?
leia Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it.
general_statura General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
rey Where am I?
kylo-ren You're my guest.
rey Where are the others?
kylo-ren You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends?
kylo-ren You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea.
kylo-ren You still want to kill me.
rey That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.
kylo-ren Tell me about the droid.
rey He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --
kylo-ren He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?
kylo-ren You know I can take whatever I want. Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
kylo-ren ... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island... Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge.
kylo-ren And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you.
rey -- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer.
kylo-ren I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but
rey I'm not giving you anything.
kylo-ren We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --
rey ... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader!
snoke This scavenger, resisted you?
kylo-ren She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke
snoke And the droid?
general_hux Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us.
general_hux That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already. Snoke is visibly furious.
snoke Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.
general_hux We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system.
snoke Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon.
kylo-ren Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance.
snoke If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me.
rey You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
stormtrooper_guard_#2 What did you say?
rey You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
stormtrooper_guard_#2 I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum!
rey You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
stormtrooper_guard_#2 I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
rey And you will drop your weapon.
stormtrooper_guard_#2 And I'll drop my weapon. 
kylo-ren NO!
general_hux Begin charging the weapon!
starkiller_technician Yes, sir. Weapon charging.
poe The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.
snap They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
brance A laser cannon?
snap We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.
major_ematt It's another Death Star.
poe I wish that were the case, Major.
poe This was the Death Star.
poe This is Starkiller Base. This is news to many here, and they're stunned.
han So it's big.
admiral_ackbar How is it possible to power a weapon of this size?
finn It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears.
leia The First Order they're charging the weapon again, now. Our system is the next target.
c-3po Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. They all react to this horrible news.
han Okay, how do we blow it up?
han There's always a way to do that.
leia Han's right. Han is surprised.
admiral_statura In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator...
finn There is one.
admiral_statura If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon.
major_ematt ... Maybe the planet.
poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the big hexagonal structure the Oscillator.
poe We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.
admiral_ackbar They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.
han We disable the shields.
han Kid, you worked there, what do you got?
finn I can do it.
han I like this guy.
finn I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet--
han We'll get you there.
leia Han, how?
han If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
poe So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! And everyone splits.
chewie MOANS/TALKS and finn follow han's orders as they prepare the falcon for one more daring run, maybe its last
han Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives.
finn Now you tell me?
leia No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. Han looks over, there's Leia.
han That's what I did it. So you'd miss me.
leia I did miss you. He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue
han It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh?
han Some of it was...good.
leia ... Pretty good.
han Some things never change.
leia True. You still drive me crazy. Han places his hands on her shoulders. It could be thirty years ago.
leia If you see our son again, bring him home.
stormtrooper Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area.
kylo-ren She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. Kylo exits.
finn How are we getting in?
han Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.
finn is suddenly filled with dread.
finn We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?!
chewie MOANS/TALKS, thinking it's crazy too, says HELL YES WE ARE!
han Alright, Chewie, get ready.
chewie groans 
han And Now!
chewie MOANS/TALKS 
chewie groans
han I AM PULLING UP!!! But the Falcon has no time 
han I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!
officer Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert.
kylo-ren Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to--
kylo-ren Han Solo...
finn The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way.
han What was your job when you were based here?
finn Sanitation.
han Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
finn I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
han People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--!
finn Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force!
han That's not how the Force works--!
chewie MOANS/TALKS
han Oh really, you're cold?
finn Come on!
general_hux Report.
first_order_officer Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir.
stormtrooper FN-9330 Hey! He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. wide ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead. Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a corner, wary.
han The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields?
finn I have an idea about that.
finn Remember me?
captain_phasma fn-2187. finn Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.
han Bring it down. Bring it down.
finn Follow me. 
finn You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.
captain_phasma You're making a big mistake.
finn Do it.
chewie MOANS/TALKS
finn Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.
han Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her.
captain_phasma You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.
finn I disagree. What do we do with her?
han Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?
finn Yeah, there is... an alert officerS at their consoles, OVERLAPPING, urgent.
officer General, their shields are down!
c-3po Thank the Maker!
leia Han did it! Send them in!
admiral_statura Give Poe full authorization to attack.
rear-admiral-gulch-black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call.
poe Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead.
yolo-ziff Dropping out of lightspeed.
poe Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get!
snap Approaching target.
general_hux Dispatch all squadrons...
colonel_datoo Yes, General.
poe Let's light it up!
lt_bastian Direct hit!
ello asty But no damage!
poe Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. 
poe Guys, we got a lot of company!
finn We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.
han You sure you're up for this?
finn Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to
finn Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan.

officer X-wings coming back for another round of attacks!
han Are you all right?
rey Yeah.
han Good.
finn What happened -- did he hurt you?
rey Finn. What are you doing here?!
finn We came back for you.
finn What'd he say?
rey ... That it was your idea.
finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.
rey Thank you.
finn How did you get away?
rey I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
han Escape now. Hug later.
snap I got one behind me. See it?
jess Yeah, I'm on it!
jess Furillo's been hit!
snap Watch out for ground fire!
han They're in trouble. We can't leave. My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em.
kaydel-ko-connix General, are you seeing this?
vober dand Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed.
c-3po And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now.
han That girl knows her stuff.
han We'll set the charges at every other column.
chewie MOANS/TALKS
han You're right. That's a better idea. You take the top.
han I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here.
kylo-ren Find them.
han Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns.
kylo-ren Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below.
han Take off that mask. You don't need it.
kylo-ren What do you think you'll see if I do?
han The face of my son.
kylo-ren Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him.
han That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive.
kylo-ren No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
han Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true.
kylo-ren It's too late.
han No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.
kylo-ren I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain.
kylo-ren I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?
han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.
han Yes. Anything.
kylo-ren Thank you.
finn Solo.
rey No, no.
admiral_ackbar The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional.
officer_tabala-zo Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes.
finn The Falcon's this way. Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. They look at each other. They both know
kylo-ren We're not done yet.
rey You're a monster!
kylo-ren It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you.
finn Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no...
finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF kylo ren'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO kylo ren, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.
kylo-ren TRAITOR! In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.
kylo-ren That lightsaber. It belongs to me!
finn Come get it.
niv-lek We just lost R-1!
jess We're overwhelmed! What do we do? it isn't working! another pilot looks down -- sees the explosion -- coming from the oscillator. relatively small, it's an opening
yolo ziff Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in!
