anakin There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .
obi-wan Look out, four droids inbound . . .
obi-wan We've got to split them up.
anakin Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
obi-wan Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
anakin Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
obi-wan Anakin, they're all over me!
anakin Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . We got him, Artoo!
anakin I copy, Artoo.
obi-wan I'm going down on the deck.
anakin Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
obi-wan Hurry up! I don't like this! Ouch! Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.
anakin We're locked on ... we've got him . . . Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
obi-wan Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...
anakin Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with vulture droids.
obi-wan I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
anakin Come on, Master.
obi-wan Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?
odd_ball Copy, Red Leader.
obi-wan Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .
odd_ball We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.
anakin This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.
obi-wan Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .
anakin I'm going head to head. See you.
obi-wan Take it easy, Anakin.
odd_ball I'm on your right, Red Leader.
anakin Incoming!!
obi-wan Five more on the right!
anakin Here we go.
obi-wan I'm going high and right.
anakin Hang on. There are four more of them.
obi-wan Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.
anakin I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
obi-wan All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
anakin How many back there. Artoo? Three . . . Four . . . that's not good.
obi-wan Anakin, you have four on your tail.
anakin I know. I know!
obi-wan Four more closing from your left.
anakin I know. I know!
obi-wan Break right and go high.
anakin I'm going low and left.
obi-wan He still has much to learn.
anakin Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .
obi-wan Too dangerous. First Jedi rule "Survive."
anakin Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.
obi-wan Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.
obi-wan You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.
anakin Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
obi-wan Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."
anakin Wrong thought, Artoo.
anakin I'm through.
odd_ball There are too many of them.
clone pilot 2 I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .
anakin I'm going to go help them out!
obi-wan No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
anakin Missiles! Pull up!
obi-wan They overshot us . . .
anakin They're coming around!
obi-wan All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
anakin Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
anakin We got 'em. Artoo!
obi-wan Flying is for droids.
obi-wan I'm hit! Anakin?
anakin I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
obi-wan Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .
obi-wan Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
anakin Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
obi-wan The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.
obi-wan In the name of ...
anakin Steady . . . steady . . .
obi-wan Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.
anakin I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .
obi-wan Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.
anakin Move to the right.
obi-wan Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.
anakin I'm not leaving without you, Master.
obi-wan Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
anakin Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
obi-wan Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.
anakin Yeah, you got him!
obi-wan Great, Artoo.
anakin Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
obi-wan Have you noticed the shields are still up?
anakin Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
obi-wan Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
obi-wan Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
anakin Tap into the ship's computers.
obi-wan The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
anakin I sense Count Dooku . . .
obi-wan I sense a trap.
anakin Next move?
obi-wan Spring the trap.
anakin Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
obi-wan Here, take this, and wait for orders.
general_grievous What's the situation, Captain?
captain TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
general_grievous Just as Count Dooku predicted.
bodyguard i General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.
obi-wan We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.
obi-wan Anakin. . .
anakin Ready.
obi-wan . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.
anakin Well then, we're safe for the time being.
obi-wan Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
anakin They're sealing this section off.
obi-wan Six droids coming our way!
anakin Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
obi-wan We'll never get through that. It's too small!
anakin I found our escape vent.
obi-wan Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.
anakin Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .
anakin Here's a way out.
obi-wan That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
anakin The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
obi-wan You still have much to learn, Anakin.
super_battle_droid r77 I have a bad feeling about this.
obi-wan All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!
anakin Destroyers!!
battle droid Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.
obi-wan Did you press the stop button?
anakin No, did you?
obi-wan No!
anakin Well, there's more than one way out of here.
obi-wan We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . . . . 31174 . . .
super_battle_droid_1 What's that?
super_battle_droid_2 Get back to work. It's nothing.
obi-wan Artoo?
obi-wan Always on the move.
obi-wan Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.
obi-wan Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.
droid 1 Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.
droid 2 Roger, roger.
super_battle_droid_1 There it is again.
obi-wan Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.
obi-wan Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!
super_battle_droid_1 Hey you!
obi-wan Now, that's better . . .
super_battle_droid_1 You stupid little astro droid!
obi-wan Oh, it's you . . .
anakin What was that all about?
obi-wan Well, Artoo has been . . .
anakin No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
obi-wan Did I say anything?
anakin He's trying!
obi-wan I didn't say anything!
obi-wan Chancellor.
anakin Are you all right?
palpatine Count Dooku.
obi-wan This time we will do it together.
anakin I was about to say that.
palpatine Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
obi-wan Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
obi-wan and anakin throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.
count_dooku Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
obi-wan and anakin move toward DOOKU.
obi-wan You won't get away this time, Dooku.
obi-wan and anakin charge count_dooku. A great sword fight ensues.
count_dooku I've been looking forward to this.
anakin My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
count_dooku Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
count_dooku Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.
count_dooku I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you donâ€™t use them.
palpatine Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
anakin I shouldn't . . .
palpatine Do it!!
anakin ... I couldn't stop myself.
palpatine You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
anakin Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
anakin I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
palpatine It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
palpatine Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.
anakin He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
palpatine Leave him, or we'll never make it.
anakin His fate will be the same as ours.
general_grievous Prepare for attack.
pilot All batteries fire! Fire!
anakin The elevator's not working, Artoo . . .
ARTOO BEEPS a response to anakin.
anakin . . . Activate Elevator 3224.
anakin Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!
pilot Reverse stabilizers.
pilot Magnetize! Magnetize!
anakin We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.
general_grievous Fire the emergency booster engines.
pilot Leveling out, sir.
anakin Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.
obi-wan Did I miss something?
anakin Hold on.
obi-wan What is that?
obi-wan Oops.
anakin Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
obi-wan Too late! Jump!
obi-wan Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.
anakin Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?
obi-wan and anakin lead palpatine down a hallway toward the hangar bay.
obi-wan None of those ships will get us anywhere.
anakin I agree.
palpatine What are we going to do?
anakin I don't know.
obi-wan Don't look at me. I don't know.
anakin Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
obi-wan We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.
anakin/obi-wan Well, that was close.
bodyguard General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.
general_grievous Activate ray shields.
anakin Ray shields!
obi-wan Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
anakin Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
obi-wan Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
anakin You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
obi-wan I'm open to suggestions here.
palpatine Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.
anakin I say . . . patience.
obi-wan Patience! That's your plan, is it?
anakin Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .
anakin See! No problem.
super_battle_droid Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.
obi-wan Do you have a plan B?
general_grievous Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.
obi-wan That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
general_grievous And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
anakin General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
general_grievous Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .
obi-wan Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.
general_grievous Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
obi-wan Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
anakin Artoo.
general_grievous Crush them! Make them suffer!
general_grievous Stay and watch your stations.
pilot Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.
general_grievous Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
obi-wan and anakin destroy the remaining DROIDS. general grievous retrieves one of the bodyguard'S staffs and faces obi-wan. anakin leaps over a console and lands behind general grievous.
general_grievous You lose, General Kenobi.
pilot The ship is breaking up!
general_grievous We've run out of time.
palpatine The hull is burning up!
general_grievous Time to abandon ship.
obi-wan and anakin go over to the navigator's chair.
anakin All the escape pods have been launched.
obi-wan Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
anakin You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
obi-wan Well?
anakin Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
obi-wan Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
ARTOO beeps.
anakin Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
obi-wan Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .
anakin We lost something.
obi-wan Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.
anakin Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
obi-wan Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
anakin What's our speed?
obi-wan Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .
ARTOO beeps
anakin Grab that . . . Keep us level.
obi-wan Steady. Steady.
anakin Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
obi-wan Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.
pilot We'll take you in.
obi-wan Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.
anakin We're coming in too hot.
obi-wan Easy-easy.
obi-wan Another happy landing.
anakin Are you coming, Master?
obi-wan Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
anakin Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
obi-wan Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
anakin All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
obi-wan . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
anakin All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
obi-wan Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.
mace_windu Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?
palpatine Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
mace_windu General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
palpatine That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
mace_windu Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
bail_organa Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
anakin Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
c-3po It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
ARTOO beeps.
c-3po Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
bail_organa The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.
anakin I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.
Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. anakin senses the figure.
bail_organa I'll do everything I can with the Senate.
anakin Excuse me.
bail_organa Certainly.
anakin stops, and bail goes off after palpatine and the others. anakin goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR padme AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.
padme Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
anakin I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
padme There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
anakin I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
padme Wait, not here . . .
anakin Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
padme Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
anakin I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
padme I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
anakin Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
padme I'm just excited to see you.
anakin That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
padme Nothing . . . nothing . . .
anakin You're frightened. Tell me what's going on!
padme You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
anakin . . . Is there someone else?
padme No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
anakin I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
padme I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
anakin It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
padme Something wonderful has happened.
padme I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
anakin That's . . . that's wonderful.
padme What are we going to do?
anakin We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.
super_battle_droid G21 The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.
general_grievous Good. Where is the Separatist Council?
super_battle_droid G21 This way, sir ...
general_grievous Yes, Lord Sidious.
darth_sidious General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.
general_grievous It will be done, My Lord.
darth_sidious The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.
general_grievous But the loss of Count Dooku?
darth_sidious His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.
anakin . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.
padme Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
anakin You are so beautiful!
padme It's only because I'm so in love . . .
anakin No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
padme So love has blinded you?
anakin Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .
padme But it's probably true!
anakin I haven't laughed in so long . . .
padme Neither have I.
padme Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.
padme Anakin??
padme What's bothering you?
anakin Nothing . . .
anakin I remember when I gave this to you.
padme Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
anakin It was a dream.
padme Bad?
anakin Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
padme And?
anakin It was about you.
padme Tell me.
anakin It was only a dream.
anakin You die in childbirth . . .
padme And the baby?
anakin I don't know.
padme It was only a dream.
anakin . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.
padme Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
anakin I know â€¦.
padme Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
anakin Have you told him anything?
padme No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
anakin He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!
padme I won't, Anakin.
anakin I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.
yoda Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
anakin They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
yoda Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
anakin Someone . . .
yoda . . . close to you?
anakin Yes.
yoda Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
anakin I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
yoda Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
anakin What must I do, Master Yoda?
yoda Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
obi-wan You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
anakin I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
obi-wan In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
anakin What's wrong then?
obi-wan The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
anakin Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
obi-wan Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.
anakin Be careful of what?
obi-wan He has requested your presence.
anakin What for?
obi-wan He would not say.
anakin He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
obi-wan All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.
anakin I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?
obi-wan The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.
palpatine Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.
anakin The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
palpatine They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.
anakin I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.
palpatine There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.
anakin With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.
palpatine Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.
anakin Everyone will agree on that.
palpatine Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.
anakin Of course.
palpatine I need your help, son.
anakin What do you mean?
palpatine I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.
anakin I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.
palpatine Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.
anakin For what? I don't understand.
palpatine To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .
palpatine Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
anakin Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
palpatine I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.
bail_organa Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.
fang_zar When did this happen?
bail_organa The decree was posted this morning.
padme Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
mon_mothma Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.
giddean_danu The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.
bail_organa We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.
terr_taneel What are you suggesting?
bail_organa I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.
mon_mothma We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.
bail_organa It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.
padme I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.
giddean_danu Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.
mon_mothma The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.
bail_organa We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .
padme Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.
bail_organa Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.
mon_mothma That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.
padme Agreed.
mace Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.
anakin I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
yoda Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
anakin I understand.
mace You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
anakin What?Â ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
mace Take a seat, young Skywalker.
anakin Forgive me, Master.
ki-adi-mundi We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
yoda Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
obi-wan It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.
mace We cannot take ships from the front line.
obi-wan And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.
yoda Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
ki-adi-mundi What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
mace It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
obi-wan He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
anakin I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
mace Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
yoda Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
mace It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.
anakin What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!
obi-wan Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
anakin I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
obi-wan But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
anakin That has nothing to do with this.
obi-wan Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.
anakin You mean divided loyalties.
obi-wan I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
anakin The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
obi-wan No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.
anakin Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
obi-wan I hope so . . .
anakin I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
obi-wan Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
anakin And?
obi-wan Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
anakin What situation?
obi-wan The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
anakin They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
obi-wan We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
anakin Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
obi-wan This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
anakin The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
obi-wan That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
anakin Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
obi-wan Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
anakin You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
obi-wan The Council is asking you.
obi-wanÂ  Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
yoda Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
mace It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.
obi-wan He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.
mace I wish I did.
obi-wan With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
mace So the prophecy says.
yoda A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
obi-wan He will not let me down. He never has.
yoda I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
padme Thank you, Captain.
captain_TYPHO Rest well. My Lady.
captain_TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach padme as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. c-3po is standing nearby.
padme I'll be up in a while.
motee Yes, my lady.
c-3po Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
padme Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
anakin Beautiful, isn't it?
padme You startled me.
anakin How are you feeling?
padme He keeps kicking.
anakin He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
padme My motherly intuition.
anakin Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
padme I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
anakin I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
padme Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
anakin They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
padme Anakin . . .
anakin Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
padme Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
anakin What do you mean?
padme What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
anakin I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
padme Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
anakin Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
padme What is it?
anakin Nothing.
padme Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
anakin You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.
anakin I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
padme I sense there are things you are not telling me.
padme smiles. anakin is a little embarrassed.
padme Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.
anakin You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
palpatine Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
anakin At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
palpatine I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far â€¦ but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.
anakin They try.
palpatine Sit down, Leave us.
palpatine Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
anakin I'm not sure I understand.
palpatine You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.
anakin I don't think . . .
palpatine Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
anakin I know they don't trust you . . .
palpatine Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
anakin I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
palpatine Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
palpatine They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
anakin I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
palpatine Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.
anakin The Jedi use their power for good.
palpatine Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .
anakin . . . evil.
palpatine . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
anakin The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
palpatine And the Jedi don't?
anakin The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
palpatine smiles.
palpatine Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
anakin I'm not sure it's wrong.
palpatine Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.
palpatine Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
anakin No.
palpatine I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
anakin He could actually save people from death?
palpatine The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
anakin What happened to him?
palpatine He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
anakin Is it possible to learn this power?
palpatine Not from a Jedi.
ki-adi-mundi Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.
mace How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
anakin A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
yoda Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
obi-wan Does everyone agree?
All the JEDI concur.
anakin The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
mace The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
ki-adi-mundi Yes, this decision is ours to make.
yoda A Master is needed, with more experience.
mace Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
anakin He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
anakin No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
obi-wan Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
yoda Obi-Wan, my choice is.
ki-adi-mundi I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
yoda I agree.
All the JEDI concur.
mace Very well. Council is adjourned.
mace Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.
clone commander gree The droids have started up their main power generators.
yoda Then now the time is, Commander.
clone commander gree Yes, sir.
obi-wan Has Anakin been to see you?
padme Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
obi-wan I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.
padme You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?
obi-wan You should be a Jedi, Padme.
padme You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
obi-wan It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
padme Why would he talk to me about his work?
obi-wan Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
padme Don't give me that look.
obi-wan I know how he feels about you.
padme What did he say?
obi-wan Nothing. He didn't have to.
padme I don't know what you're talking about.
obi-wan I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.
obi-wan I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .
obi-wan Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .
padme Thank you, Obi-Wan.
obi-wan Please do what you can to help him.
padme We cannot let this turn into another war.
bail_organa Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.
mon_mothma We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.
padme I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
bana_breemu That would be dangerous.
mon_mothma We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.
padme I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
giddean_danu Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.
padme The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .
chi_eekway Patience, Senator.
fang_zar We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.
bana_breemu When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.
bail_organa Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.
anakin You're going to need me on this one, Master.
obi-wan Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
anakin Master!
anakin Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
obi-wan You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.
obi-wan Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.
anakin Well, there's always a first time.
anakin Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
obi-wan Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
clone_commander_cody Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.
obi-wan I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.
clone_commander_cody Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?
obi-wan Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.
clone_commander_cody That was Anakin who was late. I believe.
obi-wan Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.
clone_commander_cody I'm counting on you.
palpatine Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
anakin He will soon have Grievous's head.
palpatine We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.
anakin The Council was very sure in its decision.
jar_jar Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
anakin Hi, Jar Jar.
jar_jar Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.
palpatine There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.
anakin Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
palpatine They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.
anakin That's ridiculous. Who?!?
palpatine No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.
anakin That's impossible. I would know.
palpatine Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.
palpatine Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.
obi-wan Save your energy.
padme I can't!
obi-wan Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .
anakin I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
padme He came by this morning.
anakin What did he want?
padme He's worried about you.
anakin You told him about us, didn't you?
padme He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
anakin And he's not?
padme You have been moody lately.
anakin I'm not moody . . .
padme Anakin! Don't do this again.
anakin I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
padme Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
anakin Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
padme They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
anakin Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
padme You expect too much of yourself.
anakin I have found a way to save you.
padme Save me?
anakin From my nightmares.
padme Is that what's bothering you?
anakin I won't lose you, Padme.
padme I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
anakin No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
padme You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.
tion_medon Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
obi-wan Unfortunately, the war.
tion_medon There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.
obi-wan With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
tion_medon He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
obi-wan I understand.
tion_medon The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .
obi-wan Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.
obi-wan Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.
tion_medon I told you, all he wanted was fuel.
bodyguard What was his name?
tion_medon He didn't say.
obi-wan also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.
obi-wan I need transportation.
wrangler You need transportation.
obi-wan Get it for me.
wrangler I will get it for you.
obi-wan This one.
wrangler Boga. She answers to Boga.
obi-wan Good girl, Boga.
general_grievous It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.
nute_gunray Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
general_grievous Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.
obi-wan Hello, there!
general_grievous General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, Kill him!
general_grievous Enough of this.
general_grievous Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
obi-wan Your move.
general_grievous You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.
obi-wan You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
obi-wan I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.
general_grievous Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
obi-wan I don't think so.
palpatine I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.
padme May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?
palpatine I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .
padme You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
palpatine You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.
fangzar But surely . . .
palpatine I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.
padme On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.
palpatine I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.
palpatine Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.
anakin What do you mean?
palpatine They are not to be trusted.
anakin Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
palpatine These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.
anakin I'm sure you're mistaken.
palpatine I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
anakin I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
palpatine Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.
clone_commander_cody Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.
mace_windu Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
anakin Yes, Master.
mace_windu I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
ki-adi-mundi If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.
mace_windu That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .
ki-adi-mundi . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.
yoda To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
anakin Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.
palpatine We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
anakin I should be there with him.
palpatine It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
anakin I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
palpatine They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
anakin How do you know the ways of the Force?
palpatine My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.
anakin You know the dark side?!?
palpatine Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
anakin I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
palpatine Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
anakin What did you say?
palpatine Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .
anakin You're a Sith Lord!
palpatine I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
anakin You're wrong!
palpatine Are you going to kill me?
anakin I would certainly like to.
palpatine I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
anakin I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
palpatine Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
anakin I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
palpatine You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.
palpatine I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .
obi-wan and general grievous race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.
general_grievous Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.
obi-wan So uncivilized . . .
anakin Master Windu, I must talk to you.
mace_windu What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
anakin He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
mace_windu A Sith Lord?
anakin Yes. The one we have been looking for.
mace_windu How do you know this?
anakin He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
mace_windu Are you sure?
anakin Absolutely.
mace_windu Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
anakin Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
mace_windu For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
anakin I must go, Master.
mace_windu No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
anakin Yes, Master.
mace_windu Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
anakin Yes, Master.
palpatine You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.
padme I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
c-3po My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
anakin I can't do this ... I can't let her die.
palpatine Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.
mace_windu In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
palpatine Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
mace The Senate will decide your fate.
palpatine I am the Senate!
mace Not yet!
palpatine It's treason, then.
Jedi Master mace WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. palpatine is able to use the Force to slam mace against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.
mace_windu You are under arrest, My Lord.
palpatine Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.
mace_windu You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .
palpatine No! No! You will die!
palpatine He is a traitor, Anakin.
mace_windu He's the traitor. Stop him!
palpatine Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.
mace_windu Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
palpatine You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.
mace_windu Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
palpatine I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.
mace_windu Don't listen to him, Anakin.
palpatine Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .
palpatine I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.
mace_windu You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
anakin You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
mace_windu He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.
palpatine I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.
anakin It is not the Jedi way . . .
anakin He must live . . .
palpatine Please don't, please don't . . .
anakin I need him . . .
palpatine Please don't . . .
anakin NO!!!
palpatine Power! Unlimited power!
anakin What have I done?
palpatine You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
anakin I will do whatever you ask.
palpatine Good.
anakin Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
palpatine To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
anakin I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
palpatine Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.
anakin Thank you. my Master.
palpatine Rise, Darth Vader.
palpatine Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
anakin I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
palpatine Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?
anakin I understand, Master.
palpatine We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
anakin What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
palpatine Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
obi-wan Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.
clone_commander_cody Very good, sir.
clone_commander_cody Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.
obi-wan Thank you, Cody, Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.
clone_commander_cody Yes, sir!
obi-wan and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
darth_sidious Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
clone_commander_cody It will be done, My Lord.
clone_commander_cody Blast him!
darth_sidious Commander 1138 . . .
clone commander bacara Yes, sir.
darth_sidious The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
clone commander bacara It will be done, My Lord.
aayla Steady. . . . steady . . .
aayla Bly, do you think they're Droids?
bly No.
darth-sidious Execute Order Sixty-Six.
CLONE pilot It will be done, My Lord.
plo_koon heads his ship toward a battle on a landing platform.
plo_koon There they are. Land on the nearest platform.
clone commander gree Yes, My Lord.
darth_sidious The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
clone commander gree It will be done, My Lord.
clone commander gree snaps his comlink shut.
younglings Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?
c-3po and padme look out the apartment window.
c-3po The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.
bail_organa What's going on here?!?
clone_sergeant There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.
clone_sergeant I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.
clone_sergeant It's time for you to leave, sir.
bail_organa And so it is.
clone commander appo Get him! Shoot him!
AT-ST clone sergeant Everyone out of there!
creature Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee.
clone_sergeant Did you find something?
creature It's nothing, nothing.
clone_sergeant It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.
clone trooper Yes, sir.
creature Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.
yoda Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
yoda Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .
yoda Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
royal guard Identification . . .
bail_organa Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.
bail_organa Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?
captain_ANTILLES Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.
bail_organa That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
CLONE captain Did you find Kenobi?
clone trooper No one could have survived that fall.
CLONE captain Start loading your men on the ship.
clone trooper Yes, sir.
obi-wan Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .
bail . . . Kenobi . . .
obi-wan I've locked on. Repeat.
bail_organa Master Kenobi??
obi-wan Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.
bail_organa We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.
c-3po My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.
threepio Hush! Not so loud!
padme Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
anakin I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
padme Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
c-3po What is going on?
ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.
c-3po You can't be anymore confused than I am.
anakin The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
padme I can't believe that!
anakin I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
c-3po Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.
ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. c-3po puts his fingers to his lips.
c-3po Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.
ARTOO BEEPS quietly.
c-3po Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
padme Anakin, what are you going to do?
anakin I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
padme What about Obi-Wan?
anakin I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
padme How could this have happened?, f
anakin The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
padme What are you saying?
anakin You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
padme What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
anakin That won't happen. I won't let it.
padme Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
anakin Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.
anakin Please, wait for me.
padme I will.
c-3po Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.
ARTOO beeps.
c-3po Take care, my little friend.
ARTOO BEEPS 
c-3po My Lady, is there anything I might do?
padme No thank you, Threepio.
g-3po A snack, perhaps?
padme No.
c-3po I feel so helpless.
bail_organa You made it.
yoda Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
obi-wan You were attacked by your Clones, also?
yoda With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
obi-wan How many other Jedi managed to survive?
yoda Heard from no one, have we.
bail_organa I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.
obi-wan Have we had any contact from the Temple?
yoda Received a coded retreat message, we have.
bail_organa It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .
obi-wan Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
bail_organa It's too dangerous to return.
yoda Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
obi-wan Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.
yoda I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
nute_gunray The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.
darth-sidious You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.
pilot We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.
bail_organa Send it through.
pilot Yes, sir.
mas_amedda Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
bail_organa Tell the Chancellor I will be there.
mas_amedda Very well. He will be expecting you.
bail_organa It could be a trap.
obi-wan No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
yoda If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
guard Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?
bail_organa Certainly.
guard Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.
obi-wan It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.
guard It would be better if they stayed with you.
anakin Artoo . . . stay with the ship.
ARTOO BEEP 
nute_gunray Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.
obi-wan There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.
yoda Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
palpatine . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.
bail_organa I was held up. What's happening?
padme The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.
bail_organa That's not true!
padme He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.
bail_organa And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.
palpatine The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test.
obi-wan Not even the younglings survived.
yoda Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
obi-wan . . .Who?? Who could have done this?
palpatine The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.
palpatine The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.
padme Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.
palpatine In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.
palpatine An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .
palpatine An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .
padme So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .
bail_organa We cannot let this happen.
padme Not now! There will be a time.
rune haako Stop! Enough, this is not right!
nute_gunray The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .
obi-wan I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
yoda Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
obi-wan Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .
yoda If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
obi-wan I must know the truth, Master.
obi-wan It can't be . . . It can't be . . .
anakin The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
darth_sidious Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?
anakin Yes, My Master.
darth_sidious Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.
obi-wan I can't watch any more.
yoda Destroy the Sith, we must.
obi-wan Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
yoda To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
obi-wan He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
yoda Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
obi-wan How could it have come to this?
yoda To question, no time there is.
obi-wan I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.
yoda Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
obi-wan May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.
c-3po Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.
obi-wan Has Anakin been here . . .Â ?
c-3po Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
padme Master Kenobi . . .
padme Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
obi-wan The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
padme I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.
obi-wan I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
padme The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
obi-wan No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
padme The Sith!?!
obi-wan I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
padme Yesterday.
obi-wan And do you know where he is now?
padme No.
obi-wan Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.
padme From the Sith?
obi-wan From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.
padme You're wrong! How could you even say that?
obi-wan I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
padme Not Anakin! He couldn't!
obi-wan He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
padme I don't believe you ... I can't.
obi-wan Padme, I must find him.
padme You're going to kill him, aren't you?
obi-wan He has become a very great threat.
padme I can't . . .
obi-wan Anakin is the father, isn't he?
obi-wan I'm so sorry.
captain_TYPHO My Lady, let me come with you.
padme There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.
TYPHO bows.
captain_TYPHO As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
padme I'll be all right, Captain.
padme This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
c-3po Oh, dear.
c-3po Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
darth-vader The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.
darth_sidious It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.
darth-vader Thank you, My Master.
darth_sidious Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.
darth-vader Very good, My Lord.
anakin Padme, I saw your ship . . .
padme Oh, Anakin!
anakin It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
padme I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
anakin What things?
padme He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
anakin Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
padme He cares about us.
anakin Us??!
padme He knows . . . He wants to help you.
anakin Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
padme Anakin, all I want is your love.
anakin Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
padme At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
anakin I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
padme Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
anakin Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
padme I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
anakin I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
padme I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow.
anakin Because of Obi-Wan?
padme Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
anakin Liar!
padme No!
anakin You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
padme NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
obi-wan Let her go, Anakin.
anakin What have you and she been up to?
obi-wan Let her go!
anakin You turned her against me.
obi-wan You have done that yourself.
anakin You will not take her from me.
obi-wan Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
obi-wan You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
anakin Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
obi-wan Your new Empire?
anakin Don't make me kill you.
obi-wan Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
anakin If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
obi-wan Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
anakin You will try.
ARTOO BEEPS 
yoda I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
darth_sidious Master Yoda, you survived.
yoda Surprised?
darth_sidious Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
c-3po What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!
darth_sidious I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
yoda Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
yoda At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
yoda If so powerful you are, why leave??
darth_sidious You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
yoda Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
anakin Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.
obi-wan I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.
obi-wan The flaw of power is arrogance.
anakin You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
obi-wan and anakin lock sabers. obi-wan puts out his hand to use the Force to push anakin away. anakin puts out his hand to block obi-wan.
yoda Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.
yoda Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
bail_organa There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.
clone commander thire There is no sign of his body, sir.
mas_amedda Then he is not dead.
palpatine Double your search.
clone commander thire Yes sir. Right away, sir.
palpatine Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.
mas_amedda Yes, Master.
palpatine I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
obi-wan and anakin battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both anakin and obi-wan run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
yoda Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
c-3po I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.
obi-wan and anakin continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. anakin, standing on the Droid, approaches obi-wan on the work platform.
obi-wan I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.
anakin I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
obi-wan From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
anakin From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
obi-wan Well, then you are lost!
anakin This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
obi-wan It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
anakin You underestimate my power!
obi-wan Don't try it.
obi-wan . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
anakin I hate you!
obi-wan You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.
c-3po Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.
padme Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?
darth-sidious Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.
CLONE captain Yes sir. Right away.
yoda Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...
qui-gon Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.
yoda Eternal consciousness.
qui-gon The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.
yoda . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
qui-gon You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.
yoda A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
bail_organa Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.
bail_organa We'll take her to the medical center, quickly.
medical_droid Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
obi-wan She's dying?
medical_droid We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
bail_organa Babies??!!
medical_droid She's carrying twins.
yoda Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
c-3po It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
obi-wan Don't give up, Padme.
medical_droid It's a boy.
padme Luke . . .
padme can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.
medical_droid ... and a girl.
padme . . . Leia.
obi-wan You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.
padme I can't . . .
obi-wan Save your energy.
padme Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
medical_droid My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.
darth-sidious Good. Good.
darth-sidious Lord Vader, can you hear me?
darth-vader Yes, My Master.
darth-vader Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?
darth-sidious I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.
darth-vader I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!
yoda Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
obi-wan We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
yoda Split up, they should be.
bail_organa My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.
obi-wan And what of the boy?
yoda To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
obi-wan I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
yoda Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.
yoda Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
obi-wan Training??
yoda An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
obi-wan Who?
yoda One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
obi-wan Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
yoda The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
obi-wan I will be able to talk with him?
yoda How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.
bail_organa Captain Antilles.
captain_ANTILLES Yes, Your Highness.
bail_organa I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped.
c-3po Oh, no.
