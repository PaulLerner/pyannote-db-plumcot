Palmer and Jack finally meet for the first time and discuss Operation Nightfall. Nina talks to Teri about her and Jack's past relationship after they reach the safehouse.
On the day of the California Presidential Primary, between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, Senator David Palmer calls Alan Opticam from Pentagon to break the protocol of an internal investigation in CTU conducted by Regional Director Ryan Chappelle and have a meeting with Jack Bauer. After clarifying the misunderstand about the incident in the power plant with Jack, the Senator discovers that the attempt is not related to the election process or racism, but just a revenge against the Operation Nightfall, which was ordered by him. They call Robert Ellis in New Orleans and explain that someone close to Victor Drazen seems to have connected David Palmer to Jack Bauer and wants revenge on the day of the second anniversary of Nightfall. Ellis sends a couple of missing files and they disclose that Drazen's wife and daughter were in the bunker that was exploded. Palmer forces Chappelle to reinstate Jack Bauer to his position in a provisional status for the rest of the day. Meanwhile Elizabeth is seduced by Drazen's brother and unintentionally provided information about David Palmer and his family. In the safe-house, Teri unravels the past relationship of Nina and Jack.
