Director Green and Regional Director Ryan Chappelle question Jack about the day's events. Nina takes Kim and Teri to a safe house after getting them medical attention. Palmer wants a meeting with Jack.
On the day of the California Presidential Primary, between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM, Jack is questioned by Regional Director Ryan Chappelle first and then by Alberta Green, before being sent to the Justice Department. Nina goes to the clinic to protect Teri and Kim that are having medical attention; she sees a suspect and asks Alberta permission to take the women to a safe-house. Tony discloses that three backup shooters have arrived to Los Angeles and suggests that Senator David Palmer should leave the city. Tony is seduced by Alberta with a promotion to blame Jack, but he defends Jack's attitudes to Chappelle. Kevin and Gaines's men are executed by a killer following Drazen's order. David Palmer asks for information about Jack Bauer and surprisingly he arrives in CTU requesting a meeting with the suspect.
