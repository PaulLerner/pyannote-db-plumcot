Jack meets up with Teri at the hospital where they wait to talk to Janet about Kim. Palmer confronts his family about the cover up.
On the day of the California Presidential Primary, between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM, Jack Bauer asks for security in the hospital for Janet, who is recovering from a cardiac arrest in the surgery, since he believes her life is in danger. Kim helps Rick to bury Dean. Carl tells David Palmer that he had covered up what Keith did with Gibson and Sherry knew. He finds that Nicole also knew that Keith killed Gibson, and feeling that he is losing more than the election, he goes to the campaign advisor of the party Mike Novick and tells him the truth. Mike tells David to disclose the truth to the press early in the morning before Maureen Kingsley since the electors could forgive him. Jack goes to the hospital, tells the truth to Teri and explains that the wall he had built between his work and his family was falling apart. Ira Gaines calls Jack and forces him to leave the hospital. Meanwhile Alan, who actually works for Gaines, kills Janet and lures Teri, driving her to a distant location to meet Kim. Teri receives a phone call from Nina telling the ID of the body found in the trunk of Penticoff's car.
