Jack trails a suspect while his supervisor has ordered C.T.U. to bring both of them in.
Jack continues to trail the suspect but Driscoll is against it. She orders everyone at C.T.U. to locate and capture Jack Bauer and the hostile he is tracking. He calls Chloe and asks for satellite coverage due to the fact that they are nearing the canyons. She agrees. The hostile Jack is tracking and two other men torture Andrew Paige, and just before the two men can kill him, Jack intervenes and snipes them. He continues to follow the hostile until he goes into a gas station. Jack urges Chloe to hurry but she says it'll take a little longer. Jack figures he needs to keep the hostile in there. He dons a mask and enters, ordering everyone to put their hands up. He is going to rob it to prevent the hostile from getting back on the road.
