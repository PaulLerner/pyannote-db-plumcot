On the day of the California Presidential Primary, between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, Teri contacts Nina, leaves the line open without hanging up the phone, while Nina tries to trace the call but the battery runs out. Jamey dies and the arrogant Alberta Green assumes CTU. The spiteful Sherry calls Carl Webb and asks him to get rid off the problem. Jack chases Ted Cofell following a lead through an e-mail to Jamey.
