CTU uncovers evidence that seemingly links Jack Bauer to the assassination of David Palmer. In a bid to clear his name, Jack enlists the help of Chloe O'Brian as they head to Wayne Palmer's apartment, the site of the assassination, to see what evidence they can find. Meanwhile, Walt Cummings looks in to the phone call Martha Logan received from David Palmer the night before and a terrorist group continues to set their plans for the day in to motion.
