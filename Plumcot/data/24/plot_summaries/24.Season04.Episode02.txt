Jack is in trouble with his supervisor, and he's on the trail of a killer.
Secretary Heller and his daughter Audrey Raines have been kidnapped. Jack believes the only chance of finding them lies in intercepting Andrew Paige before the terrorists do. Behrooz Araz is ordered by his father to deliver a suitcase stolen from the train bombing site to Heller's location. Richard Heller becomes a suspect and is interrogated by Curtis Manning at CTU.
Jack is detained for torturing a suspect, but gains leverage because of Andrew Paige, the computer programmer that stumbled on the Internet site. Jack asks to be reinstated if Driscoll wants the kid picked up. She reluctantly agrees. Behrooz Araz delivers a mysterious briefcase to the site where Heller is. However, his girlfriend Debbie Pendelton sees the warehouse, but doesn't know that that is where Heller is being kept. Jack and Ronnie are furious to discover that a terrorist picked Andrew up before them. They argue whether they should trail him or bring him in for questioning. They have a quick fight and Ronnie cold cocks Jack. He chains him to a pipe and decides to intercept the hostile, but is shot and killed. Jack frees himself and quickly gets to his vehicle and trails the suspect. A web cast of Heller is displayed over the Internet, saying that he will be put on trial in less that three hours.
