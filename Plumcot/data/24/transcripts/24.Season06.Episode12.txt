
not_available How soon can we deploy once we arrive? It will take us two hours to assemble the delivery system and another hour to install the bomb.
not_available Longer than I'd hoped.
not_available Remember, without us you'd be delivering your payload in weeks instead of hours.
not_available If we succeed today, the Arabs and the West will destroy each other.
not_available Did you pick up anything on Gredenko? 
not_available No.
not_available Glasgow Street house was deserted.
not_available I might have a lead.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Charles Logan.
not_available Logan? He's at his retreat under house arrest.
not_available So, you need Gredenko to find Fayed.
not_available Can you help us? I never dealt with him directly, but I know how we can find him.
not_available How? 
not_available Anatoly Markov.
not_available He's the Russian consul general in Los Angeles.
not_available I don't trust you.
not_available If you wanna find Gredenko, maybe it's time you started.
not_available You're taking a great risk, Mr President.
not_available You and I both share in that risk, sir.
not_available We have three nuclear weapons loose in my country.
not_available I want a statement of support from your prime minister, right on the heels of Assad's.
not_available A public endorsement could have grave political consequences for the prime minister.
not_available Tell your prime minister we have a carrier group operating less than 25 miles off his shores.
not_available It's armed.
not_available The president's gonna die.
not_available There's nothing you can do about it.
not_available You've got to put a stop to this.
not_available There must have been a moment when you were on board.
not_available Did you change your mind? I need to know.
not_available I was against you from the start.
not_available You're just as bad as Fayed.
not_available All right.
not_available Here we go for a run
not_available through, everyone.
not_available What is this? Bomb! Citadel has been hit.
not_available Send a medical team.
not_available Citadel is down.
not_available Send a medical team now.
not_available This is Hawkins.
not_available We've reached emergency med bay with the president.
not_available I want you to stay posted outside.
not_available Understood? 
not_available Sir.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let me be clear about this before we go.
not_available You are a federal prisoner.
not_available Do not make a move unless I tell you to, understand? You don't have to threaten me, Jack.
not_available I know what my role is.
not_available I just want to be of service.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, you'll never do anything that will erase what you've already done.
not_available I understand your anger, I do, but if you wanna find Gredenko, we should leave now.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available I haven't been outside these gates in over a year You don't need me to tell you what it's like to be locked up.
not_available You're right, I don't.
not_available I know how it feels to be locked away from the rest of the world.
not_available Lonely the silence It plays with your sanity.
not_available But in that silence you can hear the voice of your deepest self.
not_available And if you listen to that voice, you have a chance to heal.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Bill.
not_available Are you on your way to the consulate? Yes.
not_available You need to know something.
not_available There was an assassination attempt on President Palmer.
not_available He was wounded, but we don't know the extent yet.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available How did this happen? The details are still coming in.
not_available Secret Service thinks it was Assad.
not_available What? 
not_available They think he smuggled in a device.
not_available That doesn't make sense.
not_available Assad was working with the president to stop Fayed.
not_available So he said.
not_available He wasn't lying.
not_available He's dead, Jack.
not_available It doesn't matter if it was him or not.
not_available He can't help us stop Fayed, which means you're following our only live lead.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I'm at the consulate.
not_available What happened? There was an assassination attempt on Wayne Palmer.
not_available Replace it.
not_available Good.
not_available Get rid of that.
not_available Make sure you count and bag the shrapnel 
not_available Excuse me, Mr Pollock.
not_available Yes.
not_available What do you want? The vice president is being telebriefed.
not_available The sec dep wants Mr Lennox there.
not_available Well, Mr Lennox is occupied.
not_available I'm covering for him.
not_available Dr Welton is monitoring medical teams.
not_available I've asked him to brief us directly on the president's condition.
not_available Mr Vice President.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We're stabilising the president.
not_available He was hit by shrapnel which entered his upper chest and neck.
not_available He didn't suffer head wounds, but he is unconscious.
not_available Can you determine when he might be able to resume his duties? Sir, the president was within ten feet of a high
not_available velocity explosive device.
not_available That he survived at all is a miracle.
not_available Mr Vice President, as secretary of defense, I am the ranking member of this committee.
not_available And I think I can speak for all of us when I say we have no way of knowing when or if the president will recover enough to function.
not_available We need to proceed under the assumption that the president's duties are now yours.
not_available I'll be landing in a few minutes.
not_available When I get there, I want a full security briefing from Tom Lennox.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We'll see you here soon.
not_available Please submit your task profiles to my office.
not_available We'll reconvene when the vice president gets here.
not_available Reed.
not_available Where the hell is Tom Lennox? 
not_available I believe he's with the attorney general.
not_available I spoke with the AG.
not_available He's had no contact with him.
not_available Hm Well, then, I I'm not sure.
not_available You work for the man but don't know where he is? President Palmer was expecting him in the broadcast studio and he didn't show up.
not_available Tom Lennox is missing.
not_available Have your team sweep the bunker.
not_available Find him.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This is a priority request from the sec dep.
not_available You had the clarity to understand how to keep this country safe.
not_available But the president was an obstacle.
not_available We did what was necessary.
not_available Is he dead? No, but he's injured badly enough that he won't be able to serve.
not_available Secret Service is looking for Lennox.
not_available They're sweeping the bunker.
not_available Let me handle him.
not_available No.
not_available I told you before, I can make it look like a suicide.
not_available The situation supports it.
not_available He was depressed after the president rejected his plan 
not_available No.
not_available We cannot kill Tom Lennox.
not_available Why not? Because we're not murderers.
not_available What we did was necessary for the sake of national security.
not_available Killing Lennox is just about us trying to cover our involvement.
not_available Getting caught? Never part of the plan.
not_available Don't touch him.
not_available Or what? Or you'll have to kill me too.
not_available Listen, I know Tom Lennox.
not_available He can be reasoned with.
not_available So you really did it? 
not_available Only because it had to be done.
not_available You were the one who warned us all that the logic of this current engagement would demand extreme action.
not_available You said, for the greater good, individuals would need to be sacrificed.
not_available I wasn't referring to the President of the United States.
not_available Sir, the president's policies would have aided the enemy.
not_available They were well
not_available intentioned, but they were naive and dangerous, and you know that.
not_available Vice President Daniels is running this country now.
not_available He will implement your security plan.
not_available But if you implicate us, it will only drag you into this, and it will make your plan harder to push through.
not_available I'm the one who tried to stop you, Reed.
not_available They'll never believe you.
not_available The only way to stop these nuclear weapons being detonated on US soil is through the proposals in your security plan.
not_available And all I have to do is do nothing? Yes.
not_available Carson has matched the bomb signature to a design used by Assad's organisation.
not_available The FBI will put this all on Assad.
not_available No one needs to know the truth.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Sir, a guilty conscience is a fair price to pay for the survival of this country.
not_available They're coming.
not_available Do you understand the situation, sir? 
not_available I do understand, Reed.
not_available I know that you will do the right thing.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm gonna cut him loose.
not_available Mr Lennox, are you all right? 
not_available Yes, Agent Lowry.
not_available Sir, the secretary of defense has been looking for you.
not_available Lowry, these men are responsible for the attempted assassination.
not_available I'm surrendering myself until I talk to the attorney general, but I want them arrested.
not_available Welcome back, sir.
not_available Thank you, Lisa.
not_available I've sifted through the latest flashes you need to look at.
not_available I went over them.
not_available I want to follow up on the one from CTU.
not_available I'll get them on the line.
not_available CTU.
not_available I have the vice president for Mr Buchanan.
not_available Hold, please.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan.
not_available Sir, one moment for the vice president.
not_available I see from the White House flashes that President Palmer granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough.
not_available I'm curious as to what circumstances could possibly have led to that.
not_available Logan claims he can help us find Dmitri Gredenko, the man who supplied terrorists with nukes.
not_available How? 
not_available Through the Russian consul.
not_available Logan believes this man can find Gredenko.
not_available He insisted on approaching the consul.
not_available I'm surprised President Palmer trusted Charles Logan to conduct any business for the government.
not_available I believe the president's decision was informed by the fact we have no active leads.
not_available Is Logan being supervised? 
not_available Yes.
not_available By one of our agents, Jack Bauer.
not_available Bauer will keep Logan on a short leash.
not_available You keep me posted to any progress.
not_available As soon as this plays out, I want him back under arrest.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Come with me into the consulate, but I need to speak to Markov alone.
not_available Don't leave my sight.
not_available Then this is a waste.
not_available He won't tell us what we need to know if you're there.
not_available I don't let you out of my sight.
not_available What do you think I'll do, request asylum? If it's any comfort, I don't think the Russians would take me.
not_available Fine.
not_available You can talk to the consul on your own, but I will be right outside the door.
not_available You try and move more than I'm gonna prove you wrong, Jack.
not_available I'm only trying to help.
not_available The consul is expecting you, Mr President.
not_available Follow me, please.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Anatoly.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available It's a pleasure, sir.
not_available How have you been? Very well.
not_available Still trying to do my best for my country, as much as circumstances will allow.
not_available Of course.
not_available My sincere sympathies to your people for the tragedy this morning.
not_available You have the condolences and support of my country.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now how can I help you? The bomb that exploded was a Russian suitcase nuclear device, supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I don't smoke any more.
not_available Mr President, those weapons were destroyed as part of our treaty.
not_available We're certain of our facts, Anatoly.
not_available But I didn't come here to make accusations.
not_available I came here because we need to know where Gredenko is.
not_available I will ask Moscow to try to locate him immediately.
not_available I'm not asking Moscow, I'm asking you.
not_available I know that you are close, and you have been since you fought together in Afghanistan.
not_available So, I ask again, where is he? I don't know.
not_available Dmitri and I were close for many years, but not now.
not_available Forgive my lack of diplomacy, but I don't believe you, and I'm willing to force the issue.
not_available Moscow has always suspected that someone inside the Russian government helped supply the Sentox nerve gas to the separatists two years ago.
not_available I have the tapes, Anatoly, of every phone call you made to my people.
not_available I will send them to President Suvarov.
not_available You gave me your word that my role would remain secret.
not_available My promise was rendered null and void by the fact that the terrorists that Gredenko is helping have three more bombs.
not_available I haven't spoken to Gredenko for more than one year.
not_available I will send the tapes.
not_available You will be recalled to Moscow and you will never be heard of again.
not_available You can send all the tapes you like, destroy me many times over.
not_available I do not know where Gredenko is.
not_available All right, Anatoly.
not_available I believe you.
not_available Please forgive my tactics.
not_available I'm trying to save people's lives.
not_available So, if you know anyone else who might still be in contact with Gredenko I will make calls.
not_available But, as far as I know, everyone else has cut off contact with Dmitri as well.
not_available Any support would be greatly appreciated.
not_available Of course.
not_available Anatoly.
not_available Mr President.
not_available We're moving.
not_available He says he hasn't spoken to Gredenko in a year.
not_available He's lying.
not_available They're still in contact.
not_available And he knows enough about what's going on to want to deny that.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available Cos I've done enough lying myself to be familiar with the signs.
not_available Yes? The United States has connected you with terrorists.
not_available Are you sure? They sent Charles Logan to try and force me to give up your location.
not_available The reason we brought the Arabs into this was to conceal our involvement.
not_available Now we are exposed.
not_available Russia is exposed.
not_available The Americans are speculating.
not_available They have no evidence.
not_available If they did, they would not send Logan.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Don't worry, Dmitri.
not_available By the time they find anything, it will be too late.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me know if you hear anything more.
not_available Pull over as soon as you're out of sight of the guards.
not_available What are you going to do? 
not_available O'Brian.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Gain access to the DWP server.
not_available I want you to disable the power going to the Russian consulate as soon as you can.
not_available Chloe, you need to do this under the radar.
not_available How long do you need it out for? 
not_available 60 seconds.
not_available Make it look like a grid failure in case the consulate tries to contact the DWP.
not_available I'll get back to you when I'm ready.
not_available Are you going back in there? You just spent nearly two years in a Chinese prison because you violated the sovereignty of their consulate.
not_available Now you'll go into the Russian consulate and take a chance on that happening again? As nightfall approaches, hazmat teams and emergency crews in Valencia, California, continue to search for survivors, while the official death toll stands at just over 12,000 
not_available Hi.
not_available Where are you? Still at the airport waiting for my plane.
not_available Why? What's up? There's been an attempt on President Palmer's life.
not_available What? They won't know the full extent of his injuries until he regains consciousness.
not_available There's been nothing of this in the news.
not_available It hasn't been made public yet.
not_available The vice president is on his way back to the White House.
not_available He's assumed executive duties.
not_available I have to go back.
not_available You've already tendered your resignation.
not_available Nothing's been processed.
not_available Technically, I can withdraw my resignation.
not_available I've got to go back, Bill.
not_available Look, I'll call you when I get there, OK? All right.
not_available Once we settle in, I wanna go over a copy of the Lennox proposal.
not_available I need you to work up a distribution list.
not_available The president rejected that plan.
not_available What's your point? Don't you think it might be too soon to enact it? Lisa, a Muslim terrorist has set off a bomb inside the White House.
not_available If anything, we've delayed this far too long.
not_available Mr Vice President.
not_available Hello, Ethan.
not_available What's the president's condition? 
not_available They managed to stabilise him, but it's still too soon to make a prognosis.
not_available Something else has come up.
not_available There's been a development in the investigation of the assassination attempt.
not_available Tom Lennox has remanded himself into custody.
not_available Lennox? What are you talking about? Just about two hours ago.
not_available That's when Reed first hinted that there was a plot.
not_available You waited an hour before you tried to report it.
not_available Because there was nothing actionable.
not_available It was just all innuendo.
not_available I was simply trying to wait and find out more.
not_available By the time I realised they were moving, Reed caught me trying to alert Hollister.
not_available That's when he struck you over the head? 
not_available That's correct.
not_available So, when you provided Carson's clearance 
not_available No, no! I didn't provide anybody clearance.
not_available Reed stole my clearance card.
not_available and gave these men the president's itinerary, you were pretending? Yes.
not_available Or maybe it's just that you had second thoughts.
not_available I'd like to speak to Mr Lennox alone, please.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I tried to stop this, Noah.
not_available I'd like to believe you, Tom.
not_available I'll leave it to the Justice Department to determine your role, and Assad's.
not_available Assad? They were setting him up.
not_available He had nothing to do with this.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available It's my understanding you suggested that others, besides Reed and Carson, may have been involved.
not_available Only because Reed implied as much.
not_available I was trying to figure out who else was involved.
not_available Did you? 
not_available No.
not_available Then it's conceivable that Assad may have been, at the very least, a willing participant in this attack.
not_available That makes no sense whatsoever.
not_available Assad was a terrorist who hated this country and everything it stands for.
not_available What better way to rally his people than to martyr himself by murdering the president? Don't you understand? That is exactly what Reed and Carson wanted this to look like, and now you're playing right into it.
not_available I am going to address the nation shortly to inform the public about what's happened.
not_available Until I have all the facts, I am not about to tell them that Hamri Al
not_available Assad is innocent in this.
not_available I see what you're doing here, Noah.
not_available By scapegoating Assad, you can reverse the agenda, get aggressive with the Islamic community.
not_available You think I don't see what you're doing here? It's your plan, Tom.
not_available You outlined those measures yourself.
not_available I was your staunchest advocate.
not_available What has happened to the president is horrific, but if there is any good to come from this, it's that we have the opportunity to do what we know is in the best interests of protecting this country.
not_available You're asking a whole heck of a lot more than for me just to maintain silence on Assad.
not_available The cabinet knows you are the architect of the plan.
not_available If you're not on the face of it now, it may raise questions.
not_available Or have you come to believe the president was correct in rejecting your proposals? No.
not_available I know it's it's the only way to stop these attacks.
not_available But you're gonna stick to your assertion of Assad's complete innocence? Or I can clear you of these charges and you can help me to initiate your plan, which we both know is in the best interests of the country.
not_available Agent Lowry.
not_available I don't want his statement promoted to the attorney general until it's gone through me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Have you got it? 
not_available I've logged onto the DWP server.
not_available You have a 60
not_available second window before the circuits kick back in.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Shut it down now.
not_available What is happening? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available You check the upper level, I check the lower.
not_available Got it.
not_available What is this? 
not_available Hands where I can see them.
not_available Why are you here? Where is Gredenko? 
not_available I told him, I don't know.
not_available You're lying.
not_available Hands away from the desk now! Sit down! You're breaking international law, violating the sovereignty of the consulate.
not_available I don't have time to ask nicely.
not_available Where's Gredenko? I I don't know.
not_available I swear.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available When the power came back on, the consul's panic button was triggered.
not_available Consul Markov.
not_available Are you all right? I've taken the consul hostage at gunpoint.
not_available You make any attempt to enter this room, I will kill him.
not_available You understand me? Find out who this man is, and alert Moscow.
not_available CTU, Operations.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Let me speak to Buchanan.
not_available Jack Bauer on line one.
not_available What's going on, Jack? 
not_available Bill, I got a situation.
not_available Logan's play didn't work so I came back to the consulate.
not_available Before I could get any information from him, I was discovered.
not_available I don't know how much more time I've got.
not_available It's Russian territory.
not_available I can't sanction this.
not_available I know.
not_available You need to call the White House and advise them.
not_available I want you to stand down, find a way out.
not_available I'm not going until Markov tells me how to find Gredenko.
not_available I'll get back to you when I've got something.
not_available Mr Vice President, the press secretary has set up for your address.
not_available You'll be going live in ten minutes.
not_available Thank you, Lisa.
not_available Have you finished drafting my statement? I'll have it for you momentarily.
not_available I thought you should know that Karen Hayes has withdrawn her resignation.
not_available She's on her way here now.
not_available Do you know what prompted her resignation? Officially, it was to return to Los Angeles to be with her husband, but rumour has it she stepped down because of her opposition to the Lennox plan.
not_available I see.
not_available I have Bill Buchanan on the line.
not_available This is the vice president.
not_available Sir, a situation has developed.
not_available What kind of situation? Jack Bauer has taken Russian Consul Markov hostage.
not_available He's holding him at gunpoint.
not_available What? How could that happen? Markov denied having any contact with Gredenko, but Logan insisted he was lying.
not_available When the escort left, Bauer went back to question Markov.
not_available That's when he was discovered.
not_available My God.
not_available Did you approve these actions? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Bauer acted on his own authority.
not_available And the questionable assumption of Charles Logan.
not_available Sir, Bauer has absolutely no reason to trust Charles Logan, yet he was convinced enough to take action.
not_available In any event, he's created a diplomatic mess.
not_available If Markov has information, then extracting it is our only chance to stop the next nuke from being detonated.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Not now.
not_available Sir, it's President Suvarov.
not_available Bill, I don't know how long I can hold off the Russians.
not_available If Markov is connected to these nukes, Bauer had better get it out of him fast.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr President, this is Vice President Daniels.
not_available I was expecting to speak to President Palmer.
not_available My apologies.
not_available I'm afraid he's unavailable.
not_available Unavailable? Sir, I'm speaking on his authority.
not_available I assume that you're calling about the incident at your consulate.
not_available Let me assure you, this man is acting on his own and not under the orders of the United States government.
not_available Nevertheless, this is a gross violation of our sovereignty.
not_available If your agent does not stand down immediately, my country will have no choice but to retaliate with the most forceful diplomatic measures at our disposal.
not_available I understand your position, but before you escalate this you should understand mine.
not_available We've learned that Consul Markov is most likely in contact with Dmitri Gredenko, who we've linked to the nuclear attack that took place on US soil.
not_available If that's true we will look upon him as a co
not_available conspirator in the attack.
not_available Mr Vice President, I deeply regret the tragedy that your country has experienced today, but you must make these charges through proper diplomatic channels after your agent has surrendered.
not_available I wanna know where Gredenko is and what he's doing.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I haven't spoken to Gredenko since he arrived in the United States.
not_available I never said he was in the United States.
not_available Why don't I tell you what we know? We already know that Gredenko supplied Fayed with the five suitcase nukes.
not_available It doesn't make sense that he's still involved, unless he's doing something else for Fayed.
not_available That's what we wanna know.
not_available What is Gredenko doing for Fayed?! I don't know.
not_available You're gonna tell me what I want to know, or you're gonna start losing your fingers.
not_available This is your last chance.
not_available I've got the feed.
not_available Don't move in yet.
not_available He's too close to Markov.
not_available You have one of two choices You can give me the information that I want and I'll go pick up Gredenko or I can kill you and I'll make sure Gredenko finds out.
not_available And he'll panic, because he'll think you gave him up before you died.
not_available He'll be forced to use his exit route.
not_available Either way, he stops what he's doing in this country now.
not_available The choice is yours.
not_available How do I find Gredenko? Mohave Desert.
not_available Shadow Valley.
not_available Where in the Shadow Valley? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What is he doing? What is he doing?! Launching drones.
not_available What? Aerial drones for Fayed.
not_available His delivery system for nuclear bombs.
not_available How soon will the drones be ready? Two hours.
not_available In two hours, all the bombs will be in the air.
not_available Son of a bitch! Now! Don't let anyone near this man, do you understand? My fellow Americans, I regret to inform you that a short time ago, President Palmer was seriously injured in an assassination attempt at the White House.
not_available Thankfully, he is alive and currently in a stable condition.
not_available The prime suspect, Hamri Al
not_available Assad, was killed in the explosion.
not_available And in light of this heinous and cowardly act, compounded by the tragedy in California, I will be pushing forward an aggressive agenda of national security.
not_available One that will, out of necessity, suspend certain civil liberties.
not_available This is the price of war.
not_available Make no mistake, that is exactly what this is.
not_available Have you been able to reach Jack? 
not_available No, but my log confirms he did try to call in.
not_available Are we monitoring consulate communications? We are, but diplomatic traffic is encrypted with algorithm that we've never been able to crack.
not_available But I think I have a way around it.
not_available One of the computers isn't properly shielded, so I'm picking up a shadow of their messages before they're encrypted.
not_available What's that? 
not_available ASCll code.
not_available It is? 
not_available Yeah, in Russian.
not_available I'll just load a Cyrillic grid.
not_available Should be good to go.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available They're saying they've got an American agent in custody.
not_available forceful and decisive action needs to be taken 
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Morris just intercepted some bandwidth.
not_available Apparently, they got to Jack.
not_available What do you mean, "got to" him? They moved in on his position and recovered Markov.
not_available Sir, they're holding Jack prisoner.
not_available Sir, we should phone the vice president.
not_available No.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available He's in a diplomatic standoff with Suvarov.
