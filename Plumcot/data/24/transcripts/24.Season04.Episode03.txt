
not_available Who's this? 
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.
not_available He was kidnapped less than half an hour ago.
not_available I believe the same people that kidnapped him are chasing you now.
not_available The safest thing for you to do is let me bring you in.
not_available I found out who stumbled onto our server.
not_available Is he with you now? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll have him shortly.
not_available Find out who he's talked to.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available I'll kill you if you don't follow my orders.
not_available This is a simple task, Behrooz.
not_available But these are the ones where mistakes can be made.
not_available Debbie, what are you doing here? 
not_available I followed you.
not_available Omar saw you with someone outside the compound.
not_available She didn't see anything.
not_available I made sure of it.
not_available We've spent years planning for this, waiting for this day to come.
not_available Now it's here and you've compromised everything.
not_available It's a simple job.
not_available You pick up the subject and bring him in.
not_available Bauer has not been in the field for a year and a half.
not_available Which is why I need you to keep him on a tight leash.
not_available For the record, I think Driscoll made a mistake letting you come.
not_available You get the gate.
not_available I'll get the kid out of the car.
not_available My father is the secretary of defense.
not_available Richard, you are the only witness to your father and your sister's kidnapping.
not_available We need your help.
not_available You don't have anything to hide, do you? 
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available We're still on US soil.
not_available What are they gonna do? I don't know, but if they wanted me dead, they would have killed me at Richard's house.
not_available Our soldiers have taken the terrorist James Heller into custody.
not_available In three hours, Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity.
not_available If he is proven guilty, he will be executed in accordance with our laws.
not_available Sir.
not_available As you know, the secretary of defense and his daughter have been kidnapped by terrorists.
not_available The terrorists have announced that they'll put Jim on trial for war crimes, then execute him, all of it broadcast for the world.
not_available Make no mistake.
not_available This country is under attack.
not_available Foreign terrorists are operating on our soil.
not_available Intelligence indicates that the kidnapping may be some kind of trigger.
not_available The first step in a series of larger attacks.
not_available Mark, what kind of protective actions are being taken? We've changed all the codes the secretary has knowledge of.
not_available The other cabinet members have been sequestered.
not_available Melissa, where are we with keeping these people from broadcasting this? The media outlets will not air it, but the terrorists have announced that they'll use the Internet.
not_available We can't control that.
not_available Their feed is untraceable, and we can't shut down the Internet without disabling the functions of the government and the economy.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the only way to stop this is at the source.
not_available We have to rescue Secretary Heller.
not_available Erin, where is CTU on this? We have search teams out in force.
not_available We're working a few active leads.
not_available Anything promising? 
not_available We'll know very shortly.
not_available Keep us closely posted.
not_available Nothing takes priority over finding the people who have Jim Heller, and stopping them.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where are we with Heller's son? 
not_available Finding out what he knows.
not_available If he had anything to do with his father's abduction, we need to know.
not_available Get on it.
not_available Try his emergency frequency.
not_available Where's Ronnie and Bauer with the witness? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available What? I just spoke to transit police.
not_available A hostile intercepted Andrew Paige.
not_available We can't reach Ronnie or Jack.
not_available What do you mean? They're not answering their phones.
not_available There's been a report of a shooting at the station.
not_available Get pictures of Andrew Paige to our people.
not_available And set up a security grid around the station.
not_available My system's logged on.
not_available I can get it faster.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available You'll do tactical with me.
not_available Let's go, Edgar.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available Miss Driscoll, Jack Bauer's on line one.
not_available Where are you? Why have you not been in contact? 
not_available Erin, Ronnie's been killed.
not_available What are you talking about? He was shot by a hostile who kidnapped Andrew Paige.
not_available Where are you now? 
not_available I'm tracking them, but he doesn't know it.
not_available I'll send backup.
not_available Erin, I don't think that's the right call.
not_available I believe that they'll lead me to Heller and the kidnappers.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available The terrorists will try and execute Heller in less than three hours.
not_available Bring the man in now.
not_available This is our best chance of finding him.
not_available Jack, we had a deal.
not_available You're breaking up.
not_available Have SWAT and rescue teams standing by.
not_available I'll call you when the hostile reaches his destination.
not_available That call.
not_available Do you have a location? 
not_available No, it had a block on it.
not_available I've been informed that Ronnie Lobell has been killed in the line of duty by a hostile connected to Heller's abduction.
not_available At this point, Jack Bauer is no longer cooperating with this investigation.
not_available All departments need to work on the capture of Jack Bauer and the hostile he's tracking.
not_available Reconfigure the grid to include routes from the station.
not_available I want all ground teams on this.
not_available MTA, downtown.
not_available This is CTU.
not_available Do you have any new information about the kid who was abducted? We told you everything a few minutes ago.
not_available I can access surveillance cams if you give me the port codes.
not_available We're looking at them right now.
not_available There's nothing.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yes? What are you doing there? 
not_available I need you to help me with this grid.
not_available What kind of help? The northeast quadrant is passcoded 
not_available Pilot L one.
not_available What? 
not_available That's the log in.
not_available Chloe, could you just get back here? 
not_available I'm trying to find my friend Andrew.
not_available Get down! Yes? 
not_available I have the programmer.
not_available Good.
not_available We need to know what he told CTU as soon as possible.
not_available Proceed as planned.
not_available Understood.
not_available There was a problem at the train station.
not_available What? 
not_available An agent interfered, I killed him.
not_available Are you being pursued? No.
not_available Anyone who left the station after me would have caught up to me by now.
not_available Unless they don't want you to know they're there.
not_available Take precautions.
not_available Make sure that you are not being followed.
not_available Go.
not_available Move! Dad.
not_available You OK? Did they hurt you? 
not_available No.
not_available They just wanted me present while they broadcast an announcement.
not_available They're gonna put me on trial.
not_available For what? 
not_available Crimes against humanity.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available When? Less than three hours.
not_available Jack and the president will do everything they can.
not_available They may get here before then.
not_available I can deal with anything these bastards have got for me.
not_available I wish you hadn't come this morning, that's all.
not_available This is a list of the offences you are being charged with.
not_available Sign it.
not_available I'm a senior member of the United States Government.
not_available I'm not signing it.
not_available Then you will die, Mr.
not_available Secretary.
not_available Pick up the document and sign it.
not_available No! Let her go! Leave her alone, you son of a bitch! Leave her alone! Kill her! 
not_available All right.
not_available All right, I'll sign it.
not_available Pick up the document.
not_available Pick it up! Dad.
not_available Where are we on finding Bauer? 
not_available So far, nowhere.
not_available That's unacceptable.
not_available We're working up everything we can.
not_available What are you doing to find Heller? 
not_available I'll find out what his son knows.
not_available Sarah's working on the forensics.
not_available Anything new yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Great.
not_available What else? 
not_available Sarah Gavin.
not_available I'm tracing the terrorist webcast.
not_available And? 
not_available I can't get into the file.
not_available In other words, nothing.
not_available Miss Driscoll, it's the president.
not_available Make something happen.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President? 
not_available I understand you lost a field operative.
not_available Yes, we did.
not_available Were there any witnesses or prisoners? 
not_available Not yet, but there's some hope.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Jack Bauer, who, as you know, used to work here, is currently trailing a suspect.
not_available Trailing? Why doesn't he bring him in? 
not_available We're in the process of doing that.
not_available Erin, are we going to be able to save Jim and his daughter before this "trial" starts? I certainly hope so, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I have to ask you something now, as we may not have time later.
not_available What? We may end up in a situation where we have Heller's location, but can't extract him safely.
not_available If that's the case, would you authorize in advance an all
not_available out assault? The assumption being that the secretary would not survive? Correct.
not_available We'll cross that bridge if the scenario presents itself.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Goodbye, Erin.
not_available Manning.
not_available Hey, Curtis, it's Marianne.
not_available I know you're busy with the kidnapping.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available My friend said you're calling in level
not_available five consultants.
not_available We added personnel because of the crisis.
not_available She said you struck my name from the list.
not_available You don't meet the criteria.
not_available Don't give me that.
not_available I have the qualifications.
not_available Why did you exclude me? You want it straight? I don't think we'd work well together.
not_available Why? Because we slept together and you stopped calling me? I stopped calling you because you were using me to get ahead in your career.
not_available That's your interpretation.
not_available You didn't have a problem at the time.
not_available I'm not having this conversation.
not_available I'll have it with Erin.
not_available Marianne.
not_available This would be a huge opportunity for me.
not_available And I'm not gonna let you get in the way because you're uncomfortable.
not_available Where should I post those FBI bulletins? Exit three.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available It's me.
not_available Can you talk? What happened with Andrew? 
not_available Someone got to him.
not_available Did you tell anyone where we were meeting him? No.
not_available What are you doing? Driscoll said you're operating outside her authority.
not_available She's not handling this right.
not_available What if you're wrong? 
not_available This is our best chance of finding Heller.
not_available If anything happens to Andrew 
not_available Chloe, we have to find these terrorists.
not_available So why are you calling me? The hostile's headed toward the canyons.
not_available I need satellite surveillance to track him.
not_available You want me to steal satellite bandwidth from CTU.
not_available Yes.
not_available Where are you? I'm on Orchard Road, just north of the 14, about four miles east of Valencia.
not_available Caltrans has traffic cams in the area.
not_available You'll need satellite coverage nearer the canyons.
not_available Call me back as soon as you've got the coverage.
not_available I'll keep a private channel open.
not_available Who was that? 
not_available It was personal.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Chloe's acting kinda strange.
not_available That's nothing new.
not_available Hey.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available I just spoke to Marianne Taylor.
not_available Erin, whatever she told you, it's coming from a very disturbed place.
not_available That may be, but she's as qualified as any of the others you brought in today.
not_available I'm not comfortable with her.
not_available That should be enough.
not_available Normally, it would be.
not_available She mentioned that your pillow talk included a synopsis of the new data
not_available mining protocols.
not_available That's a lie.
not_available If she got that information, it was from someone else.
not_available She's using it against me.
not_available She knows details about the new UVX system.
not_available That's classified information.
not_available She can force us into a security reboot and a six
not_available month investigation.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available I asked her to come in.
not_available Deal with it.
not_available Do you have the results on Secretary Heller's son yet? Yeah.
not_available The polygraph shows he had no knowing involvement in the kidnapping.
not_available But? He insists he didn't tell anyone his father was coming to his house.
not_available The polygraph was inconclusive on that claim.
not_available You think he's lying? 
not_available It's possible.
not_available Richard was the only one who knew where his father would be, and he may have told someone about it.
not_available Why would Richard protect somebody who's betrayed him? Because he's too arrogant to believe that's what's happened.
not_available It'll take days to go through his phone records.
not_available I want you to see if you can get the name out of him another way.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available Erin, we're not sure he's guilty of anything.
not_available This is how we'll find out.
not_available Get started.
not_available Did Father talk to you about Debbie? What about her? When Dad told me to take the briefcase to Omar Debbie followed me.
not_available She didn't know where I was going, she just wanted to talk.
not_available Debbie saw the warehouse where we're holding Heller? Yes, but there wasn't anything I could do about it.
not_available You could have broken up with her a month ago like your father and I told you to.
not_available I know I made a mistake, but Father found out and he wants me to get her over here.
not_available You know what that means.
not_available If he thinks there's a chance she could expose us I didn't realize you felt so strongly about her.
not_available She's not going to mess anything up.
not_available I swear to you.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Talk to him.
not_available He'll listen to you.
not_available Please.
not_available OK.
not_available Your father is on his way to a meeting.
not_available I'll try to reach him.
not_available Thanks, Mom.
not_available When can I get outta here? 
not_available Secure him.
not_available Goddammit! What the hell are you doing? Get your hands off me! Argh! Argh! Who else knew your father would be at your house? I told you, no one.
not_available What are you? Crazy? 
not_available This works on a neurotransmitter level.
not_available Makes every nerve ending feel like it's on fire.
not_available You're bluffing.
not_available You know you can't get away with this.
not_available By the time you're released, the mark will be gone.
not_available It'll be your word against mine.
not_available My father's the secretary of defense, for God's sake.
not_available I thought you hated him.
not_available Now he's dear old Dad.
not_available Help me! Somebody! Please! Help me! Stop.
not_available I can't do it, Erin.
not_available I'm not gonna let Eric work on Richard Heller.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Maybe he's protecting a friend, but he wasn't knowingly involved with the terrorists.
not_available I gave you an order.
not_available Then give it to me in writing, Erin.
not_available What are you suggesting? We release him? 
not_available No.
not_available Sensory disorientation gives good results.
not_available Cut off his sight, saturate his auditory.
not_available It's noninvasive.
not_available Fine.
not_available Try it.
not_available Yes.
not_available I spoke with Behrooz.
not_available He told me about his girlfriend.
not_available He's very upset, Navi.
not_available That's what concerns me.
not_available He has feelings for this girl despite what he tells us.
not_available Now she's seen the warehouse.
not_available I know.
not_available It's very troubling.
not_available I told him to get her over to the house.
not_available Did he make the call? No.
not_available He asked me to talk to you instead.
not_available Go upstairs.
not_available Are you talking to Father? 
not_available I'll talk to you soon.
not_available You'll take care of this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What did he say? Do I still have to call Debbie and get her over here? No.
not_available Thank you, Mother.
not_available I'm gonna pull over soon and we're gonna talk, OK? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Good.
not_available There are some things I need you to know.
not_available Today is not about me or you.
not_available It's about something bigger.
not_available What I need to know is that whatever you saw on the Internet will not interfere with what we have planned.
not_available You have to convince me of that.
not_available Yeah? It will be a while on the satellite.
not_available The load is through the roof.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available What is your position exactly? The suspect pulled over just past mile
not_available marker 31.
not_available Why? There's nothing there.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you got the satellite coverage.
not_available Get up.
not_available Nobody! Nobody! 
not_available Jack, I'm watching this.
not_available How? On a traffic cam.
not_available You've gotta stop this.
not_available If I intercede now, we lose our opportunity to find Secretary Heller.
not_available What did you tell CTU? That someone was going to put positioning code on the Internet.
not_available What else? 
not_available I tried to dig deeper, but everything was in some kind of Arabic.
not_available I couldn't read it.
not_available That's all you told CTU? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I promise.
not_available Argh! Are you sure? 
not_available Jack, stop them.
not_available Just stop them.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available I swear, I promise.
not_available Please, just don't hit me any more.
not_available Please.
not_available I talked to the programmer.
not_available He didn't tell CTU enough for them to be able to stop us.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He only got a brief glimpse of the code.
not_available He was never logged on to our server.
not_available I need you here.
not_available Get back on the road.
not_available Have them see what else they can find out.
not_available And then get rid of the body.
not_available I will see you soon.
not_available Talk! Chloe, how do you open a secure pipe to Division? 
not_available Ask Edgar.
not_available I did.
not_available He's busy.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Why are you so impatient with everybody? Not everybody, just you.
not_available Now, please go away.
not_available Bitch.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available I've got to follow the hostile.
not_available Jack, you can't leave Andrew there.
not_available They'll kill him.
not_available Jack! Jack, please! Jack? Jack? Jack? Yeah? Is Andrew alive? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dispatch an ambulance to this location.
not_available Get me the damn satellite coverage.
not_available That's right.
not_available Just off the road next to the What's wrong? When the trial begins, you may have an opportunity to escape.
not_available You have to take it, even if it's dangerous.
not_available Maybe we'll have a chance before then.
not_available They'll never take their eyes off of me.
not_available It has to be when their attention is on the trial.
not_available I don't want to get out of here without 
not_available Forget about me.
not_available You have to take every chance.
not_available Promise me.
not_available Dad, I I I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available You can.
not_available I want you to live your life.
not_available A full life.
not_available I want you to have a family.
not_available That's all I care about.
not_available You're my baby.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Come on, now.
not_available Chloe, you want me to get that? 
not_available No.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's me.
not_available I was looking at the CHP dispatch report.
not_available Andrew is in really bad shape.
not_available I will never forgive you.
not_available Do you hear me? I understand how you feel, but you've gotta think clearly.
not_available We have terrorists who bombed a train and kidnapped the secretary of defense.
not_available We have to follow this hostile and hope he leads us to Heller.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not listening to you any more.
not_available This is over.
not_available I'm going to Driscoll.
not_available No.
not_available You know I'm right.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Chloe, if you didn't believe in what I was doing, you'd have turned me in already.
not_available I hate that this is happening.
not_available So do I.
not_available Chloe, I can't do this without you.
not_available I need your help to stop them.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What? Are you with me? Yeah.
not_available I'll call as soon as I have the satellite.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Miss Driscoll, this is Marianne Taylor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ms Taylor.
not_available I'm very excited to have this opportunity to help you here.
not_available Hello, Curtis.
not_available Marianne.
not_available Curtis, take Marianne to an empty station and get her started on the data sorts.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You'll be working over here.
not_available You know, Curtis, I didn't want to go over your head, but you left me no choice.
not_available Is that so? 
not_available I'II let it go if you will.
not_available Get to work, Marianne.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? What are you working on? 
not_available A Division protocol manifest.
not_available I need you to build a firewall around station four.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Marianne.
not_available I want to make sure she doesn't stray from her area.
not_available Fine.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I don't think I can do this, Jack.
not_available Why? I'm spread too thin.
not_available I've got to get a satellite on an overloaded system.
not_available I need more time.
not_available We don't have it.
not_available In five minutes we'll be on Route 11.
not_available It's a two
not_available lane road.
not_available We'll be the only cars for miles.
not_available There's no way I can follow him without being seen.
not_available All right.
not_available I think I know a way I can speed this up.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available The satellite system tanked and Driscoll wants these updates.
not_available OK, I'll be right there.
not_available I hope Driscoll doesn't get upset.
not_available She overreacts sometimes.
not_available This happened to me a few days ago.
not_available You can retrieve your files from the backups in the server room.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I stole a block of time.
not_available There's no continuous coverage.
not_available I'll have to order a reposition.
not_available Fine, then do it.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We're catching a break.
not_available He's pulling into a gas station.
not_available Well, I hope he stays there a while.
not_available This will take some time.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you've got it.
not_available OK, I will.
not_available Edgar? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm Marianne Taylor.
not_available Driscoll asked me to help on data and logistics.
not_available I heard something about that.
not_available Hi.
not_available So can you do me a favor? 
not_available A favor? Yeah.
not_available Everyone's busy.
not_available I'd be more useful if I had an overall on what's going on.
not_available The secretary of defense has been kidnapped.
not_available I know.
not_available I mean tactically.
not_available I don't have time for this.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Why don't you give me the main points? 
not_available All right.
not_available We think Bauer's following a terrorist.
not_available "We think"? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's off on his own.
not_available We can't find him.
not_available I thought he didn't work here.
not_available He doesn't.
not_available Driscoll gave him the authority to do this one thing.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks, Edgar.
not_available Richard.
not_available How long do you think it's been? What? How long do you think you've been sitting here like this? Three, four hours.
not_available It's been less than 30 minutes.
not_available Time's the first thing you lose track of in sensory disorientation.
not_available It only gets worse.
not_available This is illegal.
not_available You can't keep me here.
not_available Tell me what I need to know.
not_available I told you everything I know.
not_available Your father was kidnapped by terrorists.
not_available Our analysis shows that you're hiding something that might help us find him.
not_available Just tell me what it is and all this stops.
not_available You're not going to do this.
not_available If you don't care enough about your father to tell me, I'll get it out of you this way.
not_available You're not gonna do this! Please! Stop! You're not gonna Argh! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! O'Brian.
not_available How long for the satellite reposition? 
not_available My request is still in the queue.
not_available We've got to get that coverage up and running.
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available You'll have to stall him.
not_available It'll take as long as it takes.
not_available Just hurry.
not_available OK, I will.
not_available Why is Debbie here? What did you do? 
not_available I called her and asked her to come over.
not_available You said that you would help me.
not_available That you talked to Father.
not_available Your father is right.
not_available We need to find out who she told.
not_available I told you she didn't see anything.
not_available Then there shouldn't be any problem.
not_available What did you say to her? 
not_available That I was concerned about the two of you.
not_available Mom.
not_available Behrooz You know what's at stake.
not_available You do as you're told.
not_available Understand? 
not_available Debbie, thank you for coming.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Come in.
not_available Debbie, please make yourself comfortable in the living room.
not_available I'll make tea.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm glad your mom called.
not_available If she has problems with us we should talk.
not_available Debbie.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available You don't understand.
not_available You shouldn't have come here.
not_available Why do you always say things like that? O'Brian.
