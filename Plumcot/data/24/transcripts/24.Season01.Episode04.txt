
not_available Are you stupid? What are you doing in the street? What are you, an idiot? No! Keep moving! 
not_available No! Come on, get her! Shut up! Put her down.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Shut up! Let's go.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Help me.
not_available We have to go back.
not_available There's no point, she's dead.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Get in! Take it easy! Know what, you better decide whose side you're on.
not_available We can't leave her in the middle of the street.
not_available Nina.
not_available Nina, I know you're upset.
not_available Of course I'm upset, Jack.
not_available What do you expect? I'm sorry.
not_available The reason why I had to leave the office is because I got a call from Walsh.
not_available He was meeting another one of our agents.
not_available Scott Baylor.
not_available He said he had evidence that 
not_available That led you to me.
not_available I know, Jack, but you should have thought it through.
not_available Nina, listen to me.
not_available Richard Walsh is dead.
not_available What? He was shot.
not_available I watched him die.
not_available What is going on? He was killed because he had proof that people from our own agency are behind the hit on Palmer.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available Right before Richard died, he gave me that keycard.
not_available I'm hoping that's going to tell us.
not_available Jamey's trying to break it down now.
not_available You trust Jamey? 
not_available He did.
not_available I trust you.
not_available Which means the three of us have to work together.
not_available From this point forward, we have to assume that we can trust nobody else.
not_available I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Work the card with Jamey.
not_available I have to make a call.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Senator, Agent Pierce wanted to talk to you as soon as you got back.
not_available Fine.
not_available Just give me a minute.
not_available It's important, there's a security issue.
not_available A minute! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you find anything out yet? David, it's barely been half an hour since you told me about it.
not_available Carl, I need you to find out the source of this story.
not_available Not first thing in the morning.
not_available Now! I understand, but this can't be done over the phone.
not_available I have to talk to some people in person.
not_available It's five after three.
not_available I want to hear something by 4:00.
not_available David, you've got to let me.
not_available Where were you? 
not_available I went for a drive.
not_available A drive.
not_available Alone, at this time of night? I just needed to get away for a while.
not_available Away from what, David? Everything.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available They haven't told you, have they? There has been an assassination threat.
not_available That's what all the fuss is about? Yes.
not_available I thought it was something serious.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'm screening the passenger list, something doesn't add up.
not_available What? 
not_available 2B Manifest shows an empty seat.
not_available So? According to the ticketing file first class was full, plus there is a waiting list.
not_available Why would the plane take off with an empty seat? Doesn't make sense.
not_available This is good, let's work it.
not_available What time does Rayburn get in? 
not_available 6:00.
not_available Then wake him up, bring him in now.
not_available Jack.
not_available We've got something off the keycard.
not_available The encryption is complex.
not_available I've asked Jamey to isolate sectors and she's managed to extract one.
not_available Just part of one, actually.
not_available That's it, just an address.
not_available What's that got to do with Palmer? It doesn't say.
not_available Crosscheck it with his schedule for tomorrow.
not_available He's not going anywhere near it.
not_available Has he been anywhere near it since he came to Los Angeles? No.
not_available How about previous visits, connection to family members, associates, anything? I can check.
not_available It will take time.
not_available No.
not_available Let's see what we can peel off.
not_available Start in here.
not_available Still just the address on San Fernando Road.
not_available How long is it going to take to access the next level? Minutes or hours? 
not_available Hours most likely.
not_available We don't have hours.
not_available I'll check out the address myself.
not_available You want some backup? 
not_available No.
not_available I need you here.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Suddenly I can't access our decryption software.
not_available Phones are down, too.
not_available It's a lockdown.
not_available It's Mason.
not_available Hide the keycard.
not_available NI'll handle this.
not_available Hello, Nina.
not_available These men are with Internal Investigations.
not_available You are now on official lockdown.
not_available On what authority? 
not_available District Office.
not_available Trying to stop an assassination, George.
not_available Can't you find anything better to do than this? Two agents died tonight.
not_available Lockdown is standard procedure until we get some answers.
not_available Where's Jack? I don't know.
not_available Station 2, coming your way.
not_available Lockdown, nobody leaves.
not_available Lockdown, are you serious? 
not_available No, I'm kidding.
not_available I gotta get some work from my car.
not_available You know the drill.
not_available Fine, you take the keys.
not_available All right, I assume you're all familiar with lockdown procedures.
not_available You remain in the building.
not_available All communications will be monitored.
not_available Any incoming call without secure access codes will be blocked.
not_available In the meantime, you can continue to work on systems available to you 'til notified otherwise.
not_available Anyone currently assigned.
not_available Who called them in, Tony.
not_available You? Yeah.
not_available Me.
not_available Why? Somebody had to.
not_available Jack's out of control.
not_available Meaning what? Two agents are down, Jack was there when it happened.
not_available You can't believe he had anything to do with that.
not_available To tell you the truth, I don't know what to believe.
not_available I'd hate to think this has anything to do with me.
not_available You think what you want.
not_available All right, get comfortable, could be here for quite a while.
not_available He got past me.
not_available All right, Nina, where'd he go? I already told you, I don't know.
not_available As soon as you tell me, we can get things up and running.
not_available I'm really sorry, George, I can't help you out.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Senator, could I have a word with you? I'm not sure you appreciate the seriousness of this threat.
not_available I get serious threats every morning with my orange juice.
not_available With all due respect, this one's different.
not_available It's a pro from overseas.
not_available Who's behind it? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available But as I'm sure you're aware an airliner exploded about an hour and a half ago outside LA.
not_available No survivors.
not_available Are you saying there's some connection? Again, we don't know.
not_available We're looking into it.
not_available What do we know? That these are serious people, and they want you dead, today.
not_available What about my family? The threat appears to be against you only.
not_available But, of course, we'll increase security for your family as well.
not_available The main thing is your schedule.
not_available Today is Primary Day, I'm not gonna hide in my hotel room.
not_available Understood.
not_available But we are recommending some changes.
not_available The breakfast, for example.
not_available The breakfast is important.
not_available The top labor leaders in the state are going to be there.
not_available We're trying to keep you alive, Senator.
not_available And I'm trying to win an election.
not_available Mom said you wanted to see me.
not_available Wanted to make sure you're all right.
not_available What are you doing up? If I'm not sleeping by Actually, I was gonna watch some tube, you wanna join me? Is anything on this time of night? Nothing good.
not_available I guess I'll pass.
not_available Heard about the threat.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available They'll take good care of me.
not_available They better.
not_available Better get some rest.
not_available I'm telling you, we have to go back and get Janet.
not_available Are you gonna tell your girlfriend to shut her mouth or not? She's probably dead, there's no point.
not_available And what if she's not? She might need help.
not_available Why do always do what he tells you? Why don't you think for yourself? Just leave it alone, okay.
not_available I can't, she's my friend.
not_available You know, she may be right after all.
not_available We should go back.
not_available If she's alive, she can I.<br>D.
not_available us.
not_available We have to shut her up for good.
not_available What? What are you saying? You're gonna kill Janet? Is that what you're gonna do? Be quiet! Close her mouth! Now! I'm not gonna let you tie me up.
not_available Let me out.
not_available Sounds like she's gonna tie you up.
not_available Shut up! I just hope the girls are still there.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Stay in your car, sir.
not_available Back in the car.
not_available Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
not_available Do you have any idea how fast you were going? Yes.
not_available Officer, our daughters are missing.
not_available We got a phone call, we are on our way to pick them up.
not_available Please.
not_available Can I see your license and registration? 
not_available Did you hear what I said? Your license and registration, please.
not_available I'm Teri Bauer, he's telling the truth.
not_available We really could use your help here.
not_available My daughter just phoned from Platt's Auto Body.
not_available Different last names.
not_available One's married, one's not.
not_available Out together in the middle of the night.
not_available I called 911 fifteen minutes ago, verify it if you want.
not_available You know what, I'm gonna do that.
not_available Yeah, why don't you do that.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, listen, I asked you to remain in the car.
not_available I understand that.
not_available Can we speed things up? Write us tickets, we'll be on our way.
not_available The woman asked me to verify the 911.
not_available That's what I'm trying to do.
not_available You know, You are a real piece of work, you know that? My daughter is in trouble.
not_available We're finished here.
not_available Take your hands off me! What are you doing? Take it easy, relax, everyone.
not_available Get your hands off me! Stop, don't do that.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Ma'am, he just disobeyed a direct order from a police officer.
not_available I'm afraid I'm going to have to place him under arrest.
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What was your name? Excuse me! You know Richard Walsh was killed tonight.
not_available Scott Baylor, too.
not_available Did you know Jack was there when it happened? I don't know anything about it.
not_available And you have no idea where he is right now? No.
not_available You're making a big mistake, Nina.
not_available No, you are.
not_available When this lockdown is over, I'm gonna have a little talk with the Double
not_available I team about some highly irregular banking transactions which were traced to your account.
not_available Trust me.
not_available The trouble Jack's in right now my bank accounts won't even raise an eyebrow.
not_available He's going down, Nina.
not_available That doesn't mean you have to go down with him.
not_available True love is a beautiful thing, but why go to extremes? I know about the affair.
not_available See, Jack talks about it all the time.
not_available Sure he does.
not_available How else would I know about it? It is possible, that Jack's not the shining knight you think he is.
not_available Want to try again? Where is Jack now? This is Mary 13
not_available 8.
not_available Need a transportation unit at the Fifth Street bridge.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Please.
not_available Would you listen to me
not_available Repeat location with full request.
not_available unit at the Fifth Street bridge Copy, 1Mary3
not_available 8.
not_available It's Teri.
not_available Leave a message after the beep and I'll call you back.
not_available Honey, it's me, I'm just checking up on Kim.
not_available I'll call you back soon.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Request backup.
not_available Stop! Police.
not_available Hold it right there.
not_available Federal Agent! Your badge, nice and slow.
not_available Putting my gun down.
not_available "CTU.<br>" What the hell is that? Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available This guy is not waiting around for me.
not_available You better shoot me or help.
not_available Decide now.
not_available All right, I'll help you.
not_available I'm picking up my gun.
not_available Easy.
not_available You be careful with that gun.
not_available I need him alive.
not_available Throw me your flashlight.
not_available Take cover! Turn off your radio.
not_available I wish you hadn't called for backup.
not_available Why? Because cops have to play by the rules.
not_available I may have to break a few with this guy.
not_available Who is he? To sum it up, Jack leaves his wife shacks up with you for a while gets bored and then moves back home, leaving you out in the cold.
not_available My personal life is not your concern.
not_available It is if it affects your work.
not_available It doesn't affect my work.
not_available How long you been with the Agency, Nina? Six years, seven? Seven years.
not_available I remember when you first joined.
not_available You were going places.
not_available Everybody knew it.
not_available It hasn't quite happened for you yet, has it? You ever wonder why? I've done all right.
not_available But you could have done so much better.
not_available You had a great reputation, once.
not_available You know what your reputation is now? Jack's flunky.
not_available His lap dog.
not_available This is your chance to get back on track, Nina.
not_available He's a loose cannon.
not_available Rules don't apply to Jack Bauer.
not_available He does what he wants, when he wants and he doesn't care whose life it affects.
not_available He shot me with a tranq gun here in the office, for God's sakes.
not_available That's because you withheld crucial information.
not_available I was following orders.
not_available Maybe he's following orders.
not_available Orders you don't know about.
not_available He violated lockdown and left you holding the bag.
not_available If he cared about you, he wouldn't have put you in that position.
not_available Let me ask you would you have done that to him? The fact is, I'm just asking you to do your job and tell me where he is.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Get out! Maybe she's dead after all.
not_available We have to be sure.
not_available Let's just put her in the van.
not_available No.
not_available Dan.
not_available Shut up! Move it.
not_available Yeah? Mason's going to want to talk to you.
not_available What you want me to say? Jack's made it clear that the three of us work in confidence.
not_available But doesn't Mason supersede Jack? No.
not_available What we're doing came from Walsh.
not_available George will say anything to get you to talk.
not_available Do not be intimidated by him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Cross me.
not_available The other building.
not_available This place is like a maze.
not_available All right, I've got a name.
not_available George Ferragamo.
not_available Know him? Yeah.
not_available I know the name.
not_available You find anything else, leave a message on the 802 number only.
not_available Okay, you got it.
not_available Thanks, Carl.
not_available You've been spending an awful lot of time behind closed doors, making phone calls.
not_available Have I? What's going on, David? The phone call, earlier tonight, from Maureen Kingsley.
not_available She's digging up old history.
not_available Bad history.
not_available Just tell me.
not_available She claims that Keith murdered the boy who raped Nicole.
not_available What? First, Lyle Gibson was no boy, he was 19.
not_available Second, he killed himself.
not_available The coroner's report proved it.
not_available Maureen has new evidence.
not_available What evidence? I put Carl on it.
not_available He came up with a name George Ferragamo.
not_available That's the therapist Keith went to, what about him? He claims that He's not claiming that Keith confessed in therapy? 
not_available Apparently.
not_available Well, then he's lying.
not_available You've got to get our lawyers on this right away.
not_available Yeah, I know and I will.
not_available But you know 
not_available What is it, David? I just don't understand it.
not_available Maureen's always been very responsible.
not_available One of the few real professionals left.
not_available I'd call this unprofessional.
not_available David you can't seriously think that our son might be a killer? No.
not_available Of course not.
not_available Look, I apologized.
not_available You don't get it, do you? You've committed a serious crime.
not_available Officer, please.
not_available Clearly, he's upset.
not_available We both are.
not_available If you could just give us a break? Please? was placed at that location, approximately 30 minutes ago.
not_available Copy.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That still doesn't justify you disobeying a police officer.
not_available Idiot.
not_available Here's the backup.
not_available Ground units are on their way.
not_available I need him now to claim jurisdiction.
not_available Where do you want me? Keep him pinned down at the exit.
not_available I'll try to go around the other side.
not_available Don't hit him.
not_available I won't.
not_available Don't hit me, either.
not_available This is the police.
not_available Drop your weapon.
not_available I told you to stay put.
not_available Over here.
not_available You want me, come and get me.
not_available Don't do it! He'll kill both of us! Don't do it! Come out! Drop the gun! Don't! Step out where I can see you, and throw down the gun! 
not_available Don't do it.
not_available Drop it! I'm gonna drop the gun but you gotta relax! Don't do it.
not_available He'll kill us both.
not_available Shut up! Put down the gun! Drop it! Speak English, asshole.
not_available The gun is going down.
not_available I'm putting down the gun.
not_available The gun's going down.
not_available Good work, throw me your cuffs.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I think it might be up here, swing to the right.
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available There is someone up ahead, maybe they saw something.
not_available Roll down your window.
not_available Excuse me, could you tell me what happened here, please.
not_available It might involve our children.
not_available You shouldn't let your children come down here.
not_available Yeah, I know that, but could you just please tell me what happened? Girl was hit by a car.
not_available Ma'am, do you know where they took her? St.
not_available Mark's is closest.
not_available Was she alive? She didn't look good.
not_available Go.
not_available Hey, it's Gaines.
not_available Where's the other one? She was a problem, so we killed her.
not_available The body? No one'll find it.
not_available She been any trouble? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available You're with me now.
not_available Be good, you'll be back at the mall in a day or two.
not_available Be bad, and you won't.
not_available Clear? Good.
not_available Agent Farrell, come with me, please.
not_available Jamey.
not_available I've already told these men I don't know anything.
not_available Trying to protect Jack and Nina? Don't be naive.
not_available Sit.
not_available Let me tell you how the game is played.
not_available First thing they do is to tell you that you're the only one they can trust.
not_available That's flattering and it makes you trust them in return.
not_available Right? Then they get you to do something you shouldn't.
not_available Say you don't know where Jack went, for example.
not_available Then the next thing you know, Jack's gone Nina's stonewalling, and you're in the hot seat.
not_available Sound familiar? You're being used.
not_available I've seen it a million times.
not_available If you help me out, I'll help you out.
not_available If you hold out Mason.
not_available Really? Good.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available It seems our boy has surfaced.
not_available His name popped up on a police frequency.
not_available Not that I'm surprised.
not_available Is he in trouble? Off the record, just out of curiosity what's so special about Jack Bauer? All right, we found Bauer.
not_available We're pulling out.
not_available Lockdown's over.
not_available I hope you give some thought to what we talked about.
not_available Call it in as a DOA.
not_available Pedestrian hit by vehicle.
not_available Everything checked out, here you go.
not_available What was her name? Jessie Hampton.
not_available You know anything about this guy? No.
not_available But I got to take him for questioning.
not_available Maybe you didn't notice, but he killed a cop.
not_available Of course I did, but there's something else at stake here.
not_available Not to me.
not_available Not to these guys.
not_available All right.
not_available Can I at least have a few minutes with him? Guys.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Get up.
not_available If you tell me who you are, I might be able to help you.
not_available Don't let them take me.
not_available If they do, I'm dead.
not_available They seem in control.
not_available I'm not worried about them.
not_available Who are you worried about? First you spring me, then I talk.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available That's too bad Bauer.
not_available Bauer? How do you know my name? Time's up.
not_available I know more than that.
not_available If you ever want to see your daughter again, get me out of this.
not_available What do you know about my daughter? I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
