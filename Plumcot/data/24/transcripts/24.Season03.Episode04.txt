
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Wayne said you wanted to see me.
not_available Keeler.
not_available Hes bringing your ex
not_available husband into this debate, the SECs investigation into his company.
not_available Well, Ted was convicted and served his sentence, you know that.
not_available All that Ted Packard wants is money! If we pay him off hell recant before this debate.
not_available Its blackmail! We could have the money within the hour.
not_available Thought you were with my dad Your dads side
not_available lining me, Kim.
not_available Make him sit up! Look, I know my dad can be hard but he will come around.
not_available We shouldnt have told him.
not_available Well, the only other option I can think of is for us to stop seeing each other.
not_available Chase, what do you want? I want to be able to do my job! Linda! I need your help! These guys, they will kill me if I dont get them something.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Im at the mall.
not_available CTU knows the powders not real.
not_available Now theyre going after Singer.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Grab him and take him to containment.
not_available Done! We believe your son was infected with a virus in Mexico earlier this morning before he came home.
not_available We have three hours to find him before he becomes contagious.
not_available We got it, Jack! Hes at Los Feliz mall between Vermont and Sunset.
not_available I can land a team there in ten minutes.
not_available OK, fine.
not_available Kyle? 
not_available Who are you? My name is Tony Almeida.
not_available Im a federal agent but Im here to help you.
not_available I dont believe you.
not_available Come with me, Ill prove it to you.
not_available We have an officer down! Kyle Singers not in custody! I repeat: Kyle singers not in custody! The following takes place between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm.
not_available Doctor! Get out of the way, please! Jack isn't picking up.
not_available Aren't any other agents there? Isn't Tony there? I can't get through to him either.
not_available I'm trying Michael right now.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available There's been gunshots at the mall.
not_available When? About two minutes ago.
not_available I can't get in touch with my dad, or Tony.
not_available Michael said someone's down.
not_available Who? It's either Tony or Jack, he's not sure.
not_available He's about to find out.
not_available Hold on.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available Jack, what's going on? Where's Tony? 
not_available He's been shot.
not_available How bad? 
not_available He was hit in the neck.
not_available He's still alive.
not_available They're getting him into hospital now.
not_available Oh God! Michelle, I know how difficult this must be for you right now.
not_available But you need to make a decision.
not_available What? With Tony down you're in command.
not_available If you wanna be by his side at the hospital you're gonna have to hand CTU over to someone else.
not_available No
not_available one will fault you for whatever you choose to do.
not_available But if you choose to stay, we need you to work at full capacity.
not_available I understand.
not_available Michelle, I'm sorry.
not_available Is Tony all right? 
not_available They don't know yet he was shot in the neck.
not_available Michelle, we're starting to overload the network.
not_available When the virus threat came in, we had start stealing cycles from the main CPE.
not_available Chloe, now is not a good time.
not_available What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? Just deal with it, ok? Michelle? 
not_available Offload the archive files and send them to Division.
not_available That should free up the network.
not_available Fine.
not_available That's all I needed to know! I have to get to the hospital.
not_available Michelle, I need you in the conference area.
not_available The second call from Hector Salazar's people just came in.
not_available I am not in the position to deal with this right now.
not_available Who else is there? You're the ranking agent on site.
not_available Kim, I want you to find out what hospital they took Tony to.
not_available The second anyone knows anything you have them patched through to me.
not_available Ok.
not_available Deliver Ramon Salazar to the Bad Night Stand, adjacent to the 101 Freeway.
not_available Provide him with a full spectrum band wave radio, adjusted to frequency XQ2137.
not_available Do not attempt aerial or ground surveillance.
not_available You have two hours from the receipt of this message to comply.
not_available If you violate any one of these conditions, we will release the virus.
not_available Does the encoding scheme match the first message? Yeah.
not_available Is there any way you can find out where it came from? I can scan the frequency, maybe we'll get lucky.
not_available Whoever sent this message is controling Kyle Singer's movements.
not_available We have two hours to find him before they release the virus.
not_available Kyle? 
not_available Linda, where are you? I'm trying to find a place to park but they're putting out some kind of barricades, something's going on here.
not_available No, no, don't go to the garage.
not_available Meet me outside the East entrance, ok? On Vermont? Yeah, yeah, go there now.
not_available I'll be there in a sec.
not_available Over here! I found him! Move over! Come on! Get over! What's going on? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Where are we going? We just gotta get out of here.
not_available It's all contact frequency so if he shows up anywhere please let me know as soon as possible, ok? You got it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I just heard about Tony.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's he doing? He's on his way to the hospital.
not_available Why isn't Michelle with him? 
not_available She knows it's gonna set us back if she and Tony are both gone.
not_available Tell Michell I'm heading over to Downey.
not_available You going to see Salazar? Yeah.
not_available My dad said questioning him was a waste of time.
not_available No, sitting round in here is a waste of time.
not_available Don't you think you should clear it with Michelle first? We lost the kid who's infected with the virus.
not_available If anyone knows where he's going it's Salazar.
not_available At least run it by her before you go.
not_available I'll call her from Downey.
not_available Chase! Dessler.
not_available I'm looking for Tony Almeida's wife.
not_available Yes, this is Michelle.
not_available Michelle, this is Dr Landser at Good Samaritan hospital.
not_available How is he? I'm afraid the wound to your husbanïs neck is gonna require some vascular repair.
not_available We're just about to go into surgery.
not_available CanCan I talk to him? No, we've medicated him.
not_available In fact that's why I'm calling you.
not_available We need your verbal consent to operate.
not_available Yes, yes, yesOf course.
not_available Whatever you have to do 
not_available Great, thanks.
not_available Are you sure he's gonna be ok? Well we can't say anything with a 100% certainty until we get in there.
not_available But he's gonna be in good hands.
not_available Please let me know the second you finish.
not_available I'll find you in the waiting room when we're out of surgery.
not_available Dr Landser, I will do my best to be there but you may have to reach me through this number.
not_available Ok, we'll find you.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available Sure.
not_available I just spoke with Anne's ex
not_available husband.
not_available I'm meeting him in half an hour.
not_available Unless you're changing your mind I've never given in to blackmail in my life.
not_available Yes, but considering everything that you're up against today we decided that I decided to pay! It's my choice.
not_available And David, you're making the right one.
not_available Give this guy some money, he crawls back under his rock and life will be a lot simpler for everyone.
not_available Including Anne.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have Jack Bauer on the line, sir.
not_available Put him through.
not_available The president's on the line, Mr Bauer.
not_available Mr President? It's Jack Bauer.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available I was told that Hector Salazar has given your office final instructions on delivering his brother.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I've also been told that you might be able to pre
not_available empt that demand.
not_available We've identified the person carrying the virus.
not_available He is a young man named Kyle Singer.
not_available Then you know where he is? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Unfortunately we lost him.
not_available Can you find him? Not in the time
not_available frame that Hector Salazar has given us to release his brother.
not_available So, either I hand over Ramon Salazar or risk that his brother will release the virus.
not_available Mr President, I understand that this is an impossible choice.
not_available It's not a choice, Jack.
not_available Not really.
not_available This nation's policy of non negotiation with terrorists has been a proven deterrent.
not_available Capitulating to Salazar would effectively destroy that policy.
not_available Mr President, hundreds of thousands of innocent people may die within the week.
not_available More would die in the long run if I released Salazar.
not_available I would be declaring open season on the American people.
not_available This is your final answer, sir? 
not_available I don't negotiate with terrorists, Jack.
not_available I won't negotiate with terrorists! 
not_available I understand Mr President, thank you.
not_available Conference in CDC and Health Services.
not_available I want a full briefing on quarantine and evacuation procedures.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Can you just tell me where we're going? I don't know, ok? I've just gotta get out of town for a second, and figure this whole thing out.
not_available I thought you had to meet with those guys.
not_available That's why I brought you the money! Things have changed, all right? What are you into, Kyle? I mean, you ask me to steal this money from my father so those guys won't hurt you over losing their drugs I don't think it was drugs! What do you mean? What is it about? I don't know.
not_available These cops, they came to my apartment today, and they were saying something about using me toto bring some weird disease into the country! A disease? Yeah.
not_available This cop, he washe was saying it was inside of me.
not_available In your body? I know It sounds ridiculous, right? Right? Man, this whole thing is so surreal, ain't it? Pull over.
not_available What? I said pull over! What are you doing? What are you doing? Take the car, take the money! Whatever you're doing, I don't want any part of it! Hey look, linda! Linda, come on! Come on! Stay away from me, ok? If you've got some kind of disease, I don't want it! You should have never done any of it! 
not_available DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT? Kyle, please! Fine, fine.
not_available Baby, you're right.
not_available You're right, I'll stay away, ok? The money's under the front seat.
not_available Ok, now, come on Linda, please! Kyle, I really don't want anything to happen to you, ok? I really don't but I can't do this! How stupid am I! I'm sorry.
not_available Go! Run! Run, Linda! Go! Sir, we have a monitoring plan for everyone inside the quarantine zone.
not_available Define the quarantine zone.
not_available Everyone within a two mile radius of ground zero, ground zero being the shopping center where Kyle Singer was last seen.
not_available Mr President, this is Dr Nicole Duncan at Health Services.
not_available Medical teams are in place and are ready to start screening and releasing people from quarantine over a 72 hour period.
not_available If we move quickly, we believe we can lower the prior casualty estimate.
not_available Lower to what? 
not_available Between 60000 and 90000.
not_available This is Wayne Palmer.
not_available YeahYeah All right, thank you, Miss Dessler, Dr Duncan 
not_available Mr President.
not_available We're about to set into motion a chain of events that will create panick throughout the country, that will take some time to control.
not_available If anyone here sees an option that I'm overlooking, now's the time to offer it up.
not_available It's Jack Bauer.
not_available He needs to talk to you in private, and he said it's urgent.
not_available Could you all excuse me for a moment? In the meantime I want everyone to contact their key personnel, make sure they're ready to go.
not_available What is it, Jack? 
not_available Mr President, is this line secure? Yes.
not_available What do you need to tell me, Jack? For what it's worth, sir, I agree with you supporting this country's policy to not negotiate with terrorists Jack, you didn't call me to express your approval of my decision.
not_available I have another option for you to consider.
not_available Another option? Yes, one that, I believe, that will protect the integrity of this nation's policy and stop this outbreak from beginning.
not_available And how would I do this? 
not_available By simply doing nothing, sir.
not_available Nothing? 
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Hector Salazar will view that as non compliance with his demand.
not_available Not if he gets his brother back.
not_available How? Ramon Salazar would be broken out of prison and delivered to him.
not_available The public and, more importantly, other terrorist groups would view this as a prison break as opposed to a capitulation to their terrorist demands.
not_available Sounds like quite a plan, Jack! Who breaks Salazar out? 
not_available I will, sir.
not_available By yourself? I know the prison and I have full access to the prisoner.
not_available Because of the nature of my involvement with the Salazars I can break him out and deliver him.
not_available I have a history of insubordination with CTU, they would believe that I've switched sides.
not_available The cover story would stay clean.
not_available This doesn't sound like a one
not_available man job.
not_available I think in order to protect you Mr President, this has to be.
not_available I don't know, Jack.
not_available There has to be some other way.
not_available No, no.
not_available Not in the time that we've got left.
not_available The Salazars are going to release the virus in the next two hours.
not_available Regardless of how successful you are at containing the initial outbreak, the resulting civil unrest will far outreach any quarantine zones you've established.
not_available The damage to this country, sir, would be catastrophic.
not_available Mr President? I need your "ok" on this.
not_available Even if you succeed, I won't be able to protect your legal status.
not_available You'll be a fugitive.
not_available I understand, Mr President.
not_available This will be my last assignment.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available If you don't say anything, Mr President, I will accept that as a "go" for this mission.
not_available Good luck, Mr President.
not_available I want the information from Dr Duncan's central records in my office.
not_available My eyes only.
not_available Wayne? Where are you going? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Wait.
not_available I'm sorry, Anne but I I have an appointment.
not_available And I am running late.
not_available An appointment? The debate starts in 30 minutes! Who are you meeting? I'm sorry again but that's confidential.
not_available It's government business.
not_available Does this have anything to do with my ex
not_available husband? Like I said: it's government business.
not_available Surgery, nurses' station.
not_available Yes this is Tony Almeida's wife Michelle.
not_available I was wondering if he'd gone into surgery yet? Yes he has.
not_available I just wanted Dr Landser to know that he's allergic to penicillin.
not_available Yes, he's aware of it.
not_available The allergy card was in his wallet.
not_available Is there a way to know how he's doing in there? No but the doctor will contact you as soon as he's out of surgery.
not_available Ok, thank you.
not_available Yeah? Er, the site profiles are done.
not_available You could have sent these to my system.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I wanted to come down here anyway.
not_available Why? Because of earlier.
not_available What is it Chloe? I just want you to know that I didn't know Tony had been shot in the neck, when I was insensitive earlier.
not_available And had I known I certainly would have been more careful about my choice of words, ok? It's fine Chloe.
not_available I do try to be aware of other people, you know that, don't you? I said it's fine.
not_available Ok.
not_available Gael? What? I think we should be careful about how we talk to Michelle today.
not_available She's really sensitive.
not_available About Tony being shot.
not_available In the neck.
not_available Of course.
not_available So I'm telling everybody.
not_available Make sure everyone in your department knows.
not_available I've got to take this call.
not_available Is this a personal cell? I thought those were prohibited because they can't be monitored? I'm using it for an emergency, I'm moving around a lot.
not_available They'll monitor it at the other end.
not_available I've really got to take this call.
not_available Hello? When did you make the second call? Are they letting Ramon go or no? They're still deciding.
not_available What are they waiting for? They have less than two hours! I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.
not_available I'm sorry! It's not good to touch what's not yours! Does your sister know you're here? 
not_available No.
not_available Did you know it was loaded? It is a nice gun, huh? Take it, Sergio, it's ok.
not_available You like the way it feels? Huh? You want to pull the trigger? Hear the noise it makes? That's the power of these things, Sergio.
not_available It feels like a gun! Can I? Sure.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on! You see that vase down there? Ok, now I want you to aim.
not_available And squeeze the trigger.
not_available Very slowly.
not_available What are you doing? Get out of here! Go! Now! How many times do I have to tell you to leave him alone? He's just a boy! A boy who needs to become a man! You're not his father! What you gonna do, huh? You gonna shoot me? Come on! Pull the trigger! Right here, come on! Get in there! What are you gonna do to us? WhatWhat is this? What are you gonna do to us? Come.
not_available We never really finished our conversation.
not_available I was just wondering what you had decided.
not_available Decided about what? The debate.
not_available What to do about my ex
not_available husband.
not_available I ran into Wayne a few minutes ago.
not_available I know he's never liked me but this was different.
not_available He was avoiding me and I had a feeling I wasn't able to shake.
not_available What kind of feeling? That you're paying Ted to keep quiet! Is that what you're doing, David? Sometimes you have to do the wrong thing for the right reason.
not_available How can you reward someone for threatening you with a lie? That's wrong.
not_available There are political realities I have to consider if I want to stay in office.
not_available I'll tell you something If it makes you feel better It doesn't make me feel better! It just happens to be the truth.
not_available Anne, I have been in this job for nearly four years.
not_available And I have learnt the hard way that there are no absolutes.
not_available Sometimes you have to make compromises Politically, yes! But when it comes to morality David, you have to draw the line.
not_available I have drawn the line.
not_available We're just standing on different sides! You're running scared.
not_available I am fighting to stay in office and serve the people that put me here.
not_available Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and trust that the people will be able to tell the difference.
not_available It's not that easy! You've never been about what's easy.
not_available You've been about what's right.
not_available That's who you are.
not_available That's who the people elected to lead them.
not_available And for what it's worth, that's who I fell in love with.
not_available I was I was trying to protect you.
not_available Protect me? This won't end with Keeler's allegation! You're gonna be in the media's cross hairs.
not_available I am used to public scrutiny.
not_available Not like this! This will be different.
not_available And much uglier than you can imagine.
not_available I can defend myself.
not_available David? Have you made contact with Packard? Just going to.
not_available Are you with him now? No, he's coming over now.
not_available Why? Walk away.
not_available What? You heard me.
not_available David, we've been through this.
not_available Now, you decided to bury this thing, remember? I've changed my mind.
not_available Anne talked to you, didn't she? Wayne! Walk away.
not_available You wanted to see me? I've spoken to Chloe, and Adam, and we'll cover for you if you want to go to the hospital to be with Tony.
not_available Cover for me? Well, we know You've got a lot on your mind right now.
not_available I'm fine Gael! We just thought Look, Michelle.
not_available I've been taking 30% of Chloe's load since the bio
not_available threat came in.
not_available I can handle half of COM's load as well.
not_available We just need the right user password on district servers so we won't be slowed down by request authorization.
not_available It's Joe Tommisello's area, he put a 24 hour delay on user logs because of security problems we've been having.
not_available So what if I call Joe and get him to wait for us? I tried that, he's unreachable.
not_available Is there any other way to do this? More bodies.
not_available We need at least four more system radi
not_available analysts to take on work we've been doing.
not_available I can make some calls, get the next shift in early.
not_available I've already tried that.
not_available By the time they got here it would be too late.
not_available Look, I appreciate this but it's not gonna happen.
not_available So let's get back to work.
not_available Michelle! Listen, I agree.
not_available We can't run this place by committy.
not_available Let me step in for you.
not_available Adam and Chloe can stay at their posts.
not_available What about yours? When I was at Langley, I filled out for my period chief a couple of times and we got through it.
not_available Was there a bio
not_available threat? President in town all in one day? Thank you anyway, Gael.
not_available CTU, Bauer? Kim, it's your dad, what are you doing right now? I'm still trying to locate a point of origin on that phone call from Salazar's people.
not_available Ok, look, I'm gonna need you to do something for me first, it's not gonna take long.
not_available What? 
not_available I need you to generate a prisoner transfer document.
not_available Look in your file form, under the heading "Federal Transit Authorization".
not_available What's this about? I need to move Ramon Salazar.
not_available Why are you gonna move him? Kim, this has been given priority clearance.
not_available No
not_available one in CTU's supposed to know.
not_available That's why you're the only person I can trust to do this for me.
not_available So, please, help.
not_available Ok.
not_available It's asking for a clearance code.
not_available It's: *99.
not_available Now it wants a pass
not_available word.
not_available Lincoln 65 FGA.
not_available Ok.
not_available It's cycling.
not_available It's gonna take a minute.
not_available Ok, good.
not_available Look, Kim, I know you tried to come up to my office earlier today to talk to me about something that was really important to you.
not_available And I know I wasn't very supportive and I just wanted to You don't have to do this, dad.
not_available Sweetheart, I do.
not_available I need to tell you I'm sorry.
not_available I know that I'm awfully protective of you.
not_available I just watched so many things happen to you over the last few years I don't want you to get hurt anymore.
not_available The fact is, I trust you, I trust your jugement.
not_available I need you to know that anything that you ever chose to do I would support you in.
not_available Ok? Thanks that means a lot to me.
not_available Good.
not_available I love you so much, Kim.
not_available I love you too, dad.
not_available Are you ok? Yeah, yeah I'm all right.
not_available Is the document up yet? Yeah.
not_available Ok, I need you to send it to warden Mitchell, over at Downey, now.
not_available Done.
not_available Ok, good.
not_available Let me speak to Chase.
not_available He's not here.
not_available What are you talking about? Where is he? Kim? Kim, where is Chase? He went to interrogate Salazar.
not_available Chase is at the prison, now? He left about 15 minutes ago.
not_available He's gonna be there soon.
not_available I'm gonna have to get back to you.
not_available Son of a bitch! Yeah.
not_available Chase, what are you doing? I'm gonna talk to Salazar! Get back to CTU now! And do what? Some filing and some dusting round the office? No, I want you to work with Michelle and find Kyle Singer! She's got a dozen IT people on that right now! Listen to me! No! Listen to me, Jack.
not_available I know you're angry about me and Kim, I get that! But I'm not gonna let you stop me from doing my job! YOUR JOB IS TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS! You're in no condition to give me orders! Chase, I'm warning you.
not_available Don't go against me! Jack, look.
not_available You know I respect you but you also know I've been covering for you.
not_available Since you've been back, I've been keeping the fact that you're a junkie from Kim and everybody else at CTU! I'm not doing it anymore.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Chase? Chase? Damn it! Get this guy processed and get him out of here.
not_available Agent Edmunds.
not_available Warden.
not_available I need to see Salazar.
not_available I've got a lot going on right now.
not_available Have division follow up for written authorization but you need to let me see Salazar now.
not_available Salazar's been buying two murders today.
not_available Nobody gets close to him without full paperwork.
not_available You don't understand what's happening today? Our Salazar has information that I need.
not_available What kind of information? It's classified! This is my facility.
not_available I need to know.
not_available We're dealing with major terrorist threat.
not_available Salazar's brother is behind it.
not_available Go ahead and confirm with division if you want to.
not_available But hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, here.
not_available Now, Jack and I have been coming here twice a week for the last three months.
not_available Salazar's prevented us from doing our job with his stalling and his lawyers and his due process.
not_available We don't have time for that I need to go one on one with him, right now.
not_available He's in isolation cell in B block.
not_available Come on, I'll take you.
not_available Surveillance cameras? 
not_available Yeah, 3.
not_available Get them turned off.
not_available It's against regulations.
not_available Won't be any marks, I promise.
not_available You get 30 minutes.
not_available This is warden Mitchell.
not_available I need you to go black on isolation B.
not_available For how long, sir? Until further notice.
not_available You're a tough guy, huh! You are not worried of what might happen if you lay a finger on me? OkIf you're not worried, neither am I.
not_available Let me know when you start to worry.
not_available Where's Kyle Singer? I told you, I don't know! You're gonna tell me who does! Chase! Put him in his cell.
not_available What are you doing here, Jack? We're running out of options.
not_available We can't find Singer.
not_available Salazar's our only hope.
not_available You were right.
not_available He's tougher to break than I thought.
not_available Maybe two of us can Yeah.
not_available Look, Jack, about what I said before 
not_available Forget about it.
not_available So we're ok? You and me? Yeah, we're ok.
not_available Tell me about the security cameras.
not_available They're disabled.
not_available Good.
not_available Get him out of his cell.
not_available Are you gonna kill me, now, Jack? I'd love to, but I can't.
not_available If you play this cool, Ramon, you're walking out of here with me now.
not_available You'll be with your brother in the next couple of hours.
not_available Now, grab his feet.
not_available Turn and face the wall.
not_available How are you gonna feel, Anne if David loses this election because of you? I don't think that's very likely.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Then you really don't know what you're talking about, do you? Because this allegation may cost him this debate.
not_available And David needs this debate to win this election.
not_available It was blackmail.
not_available And David made the decision to pay.
not_available It wasn't up to you to change his mind! If he believed the decision was right, he wouldn't have changed his mind.
not_available The problem is, you can't stand the fact that your brother wants me in his life.
not_available Because you're a distraction to him.
not_available And you're a liability.
not_available Compared to whom? Sherry? I'm not gonna sit here and try and defend Sherry.
not_available She went off the rails.
not_available But at least she understood the game, and she understood David.
not_available She was with him for over 20 years.
not_available I have been with him long enough to know the kind of man he is.
not_available You don't know anything about him or what it takes to survive in the world he lives in.
not_available We disagree, Wayne.
not_available We always have.
not_available Anne, I will not stand by and watch you jeopardize everything that he's worked for.
not_available I won't do it.
not_available I don't scare easily.
not_available What's happening, Jack? After all you went through to put me in here, I can't believe you're letting me out! Shut up.
not_available I don't believe you sold out.
not_available It's not your nature.
not_available But then, why knock out the kid? Did your government cave, but can't admit it? Is that what happened? You don't look so good, Jack.
not_available That's a bitch! You wanna get out of here? You'll keep your mouth shut and do what I say.
not_available You understand me? We've been cleared to pass.
not_available The warden wants to see you first.
not_available He'll be here in a minute.
not_available Ok.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Sorry to keep you waiting, Jack.
not_available What's the problem? The access codes of this transfer order.
not_available They don't correspond to the ones assigned by the bureau of prisons.
not_available Division superseded those access codes.
not_available CTU has a mandate to prefix.
not_available This is yesterday's prefix.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Someone in my office must have screwed up.
not_available Look, we'll get you the proper prefix retroactively.
not_available Look, I know about the terrorist threat.
not_available Agent Edmunds told me.
not_available That's exactly why we need to move the prisoner now.
not_available It's classified priority one, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.
not_available But I can't afford to lose any time over some small technical detail.
not_available Come on, Kevin, help me out.
not_available Where's agent Edmunds? He's conducting a search of the prisoner's cell.
not_available Trying to find some additional information.
not_available He'll be right behind me, he can help you out with the paperwork.
not_available Right, pick up your badge and go to receiving.
not_available Thanks, we'll hurry out.
not_available Move.
not_available Turn on isolation 3, please.
not_available What the hell? Someone turned the camera, the angle's wrong.
not_available Get Binge to meet me in isolation.
not_available Door.
not_available Face the wall.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available Can I get my gun and a badge? Open it! Door! Kind of hot today! Yeah, I'm burning! Whatever Bauer told you, he's lying! Come on! Here you are, check your gun.
not_available Ok.
not_available Daniel I'm back on post.
not_available Move! Security 3, get a block of the whole ward.
not_available Open the cell blocks, now! I can't do it from here.
not_available Is it worth losing your life over? Do it now! Come on! Get the hell out!
