
not_available That's hyoscine pentothal.
not_available You will experience pain I can't even describe.
not_available At eight ccs I risk inducing a heart attack.
not_available Four ccs.
not_available That's eight ccs.
not_available His vitals are spiking across the line.
not_available Four ccs! The connection you found between Dad and Gredenko had to do with a contract that was awarded to us.
not_available What did a general have to do with a contract? It was his job to release the old nukes into the US for decommissioning.
not_available He knows you didn't tell him everything.
not_available I won't, Dad.
not_available I have to be sure.
not_available I'd like you to appear on television and appeal to members of Islamic communities to come forward with any information on Fayed.
not_available I can't reach out to them for help.
not_available I know you can.
not_available Fayed already called me a traitor.
not_available Many others will follow if there is a suspicion I am an American puppet! Not a puppet, a partner.
not_available At least when it comes to finding these nuclear weapons.
not_available The presidentjust rejected every one of my proposals.
not_available That a change in leadership is imperative to ensure this nation's security.
not_available I'm not talking about holding hearings.
not_available Something more immediate would have to happen.
not_available This is the engineer? 
not_available You've got the wrong man.
not_available You're going to modify this so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs.
not_available You will do it.
not_available How much pain will be inflicted on you before you comply? Stop! I'll do it.
not_available Arm it.
not_available Very good.
not_available Fayed's already gone.
not_available The reprogramming device Fayed had me build 
not_available if it's not here, it means he took it with him.
not_available And with it, he can activate the other bombs he has any time he wants.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have the arming device, but I had to leave one of the suitcases behind.
not_available What happened? 
not_available CTU found me.
not_available I needed to preoccupy them with a bomb to enable my escape.
not_available The delivery system software was programmed for five detonations at five high
not_available priority targets.
not_available Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three.
not_available More than enough for our needs, Gredenko.
not_available Just make sure the delivery system arrives on schedule.
not_available The trucks have left Nevada.
not_available They'll reach the location within two hours.
not_available Good.
not_available Use the time to reprogram your targeting software.
not_available Call me when it's completed.
not_available The FAA couldn't track Fayed's chopper.
not_available We have to assume it's somewhere outside the containment area.
not_available We may not know where Fayed is, but we know he has a device enabling him to activate the three remaining suitcase nukes in his arsenal.
not_available Our only potential lead was uploaded from a laptop hard drive recovered by Jack and his team.
not_available Milo.
not_available There was an email fragment I restored from the hard drive.
not_available It referenced recent communications between Fayed and Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available Gredenko is the former Soviet general who turned over Russian nukes to the US for decommission.
not_available He was the source of Fayed's weapons.
not_available Gredenko is more involved than we realised.
not_available What's his interest in helping Fayed? Gredenko is an ultra
not_available nationalist.
not_available His desire to harm this country is in synch with Fayed's.
not_available Any updated intel on his location? 
not_available Interpol confirmed he's not in Moscow.
not_available Since the pointof
not_available origin fingerprint on the email was Pacific time, it's safe to assume he's somewhere on the West Coast, possibly Los Angeles.
not_available Run a data sweep through INS and customs.
not_available See if we can track how he got in the country.
not_available Morris.
not_available We have to take him to Medical.
not_available I want to talk to him.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Give us ten minutes.
not_available Bill.
not_available Jack.
not_available Did you pull anything off the drive? 
not_available We have.
not_available Fayed was in contact with Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available Gredenko? 
not_available Perhaps aided Fayed's operation all along.
not_available You think he's in LA? 
not_available Evidence on the drive points to that.
not_available What leads on Gredenko? Your father's company was to dispose of the nukes Gredenko was to hand over.
not_available My brother oversaw those contracts, not my father.
not_available He might have information.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Where is he? He went to see your brother's body in the morgue.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Chloe, are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you for saving Morris's life.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm really glad Fayed didn't kill you this morning.
not_available Me too.
not_available I have to talk to my father.
not_available I just want to thank you for everything.
not_available Dad.
not_available Whatever your brother may have done, he didn't deserve this.
not_available I didn't mean for this to happen.
not_available Yeah, well Dad, I'm sorry about Graem.
not_available I am.
not_available But right now, CTU wants to know about your connection to Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available What? We believe he's working with Fayed.
not_available They want to know what you know about him.
not_available He was the Russian liaison on our contracted decommissioned Soviet nukes.
not_available Why? What dealings did you have with him? 
not_available Couple of calls to Moscow.
not_available That's about it.
not_available Does Gredenko have contacts allowing Fayed to remove the remaining four nukes? Look, Jack.
not_available Like I told you, I had virtually no involvement.
not_available Graem oversaw the project.
not_available He dealt with Gredenko.
not_available Whatever you need to know died with him.
not_available Do you know where Marilyn is? No.
not_available Why? You gonna question her too? She's probably with Josh.
not_available He's taking the death of his father pretty hard.
not_available Leave them alone, Jack.
not_available Let them grieve in peace.
not_available I'll make a call to some of the company executives.
not_available About Gredenko.
not_available Maybe Graem shared something that I wasn't privy to.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Try to rest.
not_available You're doing very well.
not_available You can go in now.
not_available Morris? How are you feeling? 
not_available Say something.
not_available What is there to say? You were tortured.
not_available You held out as long as you could.
not_available I armed a nuclear bomb.
not_available You had to.
not_available Fayed was gonna kill you.
not_available I wish to God he had.
not_available Because of me, Fayed has a device that can arm all the bloody suitcase nukes he wants.
not_available You can't blame yourself.
not_available When the next bomb goes off and thousands more people die, everybody will remember that I was the one that made it possible.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available We'll find Fayed and stop him, and none of this will matter.
not_available Are you any closer to finding him? 
not_available No.
not_available Just go, darling.
not_available Go.
not_available Yes, Mr Bauer.
not_available We got a problem.
not_available Gredenko is here.
not_available In LA? Are you sure? Yes.
not_available Only they don't know where he is.
not_available We've got to get to him before they do.
not_available If Gredenko implicates me, everything the company I founded, spent my life protecting 
not_available it's over, understand? Yes.
not_available I'll put a team together.
not_available I'll monitor CTU from here.
not_available If I hear anything, I'll call.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I don't care what you have to do.
not_available You find Gredenko and you kill him.
not_available Understood.
not_available I talked to my father about Gredenko.
not_available He'll make some inquiries, but he doesn't know anything.
not_available The news here isn't better, but Milo traced the fragment he pulled off Fayed's computer to a local IP network.
not_available It confirms Gredenko is definitely here in LA.
not_available I got my people monitoring chatter, data
not_available mining backlogs on Gredenko's activities prior to going underground.
not_available Right now, that's all we can do.
not_available OK.
not_available Have a seat, Jack.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Toxicology report on your brother's body.
not_available Forensic evidence indicates the hyoscine pentothal you gave to Graem during his interrogation caused his coronary.
not_available There's something else.
not_available I saw the field tape and Rick Burke's report for Division.
not_available He said you exceeded protocols after he warned you of dangerous levels.
not_available That's true.
not_available Agent Burke tried to warn me.
not_available Then you pulled a gun on him.
not_available You realise how this looks, coming after he tried to kill you.
not_available I lost control.
not_available You found out he was behind Palmer's assassination.
not_available Yes, I found out he was behind Palmer's assassination.
not_available I found out about everything.
not_available I lost control.
not_available I tried to tell you I didn't think I could do this 
not_available this job.
not_available I wanted to kill my brother.
not_available I wanted him dead.
not_available I was standing over him and I looked up and I saw my father in the doorway, and then everything just stopped.
not_available I ordered Agent Burke to shut down the IV.
not_available He did.
not_available I thought we got it in time.
not_available Bill, I did not set out to kill my brother.
not_available I swear to you.
not_available I can adjust the report before I send it to Division.
not_available No! 
not_available Jack.
not_available An investigation will impede our search for Fayed and Gredenko.
not_available You are critical.
not_available You cannot cover this up.
not_available I ordered Agent Burke to administer the hyoscine pentothal.
not_available I killed my brother.
not_available Whatever the consequences are, I accept them.
not_available Bill, do this right.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll submit the report as is.
not_available There is some difficulty with my statement? More emphasis on religion and less on politics than I expected.
not_available Many of the people you wish me to sway have been persuaded that our cause is a holy one.
not_available I am not innocent in this manipulation.
not_available So I must address them in these terms if I am to enlist their cooperation.
not_available Yes.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Vice President Daniels is calling for you.
not_available Would you like to take it in your office? No, I'll take it in here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Noah? Thanks for taking my call.
not_available I know you're pressed for time.
not_available What can I do? I'm disappointed you rejected Tom Lennox's plan for mass internment of Arab nationals.
not_available The plan did not delineate country of origin.
not_available It was a blanket proposal to arrest and detain thousands of Muslims living here.
not_available Without due process.
not_available Since, as I understand it, the terrorists have acquired the capability to arm the three remaining nuclear weapons, I'm asking you to reconsider.
not_available I thought I told you my decision was not open for debate.
not_available That's unfortunate, since the majority of your cabinet feels you're making a tragic mistake.
not_available I respect that.
not_available But I believe that our best chance of stopping further attacks will come from the intelligence drawn from Islamic communities.
not_available And you hope to obtain that by letting a known terrorist leader address the world on American airwaves.
not_available The man has murdered countless innocents over the past 20 years and you are putting your hopes for this country's safety on him.
not_available Not entirely.
not_available But to the extent that he can help us, yes.
not_available Mr President, you approached me cos you knew I'd deliver voters who questioned your experience, who were afraid that your presidency would be too weak on national defence, and I assured them otherwise.
not_available But now you're proving them right.
not_available There is a thin line between conviction and stubbornness.
not_available You can stand firm, butjust know that you are standing alone.
not_available Are we done? Clearly.
not_available You are paying a very high price for doing this.
not_available Not as high as my country will pay if I'm wrong.
not_available As someone who's alienated followers by choosing the unpopular course, I suggest you tread carefully among your people.
not_available Mr Assad, our cultures are very different.
not_available It's notjust a cultural issue, Mr President.
not_available It's simple human nature.
not_available They will come after you.
not_available I assure you of that.
not_available Are you sure it's safe to talk in here? 
not_available Yes, this area is currently unmonitored.
not_available All right.
not_available You intimated you had some sort of plan of dealing with the president.
not_available Palmer's refusal to implement your proposals will unquestionably lead to the loss of many more American lives.
not_available And I and many others like me who love this country will not stand by idly and let that happen.
not_available So what is it you propose? 
not_available I think you know.
not_available I need to hear.
not_available Definitive action.
not_available We are in a national crisis and he is in over his head.
not_available He has brought this on himself.
not_available Listen, before you start reconsidering and report me, just know, I will deny that we ever had this conversation.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not I'm not reconsidering.
not_available I know what you're saying is necessary.
not_available I just cannot believe it has come to this.
not_available Who else is involved? 
not_available You don't need to know that.
not_available I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.
not_available Right now you're dealing with me.
not_available Vice President Daniels 
not_available is he involved? No.
not_available The vice president doesn't know about this.
not_available But we do know that he shares our sentiment in regard to the current state of affairs and that he will enact your initiatives once he has the power to do so.
not_available You seem pretty certain this is gonna work.
not_available More so with your help.
not_available I need the president's itinerary, specifically in regards to Assad's televised address.
not_available I do not have the clearance.
not_available I need you to access it.
not_available Why? Why do you need this? Dammit, Reed.
not_available We're talking about removing the President of the United States.
not_available Do not keep me in the dark here.
not_available I never said that I was the architect of this.
not_available I'm just a conduit.
not_available Besides, for your sake, I think that it is very important we maintain a certain level of plausible deniability.
not_available The less you know the better.
not_available I'll get you that itinerary.
not_available Marilyn.
not_available Hi.
not_available I heard you were with Josh.
not_available I didn't want to disturb you.
not_available Yeah, well, he's taking it pretty hard.
not_available He loved his father very much.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available You don't owe me an apology.
not_available Maybe they haven't told you the circumstances of Graem's heart attack.
not_available They told me enough.
not_available Look, Jack, I know the kind of man Graem was.
not_available Even if he did die because of your interrogation, I don't blame you.
not_available I blame him.
not_available Truth is, I've been trying to leave Graem for years.
not_available But he threatened to take Josh away from me.
not_available He said I'd never see him again.
not_available Did Josh know what he was like? 
not_available No.
not_available I tried to protect him from the truth about his father.
not_available What have you told him about his father's death? Only that he had a heart attack.
not_available It's enough for now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to go back to work.
not_available If there's anything I can do Is it true there are more bombs out there? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you any closer to finding them? No, we hit a roadblock.
not_available We're looking for a Russian operative helping the terrorists.
not_available Graem knew him.
not_available Russian? A man named Gredenko.
not_available You know him? No.
not_available Come here.
not_available But you know something.
not_available Maybe.
not_available It
not_available it was probably nothing.
not_available It was months ago.
not_available Marilyn, anything you can tell us might help.
not_available Graem was going out a lot at night.
not_available He said it was work related, but I didn't believe him.
not_available I thought he was having an affair on me, so one night I followed him.
not_available It wasn't out ofjealousy.
not_available It was for leverage 
not_available anything I could use against him to get custody of Josh if I left him.
not_available Where did he go? 
not_available It was to a house in West LA.
not_available I went to the window.
not_available The blinds were drawn, but I could hear him inside, talking to some men.
not_available They had Russian accents.
not_available What were they saying? I couldn't hear them clearly.
not_available Frankly, once I realised he wasn't cheating, I went home.
not_available Do you remember the address? 
not_available No.
not_available Sorry, I didn't pay attention.
not_available I was concerned about getting caught.
not_available Marilyn, it is vital that we find Gredenko.
not_available If we retrace the route you took that night, do you think you'd recognise the house? Maybe.
not_available Maybe? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think so.
not_available Wait right here.
not_available Jack.
not_available I think I might have a lead on Gredenko.
not_available It's a shot in the dark, but right now we don't have anything.
not_available I wanted to know if I had your permission to follow it up.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available Hey, Marilyn.
not_available Hey, Phillip.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available I'm hanging in there.
not_available What's goin' on with you and Jack? He's looking for someone.
not_available He thinks I can help.
not_available You mean Gredenko? He questioned me about the same thing earlier.
not_available What do you know about him? 
not_available Nothing, really.
not_available I followed Graem to a house one night.
not_available He, um He met with some Russians.
not_available What house? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It was in West LA.
not_available Jack wants to take me over there to see if we can jog my memory.
not_available Phillip, I don't know how long this is gonna take and I can't leave Josh alone.
not_available Could you please stay with him? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available That will do.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Your TAC team is assembling.
not_available I'm sending Milo with you.
not_available Milo? Why? I want a tech to pull intel off computers we find at Gredenko's location.
not_available Chloe will be running point from here.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm sorry about leaving you.
not_available I'll be back as soon as I'm done helping Uncle Jack.
not_available Helping him with what? And where are you going? I'll explain later.
not_available Right now I want you to stay here with your grandfather.
not_available Marilyn.
not_available Maybe I ought to take Josh back to my house.
not_available Why? Why can't you just wait with him here until I get back? He's frightened of this place.
not_available Understandably so.
not_available I think he needs to be in familiar surroundings right now.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, I'll clear it with Mr Buchanan.
not_available Will you explain things to Josh? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available All right, you listen to your grandfather.
not_available He's in charge.
not_available Phillip, thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sorry to take you away from Josh.
not_available All you need to do is identify the house.
not_available I will not put you in danger.
not_available I know.
not_available Mr Buchanan, I'd like Josh's grandfather to take him back to his house.
not_available Of course.
not_available We should go.
not_available Bill, I'll be on comm.
not_available We'll be leaving soon, Josh.
not_available I have to make one phone call.
not_available Just be a minute.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Have your men find and secure a house in West LA.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll text you with the address.
not_available We have a lead.
not_available Jack's sisterin
not_available law thinks she knows where Gredenko is.
not_available Jack and a TAC team are heading there.
not_available I need help running Tactical.
not_available Don't be ridiculous.
not_available We're short
not_available handed, so get your shirt on and let's go.
not_available Running Tactical is what you do best.
not_available Why would you need my help? Oh.
not_available I get it.
not_available You came in here to give me a pep talk.
not_available Get me back behind that computer and everything will be tickety
not_available boo.
not_available You should be a little less obvious, Chloe.
not_available I'm a coward, not an idiot.
not_available Morris, I know you've been through a lot today, but you're really starting to piss me off.
not_available Well, let's add that to my list of failings.
not_available Why did you do that? 
not_available I didn't want to.
not_available Look.
not_available If you're gonna try and save a bloke, save someone who's worth it.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Jack and his team are entering a hostile situation and need backup.
not_available Yes, I can do it alone.
not_available But there would be less chance of a mistake if you would help.
not_available So why don't you stop feeling sorry for yourself and get back to work? We just passed 98th Street.
not_available Roger that, Jack.
not_available We're maintaining our position six blocks behind you.
not_available I can't imagine what you went through in China, Jack.
not_available When you were over there, I thought about you.
not_available I tried not to.
not_available I guess I've been trying not to think about you for over 20 years.
not_available We don't need to talk about this.
not_available It was your father, wasn't it? He drove you away, tried to pressure you to work for his company.
not_available Is that why you left? Enlisted in the military? There were a lot of reasons.
not_available Was I one of them? No.
not_available Hello? It's me.
not_available Don't say anything, just listen.
not_available I don't want Jack to know I'm on the line, you understand? OK.
not_available You're involved in something much bigger than you can possibly imagine.
not_available So here's the deal: unless you do exactly what I say, I will hurt Josh.
not_available If you don't believe that, you might consider this: Graem's death was not an accident.
not_available I killed him.
not_available I want you to say, "Thank you, Susan".
not_available Thank you, Susan.
not_available You won't take Jack where Graem met the Russians.
not_available You're gonna take him to a different address 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Now, you do this for me, and I promise you you will see Josh again.
not_available If you don't, he dies.
not_available OK.
not_available 9407 Hindry Place.
not_available Do the right thing.
not_available I already lost a son today.
not_available Don't make me lose a grandson.
not_available Goodbye, Susan.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It was my office.
not_available A lot of the roads are still shut because of the bomb.
not_available Can we get home? 
not_available No.
not_available And no one knows when they'll open up.
not_available So what do we do? We'll go to a hotel.
not_available We can stay there until they clear up.
not_available Marilyn, is any of this familiar? Yes.
not_available Jack? What? What is it? It's nothing.
not_available I thought I saw the house, but I was wrong.
not_available Oh, that was it.
not_available Hindry Place.
not_available Milo, we got a street.
not_available Hindry Place.
not_available Copy that, Jack.
not_available Relaying it to CTU now.
not_available How long before the new targets are reprogrammed? You still think you can trust the Arabs? They serve their purpose.
not_available Our country lost the Cold War because it was afraid to use these weapons against the Americans.
not_available Today we will correct that mistake.
not_available And the Arabs will take all the blame.
not_available There's no telling what this explosion will do All right, we're on it.
not_available Chloe! Marilyn remembers where she believes her husband met with Gredenko 
not_available Hindry Place.
not_available Is she sure? That's what she told Jack.
not_available Pull up all access roads in the area.
not_available I'm in the middle of reconfiguring the uplink.
not_available I'll put Morris on it.
not_available Your call.
not_available I know you're lying to me, just like my mom.
not_available You're all treating me like I'm some stupid little kid.
not_available What? 
not_available I wanna know why my dad died.
not_available What's your mom said? It was a heart attack.
not_available I know, but I know he was doing something illegal or whatever and But nobody's telling me what it was and I just want to know.
not_available Did it have to do with the nuke? Look, Josh.
not_available You'll hear a lot of things about what your father may or may not have done.
not_available I'm not gonna pretend it's gonna be easy for you.
not_available You know no matter what, I'm gonna be there for you.
not_available That's it 
not_available the blue house on the right.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We've got an address 
not_available 9407 Hindry Place.
not_available Have CTU bring up the schematics of the house.
not_available Meet me in the alley behind the target.
not_available All right, I'm on it.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We're going after the blue house.
not_available Tell them nonlethal force.
not_available We need Gredenko alive.
not_available Jack.
not_available Stay in the tactical van.
not_available You'll be safe there.
not_available But I have 
not_available Jack.
not_available There are two entrances 
not_available one in front, one on the west side.
not_available I'll contact CTU when we've got Gredenko in custody.
not_available Stay with Marilyn.
not_available Your men ready? 
not_available We're set.
not_available Let's go.
not_available All teams go.
not_available Go! Go, go! Bomb! Everyone out! Jack! 
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Come on.
not_available No! Get in the van.
not_available Get in the van! Close the door! Jack.
not_available Jack, can you hear me? Oh, they're coming! 
not_available Get up.
not_available Come on! Move, move! Get down, get down! Don't hit the woman! We need her alive! Move.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available Move.
not_available Go, go, go, go.
not_available Don't stop! Get 'em! 
not_available Let's go! All agents report in.
not_available All agents report in now.
not_available Calling in for EMT.
not_available English SDH
