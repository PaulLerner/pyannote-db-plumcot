
not_available You know I have the fuel rods.
not_available But I have no desire to harm innocent Americans.
not_available And yet you're threatening them with a bomb.
not_available What I'm asking for is simple.
not_available Turn over President Hassan.
not_available That will never happen.
not_available You have exactly one hour to change your mind.
not_available We have an out here.
not_available I think we should take it.
not_available Give in to the demand to turn over President Hassan? I will not sell him out to the very terrorists that we are determined to defeat.
not_available What are you suggesting? A covert action.
not_available We deliver Hassan to the terrorists, but make it look like they took him hostage.
not_available I'm begging you.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Don't betray your president.
not_available Ethan? All right.
not_available My God! Call a medic.
not_available We wait to acquire Hassan before calling an ambulance.
not_available Understand? Take the weapon off now! A dirty bomb will be detonated in New York unless we deliver Hassan to the terrorists.
not_available Does the president know about this? She's refusing to deal with the terrorists.
not_available This is General Brucker's operation.
not_available What are you doing? This is on you now.
not_available You have to deliver Hassan to the terrorists.
not_available I don't take orders from anybody but the president of the United States.
not_available Now, move.
not_available Are the Americans handing over Hassan or not? The only information we have is that he's being transported to McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available So, President Taylor doesn't intend to give him up.
not_available Tarin.
not_available Yes? The president has not responded.
not_available Start the countdown.
not_available The NYPD will handle hazmat and triage; the National Guard will control the streets; and I've got an army battalion standing by.
not_available Well, a dirty bomb is about to go off in Manhattan, Commander.
not_available I'd plan for mass panic.
not_available Ethan Kanin is dying back there.
not_available We need 
not_available to get him medical help.
not_available We will.
not_available I mean now.
not_available No, not until our team completes its mission.
not_available When we have the bomb, then we'll get your friend help.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Carry on.
not_available General, what's our status on the ground? Well, the civilian first responders are positioning for rapid deployment, and we've got army support available as necessary.
not_available At this point, only command level knows we're anticipating a radiological device, but people on the ground are quick to connect the dots.
not_available Word will get out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd like to get ahead of that.
not_available I've drafted an address for the networks, Rob; I need you to look at it.
not_available And I'd like Ethan to read it, too.
not_available He wasn't in his office.
not_available Do you know where he is? I'll go find him.
not_available Less than ten minutes.
not_available Dear God, this bomb cannot go off.
not_available I'm sorry, Madam President, but we have to prepare for the worst.
not_available What are the latest casualty figures? Median scenario shows due to the bomb and ensuing panic.
not_available But who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky.
not_available Let me know the second President Hassan arrives.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available This is not right.
not_available My life for so many others.
not_available It's not right.
not_available President Taylor doesn't see it that way.
not_available She knows I would never have gone along with this decision.
not_available That's why she kept me out of it.
not_available You are more than just one life, Omar.
not_available You are the best hope of ending a war that has lasted for decades.
not_available You must understand President Taylor trying to protect that.
not_available This is not acceptable not like this.
not_available Get in here.
not_available Get down.
not_available What are you doing? He's slowing us down.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available His injuries aren't lethal.
not_available Jack, I need to talk to you.
not_available What? Hassan isn't happy about Taylor's response to the ultimatum.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available It doesn't affect our mission.
not_available He's a head of state, Jack.
not_available Maybe it should.
not_available It's not our call.
not_available If he wants to take it up with President Taylor, he can do it when he sees Mom! What? 
not_available Throw your gun down.
not_available Omar, what are you doing? Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Kick it to me.
not_available Omar, have you lost your mind? You, outside! Back up inside! Sir, you do not want to do Just shut up and move it inside! I'm giving you what you want.
not_available Here, take the gun.
not_available Omar, what are you doing? I'm sorry, Dalia.
not_available My life for tens of thousands? 
not_available I couldn't live with that.
not_available Omar, don't.
not_available You can't give yourself up.
not_available I have to.
not_available What if they're lying? What if they blow up the bomb anyway? At least I've tried to stop the attack, and I've failed.
not_available But if I don't even try Father, please.
not_available You stay here with Kayla.
not_available I'll send someone 
not_available from our delegation to pick you up.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I won't leave you.
not_available Dalia, do as I say.
not_available Do as I say! If you want me to stay here, then you better lock me in that room because I won't let you walk to your death! I won't leave you! Dalia, I said do as I say! No! 
not_available Back in the room! Now! In the room! We've got less than five minutes.
not_available We got to move.
not_available Mr.
not_available President! Mr.
not_available President, you can't trust him! You can't trust him! Come on.
not_available These people owe you their lives, sir.
not_available You're doing the right thing.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you have the package? Yes.
not_available You're cutting it damn close.
not_available You know that? Yeah, there were complications.
not_available Jack Bauer found out about our operation.
not_available He's no longer a problem.
not_available Casualties? The entire unit.
not_available Everyone but me.
not_available Sir, you need to know that President Hassan is cooperating with us.
not_available He's here by choice.
not_available Well, what are you saying? That he would have given himself up? Yes, sir.
not_available We got to move.
not_available All right.
not_available Stay on the line.
not_available Weiss.
not_available Look at him.
not_available He'll be dead soon if we don't do something.
not_available Yeah, along with half of New York.
not_available Bishop's on the line.
not_available He's got Hassan.
not_available Get ready to make the call.
not_available Bishop, we're live.
not_available You there? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right, we got less than two minutes.
not_available Do it.
not_available Yes.
not_available This is Rob Weiss, President Taylor's chief of staff.
not_available Do you have Hassan? Yes, and we're prepared to make the exchange.
not_available Prove it.
not_available Uh, Bishop, put him on.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available This is President Hassan.
not_available I'm prepared to give myself up if you stop the bomb.
not_available So, President Taylor changed her mind.
not_available No.
not_available She wasn't willing to meet your demands.
not_available I am.
not_available But I need assurances.
not_available Assurances? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That the exchange will The exchange will happen exactly as you're told.
not_available What you'll do is exactly what I say.
not_available Damn it.
not_available We did what you asked.
not_available Quit stalling.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available He cut us off.
not_available A minute and a half till the bomb goes off.
not_available Yes? Tarin stop the bomb.
not_available Hassan will be arriving there shortly.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available Bomb was supposed to go off four minutes ago.
not_available There's no report of an explosion anywhere on the island.
not_available Arlo, what's happening on the ground? Sweep teams are still looking everywhere.
not_available No luck.
not_available According to the deadline we've been given, we're on borrowed time.
not_available The bomb is still out there, still a threat.
not_available We may have caught a break here.
not_available Let's use it.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Reception is terrible.
not_available I can barely hear you.
not_available Can you hear me now? 
not_available Yes.
not_available President Hassan is trying to hand himself over to the terrorists.
not_available That's why the bomb didn't go off.
not_available No one here knows that.
not_available And no one else can until I talk to the president.
not_available What's going on? Chloe, I don't have time to explain.
not_available Please, just contact Tim Woods.
not_available He can get me a clean line to the president.
not_available But no one else can know that I'm calling.
not_available Do you understand? I'll call you right back.
not_available Who was that? Search team.
not_available Requesting updated grid assignments.
not_available Do you need some help? I'll ask if I do.
not_available We're clear! Keep them up here on the landing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I need you to get them back to President Taylor.
not_available What about you? I'm going to say behind and look for Hassan.
not_available Ma'am, I just got off the phone with CTU.
not_available They're going to help me find your husband.
not_available But right now it's not safe here for you.
not_available I want you and your daughter to continue on to the Air Force Base.
not_available Agent Walker will help you get there.
not_available She can be trusted completely.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, my father, he did 
not_available what he thought was best.
not_available I know he did.
not_available We're gonna do everything we can to get him back, but right now we need to move.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Jack, he gave himself up willingly.
not_available Maybe we should just let this happen.
not_available I already told you, it's not our call.
not_available President Taylor asked me to protect him.
not_available That's what I'm gonna try and do.
not_available So, please, just get them to the Air Force Base.
not_available Taxi! Come on.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available I got a secure line.
not_available Good.
not_available Chloe, I need you to do something else for me.
not_available I'm on Seventh Avenue between 53rd and 54th.
not_available There's a security camera mid
not_available block.
not_available I want you to see if you can get a feed and roll it back.
not_available President Hassan was standing here less than ten minutes ago.
not_available I'll check.
not_available Seven minutes past the deadline.
not_available Do we have any idea why the bomb didn't go off? No, Madam President.
not_available We're polling our civilian counterparts, trying to determine that.
not_available Maybe it's like you said.
not_available We got lucky.
not_available Well, at the moment it certainly looks that way.
not_available What about President Hassan? When will he arrive? Well, his transport was a Secret Service operation, ma'am.
not_available I'm not really in the loop.
not_available I'll look into it.
not_available No, I'd rather you find Ethan.
not_available I'll page him.
not_available No, not page him, find him.
not_available I need him here.
not_available Please.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President? 
not_available Yes? It's an urgent call from Homeland for you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is President Taylor.
not_available Madam President, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available Please don't say my name or react openly to what I'm about to tell you.
not_available Yes.
not_available President Hassan is no longer in my custody.
not_available He got away and he's trying to hand himself over to the terrorists.
not_available That's why the bomb didn't detonate.
not_available I'm afraid I don't understand.
not_available Madam President, you're being betrayed by General Brucker.
not_available 40 minutes ago we were attacked by mercenaries under his command.
not_available Go on.
not_available We managed to fight off the attack, but President Hassan turned himself over to one of them in an effort to stop the bomb from going off.
not_available As we speak, they're preparing to hand him over to the terrorists.
not_available I'm assuming that that is still something that is unacceptable to you.
not_available That is correct.
not_available Madam President, General Brucker is in charge of this operation.
not_available He's in communication with the terrorists.
not_available I need to know where the exchange is gonna take place.
not_available Ma'am, you need to confront him now.
not_available I understand.
not_available As soon as you have anything, please contact CTU.
not_available I will.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Come with me, please.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available You still there? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available What do you got? Got the security camera feed you were talking about.
not_available Hassan got into a black SUV at 6:08 with one other guy.
not_available That's got to be the merc he handed himself over to.
not_available They were headed west on 53rd Street.
not_available I was able to trace them until they turned north 
not_available on 10th Avenue.
not_available Okay, good work.
not_available Redirect the satellites to the Upper West Wide.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey! What now? Who's this? Listen carefully.
not_available Hand the phone to the driver.
not_available Tarin.
not_available It's you, isn't it? Hand it to him now.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available It's Bishop.
not_available Okay, Bishop, this is what you need to do.
not_available Listen to my instructions and follow them.
not_available Step out of the car, leaving the keys in the ignition.
not_available Take the phone with you.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Walk toward the intersection.
not_available When the light changes, I want you to cross the street.
not_available Stay inside the crosswalk.
not_available Where's the bomb? Just do what I say.
not_available The deal was Hassan for the bomb.
not_available The light's changed.
not_available Bishop, move.
not_available Where is it? Just do what I say.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Listen.
not_available Stop now.
not_available Don't turn around or you get nothing.
not_available Stand there and wait.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Walk toward the newspaper stand.
not_available Look down.
not_available Show me your hands.
not_available Hands! On the dash.
not_available Where's the bomb? Where is it? Where is he? The General's in Mr.
not_available Kanin's office.
not_available With Ethan? We're not sure.
not_available No one's seen him in nearly an hour.
not_available Ma'am, there's something you need to know.
not_available Your chief of staff is with the General.
not_available They appear to be in on this together.
not_available Are you saying Rob Weiss betrayed me, too? I'm afraid so.
not_available Okay, do it.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Hands where we can see them! Up! Call medical.
not_available Against the wall, hands behind your head.
not_available Madam President, you need to see this.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Is he still alive? Yes, ma'am.
not_available He's had a serious cardiac event.
not_available Get him out of here! No! You stay.
not_available Where is President Hassan? Damn you, Rob.
not_available Where is he? I don't know.
not_available Don't lie to me! Tell me where he is.
not_available No, ma'am, I cannot.
not_available And if it makes any difference, this was not an easy decision.
not_available It makes no difference at all.
not_available It wasn't your decision to make.
not_available With all due respect, you were not elected to sentence tens of thousands of Americans to death.
not_available Is that how you justify this? You have sold out a peace I committed this administration to.
not_available I've protected New York and given you plausible deniability in an impossible situation.
not_available I don't want deniability.
not_available I want Hassan! We are on the verge of a peace that has eluded this planet for 50 years, and you are throwing it away! Tell me where he is.
not_available The charge is treason.
not_available It carries the death penalty, and so help me God, I'll throw the switch myself.
not_available Tell me where he is.
not_available It's not too late.
not_available It is too late.
not_available They have Hassan.
not_available We have the bomb.
not_available The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd.
not_available We'll get NEST team there as soon as possible.
not_available Damn you, Rob.
not_available Really, Madam President? New York City is safe.
not_available Take him away.
not_available Your attention, please.
not_available I've just spoken with the President at McGuire.
not_available Rogue operatives have handed Hassan over to the terrorists.
not_available In return, they got the location of the dirty bomb: Jack Bauer and NEST are already on
not_available site and disarming the bomb.
not_available Our focus is to recover President Hassan.
not_available I've got satellite feed at 93rd, sir.
not_available Okay, looks like we're back in business.
not_available Put it up on
not_available screen, Arlo.
not_available We know that President Hassan was handed over at that location approximately ten minutes ago.
not_available NSA feed only gives us still images.
not_available We might have missed him.
not_available We didn't.
not_available There's Bishop's SUV.
not_available Okay, they've got to be close; find them.
not_available Someone's approaching the SUV.
not_available Any idea who that is? I can try to clean up the image.
not_available Lost it.
not_available They were heading east.
not_available We can backtrack through the traffic cam footage.
not_available I want you and Dana to find that vehicle.
not_available As soon as you reacquire it, let Jack know.
not_available Dana, where are you going? Hastings wants us to do this.
not_available I was thinking I would reroute some of the servers.
not_available Not now.
not_available It'll give us more processing speed.
not_available We can work with what we have.
not_available Let's get going.
not_available Okay.
not_available Those are the rods we were looking for, sir, packed in enough C4 to irradiate half of Manhattan.
not_available Okay, as soon as they're extracted, I want you to contact CTU.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I want him transferred back to holding in medical.
not_available Contact Hastings as you're en route.
not_available So it's real.
not_available A dirty bomb.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then we succeeded.
not_available We saved Manhattan.
not_available You betrayed your president and your country.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available We've got Hassan's location.
not_available He's heading north on Amsterdam in a black SUV.
not_available How far north? About 
not_available 30 blocks ahead of you.
not_available Jack, the president wants us to do everything we can to recover Hassan.
not_available She wants you to lead the operation.
not_available How many men are with him? 
not_available We think only one, the driver.
not_available Okay, Chloe, I need you to find me a suitable ambush point.
not_available I want clean lines of fire from rooftop and street level.
not_available In order to protect Hassan, we need to take the vehicle and the driver out at the same time.
not_available Tac teams are standing by, Jack.
not_available Is Cole with them? 
not_available No, on his way back.
not_available We expect him here any minute.
not_available Then he's going to have to quarterback this op from CTU.
not_available I'll get you real
not_available time updates on the position of Hassan's vehicle.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Cole's back.
not_available I'll go get him.
not_available Yes? Hello? I'm so glad you're back.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available I heard we recovered the bomb.
not_available Only 'cause Hassan gave himself up to the terrorists.
not_available Jack's putting together an intercept operation right now.
not_available He wants you to run it from here.
not_available All right, you'd better bring me up to speed.
not_available What happened to that probation officer that was sniffing around? I convinced him I didn't know anything; he left.
not_available That's good.
not_available Yeah, it's good.
not_available Hey.
not_available We're going to get through this, you and me.
not_available We will.
not_available We should go.
not_available You don't have to do this, Tarin.
not_available You can pull over right now, stop the car.
not_available Believe me, I want to do this.
not_available If you hate me so much, stand against me at home.
not_available Join the opposition.
not_available Fight me openly, honorably.
not_available I don't need to fight you, Hassan.
not_available You have already lost.
not_available So tell me, what's the plan? You'll put me on trial? A dark room and a video camera, I suppose.
not_available A man hiding behind a mask will read a list of my crimes and cut off my head with a sword.
not_available The world will be impressed.
not_available You've done worse in your prisons.
not_available What I did I did to unite our country, to make us stronger.
not_available That's a lie.
not_available You just wanted to hand us over to the Americans.
not_available No.
not_available I wanted us to rejoin the world.
not_available I wanted us to have peace.
not_available You wanted the cover of Time Magazine! You think I don't know you, Omar.
not_available I watched over you day and night, remember, watched over you while you betrayed your own wife with a western whore.
not_available You care for nothing but yourself.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I've made mistakes but believing in peace was not one of them.
not_available Think whatever you like.
not_available You won't be around to find out.
not_available Madam President Just, just a moment.
not_available They're going to treat you on the base hospital.
not_available But then I want you right back here.
not_available That's an order.
not_available Excuse me just a moment.
not_available You have always been true to me, Ethan.
not_available I need you now.
not_available Hurry back.
not_available Take good care of him.
not_available Madam President, Mrs.
not_available Hassan and her daughter have just arrived.
not_available Thank you, Susan.
not_available I am so relieved you're both safe.
not_available Thank you, Madam President.
not_available Do you know what is happening with my husband? We do.
not_available He is in the hands of the terrorists, but we're tracking him on satellite.
not_available We're going in now to monitor the rescue effort.
not_available Do you want to join us? Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available If you will, go on in the situation room, and, and I'll be there in a minute.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I didn't expect to see you again, Ms.
not_available Walker, but in these last few hours, I have learned how few people I can really trust.
not_available I am glad you're here.
not_available Thank you, Madam President.
not_available But I think I'd be of more use at CTU.
not_available Of course.
not_available Susan will arrange a car for you.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack Bauer and CTU are running the operation.
not_available We expect the intercept to occur in a few minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ma'am, satellite feed's coming in from CTU.
not_available Jack, Hassan's vehicle just crossed 130th.
not_available I'm at 110th Street.
not_available Do we have an ambush point yet? Yes, intersection of 161st and Amsterdam.
not_available Who we got for the take
not_available down team? I have a special ops unit moving into position.
not_available We'll trigger the traffic lights to stop the vehicle at the intersection, then heavy machine gun fire into the engine block to disable it, snipers to take out the driver.
not_available That leaves you 
not_available to reacquire Hassan.
not_available Good.
not_available What's our perimeter look like? Bridges and tunnels were closed earlier this morning.
not_available That means Riverside Drive is shut down, too.
not_available He can only use Amsterdam.
not_available What about cross streets? We got 'em all covered from 140th Street on.
not_available As long as we don't spook him, he'll drive straight into the ambush.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Leave this line open in case there are any changes in the route.
not_available You got it.
not_available What's our timing? Given traffic flow, Tarin should hit the intersection 
not_available in eight minutes.
not_available I can use traffic lights to slow him down if Jack hasn't caught up.
not_available Fine, I'll let the president know.
not_available Cole, I'm seeing some fluctuations in the carrier signal on the subnet.
not_available What's that mean? It might be a problem with the trunk line.
not_available We can't afford another dropout with the satellite feed.
not_available That's how we lost the rods in the first place.
not_available Chloe, what's the status of your workaround on the trunk line? It's working fine if you ask me.
not_available Do you need me to check it? No, we need you here.
not_available I can check it if you can watch my screen, 
not_available Chloe.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks, Dana.
not_available Arlo, what are you doing here? I could ask you the same.
not_available Cole asked me to check on the trunk line.
not_available Except the trunk line's over here.
not_available I can do it from here also.
not_available I set up this system, you know.
not_available Right.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Then maybe you can explain why they keep going down.
not_available We were hit with a massive electromagnetic pulse.
not_available It's a miracle we managed to get anything up and running again as fast as we did.
not_available So, what are you doing now? I'm running a diagnostic on the trunk line.
not_available Why were you looking at a map of Manhattan if you're running an internal diagnostic? I was checking the progress of the operation.
not_available How I do my work is none of your business, Arlo.
not_available Actually, given that I've been having to cover for you the entire night, I think it is my business.
not_available Fine.
not_available You want to check up on me, go ahead.
not_available You're really going to do this.
not_available Yeah, I am.
not_available So, where are the diagnostics? In the systems folder, where they always are.
not_available No, I mean, where on our screen? Thought you said you were working on this.
not_available I wasn't using diagnostics.
not_available I was monitoring the voltage fluctuation in the trunk line directly.
not_available Really.
not_available How? I thought you knew everything.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Arlo, where are you? Hasting's been looking for you.
not_available Yeah, I'll be right down.
not_available Hastings wants me on the floor.
not_available I'll leave you to do whatever you're doing.
not_available Don't push it, Arlo.
not_available Yes.
not_available CTU is following you.
not_available Where? Where are they? They're all over you.
not_available There's an ambush set for 161st.
not_available I'm nearly there.
not_available Why am I only hearing this now? Look, I am already doing far more than I've been paid to do.
not_available You need to calm down.
not_available We knew this might happen.
not_available Can you find me an exit? There's one between 158th and 159th.
not_available Parking garage.
not_available 158th, 159th.
not_available Is everyone ready for this? I will let Samir know, and then it is up to him.
not_available It's only a matter of time before this gets traced back to me.
not_available I need to get the hell out of here while I still can.
not_available Hassan is crossing over 148th Street.
not_available I'm activating signals up to 160th.
not_available You took your time.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It got complicated.
not_available Is the trunk line going to hold? Yeah, I think so.
not_available Then we keep going.
not_available What's our timing, Chloe? Intercept: four minutes.
not_available Jack, do you have a visual on Hassan yet? 
not_available Negative.
not_available He's five blocks ahead of you, Jack.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Tac teams in position? 
not_available They're good to go.
not_available Okay, nobody move until Hassan's vehicle is stopped in the intersection.
not_available What are you looking for? We are being followed, aren't we? Shut up.
not_available That phone call it's a warning.
not_available CTU is onto you.
not_available I'm not afraid of CTU.
not_available Why are you looking over your shoulder all the time? 
not_available I said shut up! Tarin, it's not too late.
not_available Give yourself up.
not_available Give yourself up, and I'll speak for you.
not_available I won't warn you again.
not_available You're on an island here.
not_available There's no way out.
not_available They'll find you.
not_available Yes, they will.
not_available Soon enough.
not_available Damn it.
not_available They've made us.
not_available He's breaking left.
not_available I repeat: he's breaking left.
not_available Chloe, have you got them? Can you see where they're going? Checking.
not_available What's happening? Why did he turn? He's in a parking garage.
not_available It extends across the block.
not_available How many exits? 
not_available Only two.
not_available Okay, he's going to have to double back.
not_available Where's the other exit? 
not_available Broadway.
not_available I'll cover that.
not_available Cole, I want you to pull your team back from the ambush point.
not_available Cover the block.
not_available You got it.
not_available All teams, pull back and reposition.
not_available Set a perimeter around the parking garage between 158th and 159th.
not_available I've got him.
not_available He's going back into the garage.
not_available Copy that.
not_available All units converging on your destination.
not_available He's just moving deeper into the structure.
not_available He's got no place else to go, Jack.
not_available You got him.
not_available Where did they go? Inside the structure.
not_available He's running for the roof.
not_available Move! Move! Where the hell is he going? Coming straight at me! Damn it! Chloe, we got any movement from the target vehicle? No.
not_available No one could survive that.
not_available Chloe, Hassan is not in the vehicle.
not_available You know where to go.
not_available What if he comes to? 
not_available He won't.
not_available Not before you deliver him.
not_available Go! I said go! Yeah.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Have you got Hassan? No.
not_available We set up our ambush.
not_available We were seconds away from taking him down, when out of nowhere, the driver deviated from his route.
not_available He managed to transfer Hassan to another vehicle before I could get to him.
not_available Someone inside CTU has got to be tipping them off.
not_available How is that possible? I don't know, but I've got the driver's cell phone.
not_available Soon as we can set up an uplink, I'll be able to figure out who it is.
not_available I'm on my way to CTU.
not_available Do you want me to talk to Chloe? 
not_available Yeah, but no one else.
not_available Tell her we need a secure area to run the uplink.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you're ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need to search the parking structure.
not_available They switched cars.
not_available Get the team to move in now.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's move.
