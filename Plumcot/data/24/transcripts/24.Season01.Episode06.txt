
not_available She's crashing, BP's falling.
not_available Get Dr.
not_available Collier.
not_available She's on her way.
not_available What have we got? BP's dropping.
not_available She's in V
not_available tach.
not_available BP's crashing at 90/50.
not_available Give her an amp of epi, and let's go at 200.
not_available Yes, Doctor.
not_available Epi's in.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Start.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Again, 300.
not_available 300.
not_available 300.
not_available Charge.
not_available Clear.
not_available Blood pressure still dropping.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Go again.
not_available 360.
not_available Charge.
not_available Clear.
not_available No rhythm.
not_available One more time.
not_available Charge.
not_available 360.
not_available Charge.
not_available All right, clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Jack, where are you? I'm still on the West Side.
not_available You said you were coming to the hospital.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Is Janet out of surgery yet? There's been a complication.
not_available They're working on it now.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Do not let anyone near Janet who doesn't belong there.
not_available What do you mean? I think she might be in danger.
not_available From whom? I'll explain when I get there.
not_available Until then, do not mention this to anyone, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Okay.
not_available Give her another amp of epi at 360.
not_available Epi's in.
not_available Clear! Whose car? Penticoff was paid to pick it up and get rid of this.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Who is it? That's what you'll find out.
not_available But somehow all of this is connected to Senator Palmer.
not_available Didn't leave much of his face.
not_available They removed his fingers and teeth.
not_available Is forensics here yet? Not yet, he's on his way.
not_available Call me as soon as you've got a name.
not_available Nina, I need a favor.
not_available It's starting to add up, Jack.
not_available Don't let anyone know I requisitioned this for personal use.
not_available Personal use? Yes, could you please pass me through to hospital security.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know Kim's friend, the one she went out with tonight? She turned up at St.
not_available Mark's ER.
not_available She got hit by a car.
not_available Does she know where Kimberly is? It's the only chance I've got.
not_available I'm meeting Teri at the hospital now.
not_available Get me that name.
not_available Yes, hello? My name is Jack Bauer, I'm a federal agent.
not_available I'm coming to you now but I wanted to give you a heads
not_available up on one of your patients.
not_available I think her life might be in danger.
not_available Yes, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
not_available Her name is Janet York.
not_available Jack requisitioned a chopper 15 minutes ago but he didn't log a destination.
not_available Where's he going? He's tracking a lead.
not_available Ignoring protocol again.
not_available First he assaults an agent to avoid lockdown.
not_available Then he breaks a prisoner out of jail.
not_available What's the hell's going on here? I thought we were suppose to be
not_available Stop following me, Tony! I prefer to think of it as watching your back.
not_available When I need your help, I'll ask for it.
not_available Yeah, we got a little off
not_available schedule, but we're good now.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available It's already done.
not_available See what happens when you lie? Don't ever lie to me, Rick.
not_available I won't.
not_available Oh, I know you won't.
not_available Now bury your friend.
not_available Where? 
not_available In the ground.
not_available We've got to get out of here.
not_available What do you mean, "we"? I don't know how you hooked up with these guys.
not_available They obviously don't trust you.
not_available You just saw Gaines kill your friend.
not_available He's not gonna let you walk away.
not_available Shut up.
not_available The only way either of us is going to stay alive is if get.<br>.
not_available I said shut up! Sources close to the campaign say the Senator spent the night working on a party unification speech which he's set to deliver later
not_available How did you get past Secret Service? Good to see you too, Sherry.
not_available You listen.
not_available David has to prep for a breakfast meeting.
not_available And the polls are opening in an hour, so whatever you're doing
not_available David asked me to come.
not_available Why, Carl? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I gotta get ready, and so do you.
not_available So, what's the big emergency, David? 
not_available Thought we had a game plan.
not_available We did.
not_available Until I found out that my son lied to me.
not_available That he's been lying for seven years.
not_available What's going on? Why would Maureen Kingsley run a story this big unless it were true? Are you saying you believe her accusation about Keith? I'm saying, my son was involved in Gibson's death and you covered it up.
not_available Not only from the law, from me.
not_available David.<br>.
not_available Someone altered the hospital records to make it look like Keith wasn't involved.
not_available That could only have been you.
not_available Look me in the eye and tell me what happened.
not_available You sure you want to know? You might not like what you find if you open that door.
not_available It's already open.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available The night Gibson raped Nicole while Sherry was still at the hospital and you were flying back Keith went to see Gibson.
not_available How do you know this? Keith told me.
not_available Your son came to me, David.
not_available He said Gibson pulled a knife.
not_available I took him at his word.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available He was defending himself.
not_available So you made it look likeKeith was never there.
not_available As far as I was concerned, he never was.
not_available Why didn't we just go to the police? If it really was self
not_available defense, Keith would have been cleared.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But your career would have been over.
not_available Gibson was white, David.
not_available I still wouldn't have covered it up.
not_available Are you so sure? 
not_available It was my decision, not yours.
not_available I don't want you anywhere near me or my family, ever again.
not_available You have never needed me more than you need me now.
not_available Get out.
not_available Before you finish crucifying me save some nails for your wife.
not_available Sherry didn't know anything about this.
not_available No? How do you think Keith got to me in the first place? What are you doing? What does it look like? 
not_available I said, I don't need.<br>.
not_available I heard.
not_available You think I wanted to leave Janet there? Everything just got so crazy.
not_available All we had to do was hang out with you guys.
not_available No one was supposed to get hurt.
not_available None of this was supposed to go down.
not_available What did you think was gonna happen? I don't know.
not_available Smoking that's really gonna help.
not_available I can't believe this is happening.
not_available It is, and you can sit there feeling sorry for yourself or you can get up and help me figure out a way to get us out of here.
not_available West Side.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Claude Davenport, Hospital Security.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Thanks for mobilizing on such short notice.
not_available I put a man at each end of the ICU corridor, it should lock it down.
not_available They know not to let anyone in or out? Only hospital staff, like you asked.
not_available Wanna let me know what this is about? I wish I could.
not_available Teri.
not_available Jack.
not_available Thank God.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm here now.
not_available Oh, Don't leave me.
not_available Don't ever leave me again, okay? I promise.
not_available I won't leave.
not_available Agent Bauer, I'm gonna be walking the floor if you need anything.
not_available Thank you, Claude.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available You gotta tell me about Janet.
not_available She's stable.
not_available Can she talk? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available What did you mean before about her being in danger? Danger from whom? Someone who doesn't want her talking to me.
not_available You must be Jack? Alan, yeah, this is my husband, Jack.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Alan's been a great friend tonight, Jack.
not_available I'm glad your daughter's okay.
not_available Thank You.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Gave us a good scare, but she pulled through.
not_available When she's up to it, I'm going to need to ask her a few questions.
not_available Jack, my daughter's been through a lot.
not_available If the doctor says it's okay.
not_available The guys that Kim and Janet were with tonight Teri told me you didn't know them.
not_available No no, Janet never mentioned them.
not_available Are you close to Janet? She's my daughter.
not_available But, you don't know who she goes out with on a school night? Jack? 
not_available No, not tonight, I didn't.
not_available But apparently you didn't either.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Trying to find where our daughter is.
not_available By treating Alan as a suspect? He can handle a few questions.
not_available Now, you understand that right? Our daughter's still missing.
not_available Of course I do.
not_available Alan, would you excuse us for a minute, please? Jack, what's going on? I don't know what you've been doing for the last five hours , but Alan was with me tonight.
not_available I'm sorry if that makes you feel bad
not_available Hold on one minute.
not_available I'm here to see my brother.
not_available My bag? I'm not gonna open my briefcase.
not_available I'm here to see my brother.
not_available What's the problem here? 
not_available There's no problem.
not_available Sir.
not_available What's in the briefcase? Don't worry about it.
not_available Get off of me! What is this? 
not_available It's my medication.
not_available What kind of medication? Ben? What is going on? Virgil's in pain.
not_available You aren't giving him what he needs! We're taking good care of your brother.
not_available I told you.
not_available His brother's in detox.
not_available He's been trying to sneak him drugs all week.
not_available You guys don't get it! That's it, out! Let's go! I'm sorry.
not_available Come on.
not_available What did Carl want? I know about Keith.
not_available Know what about Keith? That he went to Carl to cover up the Gibson boy's death.
not_available Keith was there, wasn't he? Just because Carl wants to feed you some story doesn't meanAre you sure you're not the one that's feeding me the story? The thing I can't understand, what I keep asking myself is why you hid this from me? 
not_available I wanted to tell you, David, I.<br>.
not_available But you didn't.
not_available Carl said you'd be exposed! 
not_available Don't put this on Carl! You keep your own counsel, Sherry.
not_available You always have.
not_available Nothing I say to you is going to make you feel any better, I know that.
not_available I did what I thought was right, for our family and for your career.
not_available What about Nicole? Does she know, too? We were protecting you.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Or protecting your chance to move into the White House? I am as ambitious as you are, David.
not_available That's why you married me.
not_available No, I married you because I loved you.
not_available I thought we were working towards something together.
not_available We still are.
not_available It doesn't feel that way.
not_available David.
not_available David, what are you going to do? I don't know.
not_available David, you can be as angry at me as you want.
not_available But I'm telling you, we should do everything we can to keep this thing from coming out.
not_available It's too late for that.
not_available I'm sorry to hear you say that because you'll lose a lot more than the election if it does.
not_available Are you prepared to send our son to jail? Everything was always a game with Dan.
not_available He acted like nothing could touch him.
not_available And I bought into it.
not_available So did Janet.
not_available I'd give anything to turn back the clock.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I spend every day trying to get away from my mother.
not_available Now I can't stop wishing she were here.
not_available God, she must be freaking.
not_available Must be nice, having a mom you like.
not_available You don't like yours? Not all women are meant to be mothers.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's not your problem.
not_available Rick.
not_available We've got to get out of here.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Leave the shovel, unless you plan to use it on me.
not_available When I come back, your friend better be in the ground.
not_available Myers.
not_available Any word on the John Doe yet? Perry estimates the time of death between 11:00 and 12:00 last night.
not_available Before we were tipped on the Palmer hit.
not_available Is he close to making an ID? We did sent some tissue samples to the lab.
not_available They're running his DNA against all databases.
not_available No, that will take too long.
not_available We're going as fast as we can, Jack.
not_available Put Jamey on it, we've got to take care of this now.
not_available Did you find Kim? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Is her friend all right? 
not_available She will be.
not_available How about Teri? How's she holding up? 
not_available She's fine, Nina.
not_available What else is going on over there? I think I have to apologize for Jack.
not_available You don't have to apologize for your husband.
not_available We're all pretty wound up.
not_available Jack's wound up a little tighter than the rest of us.
not_available No argument here.
not_available I guess I've always accepted it as an occupational hazard.
not_available I thought you told me that he sat behind a desk.
not_available The truth is, half the time I don't know what he's doing.
not_available He can't tell me.
not_available It's a security thing.
not_available Must be tough on you.
not_available Sometimes.
not_available But you deal with it.
not_available Right now, he's just worried about Kim.
not_available Hopefully, when Janet wakes up, she'll be able to tell us where she is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, I gotta go.
not_available Call me back as soon as you've got anything.
not_available Walk with me for a sec.
not_available What is it, Jack? Why is there all this security here? Who wants to hurt Janet? Today someone is going to try to kill David Palmer.
not_available What? That's why I was brought in last night.
not_available Why is Janet in danger? Because she was with Kim.
not_available Our daughter's missing.
not_available Are you saying it relates to an assassination attempt? They must know that I've been assigned to protect Palmer.
not_available And you think this person kidnapped Kim? Oh, my God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I know this is all happening because of me.
not_available I've tried to keep a wall between my work and my family.
not_available The wall's coming down, and now I don't know what to do.
not_available Okay.
not_available What do they want from you? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available What are the police doing? I couldn't call them.
not_available I can't without risking Kim's life.
not_available What if it's too late? 
not_available It's not too late.
not_available Kim is okay.
not_available They took her for a reason, and that was not to hurt her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Honey I promise you, we are going to get her back.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I need you in forensics.
not_available I'm about to crack the outer shell.
not_available You said that two hours ago.
not_available This keycard is our best lead on the Palmer hit.
not_available I'm not dropping the keycard.
not_available I've called in Milo.
not_available Milo's an outside contractor.
not_available Which is why we can trust him.
not_available I can do this.
not_available I'm as good as Milo.
not_available Not with this kind of thing you're not, and I can't wait.
not_available Jack wants you on this.
not_available I'll brief you on the way.
not_available He thinks it's a male Caucasian.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available David.
not_available Sorry to wake you like this, Mike, but something's come up.
not_available I was hoping to keep you out of it.
not_available I'm your Chief of Staff, David.
not_available I shouldn't be kept out of anything.
not_available It was a private matter.
not_available You're running for president.
not_available Nothing's private any more.
not_available Where you going? They moved Janet upstairs to the ICU.
not_available She's out of recovery? She's a little groggy, but she's awake.
not_available Alan, that's wonderful.
not_available Yeah, thank you.
not_available Alan, I owe you an apology.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't need to be.
not_available I understand exactly what you're going through.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Bauer.
not_available We found something.
not_available X
not_available rays show a surgical pin in John Doe's ankle.
not_available Turns out it's not standard.
not_available It's custommade, oneofa
not_available kind.
not_available That means we can trace it to the surgeon who implanted it.
not_available Jamey's searching the AMA database, crosschecking it with the manufacturer.
not_available Hopefully, we'll have this guy's name within the hour.
not_available Sooner is better.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Call me as soon as you've got something.
not_available The minute Maureen breaks the story, you'll free
not_available fall in the polls.
not_available Then the media will start churning this thing, 24/7.
not_available They'll pick you clean, then go to work on the bones.
not_available Chances are, the party will try to cut bait.
not_available So I'd say you're textbook unelectable.
not_available So I'm right to withdraw from the race.
not_available No, that's the last thing you should do.
not_available You just got through telling me I can't win.
not_available I told you what to expect so you can.
not_available If we handle this right, I think you can come back from this.
not_available David.
not_available You're the most important presidential candidate this country's had in a long time.
not_available Like it or not, fair or not, you're making history.
not_available My son was involved in another man's death.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Okay, then what if some judge rules it was How do we justify the cover
not_available up? All of them Sherry, Keith, Nicole kept this from the police.
not_available I don't want to seem crass, but the important thing is you didn't cover it up.
not_available You didn't know.
not_available What does that say about me? Not knowing the most important things about my family.
not_available I'm not saying it's not a hard sell.
not_available The election is still six months away.
not_available The voters know how to forgive.
not_available You just have to know how to ask for it.
not_available Do you still want the job, David? You know I do.
not_available Then you need to come out with the story yourself before Maureen Kingsley.
not_available Make it the first thing you say at the breakfast.
not_available I just don't know how my family's going to feel about that.
not_available Find out fast, because you can't do this without them.
not_available When you come clean be damned sure your family is standing next to you.
not_available I did an extensive neurological exam which showed no spinal injury.
not_available She suffered multiple fractures, but nothing she can't recover from.
not_available What went wrong in surgery? When they tried to stop internal bleeding, she had a cardiac arrest.
not_available It happens sometimes.
not_available But she's okay now? The next six hours will be critical, but I'm optimistic.
not_available Is it be possible to ask her a few questions? When? 
not_available As soon as possible.
not_available Our daughter's missing and Janet was the last person to see her.
not_available I'm not comfortable with her being interrogated.
not_available I'm just talking about asking her one or two questions.
not_available I'll leave it up to her father.
not_available Let me go in first, make sure she's up to it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know what we should do when this is over? Get some sleep? We should take that trip we always talked about.
not_available You know, up the coast into Canada.
not_available Just the three of us.
not_available That sounds nice.
not_available I'm sorry, Nina's following up a lead.
not_available That was quick.
not_available Do what I tell you, Jack, and you might see your daughter again.
not_available Say yes if you understand me.
not_available Answer me, Jack.
not_available Yes.
not_available Now smile at your wife like nothing's wrong and move away from the doors.
not_available That's right, we're watching you.
not_available Walk away now, or Kimberly gets a bullet in her head.
not_available The reception is really bad here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Now continue down the hall.
not_available Come on Jack, I don't have all day.
not_available What do you want me to do? Go out the north entrance.
not_available Left.
not_available Yes, I'm still watching you.
not_available Let's head out the north entrance.
not_available She's a tough one, your daughter.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Would you rather go in alone? Do you mind? Daddy? Hello, Janet.
not_available You've had a rough night, haven't you? Who are you? Where's my father? Where am I going? On your left, there's a silver Taurus.
not_available I see it.
not_available Get in.
not_available Open the glove compartment.
not_available First prove to me that my daughter is still alive.
not_available Daddy? Kimberly? Are you okay? Yeah, they haven't hurt me, but I'm
not_available There's a metal box inside the glove compartment.
not_available Take it out.
not_available Tuck it in your ear.
not_available Now say something.
not_available If you hurt my daughter, I will kill you.
not_available Good.
not_available There's a nice, clear signal.
not_available You won't need your phone anymore.
not_available Lose it out the window.
not_available Out the window, Jack.
not_available The keys are on the seat next to you.
not_available Where do you want me to go? You're going to the office, like everyone else.
not_available CTU? 
not_available That's where you work.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Jack, where are you? Sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to scare you.
not_available Where's Jack? 
not_available He went to take a call I need to talk to him.
not_available Why, what did Janet say? Does she know something? They were trying to escape.
not_available Escape from whom? A couple of boys who got too aggressive.
not_available She doesn't know if Kim got away.
not_available Kim would have called if she did.
not_available Janet says that they were being held in a house up in Bel Air.
not_available That's the address? We should give it to the police.
not_available Jack is the police.
not_available Jack, pick up.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available He's not answering.
not_available Jack, listen, it's me again.
not_available Janet may know where Kimberly is.
not_available Would you please call me as soon as you get this, okay? Jack? He was just here.
not_available He promised me he wouldn't leave.
not_available Keep trying him on his cell.
not_available I'll call the police.
not_available No, I have to get there.
not_available If you want, I'll take you.
not_available Well, what about Janet? 
not_available She's sleeping.
not_available Dr.
not_available Collier says she's not in any danger and she'll be out for a couple of hours, Okay? Okay.
not_available I guess I'll just call from the car.
not_available Come on, move it.
not_available Sorry, man.
not_available We're gonna be okay.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I just spoke to my dad.
not_available How? Gaines put me on the phone with him.
not_available What does Gaines want from your dad? Money? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm not sure, but I don't think it's about money.
not_available My dad's gonna get us out.
not_available He doesn't even know where we are.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available He'll find us.
not_available What's up, Milo? Did you try using an S
not_available box inversion on that keycard? No.
not_available Why? I don't know, it's just the fastest way into a file that size.
not_available Your hunch on the AMA database paid off.
not_available We just ID'd our John Doe.
not_available What happened to your wrist? You didn't have that before.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available It happened back at the furniture store.
not_available Oh.
not_available Maybe that's Jack.
not_available Jack? Teri.
not_available Hi, it's Nina Myers.
not_available Oh, hi, Nina.
not_available I have some important information for Jack.
not_available He's not answering and I know he's with you.
not_available No, he was, but he went to take a call a couple minutes ago.
not_available I thought it was from you.
not_available No, I haven't spoken to him in almost half an hour.
not_available Then you don't know where he is? No.
not_available Nina, what's going on? Um listen Teri, if you hear from him first, can you give him a message? Of course.
not_available There's a murder victim he asked me to ID.
not_available Tell him the murder victim's name is Alan York.
not_available I'm sorry, Nina, could you say that again please? Alan York.
not_available He's an accountant from the Valley.
not_available Listen, I'll give Jack the details when I speak to him.
not_available Hello? Yeah.
not_available Will you tell Jack? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks, and if you hear from him, tell him to call in? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Everything all right? Yeah, that was just someone from Jack's office trying to find him.
