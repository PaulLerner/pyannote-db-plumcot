
not_available When I have it, we have to involve your father.
not_available You know I don't like to be kept in the dark.
not_available Tell me what this is all about.
not_available I will.
not_available I just need a minute.
not_available I decide what needs to be done.
not_available I never authorised you to kill David Palmer.
not_available President Logan? 
not_available And Christopher Henderson.
not_available I know what you did and what you're doing.
not_available And I'm here to put an end to it.
not_available You asked to see me, Mr President? 
not_available Hal.
not_available I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his resignation.
not_available I wanted you here as a witness.
not_available What? 
not_available He thinks I was complicit in today's attacks.
not_available Miles set me up.
not_available Please come with us.
not_available We traced your call to a public phone at Van Nuys airport.
not_available If Audrey is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble.
not_available You're supposed to be in custody.
not_available You helped Audrey break surveillance.
not_available You need help.
not_available If you try to stop me, I will recommend you for psychiatric evaluation.
not_available Get in here.
not_available I couldn't contact Jack or Audrey.
not_available I haven't either.
not_available Whatever you tell me will remain between us, I promise you.
not_available Not here.
not_available Outside the south stable.
not_available Is Bauer dead? 
not_available Not yet, Mr President.
not_available He has the recording? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available They want the recording.
not_available Audrey! I have her, Jack.
not_available What have you done? 
not_available The left brachial artery.
not_available She has three minutes before she bleeds to death.
not_available Throw me that recording.
not_available Jack, don't do it.
not_available She's running out of time! Don't give it to him.
not_available Here it is! Easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Jack, go get it.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available I need to loosen the tourniquet.
not_available The bleeding's stopped.
not_available He didn't sever the brachial artery.
not_available I need to get you to a doctor.
not_available I can wait.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available This is Chloe O'Brian.
not_available I'm not available now.
not_available Chloe's not picking up her phone.
not_available Can anyone else help you track Henderson? No one who has access to CTU's satellite network.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available Stop it.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack? Why are you answering Wexler's phone? He's dead.
not_available Henderson and a commando unit attacked us 15 minutes ago.
not_available They took the recording back.
not_available Is Audrey all right? She's fine.
not_available Did you cut your deal with Logan? Logan accepted my terms, then he took a call and suddenly changed his mind.
not_available That must've been Henderson.
not_available We have to get the recording back.
not_available If there's anything I can do, let me know.
not_available With all due respect, Mr Secretary, I asked you for help, and you betrayed me.
not_available Jack, I did what I thought was best for this country.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available Please, forgive me.
not_available I need to go, sir.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hello? 
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Jack, did you get the recording to Secretary Heller? Henderson's got the recording.
not_available I need Chloe to find him, but I can't reach her.
not_available Chloe's here.
not_available She was arrested by Homeland Security for helping you, but she got away.
not_available Put her on speaker.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at Van Nuys airfield.
not_available Listen.
not_available Henderson left here ten minutes ago with the recording.
not_available I need you to access CTU's satellite data streams to find him.
not_available If I log onto their system, they'll find me eventually.
not_available You don't need to track him for long.
not_available Can you do it? 
not_available I can try to slip in through the subnet.
not_available Get back to me.
not_available I'll set up a VPN pathway so they can't trace us.
not_available It will only work with that phone.
not_available OK.
not_available I got ahold of Chloe.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Can you get up? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Move slowly.
not_available Ow.
not_available Come on.
not_available For satellite tracking, I need more than my laptop.
not_available I'll network onto your computer, even though it's pathetic.
not_available And get that screen to work for me.
not_available All right.
not_available I hope you don't mind, but I don't work for you now.
not_available It's all right, Chloe.
not_available Good.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, I'm pulling up footage of the airfield from 15 minutes ago.
not_available Look for an explosion in the northwest.
not_available I see it.
not_available Five minutes later, a vehicle leaves.
not_available That's Henderson.
not_available He went south on the service drive and east on Menders.
not_available Then I lose him.
not_available Use another satellite, traffic cams.
not_available Find him.
not_available It'll take us a few minutes, but we're on it.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you've got him on a live feed.
not_available What makes you think that Henderson hasn't destroyed the recording? He would've done it in front of me, giving me less of a reason to come after him.
not_available Why would he keep it? 
not_available It's his insurance.
not_available Yes? Is Bauer dead? 
not_available No.
not_available What happened? 
not_available All that matters is that I have the recording.
not_available Have you destroyed it? 
not_available No, sir, I have not.
not_available Why? What's the problem? I'm making sure there won't be any problems.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I may need protection.
not_available That recording gives it to me.
not_available Protection? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Do you mean from me? That's absurd.
not_available With all due respect, it isn't absurd, as evidenced by Walt Cummings' "suicide".
not_available That was different.
not_available You told me yourself that was necessary.
not_available I assume that one day others will tell you the very same thing about me.
not_available Chris, you and I have been in this from the beginning.
not_available Destroying that recording protects both of us.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr President.
not_available I give you my word it will be kept in a very safe place, and it will only be made public should I meet with some accident.
not_available Chris, this is completely unnecessary.
not_available I'm sure it is, sir.
not_available Then again, I am a very cautious man.
not_available Chloe, have you got Henderson? 
not_available He's three quarters of a mile ahead.
not_available He should be farther along.
not_available It's definitely the car he left in.
not_available How long until I've got a visual? The road curves.
not_available You should see him once it straightens.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Got him.
not_available Get down.
not_available Damn! It's over, Christopher.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Put the gun down and keep your hands where I can see them.
not_available Do it or I will kill you.
not_available You kill me, Jack, Secretary Heller dies too.
not_available What are you talking about? There's always a contingency plan, Jack.
not_available You know that.
not_available My men have been tracking Heller from a chopper ever since he left Logan's retreat.
not_available If I can't contact them every 15 minutes on the dot, they have orders to kill Secretary Heller, which means you got about three minutes to save his life.
not_available Jack.
not_available Audrey, please get back in the car.
not_available Is he lying about my father? Slowly, walk towards me.
not_available Put your hands behind your head.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available Cuff yourself.
not_available Yeah, Jack.
not_available Patch me through to Secretary Heller's cellphone.
not_available Lock a satellite on his signal.
not_available Download a visual of his vehicle on my PDA.
not_available He left the retreatjust before one o'clock.
not_available On it.
not_available Open up a parallel channel on the NSA's land sats.
not_available Scan radio slices in three
not_available mile increments emanating from the retreat.
not_available Sir.
not_available Jack, I'm pulling up the DOD database.
not_available Here it is.
not_available I'm patching you through.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Heller.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I need you to confirm for me if a helicopter has been tracking your vehicle.
not_available What's going on, Jack? 
not_available Time is critical.
not_available Is there a helicopter or not? Yeah, there's a chopper.
not_available Who are they? Henderson's men.
not_available He claims they'll kill you if I don't let him go.
not_available Is he bluffing? 
not_available He doesn't do that, sir.
not_available Jack, I've got Heller's car.
not_available I'm patching it to your PDA.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Jack, they have a laser sight trained on me.
not_available Get up.
not_available You give me the recording, I let you go.
not_available No.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available You're wasting time.
not_available We both know you're not gonna let Heller die.
not_available Don't let him do this.
not_available I'm gonna walk out of here, and you're not gonna stop me, so uncuff me.
not_available Jack, don't let him go! 
not_available I don't have a choice, sir.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available If I had listened to you, none of this would be happening.
not_available This is my responsibility.
not_available I will not allow Logan and Henderson to use me as a pawn.
not_available Sir.
not_available 
not_available Do not let them get away with this.
not_available Make sure that the recording gets to the right people.
not_available Tell Audrey I love her.
not_available Mr Secretary, what are you doing? 
not_available No.
not_available Chloe, are you on the line? Can you confirm that Hellerjust drove his car into the lake? Yes.
not_available Damn you! Oh, my God! No! How could you do this? This isn't about what you think is best for the country.
not_available This is about your greed for power.
not_available Today you have been responsible for killing David Palmer and the Secretary of Defense.
not_available Two real patriots.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Damn you.
not_available What happened to you? 
not_available Give me the recording.
not_available I don't have it.
not_available Where is it? I'm not gonna tell you, you know that, no matter what you do to me.
not_available Do it.
not_available Kill him, Jack.
not_available Do it! Yeah? Graham? 
not_available Cancel the action against Henderson.
not_available Why? He has the recording, but he's arranged to have it released if anything happens to him.
not_available You should've exercised more control.
not_available There's a limit to what I can do.
not_available Apparently.
not_available Don't you use that tone with me.
not_available We've both made mistakes.
not_available You're right.
not_available Mr President, my apologies.
not_available But the fact is we have a bigger problem than Henderson.
not_available What are you talking about? At least he acts rationally in his own interests.
not_available Unfortunately this is not true of your wife.
not_available My wife? There's a Secret Service agent named Pierce who knows more than he should.
not_available He intends to share that with Martha.
not_available I've taken steps to deal with Agent Pierce.
not_available The real problem is Mrs Logan.
not_available She continues to ask questions, talk about her suspicions.
not_available People don't take her seriously.
not_available There are too many loose ends.
not_available We cannot have her unravel everything.
not_available You think I don't realise that? 
not_available I think you are in a very difficult position.
not_available You hoped the situation with Martha would resolve itself.
not_available You must silence her.
not_available I know.
not_available But I'll handle this myself.
not_available Mrs Logan, Agent Pierce was transferred.
not_available That's what you keep saying, but it doesn't make sense, not at one in the morning.
not_available We work around the clock, ma'am.
not_available It's quite common for agents to get pulled off details at odd hours.
not_available Right when they're supposed to have a meeting with the first lady? 
not_available I don't know anything about a meeting.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available I found Aaron's phone on the ground where we were supposed to meet.
not_available Now, I want you to find Agent Pierce, and get him back here right now.
not_available There's a glitch in the scheduling software.
not_available Are these glitches quite common as well? 
not_available Actually, no.
not_available Mrs Logan.
not_available I'm Agent Adams.
not_available I think I can explain everything.
not_available Well? 
not_available This is a sensitive issue.
not_available President Logan would like you to come with me.
not_available What is this sensitive information? Is it about Agent Pierce? 
not_available You need to talk to the president about that.
not_available I'm asking you.
not_available Do you know where Aaron Pierce is? 
not_available No, ma'am, I don't.
not_available Is this where my husband is? I want to talk to him.
not_available Charles? Hello? Yeah.
not_available Henderson doesn't have the recording.
not_available Is it in his car? 
not_available No.
not_available There must've been a hand
not_available off.
not_available What do you mean? That explains why he wasn't farther ahead when I left the airfield.
not_available He must've given it to someone.
not_available OK, I'll back
not_available trace the route with the satellite.
not_available See if I can spot anything.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, we're getting that recording and exposing Logan.
not_available I don't care how far I have to go or what I have to do.
not_available Do you understand, Jack? Yes.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available You were right.
not_available I found the hand
not_available off.
not_available Henderson rendezvoused with another car.
not_available Can you track the other car? We're tracking it.
not_available It headed back to Van Nuys.
not_available Looks like the civilian side of the airfield.
not_available Pulled onto the tarmac.
not_available Whoever it was got onto the plane.
not_available Isn't air traffic grounded? 
not_available Yeah, this is not a commercial flight.
not_available The plane is servicing.
not_available It's about to take off.
not_available Was Curtis relieved of his duty or is he at CTU? He's at CTU taking orders from Homeland Security, but I trust him.
not_available Where is he? According to the deployment grid, Call him.
not_available Get him to this location as soon as possible.
not_available I want him to transfer Henderson and Audrey to CTU.
not_available Is that a good idea? Logan's in control at CTU.
not_available Curtis will protect them.
not_available It's our best chance to get Audrey medical attention.
not_available I'm calling Curtis now.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's happening? The person Henderson gave the recording to boarded a plane at Van Nuys.
not_available Why aren't you going now? 
not_available I'll go when Curtis gets here.
not_available He's not far.
not_available I'll be fine until then.
not_available I won't leave you alone.
not_available Jack, if you don't get that recording, my father will have died for nothing.
not_available Jack for me.
not_available Henderson is secure.
not_available When he regains consciousness, don't go anywhere near him.
not_available You don't even talk to him.
not_available You understand? 
not_available I understand.
not_available We have to assume his people are looking for him.
not_available They'll monitor non
not_available VPN traffic, which means you can't make or receive any calls unless they come from me.
not_available It's Wexler's cell.
not_available I've got the number.
not_available All right.
not_available Audrey, I don't feel right about this.
not_available I'm gonna be all right.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Jack, you have to go now.
not_available Jack.
not_available Make sure you get that recording.
not_available I will.
not_available Let me know when you're done.
not_available Bierko has regained consciousness.
not_available We're waiting for the medical assessment before we begin the interrogation.
not_available Let me know when we get the go
not_available ahead.
not_available Final protocol shifts.
not_available You can tell Washington the transfer of authority from CTU to Homeland is complete.
not_available OK.
not_available Two hours ahead of schedule, Karen.
not_available That is remarkable.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available My head is somewhere else.
not_available Where? We gave the president Bauer's location an hour ago.
not_available We should've heard something.
not_available The military authority is handling Bauer.
not_available I know, but this doesn't make any sense.
not_available The president insisted we focus on Bauer.
not_available We find him, he hands the mission to the military.
not_available Karen, we're out of that loop.
not_available Karen Hayes.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available Chloe O'Brian got out of Holding, and she is not in the building.
not_available How's that possible? I'm gathering details.
not_available I reviewed the tape.
not_available It looks like Shari talked to her, and Shari let her go.
not_available Shari didn't try to stop her? Why? I don't know.
not_available I had security take her into custody.
not_available Good.
not_available Bring her up here right now.
not_available We need to focus on how we find Chloe now.
not_available My guess is she'll try to contact Bauer.
not_available I agree, but how? She was using CTU resources before to help Bauer.
not_available Maybe she'll try again.
not_available She could try to access our system remotely.
not_available All she needs is a laptop.
not_available That's right.
not_available She'll disguise her traffic.
not_available Can you get through it? 
not_available I can trace her location from the binary.
not_available Do it.
not_available Wait outside.
not_available Why did you let Chloe escape? 
not_available She intimidated me.
not_available She intimidated you? Sit down.
not_available You are in a great deal of trouble, Ms Rothenberg.
not_available You had better start talking to me now.
not_available She said she'd recommend me for psychiatric evaluation and I'd lose my job.
not_available I'm sorry, Ms Hayes.
not_available There's something wrong with me.
not_available I should see someone Shari, did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer? 
not_available She thinks Jack is innocent.
not_available Based on what? Based on some absurd idea that President Logan framed Bauer.
not_available She said something about the president being involved in David Palmer's assassination.
not_available Can you believe her? And people think I'm crazy.
not_available Dammit! Open this door! I don't know what you think you're doing.
not_available Unlock it.
not_available Open it! Charles.
not_available I want that man arrested! 
not_available And I want to know where Aaron Pierce is.
not_available Shh.
not_available Martha, calm down.
not_available All right? Aaron's fine.
not_available I just transferred him back to Washington.
not_available In the middle of the night? It makes no sense.
not_available Why am I locked in this room? Because we need to talk.
not_available About what? I've been wanting to tell you this, but I told myself that you were too fragile to handle it.
not_available But that's not the truth.
not_available The truth is I've kept this from you because it's horrible, and because it's ugly.
not_available What are you talking about? What happened to Palmer shouldn't have.
not_available He got involved in something he shouldn't have.
not_available What are you saying? That I never authorised his death.
not_available You mean you know who killed David? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How do you know that? 
not_available He works for me.
not_available What? 
not_available It's very complicated.
not_available What? 
not_available There's an explanation.
not_available What? An explanation? Oh, my God! 
not_available Stop! You don't understand.
not_available Go to hell! Oh, my God! You're involved with David's murder.
not_available Martha.
not_available Oh, my God! Why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? Because you're on your way to finding out the truth on your own.
not_available And because you need to stop.
not_available Stop what? 
not_available Asking questions and talking about this.
not_available Never again.
not_available Do you know how traumatic this would be for the country if people found out? Oh, yes, you're worried about the country.
not_available Dammit, that's the most important part of this! This would destroy the American people's faith in their government.
not_available It would destroy our credibility all over the world.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available Everything, this whole day has been one giant lie.
not_available What you've done makes me sick! 
not_available Martha, enough.
not_available I know that what I did, what I allowed to happen, was a terrible mistake, but it's done.
not_available Right now, I need you to swear to me that you will do as I ask for the country, Martha.
not_available I've forgiven you many things, Charles, but not this.
not_available You've broken my heart.
not_available I'm looking at you, and I hate you.
not_available But I will keep my mouth shut, because the people of this country don't deserve to suffer.
not_available You do, Charles, you do.
not_available Are you sure we're going to get through this the way we planned? What does that mean? 
not_available There are too many loose ends.
not_available What operation doesn't have loose ends? Hm? Of course we won't get through this the way we planned.
not_available I have never made a deal that didn't feel like it would fall apart in the 11th hour.
not_available Now, if you don't have the stomach to deal with a few bumps, then this is not the room where you belong.
not_available And that goes for all of you.
not_available You're starting to have doubts.
not_available I can smell it, and I don't like it.
not_available We need to remember the strength we had We OK, Ron? Yeah.
not_available Think about your kids.
not_available That's what I do when I need to get focused.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The situation with Martha is taken care of.
not_available I spoke to her.
not_available And? And I made it very clear that if she continues with this behaviour, I will send her back to the hospital in Vermont.
not_available Well, you were going to have her committed earlier today, but you changed your mind.
not_available That's because she found out the truth, and I decided I should keep her close.
not_available What if she finds out the truth again? 
not_available She won't.
not_available And if she does, I will handle it, just like I have all day.
not_available OK.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available You have done a remarkable job today, Mr President.
not_available I will admit that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's about time I heard some words of appreciation.
not_available We were just talking about how you've had to be on the front line, how you've had to get your hands dirty, while we could just sit back and watch from a safe distance.
not_available You've earned our trust, and I am sure that you will do whatever it takes to keep your wife in line.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Where's Jack? Audrey, I'm sorry about your father.
not_available I never intended your father to get in the middle of this.
not_available I've known Secretary Heller a very long time, and he's an honourable man.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available What time is it? It's ten or twelve minutes since If the windows didn't collapse when the car hit the water, there could be an air pocket.
not_available if there's an air pocket 
not_available Stop it.
not_available Your father could be alive, Audrey.
not_available Secretary Heller could be alive inside that car.
not_available If he's alive, you gotta do something about it.
not_available If there's a possibility he's living, you gotta call military authority or emergency services.
not_available For God's sakes, he's your father.
not_available Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop talking! What do you think? I'm stupid? You want me to make that call so your people can find me.
not_available Audrey, my people are gonna find us anyway, and Jack's not gonna stop all this.
not_available I'm trying to help your father.
not_available He's drowning in a car and you're not doing anything about it.
not_available You're gonna live with that? 
not_available Shut up.
not_available He is dying and you're doing nothing, Audrey.
not_available You are doing nothing.
not_available I swear to God, not another word.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack? 
not_available I've got a visual on the plane.
not_available It must be a diplomatic flight.
not_available There's a lot of security.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available What? I'm tracking the helicopter Henderson's men used to shadow Heller.
not_available And? 
not_available It's heading towards Audrey and Henderson.
not_available How could they find them? 
not_available Maybe by using satellites.
not_available But they'll be there any second.
not_available Where's Curtis? He might not make it there before Henderson's men, Jack.
not_available Upload your visual to my PDA.
not_available Advise Curtis of the situation.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Jack.
not_available Listen.
not_available Henderson's men are heading back towards you.
not_available You've gotta get out of there.
not_available And leave him? 
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available 
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available I have the gun and I can kill him.
not_available We need him alive.
not_available Curtis's team is almost there.
not_available They'll secure him.
not_available Get out of there.
not_available He's responsible for the death of my father.
not_available I can't leave him here! Audrey, please, listen to what I'm telling you.
not_available You've gotta start moving now! Audrey! On the right.
not_available Take the other side.
not_available Stipe, get over and get these handcuffs off me.
not_available Dammit! Heller's daughter is in this building.
not_available Kill her.
not_available Then get back here.
not_available We'll deal with Bauer.
not_available Audrey, it's Curtis.
not_available Stay behind me.
not_available Hold it right there! Hands on your head.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Move.
not_available Secure him for transport back to CTU.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tac team, hostiles are down.
not_available We have Henderson.
not_available Roger that, sir.
not_available Copy.
not_available We need medical attention for Audrey Raines.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available It's me.
not_available 
not_available What's happening? Curtis's team killed Henderson's men, and they're taking Henderson into custody.
not_available Jack, I tried to shoot him, but I couldn't.
not_available All that matters is that you're safe.
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Let me speak to Curtis.
not_available Curtis.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Yeah, Jack.
not_available Transport Audrey back to CTU as quickly as possible, and get her over to Medical.
not_available Tell Karen Hayes that no one is to have access to Henderson.
not_available She'll be taken care of, but as far as Henderson goes, CTU wants to apprehend you, not take your advice.
not_available Just do what you can, and I'll get back to you.
not_available Jack, is Audrey all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Curtis is in control of the situation.
not_available What do you have on the plane? 
not_available Details just came in.
not_available It is a chartered diplomatic flight.
not_available Security level eight, leaving at 2am or sooner.
not_available Find out who's on board so we can figure out who Henderson gave the recording to.
not_available It won't be easy getting past the firewall.
not_available I understand.
not_available Bill, slow down the departure of this flight so I can get on it.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available There's a maintenance gate on the northwest side of the airfield.
not_available You'll be able to get close to the plane.
not_available I'm there.
not_available Just get back to me as soon as you've got the passenger list.
not_available Here you go.
not_available He's clear.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack.
not_available We've tried everything.
not_available We can't delay the plane.
not_available It takes off in ten minutes.
not_available OK.
not_available Has Chloe got the passenger list? 
not_available I still can't get past the firewall.
not_available Chloe, I need that list.
not_available Jack, I'm trying.
not_available There you are.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got O'Brian.
not_available On our system? Yeah, she's trying to log in to the State Department network.
not_available Do we know why? 
not_available No.
not_available She used a work
not_available around I'd never seen.
not_available I machinecoded a matrix to get through 
not_available We just need to find her.
not_available Where is she? I'm running a physical trace.
not_available It's a private house.
not_available Cross
not_available referencing with property records.
not_available Karen, she's working out of Bill Buchanan's house.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Positive.
not_available We have a tac team not far away.
not_available I'll dispatch them now.
not_available What's their ETA? 
not_available I'm showing less then seven minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Novick.
not_available 
not_available Mike, it's Karen Hayes.
not_available Karen.
not_available How are things going over there? It's a bit of a rough transition but we're getting through it.
not_available That's good to hear.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available Some clarification.
not_available We were sent here by the White House, but we've been dealing exclusively with Vice President Gardner, until two hours ago.
not_available What happened? The president ordered me to arrest Jack Bauer on evidence he was unwilling to share with me.
not_available Yes, I know about that.
not_available Have you seen the evidence? No, actually, I
not_available I haven't.
not_available Mike, who has seen it? 
not_available I don't have a good answer for that.
not_available Are you telling me you're not in the loop? Actually, I don't even think there is a loop.
not_available The president is keeping his own counsel at the moment.
not_available That's a first.
not_available Yes.
not_available It is.
not_available Is there anything else you want to tell me? Nothing that I can say with any authority.
not_available All I know is that it's been a strange night.
not_available I see.
not_available I wish I could be more helpful.
not_available No, Mike, actually, you've been very helpful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello? 
not_available This is Karen Hayes.
not_available You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out.
not_available 
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Bill, stop.
not_available Miles traced Chloe through a remote node, and if you don't believe me, tell her he used a machine
not_available coded matrix to find her.
not_available Karen, why are you warning us? 
not_available Because I may have made a mistake earlier.
not_available A lot of things didn't make sense today, until Shari told me what Chloe said about President Logan being involved.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available Just get Chloe out of there now.
not_available You have to go.
not_available I can't.
not_available Jack needs the passenger list.
not_available Chloe, if they find you here, you'll be arrested.
not_available You have to go now.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Closing doors.
not_available That's the last one.
not_available Let's get this thing out of here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
