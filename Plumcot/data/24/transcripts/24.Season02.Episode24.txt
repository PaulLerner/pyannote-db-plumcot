
not_available You may not be able to contact me.
not_available Why? 
not_available Chappelle became a problem.
not_available I had to take him out of play and they're onto me.
not_available They'll take me out soon.
not_available Who do I contact if I need help? Michelle is setting up an off
not_available site station.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Where's Dessler? 
not_available I can find her.
not_available Affirmative, Central.
not_available She's in custody.
not_available Kim? Hello? Who are you? 
not_available I'm Kate Warner.
not_available Your father sent me to come getyou.
not_available Why would my dad send someone he'd just met to come get me? He trusts me.
not_available The sooner we leave, the sooner you and your dad can be together.
not_available The Attorney General said you'd want me for your counsel.
not_available What have they told you? 
not_available You've been removed from office.
not_available The evidence was manipulated by a man named Peter Kingsley.
not_available I need you to find out all you can about him.
not_available What happens now? 
not_available We got one last play.
not_available Deliver Kingsley.
not_available He's far too dangerous, and you'll never get close to him.
not_available You're right.
not_available I won't, butyou will.
not_available Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed.
not_available If you say you can deliver him, that should get his attention.
not_available I want the tapes thatyou made of our conversation.
not_available I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return.
not_available All right.
not_available LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes.
not_available What support will you get from CTU? 
not_available As of now, none.
not_available Ow! Jack? Jack! You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dammit.
not_available The car won't start.
not_available We gotta get out of here.
not_available My seat belt's jammed.
not_available Mrs Palmer, I'm gonna need your help.
not_available Mrs Palmer, please don't do this.
not_available I'm sorry, but I have to take care of myself.
not_available When I'm free I'll call an ambulance.
not_available You can't do this! 
not_available I don't have a choice.
not_available You're a very impressive man, butyou see everything as either good or bad, just like David.
not_available The world is so much more complicated.
not_available No, it's simple.
not_available There's a war about to start and you're the only person who can help me stop it.
not_available What about the president? 
not_available He turned away from me.
not_available After 25 years of building a life together, a family, he turned me away.
not_available Eventually they will connectyou to this conspiracy.
not_available That bomb was never supposed to go off.
not_available None of this was supposed to happen this way.
not_available I know.
not_available I believe you.
not_available You can put an end to it now.
not_available If you help me get Kingsley, your husband will get his presidency back.
not_available That will be because of you.
not_available Mrs Palmer, please.
not_available Goddamnit! What do you want me to do? There's a knife in the glove box.
not_available Help cut me out.
not_available Come on in.
not_available This is much better.
not_available It's simpler.
not_available We gotta be able to explain this thing.
not_available I need to talkto you, Mike.
not_available I'll be down in five minutes.
not_available Mike.
not_available It's important.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What is it? It's a file on Peter Kingsley.
not_available They pulled it up a few minutes ago.
not_available Peter Kingsley, the man Jack Bauer thinks is behind the bomb.
not_available There's a record of phone calls he made, as recently as six hours ago, to a soldier named Jonathan Wallace.
not_available Wallace was a member of the Coral Snake brigade.
not_available He apparently killed his own men.
not_available I know who Wallace is.
not_available The planes have passed over their final checkpoint and will reach their targets within the hour.
not_available Our primary targets are all military, but one includes a commandand
not_available control centre inside a residential area.
not_available As smart as our weapons have become, there may be some collateral damage.
not_available You mean civilian casualties.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available There's no way to avoid these? 
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available Then it's something we're just gonna have to live with.
not_available Ryan Chappelle.
not_available Ryan, this is Mike Novick.
not_available How can I help you, sir? I knowthere's been some confusion today about the veracity of the Cyprus audio.
not_available Not really.
not_available Our teams came to the same conclusion as Langley.
not_available Do you know if Bauer's still trying to find evidence that the recording was fabricated? Yes, but he's operating outside our authority.
not_available I wantyou to assist his investigation.
not_available Sir, I don't even know where he is.
not_available Then find him.
not_available I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this.
not_available I was told we're at war and to proceed accordingly.
not_available We're not at war yet.
not_available You have 30 minutes to report backto me the findings of Bauer and your efforts.
not_available But sir 
not_available That's a direct order, Ryan.
not_available You have my channel.
not_available Call me back on this line.
not_available That's all.
not_available I'll be on the plane in an hour.
not_available Why the delay? The bomb detonating in the wrong location created a little extra work.
not_available Nothing to worry about, I hope.
not_available Not at all.
not_available I won't bore you with the details.
not_available Bore me.
not_available I still have to take care of Alex Hewitt.
not_available Hewitt is the only one who can bring this whole thing down.
not_available You told me you'd have him by now.
not_available I wasn't able to find him.
not_available But I'm taking care of it.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Sit down, both of you.
not_available You don't need Michelle here.
not_available She was acting under my orders.
not_available I can defend myself, Tony.
not_available I said sit down.
not_available I need you to get me in contact with Jack Bauer.
not_available Oh, I see.
not_available Jack got some support above you and now you're being squeezed, right? Can you do it or not? What's goin' on? Bauer's evidence might actually have some relevance.
not_available Which means we were right.
not_available No.
not_available You damn near put me in a coma.
not_available That's assault.
not_available I'll tell you what.
not_available You drop the charges against us and we'll help you.
not_available Come on, Ryan.
not_available You of all people knowthat's your best move.
not_available Fine.
not_available In writing.
not_available All right, in writing.
not_available Just get me in touch with Bauer.
not_available Shouldn't we call for help? 
not_available I'm not working under CTU's authority.
not_available To them I don't exist.
not_available So we're out on our own.
not_available Completely.
not_available Are you all right? You need some help? 
not_available He got hurt.
not_available Can you get us to a hospital? 
not_available Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.
not_available Mrs Palmer, you need to drive.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Sorry, but we need your car.
not_available Hey, easy, all right? Go ahead, take it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available They're ready, sir.
not_available Miss Warner.
not_available Hi.
not_available Carrie Turner.
not_available Hi.
not_available Kate.
not_available You must be Jack's daughter Kim.
not_available Where's my dad? He's still in the field.
not_available Wait here.
not_available I'll tell Ryan Chappelle you're here.
not_available I'll handle this.
not_available I thoughtyou were in custody.
not_available I was released.
not_available Kim, I heard what happened to you.
not_available Are you all right? Yeah, I guess so.
not_available Look, I just wanna see my dad and make sure he's OK.
not_available No, he's not here right now.
not_available He won't be back for a couple of hours.
not_available Does he know I'm here? 
not_available No.
not_available We'll tell him when he phones in.
not_available Jack insisted we call as soon as we get here.
not_available He's just not reachable now.
not_available I'll have Carrie take you back and getyou situated.
not_available I'll be there in a minute.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Miss Warner? I don't know if you're aware of this but your father came back here after we released him.
not_available Why? He wanted to talkto your sister before she was taken away.
not_available They brought Marie back here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You lied to me? You killed Reza? You tried to kill your own sister? You were willing to set off a nuclear bomb in a city with ten million people? You tell me why.
not_available Because I need to understand.
not_available Tell me that they forced you to do it, that they brainwashed you, that they threatened you.
not_available You can tell me thatyou didn't know whatyou were doin'.
not_available There must be a reason.
not_available There is no reason, Dad.
not_available I can't accept that.
not_available I couldn't either.
not_available Until I looked into her eyes and she pointed a gun at me and started to pull the trigger.
not_available Trust me, Dad.
not_available She's not gonna give you any answers.
not_available She can't.
not_available At least, nothing that we could ever understand.
not_available Dad Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Kate.
not_available You think you'll be safe out there.
not_available You won't be.
not_available Jack, it's Tony.
not_available Tony, you back in play? Yeah.
not_available Jack, Kim's here at CTU.
not_available She's safe.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Don't tell her what's going on.
not_available Just say I'll be back as soon as I can.
not_available I will.
not_available Jack, this is Ryan.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available You stopped that chopper picking up me and Hewitt.
not_available Hewitt's dead.
not_available I hold you responsible.
not_available Listen, things have changed.
not_available You got full support.
not_available Give me your mission profile.
not_available I've set up a meeting with Kingsley.
not_available We're gonna meet him at the LA Coliseum, gate 18.
not_available Mrs Palmer will wear a wire and make him confirm that the three countries had nothing to do with the nuke.
not_available Stand down until you get some support.
not_available Our people will be there soon.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available Kingsley's expecting the meet to go down now.
not_available You need backup.
not_available If you wanna help me, get me voice prints of Kingsley and Mrs Palmer for authentication.
not_available Done.
not_available And a live audio feed to the White House.
not_available You want an audience with the president.
not_available Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep the line clear.
not_available Copy.
not_available We're pulling into the Coliseum now.
not_available We need to get a SWATteam to his location.
not_available Pull over there.
not_available Wait here for me.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's getyou wired.
not_available Take your jacket off your shoulder.
not_available This is a wireless transmitter.
not_available They won't knowto look for it.
not_available They won't be able to trace it.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available We shouldn't do this alone.
not_available We don't have another choice.
not_available Remember, Kingsley doesn't want to leave here without Hewitt.
not_available That's gotta be to our advantage.
not_available OK, say something.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available OK, it's working.
not_available Yes, Mike.
not_available Mr President, I am against any delay in our military actions.
not_available I have been from the start.
not_available But there is a good chance we'll receive evidence soon the Cyprus recording is false.
not_available We know Second Wave brought the nuke into the country and we know they're sponsored by these three countries.
not_available What am I missing? I don't have all the details, but I just learned about a possible link between Second Wave and a man named Peter Kingsley.
not_available Who is he? He's apparently part of a consortium of oil interests with contracts in the Caspian Sea.
not_available An oil consortium's behind the nuke? Bauer believes he can get a confession from Kingsley.
not_available He's set up a live audio feed.
not_available Our bombers are due to drop their payloads in less than 20 minutes.
not_available Bauer's meeting Kingsley any minute.
not_available This is the live voice print.
not_available And this is the voice file we have on record which will prove that it is, in fact, Sherry Palmer.
not_available It's confirmed.
not_available The one below is Kingsley? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you guys getting this? 
not_available We're good here.
not_available Howfar out is our backup? 
not_available They're 11 minutes out.
not_available That's too long.
not_available We've gotta go now.
not_available Just wait.
not_available We can't.
not_available We're already ten minutes past the meeting time.
not_available Is Prescott ready? Tony's on with the White House.
not_available They're setting up a live audio feed.
not_available OK, good.
not_available We are set to go.
not_available How are you doing, Mrs Palmer? What's to prevent Kingsley from shooting me? He won't do anything until he gets Hewitt.
not_available But the moment he realises we don't have Hewitt I'll be covering your back.
not_available That's not very comforting considering the condition you're in.
not_available I may not make it out of this.
not_available I'm not gonna lie to you, Mrs Palmer.
not_available That's a possibility.
not_available I'm doing this for David.
not_available You knowthat, don'tyou? Yes.
not_available Will you tell him that? In case something happens.
not_available I'll take care of it, Mrs Palmer.
not_available You've gotta go now.
not_available Mike.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We just finished setting up the feed.
not_available I hope this isn't gonna be a waste of our time.
not_available Believe me, Mr President, so do I.
not_available What's going on, Mike? The president and I thought you should be part of this.
not_available Along with Prescott and the Attorney General, we will be listening to a live feed.
not_available Of what? 
not_available A sting operation against Peter Kingsley.
not_available It appears he wasthe architect of today's bombing and the delivery of the Cyprus audio.
not_available Bauer found Kingsley.
not_available Yes.
not_available But it won't be Bauer who'll be talking to Kingsley.
not_available What difference does it make as long as we get him to incriminate himself? What is it, Mike? It's Sherry who'll be talking to Kingsley.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available It seems that Kingsley recruited her some months ago.
not_available She was part of this.
not_available Sherry was working with this man, Kingsley? It appears that way, sir.
not_available To detonate a nuclear bomb and start a war? No.
not_available It's unclear how much she knew, or how deep she was in it.
not_available We just have to hope she can extract a confession from Kingsley.
not_available So now Sherry is working with Jack Bauer to bring down Kingsley? Yes.
not_available And at considerable riskto herself.
not_available Scott, don't do anything until I tell you to.
not_available We need Hewitt.
not_available Understood.
not_available Where's Hewitt? 
not_available He's safe.
not_available Where is he? You lied to me.
not_available You wanted this bomb to go off all along.
not_available You used Roger Stanton and you used me.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Well, now I'm tied to you, and the nuclear detonation.
not_available I want safe haven.
not_available That's your problem.
not_available Well, I just made ityours.
not_available Because you won't see Hewitt until I'm safe.
not_available Don't horse trade with me.
not_available Don't insult my intelligence.
not_available We got a match on Kingsley's voice.
not_available Ryan, you got it.
not_available You're not going anywhere till I have Hewitt.
not_available That doesn't work for me.
not_available I'll call you on this line to give you Hewitt's location after I'm safely away.
not_available You don't need to know where I'm going.
not_available We're not getting what we need here.
not_available She'll get it for you.
not_available Nowthere's the matter of the recordings.
not_available They're right here.
not_available Every phone conversation between you and me.
not_available No.
not_available I want all of them, including Cyprus.
not_available Why Cyprus? You had nothing to do with that.
not_available Insurance.
not_available Insurance? Once the country goes to war, the government will never let that be exposed.
not_available Hewitt is the only one who can hurt us.
not_available Because he forged the Cyprus recording.
not_available Right.
not_available You gotyour proof.
not_available Let me go ahead.
not_available Get it confirmed from the White House.
not_available She can't stay much longer.
not_available Are you satisfied? CTU wants to know if that's enough to prove it.
not_available Have you confirmed this is live and the voices have been authenticated? Yes, sir.
not_available So that's it.
not_available Yes.
not_available When I land I'll call you.
not_available Hm.
not_available You're bluffin'.
not_available You don't have Hewitt, do you? 
not_available Oh, yes, I do.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Scott, take her out.
not_available Kill her.
not_available Run, Sherry! Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Mrs Palmer, get out of here.
not_available Go! Jack Bauer.
not_available You've caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack.
not_available You're not gonna give me Hewitt, are you? Our bombers are three minutes from the targets.
not_available Initiating sequence six one tango one.
not_available Target in view.
not_available Weapons lock.
not_available Are we go for a strike? Are we go for a launch? We are awaiting command.
not_available Abort the attack.
not_available Abort, abort.
not_available What do you mean, Kingsley's dead? How could that happen? I warned you not to use him.
not_available So we did use him and he failed.
not_available But it won't matter.
not_available Once the war starts we'll be OK.
not_available It isn't going to start.
not_available Why's that? The president found out about the Cyprus recording and called off the attack.
not_available There isn't going to be any war, Max.
not_available Well we're going to have to do this another way.
not_available Another way? What are you talking about? 
not_available You'll find out.
not_available It'll start today.
not_available It's me.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available The cabinet has annulled its earlier action.
not_available I have instructed the Secret Service to resume its charge of serving you as President of the United States.
not_available I see.
not_available I've also tendered my resignation, effective immediately, and those members of the cabinet who voted againstyou have also agreed to resign.
not_available Jim.
not_available Gentlemen, ladies we came dangerously close to war today.
not_available That all of us reacted emotionally to the nuclear detonation is understandable.
not_available But leaders are required to have patience beyond human limits.
not_available The kind of action we nearly took should only be exercised after all other avenues have been exhausted.
not_available After the strictest standard of proof has been met.
not_available By casting me aside so quickly, you effectively lowered those standards.
not_available And that was a profound mistake.
not_available It was not, however, a mistake you're likely to make again.
not_available Therefore I do not acceptyour resignations.
not_available We have a nation to heal today.
not_available And all of you play a vital role in that healing process.
not_available Mr President I don't know what to say.
not_available There's nothing to say.
not_available We have workto do.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available Jenny, set up a press conference.
not_available When? As soon as you can.
not_available And I want it public.
not_available I want to speakto the people directly.
not_available They deserve my assurance.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mike, I wanna thank you again for calling CTU in the 11th hour.
not_available Of course, Mr President.
not_available Butyou should have been with me to the end.
not_available That's what I expected of you.
not_available That's why I appointed you.
not_available I'm relieving you of your post, effective immediately.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I can't take all the credit myself.
not_available It's a great team George Mason put together here.
not_available Yes, I will.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Tony.
not_available That was District Director Vaughn.
not_available He's so happy with what we did here today he doesn't know where to start.
not_available That's great.
not_available So what's up, my friend? Well, um it's like this.
not_available Either fire me or get out of my chair.
not_available The chair's all yours.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available The new shift is here.
not_available They've been brought up to speed.
not_available I was thinking I'd get my brother and go home.
not_available Michelle, um there's a handful of people who made a big difference today.
not_available You're one of'em.
not_available You made some tough choices and went up against me.
not_available You were right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, um why don'tyou go home and get some rest? Michelle.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available I'll need to see the contents of your bag.
not_available I'm Kate Warner and this is Kim Bauer.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey, honey.
not_available Daddy.
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available I know.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Dad? I'm gonna take care of you.
not_available I urge you in the strongest terms not to indulge any rumours or theories thatyou may have heard, or may soon hear.
not_available Once the facts are known, I will present them to you myself.
not_available Until then, knowthat we are all safe and that we will continue to be safe.
not_available The most patriotic thing that we can all do today is to keep living our lives.
not_available So I urge you all, go backto work, go backto school.
not_available Because the freedom we enjoy, the freedom that we earn every day, is the very thing that will defeat our enemies and keep us strong.
not_available God bless America.
not_available God bless us all.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available God bless you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr President! Hi.
not_available Excuse me, Mr President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Hi.
not_available Thank you.
not_available God bless you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The president's down! We need medical assistance.
not_available Help! Mr President? 
not_available Mr President? lt'll be all right, sir.
not_available We need an ambulance! Help!
