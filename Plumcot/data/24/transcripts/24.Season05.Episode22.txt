
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Air Traffic Control just received a VCI distress signal from your aircraft that effectively authorizes President Logan to shoot you down.
not_available Start taking us down.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Jack, the F
not_available 18 is within 15 miles.
not_available My radar is locked onto the target.
not_available Lower the landing gear! 
not_available We're going too fast! Touch it down! We're ready to move Bierko.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be right out.
not_available Vladimir Bierko, you're being transferred to a primary holding facility in our district headquarters.
not_available Jack, the Attorney General is on his way to his office right now.
not_available He'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes.
not_available Chloe, I want you to prepare the recording for playback.
not_available I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature so we can establish a chain of evidence.
not_available You work alone.
not_available We got the evidence.
not_available President Logan's going to pay for David Palmer's assassination.
not_available The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder would be devastating.
not_available Yes, it would.
not_available If only there were a way that we could prevent such a trial from taking place.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? You don't know me.
not_available My name is Miles Papazian, I work under Karen Hayes.
not_available What is this about? It's about a recording, sir, if leaked, could significantly compromise national security.
not_available Why are you telling me this? I feel compelled to intervene, and I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve.
not_available I do, Mr.
not_available Papazian, I do approve.
not_available Get out of here, Miles.
not_available I'm just doing my job, Chloe.
not_available If your job is to slow things down, then you're doing really good work.
not_available I'll tell Karen you'll be ready.
not_available The Attorney General, I'll be on the line in 5 minutes.
not_available Did you tell him that the recording implicates President Logan in Palmer's assassination? 
not_available No.
not_available I feel he needs to hear it directly from the source.
not_available Fine.
not_available We're minutes away, Chloe, what's your status? Everything's set.
not_available I've got a T
not_available 1 line hooked in to the attorney general, the other 2 lines are secured on dedicated channels.
not_available What other two lines? We're patching in a representative from the House Judiciary Committee and a Congressional liaison.
not_available We need their support to call an emergency session of Congress 
not_available to begin the impeachment process.
not_available Impeachment process? What about an arrest warrant? We'll never get Justice to indict a sitting President.
not_available Removing him from office is a necessary step to begin full criminal prosecution.
not_available All right, Chloe, let's check the sound levels.
not_available Play the recording.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What do you mean? Where's the recording? 
not_available This is what's on the digital medium.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available See if there's an overlay, check your connections.
not_available There are no mistakes.
not_available Damn it, Chloe, you were in charge of this recording.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available I told you, I don't know.
not_available But if something was on this memory chip, it's been erased.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Excuse me, Ms.
not_available Hayes.
not_available The Attorney General's holding on the line.
not_available Ms.
not_available Hayes? 
not_available I heard you.
not_available Bill Buchanan will take the call in a moment.
not_available I'll tell him we're having technical problems, we need to postpone the conference.
not_available Someone got to that recording.
not_available Perhaps it was damaged in your attempts 
not_available to retrieve it.
not_available It wasn't.
not_available Chloe, who had access to this room? 
not_available No one.
not_available Someone did! Who had access to this room, think about it! Miles was in here.
not_available What? You sent him in here to check up on me 
not_available while I was setting up.
not_available I never sent him in here! Security, stop him.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Let go of me, Bauer.
not_available Do you know how many people died so I could bring that evidence in? I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available We know it was you.
not_available Let him go, Jack.
not_available Jack, let him go! Where are you going, Miles? I've been transferred.
not_available I was told to report immediately.
not_available The order should be coming through any minute.
not_available Transferred to where? To the White House.
not_available How could you do this, Miles? This is not over.
not_available There will be an investigation.
not_available Do what you have to do, Karen but I work for the president now.
not_available Jack, I'm so sorry.
not_available I don't know how he did it, he didn't even touch the recorder.
not_available Karen, Audrey Raines heard the recording when I played it for Secretary Heller.
not_available I know that she will sign an affidavit Jack, not now.
not_available Chloe, take the recorder down to Processing.
not_available Analyze the memory chip And see if you can restore anything.
not_available Fine.
not_available Ms.
not_available Hayes? The president's calling for you.
not_available Line two.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Karen, I heard about a conference call you've planned with the attorney general? Is there some problem I should know about? It's nothing, sir, a mistake.
not_available The conference call was canceled.
not_available Good, I'm glad to hear that.
not_available Listen, the real reason for my call is Jack Bauer.
not_available What about Jack Bauer? I'm embarrassed to say that after further review, it appears that the evidence against him is, at best, inconclusive.
not_available Now, we'll have our lawyers continue to work on it, of course, but for the time being, I'm suspending the arrest order.
not_available You're dropping the charges against Bauer? That's correct.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you have had this office, other agencies, and the military dedicate all manpower and resources into apprehending Jack Bauer.
not_available Yes.
not_available Based on evidence I initially thought was credible.
not_available And now I have new information that's convinced me that the original Intel was faulty.
not_available Am I to release Bauer, sir? I'll leave that to your discretion.
not_available Thank you, Karen.
not_available Good work.
not_available We'll be in touch.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available He's letting me go because he knows he's won.
not_available What does he gain by releasing you? I'll be on my own.
not_available Alone, unprotected, a perfect target.
not_available Word just came in, Bierko's escaped.
not_available What?! 
not_available How long ago?! The convoy that was moving him to District was hit about 10 min ago.
not_available They took out all our agents except one: Davis, on line three.
not_available Davis, Karen Hayes.
not_available What happened? Our lead car got taken out by an IED.
not_available I counted six attackers.
not_available Bierko got away before I could call in backup.
not_available Did you see the vehicle? Negative.
not_available I blacked out when I took one in the shoulder.
not_available There's a Med.
not_available Evac.
not_available team on the way.
not_available Before I lost consciousness, I overheard Bierko talking to his men.
not_available He said they're not finished.
not_available "Not finished"? Yes, ma'am, I'm certain he said something about a nerve gas canister.
not_available Did he say anything else? I'm sorry, Ms.
not_available Hayes, that's all I heard.
not_available All right, Davis, stand by.
not_available The medical team will be there soon.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Why would Bierko even mention the Sentox? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I assumed all the canisters were destroyed in the explosions at the distribution center.
not_available How many canisters has forensics accounted for? By the time the fire was put out, there was not enough left to do a full accounting.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Bill, raise an inter
not_available agency alert.
not_available I need LAPD to do a sweep of the ambush area for witnesses.
not_available I want search helicopters.
not_available I want Chloe to have full domain over surveillance satellites.
not_available This is priority one, we have got to find Vladimir Bierko.
not_available We held one in reserve, just as you ordered but I still don't understand why.
not_available We can't do much damage with one canister of nerve gas.
not_available You're so wrong.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Excuse me? Agent 
not_available It's Agent Cole, ma'am.
not_available Cole.
not_available I'm sorry, Agent Cole.
not_available My husband said that Aaron Pierce had been transferred to Washington, and this is Agent Pierce's phone.
not_available I was wondering if you'll be so good as to make sure that it's returned to him? Of course.
not_available Was there anything else, ma'am? There's nothing else.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm sorry about this, Aaron.
not_available Listen to me, Aaron.
not_available You think you know what's going on.
not_available I'm here to tell you, you don't.
not_available Then why don't you explain it to me, Mr.
not_available President? I understand Jack Bauer led you to believe that there was a recording something that tied me to David Palmer's murder.
not_available That recording doesn't exist.
not_available That's not what I've been told.
not_available You're not hearing what I'm saying.
not_available The recording doesn't exist.
not_available It's over.
not_available You have a choice here, Aaron.
not_available You are a good man.
not_available You're a fine agent.
not_available I see no reason to throw away your career.
not_available But I need to know that we can put this behind us.
not_available If you'll give me your word that you'll let this drop, I will make sure you are reassigned to whatever post you want.
not_available Except for the White House, of course.
not_available So? what's it gonna be, Aaron? Are my terms acceptable? There is nothing that you have said or done that is acceptable to me in the least.
not_available You're a traitor to this country And a disgrace to your office.
not_available And it's my duty to see that you're brought to justice for what you've done.
not_available Is there anything else, Charles? I know Pierce, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Served with him for five years.
not_available And his loyalty is to David Palmer.
not_available Believe me when I tell you, he's going to be a problem.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I confess, I didn't expect to hear from you again.
not_available The situation's changed.
not_available Everything's under control.
not_available The recording's been destroyed.
not_available It's no longer a problem.
not_available That's very good news, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available What about the people who've already heard it? Can't do anything without proof.
not_available I don't think any further action needs to be taken.
not_available Then can we assume you've got the rest of your house in order? If by that you mean my wife, yes.
not_available Yes, she's cooperating fully.
not_available As for Aaron Pierce, that's another matter, but I'm taking care of that.
not_available Of course.
not_available What about Jack Bauer? I've already given Karen Hayes permission to release him, and the arrangements that we discussed about taking him out have already been set in motion.
not_available It appears you have everything well in hand, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available I said I would handle it, and I have.
not_available Situation's contained, there's nothing more to worry about.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Mike? Sir.
not_available What is it, Mike? I just got off the phone with Karen Hayes.
not_available Vladimir Bierko has escaped.
not_available What? How? The caravan transporting him to District was ambushed.
not_available Damn it! I thought we rolled CTU into Homeland Security just to avoid screw
not_available ups like this.
not_available There's more, sir.
not_available They have reason to believe Bierko might be readying another terrorist attack.
not_available What kind of attack? Well, CTU's working on that now.
not_available I want constant updates.
not_available You keep me apprised of the progress.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chloe, any luck? Only the bad kind.
not_available None of the sats.
not_available were positioned toward the ambush site.
not_available By the time I queued a redirect, Bierko and his men were gone.
not_available You try CalTrans? I'm back
not_available streaming now.
not_available So far, I've come up dry.
not_available Keep trying.
not_available We've got to ID the vehicle.
not_available I know.
not_available That was LAPD command.
not_available They combed the area but couldn't find any witnesses.
not_available None? a curfew; there simply wasn't anyone there.
not_available Then we have nothing.
not_available We've got Henderson.
not_available What about him? 
not_available Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with.
not_available No, we've gone through this already.
not_available He won't talk to us and you know that.
not_available That was about protecting Logan.
not_available If Henderson's a real patriot, he won't let those terrorists succeed.
not_available Trust me, you're wasting your time.
not_available He won't help us.
not_available He will if we offer him a deal.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Jack.
not_available Not this time.
not_available Not this man.
not_available We're running out of options here.
not_available This is about saving lives, not indulging a grudge.
not_available You think this is about a grudge? He killed an ex
not_available President of the United States.
not_available He tried to kill the Secretary of Defense.
not_available You want this man to walk with full immunity? It's not about what anyone wants, it's about doing what has to be done.
not_available Nobody knows that better than you.
not_available Bierko is going to kill innocent people.
not_available Henderson might be our only chance to stop him.
not_available Jack What would David Palmer want you to do if he were here? The best way to honor his memory is to make the choice to save others.
not_available Obviously, I can't stop you from doing this.
not_available If you're gonna give him a deal, at least let me present it.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Since you're clearly no longer a fugitive, I assume they retrieved that recording.
not_available Someone got to it and erased it.
not_available I'm not here to talk about the recording.
not_available Bierko escaped about a half an hour ago.
not_available He's gonna carry out another attack.
not_available I'm sure he will.
not_available You bruised the man's ego when you stopped his first attempt.
not_available You know him.
not_available You know how he thinks.
not_available You studied him before you set up this deal.
not_available What's he gonna do? Why should I help you? You call yourself a patriot.
not_available Prove it.
not_available These terrorists are gonna attack the country that you love, because you betrayed them.
not_available Why don't you help me put out the fire that you started? They sent you in here to broker a deal, didn't they? What's the offer, full immunity? That just must be really eating you up inside.
not_available What do you think? You were responsible for the murder of people that I cared about.
not_available I am sorry about David Palmer, I am.
not_available But what I did was in the interest of the destiny of this country.
not_available And I'm not talking about the version you read on the op
not_available ed pages of the New York Times.
not_available I'm talking about the politics of survival the way the world really works.
not_available Do you want immunity or not? Immunity is worthless.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack.
not_available That recording was my only immunity.
not_available They give me a piece of paper, I walk out of here, I'm a dead man.
not_available It's two days, two hours, two months, who cares? They're gonna take me down.
not_available Who's they? Same people that made Walt Cummings look like a suicide.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available You can't really believe that Charles Logan masterminded all of this by himself.
not_available Give me the names.
not_available You can't touch them.
not_available But they can touch you.
not_available I'll help you catch Bierko.
not_available But not for an immunity deal.
not_available I need something more, and you're the only person can make it happen.
not_available What do you want? To disappear, just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese.
not_available Except, I'm not gonna make your mistake.
not_available I'm gonna leave the country, I'm gonna take Miriam with me.
not_available You don't need my help for that.
not_available Actually, I do.
not_available All of my contacts are still loyal to the President.
not_available I need somebody I can trust to cover our tracks.
not_available I need somebody who can do a better job of it than those incompetents who failed to cover yours.
not_available What makes you think that I'm not gonna kill you the second this is over? Because you're gonna give me your word.
not_available And I know what your word is worth to you.
not_available So it's all I need.
not_available Let's say that I agree to this.
not_available Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate, this deal is off.
not_available Alright.
not_available Now, Bierko is gonna hit hard, so you gonna think fast.
not_available Chloe, do a phone check on these 14 names.
not_available I want you working out of the Situation Room.
not_available What do we have? Henderson gave usn14 names that he believes Bierko's gonna contact first.
not_available Chloe's doing a phone check And pulling up relative data.
not_available Is Tactical standing by? 
not_available They're on priority alert.
not_available I put Curtis Manning in command, if it's all right with you.
not_available I trust your judgment, Bill.
not_available Security's getting ready to bring Henderson in here for a debrief.
not_available Excuse me for one second.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Jack, I just heard about the recording.
not_available Has it really been destroyed? President Logan managed to get to it.
not_available My God.
not_available We have a more immediate problem.
not_available Bierko.
not_available I heard that he escaped.
not_available That's why I came back out here.
not_available I was hoping that I could help.
not_available Why is Henderson coming out of Holding? We're using him to help us find Bierko.
not_available Audrey, Karen made a deal.
not_available She gave him immunity.
not_available What? What?! Jack, how can you let this happen? 
not_available You know what that man has done.
not_available We didn't have a choice.
not_available Bierko's our number one priority.
not_available We know he's planning another attack.
not_available Without Henderson's help, we won't find him.
not_available Jack! I think we've got something.
not_available Audrey, I'm sorry.
not_available I've got to go.
not_available Alright.
not_available What do we have? Out of the 14 names on the list, only one has an active cell phone Joseph Malina.
not_available Joseph Malina's an arms dealer.
not_available Used to be a military contractor until they accused him of selling secrets.
not_available But they couldn't prove anything, so he beat all the charges.
not_available You know him? Well enough.
not_available I did business with him before and after he was arrested.
not_available What do you have on him? Malina got a 12 second call on his home phone at 4:03 a.
not_available m.
not_available from a pay phone in Van Nuys not far from the ambush site.
not_available A minute later, the same pay phone got a call
not_available back from a GSM Sat phone.
not_available In other words, he took down the number, called from an untraceable line.
not_available Sounds like our guy.
not_available Tell Curtis to mobilize his tactical team.
not_available Hang on, hang on.
not_available What good is that going to accomplish? You're going to bring Malina in here.
not_available You think he's just going to roll over on Bierko? He didn't cut a deal when he was busted before, he's not gonna cut a deal now.
not_available And even if you can crack him I don't think you can, You're going to need hours, and you don't have hours.
not_available What do you suggest? I suggest you send me in to talk to Malina.
not_available I'll find out what Bierko got from him.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Jack, don't be stupid.
not_available You know you can't get anything out of this guy, and his computer makes this place look like an Internet cafe.
not_available He's got the absolute, most sophisticated, stateofthe
not_available art security system, including a Phoenix Shield.
not_available We can get through it.
not_available Not a Phoenix.
not_available It's a poison pill firewall.
not_available Any attempt at circumventing it, and the hard drive does a cold
not_available start erase, at which point, you can forget about retrieving any data.
not_available Take him back to Holding.
not_available I don't think we have a choice here.
not_available Karen, please, don't do this.
not_available Jack, I know how you feel, but Henderson's right.
not_available We can't afford to gamble on this play.
not_available Damn it, Bill, you cannot trust this guy.
not_available I agree.
not_available That's why I'm sending you with him.
not_available I want him under your guard on a tight leash.
not_available If he tries anything, I swear to you, I will kill him.
not_available Then don't let it get to that point.
not_available Get in.
not_available Adams, listen to me.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Logan isn't worth protecting.
not_available You know that.
not_available He's not going to get away with any of this, and neither will you.
not_available Shut up and get in the trunk.
not_available Use your head.
not_available Logan wants me dead because he thinks I know too much, that I'm a liability.
not_available How soon before you're just another liability? What are you doing? Ma'am please stay where you are.
not_available Aaron? You're going to shoot me? I'm the First Lady.
not_available You're going to shoot the First Lady? Who are you calling? Mrs.
not_available Logan, this is my last warning.
not_available Martha.
not_available Aaron! Aaron, stay with me.
not_available Aaron! Oh, God.
not_available Oh, God, Aaron.
not_available Jack, we're coming up on Malina's place.
not_available Curtis, I want you to set up a perimeter.
not_available I want a man at each possible escape route.
not_available You got it.
not_available Christopher, you got ten minutes.
not_available You don't get the intelligence from Malina by then, we come through the door, and we interrogate him.
not_available I'm gonna tell you again, Jack, interrogating won't work.
not_available This guy won't break.
not_available Then you better hope your way does.
not_available Get me an audio pack.
not_available Undo your shirt.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available You can't wire me.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Well, think about it, Jack.
not_available You heard Malina's file.
not_available This guy didn't get where he got by being careless.
not_available He's got a scanner, frequency detector, God knows what else.
not_available The second I walk through that door with a wire, the bells go off, this thing's over.
not_available Look, you don't trust me, fine.
not_available And just so we're straight, I don't trust you, either, but neither one of us can afford to blow this operation.
not_available We're all set.
not_available Men are in position.
not_available No games, Christopher.
not_available I don't need another reason to put a bullet in your brain.
not_available You got ten minutes.
not_available Have CTU in
not_available monitor channel 8.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hold up.
not_available Go.
not_available Who is it? What do you want, Chris? We have to talk.
not_available What, at 4:30 in the morning? About Vladimir Bierko.
not_available You don't waste my time, I don't waste your time.
not_available You're going to want to hear what I have to say.
not_available Hey! What's so important it couldn't wait? What are you looking for? Is there another way out of here? What the hell are you talking about? Jack, I don't like this.
not_available What's Henderson doing? I don't yet.
not_available Maintain your position.
not_available I repeat, maintain your position.
not_available Secure
not_available cache the files.
not_available Anything you can't do without.
not_available Why? Because there is an entire phalanx of CTU agents outside, including an ex
not_available agent named Jack Bauer.
not_available He's selling us out, Jack.
not_available Now, Bauer is running me.
not_available I cut a deal with him, but I know this guy's gonna kill me first chance he gets.
not_available Curtis, move your team in now.
not_available All teams, move in now! You bastard, you brought him here! He was coming here anyway.
not_available So secure the files, crash the system.
not_available Stop wasting time, and do it! Give me a weapon.
not_available Freeze! Cover Malina.
not_available Let me see your hands! Now! Slowly stand up.
not_available Put the weapon on the counter.
not_available Step back.
not_available Curtis, how are your men? My men are fine.
not_available I've been hit, but I'm okay.
not_available Call in medical; get him transferred back to CTU.
not_available What's Malina's condition? Gunshot to the hip.
not_available He's losing blood.
not_available Stabilize him, keep him alive.
not_available I had him, Jack.
not_available You played me.
not_available This is over; you're going back.
not_available No, you blew it, Jack.
not_available What are you talking about? I got him to lift the firewall, and he was about to dump all of his files onto a flash drive before you jumped the gun and busted in here.
not_available Now you're going to waste a hell of a lot of time trying to decrypt those files off a mainframe, so you'd better pray there's something on there you can read.
not_available Cuff him.
not_available Bill, this is Jack.
not_available Get Chloe to open up a channel.
not_available I'm going to send you some files from Malina's computer.
not_available I'm on it, Jack.
not_available Chloe, I need you to access these files, find out which ones were opened in the last ten minutes.
not_available They'll tell us what Malina sold Bierko.
not_available They're coming through now hang on.
not_available Bill, Curtis was hit he's stable, but I'm having him transported back to CTU.
not_available All right, Jack, I'll tell Medical.
not_available Send a chopper over to this location.
not_available As soon as we know what Bierko's target is, we're going to need to move fast.
not_available Okay, I got through the firewall.
not_available It's still going to take me some time to decrypt the files.
not_available Chloe, just do it as quickly as you can.
not_available Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon.
not_available We need to know where.
not_available There, you should have everything.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Aaron? Charles lied to me.
not_available He said you'd been transferred to Washington.
not_available That agent Adams, my husband ordered him to kill you, didn't he? Yes, ma'am.
not_available But I'm sorry to tell you the president was involved with much worse things than that.
not_available I know.
not_available I was going to let him get away with it all of it.
not_available I was going to keep quiet.
not_available We have to do something.
not_available I'll hide the body, get him in the trunk, but I can't drive it out of here.
not_available The president has to believe that I'm dead.
not_available I need to lay low, keep out of sight.
not_available I can do it.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, Aaron, I can drive it.
not_available No, you need to get back inside the residence.
not_available Your husband can't suspect that anything has gone wrong.
not_available You need to find Mike Novick.
not_available Mike? 
not_available Tell him everything.
