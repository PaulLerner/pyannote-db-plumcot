
not_available Whatever you've planned next is going to fail, just like everything else you've tried today.
not_available Almost 40 dead in the train crash, many more near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.
not_available We managed to stop the other 103 power plants from melting down.
not_available That's what America will remember, that we stopped you.
not_available No.
not_available This country will be afraid to let their leaders appear in public.
not_available For all the hatred that you have for this country, you don't understand it very well.
not_available Marwan.
not_available In the next few minutes CTU will be alerted that the pilot and his family are missing.
not_available What do you think we should do? We have to make sure CTU is too busy to realize its significance.
not_available Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody.
not_available I will return him to you unharmed in exchange for Behrooz Araz.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan from Division.
not_available He'll be overseeing the operation.
not_available What happens if we don't agree to the exchange? 
not_available We don't get Bauer back.
not_available That can't be the deciding factor.
not_available If we don't go through with this, we may lose an opportunity to trap Marwan.
not_available Is my mother in the van? She was working with you.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't wanna die.
not_available Sniper's down! Move out! Why'd you give 'em that kid? He's double
not_available tagged.
not_available We'll be tracking him.
not_available I managed to short
not_available circuit some phone lines.
not_available If you can find two service obstructions at the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan.
not_available We have a location where Marwan was holding Jack.
not_available Yes.
not_available There's a problem.
not_available As I was about to do a pre
not_available flight check, they grounded the plane.
not_available Resolve this now.
not_available Did you report to the chief officer? 
not_available I'm about to head over there now.
not_available Don't let me hold you up.
not_available It's just a false alarm.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll clear it for takeoff.
not_available We placed multiple trackers on Behrooz Araz but those are no longer transmitting, which means that Marwan's men destroyed them.
not_available Are you close to finding Marwan? 
not_available We may be.
not_available Bauer tagged the location where he was being held.
not_available We're preparing to mount a raid as we speak.
not_available I want Marwan found now.
not_available I've asked Secret Service to secure a landing site so I can be on the ground to address the nation before 11 o'clock.
not_available Sir, we believe that you're safer in the air.
not_available I have been flying for 20 hours.
not_available The people need to hear from me now, not tomorrow.
not_available Then may I suggest you do it from Air Force One? It may not be optimal, but at least you'll get your message across.
not_available I appreciate your concerns, but I'm going to give my speech when I get to Los Angeles.
not_available I'll inform the press corps, give them enough time to notify their outlets.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Make sure I'm briefed on Bauer's progress before I go on the air.
not_available Of course.
not_available What's Jack's status? His team just arrived.
not_available They'll be in place in a few minutes.
not_available CTU.
not_available Strike teams are moving into final position.
not_available We're five minutes out.
not_available How's your end? 
not_available We're coordinating backup teams.
not_available Chloe? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Michelle brought me back in.
not_available Good.
not_available Are the satellites in position? Yes.
not_available We've been monitoring the area, but there's been no activity.
not_available How's Paul doing? Is he still in surgery? 
not_available Uh, no, he just got out.
not_available Chloe, I'm glad to have you back.
not_available We're gonna need your help.
not_available Is Audrey there? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Let me speak to her.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Audrey, I have Jack on the line.
not_available Are you there? 
not_available Yeah, I'm here.
not_available Hold for Jack.
not_available OK.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Jack, you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available How's Paul doing? They just finished operating, but they said he's gonna make it.
not_available I'm waiting to talk to the doctors.
not_available Good, I'm glad.
not_available Look.
not_available Audrey, I know we have to talk about how I handled everything with Paul.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available It's just 
not_available It's really hard right now.
not_available Yeah, I
not_available I understand.
not_available Are you out in the field? 
not_available We're getting ready to move on Marwan.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll call you as soon as it's done.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available I got off the phone with DOD.
not_available They wanna know our status.
not_available Jack's team has been deployed.
not_available He should begin the assault soon.
not_available Do you know how many hostiles are inside? 
not_available Based on the infrared scan, eight.
not_available Did voice transmission indicate one of them is Marwan? No, but we know he was there If that hard drive is discovered by the Americans, it'll jeopardize the next phase of our plan.
not_available It's not here.
not_available You haven't looked hard enough.
not_available I've been searching for almost an hour.
not_available Aziz told one of his men he hid a backup copy of those files in his apartment.
not_available Why didn't Aziz tell you where he hid it? Because he was killed before he could tell me.
not_available Anderson shared this apartment with Aziz.
not_available Maybe he knows where the hard drive is.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available I'll try to contact him.
not_available Bravo three
not_available niner in the air, heading 552.
not_available Roger Bravo three
not_available niner.
not_available You are cleared for 35,000ft.
not_available Bravo three
not_available niner ascending to 35,000ft.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'm in the air.
not_available I should reach the target in 45 minutes.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available What kind of problem? Aziz.
not_available He hid a backup copy of his files in your apartment on hard drive.
not_available We haven't been able to find it.
not_available Ask Aziz.
not_available Aziz is dead.
not_available I don't know about a hard drive.
not_available You have no idea where it might be? If I knew where it was, I'd tell you.
not_available I just don't want to get myself killed.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available In order to flush Marwan out, lead your men down the main corridor.
not_available He'll try and escape through the left flank.
not_available Tac teams are ready to go in.
not_available Have they set the charges? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Gentlemen, we are go.
not_available We've got a green light.
not_available Teams A and B, move into position.
not_available All teams move in on target.
not_available All teams, all teams Prepare to ignite charges on my mark.
not_available Three, two, one, blow the door! Go, go! Move! Delete the files.
not_available Delete everything.
not_available They're down! They're down! All right, let's go! Hold your fire! 
not_available Clear! Marwan's not here.
not_available Notify the perimeter.
not_available Teams one and two, Marwan is not in the building.
not_available Maintain your perimeter.
not_available Come on! I can't stop this thing from deleting.
not_available This doesn't make sense.
not_available This room's hot.
not_available Get your men out.
not_available Get your men outta here right now! What's happening? What's going on over there? You OK? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Check your men! 
not_available Jack, if you can hear me, respond.
not_available Michelle, Marwan's escaped.
not_available He just blew up the hard drive to all his computers.
not_available He's covering his tracks.
not_available I'm going off comm.
not_available If you want me, I'm gonna be on my cell.
not_available Chloe, get data forensics in there now, and start a hard target search for Marwan.
not_available Get me a medic! Medic! Too late.
not_available You can't stop it.
not_available Stop what? Within the hour.
not_available What's gonna happen within the hour? What's gonna happen within the hour? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Raines? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Your husband's in recovery.
not_available How is he? He's stable.
not_available One of the bullets did some damage to his spine.
not_available Right now he's paralyzed from the waist down.
not_available Is it permanent? 
not_available It's too early to tell.
not_available It'll take weeks or months before we fully understand the extent of damage.
not_available So he could regain the use of his legs.
not_available It's possible, yes.
not_available But not likely? 
not_available Again, it's too early to tell.
not_available We could go over the details later, but I'd be lying to you if I told you I was optimistic.
not_available A lot depends on his attitude, his support system, emotional as well as medical.
not_available Does he know? 
not_available Yes, I just told him.
not_available I'm sure he'd like to see you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me, can you give us a minute, please? Thank you.
not_available Oh, no, don't you even think of feeling sorry for me.
not_available Whatever they say, I'm gonna walk again.
not_available I know you will.
not_available So, where's Jack? He's still out in the field.
not_available He called a little while ago and wanted to know how you were doing.
not_available He knows that bullet was meant for him.
not_available I was trying to push him out of the way.
not_available I didn't expect to get shot myself.
not_available What you did was very, very brave, Paul.
not_available LAPD's widening the search perimeter, but so far they're coming up empty.
not_available Something might happen within the hour.
not_available We're gonna find him.
not_available Did you secure Marwan yet? 
not_available He must have slipped through the perimeter.
not_available How could you let that happen? 
not_available It doesn't matter how.
not_available What matters is that he's gone and we're doing everything we can to find him.
not_available What exactly are you doing to find him? We've widened the perimeter, set up a search grid.
not_available State police are conducting a sweep.
not_available Jack says he's got something.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available It's Michelle.
not_available You're also on with Tony and Bill Buchanan.
not_available OK, look.
not_available Marwan had an area set up for forging documents.
not_available Some of them survived the explosion.
not_available We secured a number of names and faces.
not_available Castle's uploading them now.
not_available Cross
not_available reference them with the watch list.
not_available We'll do it now.
not_available Get back to me if you've got a match.
not_available Edgar.
not_available I'm initializing the software now.
not_available Good.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Listen, um, I'm sorry if I snapped.
not_available It's OK.
not_available We're all under a lot of pressure.
not_available You holding up? I'm fine.
not_available Edgar, how's that uplink? 
not_available Coming up.
not_available Chloe, how long has Buchanan been at Division? I don't know.
not_available It took them a while to fill Chappelle's position.
not_available Six months? Where was he before that? 
not_available Seattle, I think.
not_available Seattle? That's where Michelle was posted while you were in jail, right? Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We got a match.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available We have a match on one of those photos.
not_available He's on the FBI watch list.
not_available His name is Mitch Anderson.
not_available What do we got on him? Ex
not_available military, arrested for drug possession, served time, was dishonorably discharged four years ago.
not_available He's been hired as a mercenary in a number of conflicts.
not_available Came back to the US about a year ago.
not_available Is he under investigation? He was moved up the list, but he wasn't made a priority.
not_available The bureau sent an agent to his apartment.
not_available Has the agent checked in? 
not_available They may be in transit.
not_available OK.
not_available Get me an address on Anderson, start digging up information, and get me a number for the FBI agent.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available FBI.
not_available I'm looking for Mitch Anderson.
not_available This is FBI Agent Drake.
not_available Please open the door.
not_available Agent Drake.
not_available Hi.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I work with CTU.
not_available Your office said you were investigating Mitch Anderson.
not_available I got to his apartment a few minutes ago.
not_available He's not there? No.
not_available Why is CTU involved? Is there new information about Anderson? We have evidence connecting him to a man named Marwan.
not_available Marwan's responsible for all the terrorist activity today.
not_available We believe he's planning another attack.
not_available How is Anderson involved? 
not_available I'll advise you when I get there.
not_available How far away are you? 
not_available About ten minutes out.
not_available I'll be here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes.
not_available We had a delay.
not_available We're heading over there now.
not_available What about Anderson? 
not_available He's in the air, on his way to the target.
not_available He's on schedule.
not_available Are your people in place? Yes.
not_available We're ready to deploy.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you when we arrive.
not_available I'm sorry, but this just isn't cutting it.
not_available The tone is all wrong.
not_available Maybe I could give them a clearer idea of what you want.
not_available This is one of the most traumatic days in this country's history.
not_available What I want is a speech that is equal to the occasion.
not_available Give me a few minutes, will you, Robert? Let me think about this a little while longer.
not_available Of course, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Oh, and Robert, ask my son to step in, will you? Yes, sir.
not_available Dad? A quick trip to Mexico, a low
not_available key state visit, then we'd have some time to spend together.
not_available It's OK.
not_available The, uh, press corps has been keeping me entertained.
not_available You know, ever since your mother died, I promised myself I'd be there for you.
not_available You were doing what you had to do.
not_available I could use your help right about now.
not_available I'm gonna address the nation in about one hour.
not_available I still don't have a speech I'm happy with.
not_available I'm no speech writer.
not_available No, I know, but you've got a level head, and you're about the most decent person I know.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, you represent the very best this country has to offer.
not_available So.
not_available What do you wanna hear the president say when he addresses you tonight? The truth.
not_available We've been attacked by terrorists.
not_available Americans are dead.
not_available The man responsible is still at large.
not_available We are by no means certain we can catch him before he strikes again.
not_available What happened earlier may be nothing compared to what happens next.
not_available That's the truth, Kevin.
not_available Is that what you think I should say? I don't know.
not_available Neither do I, but the fact remains I have to say something.
not_available Do you want me to help you figure it out? Absolutely.
not_available Agent Drake? Agent Drake? Drop the weapon now! Are you Agent Bauer? Yes! Holster your weapon! 
not_available I need to see your ID.
not_available I don't have ID.
not_available I'm working with CTU on a provisional basis.
not_available I talked to you ten minutes ago.
not_available You can confirm with Division.
not_available Agent Drake, just take it easy.
not_available He's with me.
not_available Agent Hart, CTU.
not_available Now I'm gonna holster my gun, and I'm gonna show you my credentials.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But with everything that happened today, 
not_available you can't be too careful.
not_available I understand.
not_available We just intercepted a call indicating Anderson was in possession of computer files that could tell us Marwan's next target.
not_available What's the source of the intercepted call? 
not_available I'm still waiting for the details.
not_available Did you find the apartment like this? 
not_available No.
not_available There may be a backup copy of the files.
not_available I was trying to find it.
not_available Right now Anderson's our only lead.
not_available We're gonna stay here and help you finish the job.
not_available Do a canvass.
not_available I'll take upstairs.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm almost in position.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available Is my cover in place? I've told you before, yes.
not_available You'll be 100 per cent safe.
not_available Marwan, they have to believe I'm dead.
not_available They will.
not_available My people have taken care of this.
not_available They better, cos once this is done, the entire world is gonna be looking for me.
not_available Recovery teams aren't gonna be allowed in there for a few weeks.
not_available I understand.
not_available Would you pass along our condolences? 
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available Sorry we couldn't help.
not_available Thanks, Ruben.
not_available Edgar.
not_available Yeah? I have some bad news.
not_available Do you want me to tell you here or somewhere private? What? Ruben Weiss from OSHA said they're not gonna be able to get into the area where your mother died for a few weeks or months.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Think about it.
not_available Halflife? Radiation? What does that mean? 
not_available Well, he didn't spell it out, but I think that means you're gonna have to have your funeral without the body.
not_available Of your mother.
not_available I can't deal with this right now, Chloe.
not_available Michelle needs a prioritized list for Marwan's pursuit plan.
not_available Oh.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Do you want me to do that for you? 
not_available No.
not_available LAPD's locked down the area where Marwan was last seen.
not_available Review the search grid.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Michelle.
not_available When were you planning on telling me? 
not_available About what? About you and Buchanan.
not_available Never, because it's none of your business.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Before you worked with him at Division, you worked with him in Seattle.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We were still married then.
not_available Legally, yes.
not_available Did you sleep with him while we were married? No.
not_available I didn't.
not_available But you are now.
not_available Like I said, it's none of your business.
not_available Edgar, where are those updates? 
not_available Coming right up.
not_available Edgar, what are you doing? 
not_available Ms Dessler.
not_available What? 
not_available Edgar, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I used rowmajor format instead of column
not_available major.
not_available Why would you do that, Chloe? Row
not_available major isn't compatible with our software.
not_available It'll bring all our processors to a crawl.
not_available I know.
not_available It was a mistake.
not_available Well, fix it.
not_available Chloe, why did you cover for me? 
not_available You're welcome.
not_available You'd have your job back if I'd handed her that disk.
not_available I thought you had a lot on your mind.
not_available Agent Bauer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I checked with the neighbors.
not_available Nobody's seen him.
not_available Did you talk to the manager? 
not_available He kept to himself, paid his rent on time.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Agent Drake? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Anderson was ex
not_available military.
not_available This bag is from Vanguard Mills.
not_available They make medals for the armed forces.
not_available There's a date stamp on it, three months old.
not_available Anderson left the military four years ago.
not_available You think he's posing as military? There's a possibility.
not_available Let your people know.
not_available We'll do the same.
not_available Have this scanned.
not_available Send it over to Chloe.
not_available You got it.
not_available This is Special Agent Drake.
not_available Can you put me through to Dawson, please? Thank you.
not_available CTU, Almeida.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available Anderson might be posing as military.
not_available Update the profile and see if anything comes back.
not_available All right, I'm on it.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Yeah, this is Drake.
not_available Listen, we just found credible evidence suggesting that Anderson is disguised as military.
not_available That's right.
not_available Yes.
not_available Fine.
not_available Yes.
not_available No, that's not a problem.
not_available Good.
not_available All right, well, thanks.
not_available I'II let you know if we find anything else.
not_available Hey.
not_available I found something.
not_available It's an external hard drive.
not_available This is exactly what we're looking for.
not_available That's good work.
not_available Drop the weapon! Son of a bitch.
not_available Come on.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Where's Chloe? 
not_available She's busy doing a systems update.
not_available Tell Michelle and Tony that the FBI agent was an impostor working for Marwan.
not_available I killed her.
not_available She took out my backup.
not_available CTU needs to send out a team, lock down the apartment and investigate.
not_available Do you wanna tell 'em yourself? 
not_available No.
not_available Help me pull some data off a hard drive.
not_available The directory's locked.
not_available Hold on one second.
not_available I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Can you get into the root? 
not_available Yeah, but I can't open the files.
not_available Hold down tab arrow until the code appears.
not_available OK.
not_available What are the last three digits on the part code? R2
not_available 5.
not_available Escape out and enter pass code CTIS83
not_available R.
not_available That should backdoor you into the files.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Jack, did it work? 
not_available I'm in.
not_available I need to speak to Michelle now! 
not_available Hold on, I'll get 'em.
not_available Jack's on the line.
not_available Jack, what is it? I pulled some data off a hard drive in Anderson's apartment.
not_available On it is a flight simulator and full schematics to an F117 A Stealth fighter.
not_available Anderson's an experienced pilot.
not_available I know.
not_available I also think he's posing as military.
not_available I believe Mitch Anderson's trying to steal a Stealth fighter.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Have you got anything from the air force? Hang on, it's coming through.
not_available An F117 A Stealth fighter took off on a scheduled mission about 40 minutes ago.
not_available The pilot did not call in on schedule.
not_available That was about six minutes ago.
not_available All attempts to contact that pilot have failed.
not_available OK.
not_available We have to assume Anderson's flying that plane.
not_available I agree.
not_available Is the aircraft armed? Yeah, standard non
not_available nuclear ordinance.
not_available We need a list of obvious possible targets.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available I'm working that up right now.
not_available Wait.
not_available Air Force One is headed to LA.
not_available Jack, did you hear that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's the ETA? Oh, my God.
not_available They're going after the president.
not_available I'll call Air Force One.
not_available We don't have a lot of time.
not_available Get me the recall frequency for that squadron and send Anderson's bio over to my screen.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Where's Buchanan? 
not_available He's in tactical.
not_available He has to tell the Joint Chiefs of Staff that we believe the likely target is President Keeler aboard Air Force One.
not_available You really have been helpful, Kevin.
not_available I think this speech strikes just the right note.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt.
not_available It's Dessler at CTU.
not_available She says it's urgent.
not_available Yes, what is it, Ms Dessler? Mr.
not_available President, we have reason to believe that a Stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist, and is in your airspace as we speak.
not_available This plane is due to land.
not_available I'm about to address the country.
not_available Just how sure are we about this? It's a near certainty.
not_available Your pilot is preparing to combine evasive action with immediate descent.
not_available You're cleared to land in Palm Springs.
not_available I'm sure my escort fighters are capable of protecting Air Force One.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, this is a Stealth aircraft, invisible to radar.
not_available If he finds you, he may be on you before your fighter escort can react.
not_available What are the chances he'll find us? 
not_available I can't be sure, but the radar signature of a 747 and four fighter planes is unmistakable.
not_available You're telling me that this stolen Stealth plane will attempt to shoot me down? It looks that way, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I see.
not_available Dad? It's gonna be OK.
not_available Our plane may come under attack.
not_available We're gonna take some precautions.
not_available Get me the vice president on the phone.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available It should be coming through right now.
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available Not much to go on.
not_available Parents deceased.
not_available Has a sister named Alicia.
not_available It looks like they lived together, so they might be close.
not_available Any contact information? 
not_available I can find that for you.
not_available No time.
not_available Have you got the recall frequency? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get ready to patch me through to Anderson.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Air Force One is descending through 20,000ft.
not_available The fighters have formed a protective shield.
not_available How long before it touches down? 
not_available Nine minutes.
not_available And no sign of the Stealth aircraft? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Maybe it's not there.
not_available It's there.
not_available We just can't see it.
not_available We're being beaten by our own technology.
not_available When you hit your intercom button, you're patched through to the Stealth fighter.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Mitch Anderson, can you hear me? Captain Anderson, do you read me? My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm a federal agent.
not_available We know who you are, we know what you're trying to do.
not_available Sir, I know you can hear me.
not_available Nothing you've done so far can't be undone.
not_available All you have to do is change your vector to heading 115 southeast.
not_available That'll put you on a fast track to Edwards Air Force Base.
not_available Once you touch down, then we can discuss how you wanna handle this.
not_available Please just talk to me.
not_available Explain to me what you're trying to do, what you're trying to accomplish.
not_available Why? I've been going over your service record.
