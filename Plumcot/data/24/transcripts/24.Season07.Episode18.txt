not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Mr.
not_available Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Jonas Hodges is in possession of a military grade bioweapon.
not_available I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters.
not_available I promise you, sir, the weapon is on your base.
not_available Do you have any idea where they might be? 
not_available Think I might.
not_available I have an order from the president of the United States.
not_available To search this building.
not_available Are there weapons of mass destruction? Are there weapons of any kind? You've got five minutes to get these helicopters flying out of here, with all of you on board.
not_available Larry, I want you and your men to pull out on Hodges's timetable.
not_available Tony, you're gonna need to find a way to stay behind.
not_available We're gonna get your vectors over to a man that we contacted inside Starkwood.
not_available His name is Douglas Knowles.
not_available He believes he knows where the weapons are.
not_available S
not_available Stay here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Jack! 
not_available We need a medic! Bio
not_available agent is more virulent than we thought.
not_available All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.
not_available I understand.
not_available There's something you may want to consider.
not_available What's that? Apossible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor.
not_available I saw your file, and it says you have a daughter.
not_available I don't want my daughter involved in this.
not_available Jack, it should be her choice.
not_available Well, it's not.
not_available I'm the one who's dying.
not_available I'm in, but they got Knowles.
not_available A little loyalty.
not_available Wasn't that the least I deserved? You can't take on the federal government.
not_available I have a visual on the weapon.
not_available Okay.
not_available Those are the canisters.
not_available I'll notify Admiral Smith.
not_available Target is located and confirmed.
not_available You remember Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan? That we requisitioned a missile system at that time
not_available Well, three of those missiles are now loaded with the pathogen and aimed at cities on our Eastern Seaboard.
not_available You will keep this conversation to yourself and turn the planes around.
not_available And if you do not comply, Madam President I will have no choice but to launch those missiles.
not_available Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.
not_available Ma'am, with all respect
not_available Damn it, Admiral! Abort the air strike immediately! 
not_available The following takes place between 1:00 a.m.
not_available And 2:00 a.m.
not_available Clear out! Tony, it's Jack.
not_available Do you copy? Jack, what the hell's goin' on? Where are those F
not_available 18s? Tim Woods just called from the White House.
not_available The president canceled the air strike.
not_available What? Why? She doesn't believe our intel's strong enough to justify military action.
not_available Is she out of her mind? Jack, I saw those canisters with my own eyes.
not_available So did you.
not_available They're in that bunker.
not_available She's not gonna get any better intel than that.
not_available I know.
not_available It doesn't make sense, but right now we've got a presidential order to pull you out of the Starkwood compound, along with the perimeter teams.
not_available Tony, Larry's been told the president's decision.
not_available He's preparing to move his teams out, but he's gotta get you outta there first.
not_available He'll be sending you coordinates for an exfiltration portal on the southwest perimeter.
not_available Tony? 
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Tony, what's going on? Jack, I might know why the president called off that air strike.
not_available What do you mean? I think Starkwood's got surfaceto
not_available surface missiles.
not_available That's how they're gonna deploy the bioweapon.
not_available How do you know this? A fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker where they're storing the weapons.
not_available They're pumping RP
not_available 7 into an underground depot.
not_available What's RP7? It's a propellant only used in surfaceto
not_available surface missiles.
not_available Tony, are you sure? 
not_available I'm lookin' right at it, Jack.
not_available Do you have any C4 on you? 
not_available Yeah, I've got three charges and a remote detonator.
not_available Do you think you can gain access to the underground fuel depot? Yeah, I think we've got a play.
not_available But I've gotta move soon, before that fuel truck pulls away.
not_available Okay, I want you to maintain your position, I'm gonna call the president.
not_available Come with me.
not_available What is it, Tim? Madam President, theJoint Chiefs are beginning to question your decision to call off the air strike against Starkwood.
not_available They think the intelligence we received from Tony Almeida was sufficient and that we may be missing an opportunity to destroy the bioweapons.
not_available I gave my orders, Tim.
not_available No air strike, no military action of any kind against Starkwood.
not_available Now, I ask you to handle theJoint Chiefs.
not_available Handle them.
not_available I'll do my best, ma'am.
not_available But if I may what is our next move? Jonas Hodges is coming to the White House.
not_available He wants to speak with me, alone.
not_available For what possible reason? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Madam President, shouldn't your advisers be at that meeting? Tim, stop asking me questions.
not_available And if you want to help, make sure as few people as possible know thatJonas Hodges is coming here.
not_available And bring him in through the southeast service entrance.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Madam President Jack Bauer and Renee Walker are calling from F.B.I.
not_available You did speak to F.B.I.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Five minutes ago I gave them your reason for calling off the air strike.
not_available But I must warn you, they were skeptical as well.
not_available Be ready for Hodges.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, Agent Walker, this is the president.
not_available Madam President, we need to talk.
not_available No, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available We don't.
not_available You need to listen.
not_available I appreciate everything that you have done in gathering this intel.
not_available But I still need more before I could authorize an air strike.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Madam President, with all due respect, I don't believe you're being truthful with us.
not_available Excuse me? I think you called off the air strike because Hodges is in possession of surfaceto
not_available surface missiles armed with the bioweapon, and he's threatened to use them in case you try to take action against him.
not_available Madam President, Tony Almeida witnessed a truck pumping RP
not_available 7 rocket fuel into an underground depot situated right next to the bunker where the bioweapons are being stored.
not_available The only purpose for RP
not_available 7 rocket fuel is to launch missiles.
not_available Madam President, please just tell us the truth.
not_available Jack, Hodges has 13 Python missiles armed with the bioweapons.
not_available Three are currently aimed at American cities.
not_available He demanded that I recall the planes, or he would launch.
not_available What does Hodges want? I don't know.
not_available But he's requested a faceto
not_available face meeting.
not_available He'll be at the White House in a few minutes.
not_available Madam President, the only reason he wants a faceto
not_available face meeting is to lay out his demands and whatever they are, you can not negotiate with him.
not_available I'm not planning on negotiating with him, Jack.
not_available Once he places his cards on the table, I am sure that I can
not_available I can make him realize the futility of what he is trying to do.
not_available Jonas Hodges is a traitor and a terrorist.
not_available And after everything that's happened today, are you really naive enough to believe that you can simply talk to him and change his mind? I'm not new at this, Jack.
not_available And right now, I don't have another option.
not_available Madam President, you do.
not_available Tony Almeida is still inside Starkwood.
not_available I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.
not_available What's he still doing there? I asked him to stand by until I could talk to you.
not_available He believes he can gain access to the fuel depot and lay a series of explosive charges and take the missiles out.
not_available Now, I believe this can work, but we need to act quickly.
not_available What about the bioweapons? RP
not_available 7 rocket fuel burns at 5,000 degrees.
not_available There'll be nothing left.
not_available Once the weapons are destroyed, Larry Moss and his teams can move in on Starkwood and lock it down.
not_available Hodges gave standing orders to his men to launch the missiles at the first detection of government interference.
not_available If Almeida is detected, thousands of Americans will die, Jack.
not_available Madam President, I know that there's a risk but I would not be asking you to do this if I didn't think it would work.
not_available Please, I am begging you.
not_available Trust me.
not_available How long did the doctors give you to live? Uh, th
not_available they're not sure.
not_available But the pathogen has started to take effect.
not_available Then there's not much I can threaten you with, is there? I expect you'll do what you think is right.
not_available What the hell does that mean? Sh
not_available She wants us to go in.
not_available But she didn't authorize it.
not_available She can't.
not_available She needs this to be a covert operation.
not_available If something were to go wrong and those missiles were to be launched the president needs to be able to swear, under oath, that we were working on our own.
not_available She wants us to go in.
not_available Notify Larry.
not_available We need to move fast.
not_available Told you I'd get you to the White House.
not_available I just didn't think it'd be under these conditions.
not_available It was brilliant, you know.
not_available What was that, sir? Your idea to make Almeida think that you were betraying me.
not_available Quite brilliant.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You put yourself in harm's way, Greg.
not_available I'll never forget that.
not_available Can't believe I'm feeling nervous.
not_available You're gonna do fine, sir.
not_available Thank you, Tim.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available So sounds to me like the president didn't actually authorize this.
not_available Technically, no.
not_available It was more of an
not_available an indirect order.
not_available But believe me, Larry.
not_available She wants this to happen.
not_available She's gonna meet with Hodges, and we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.
not_available Larry, do you have a problem with this? Hmm.
not_available As a matter of fact, no.
not_available None whatsoever.
not_available Those Starkwood bastards drew on my men.
not_available I'm lookin' forward to gettin' back in there.
not_available All right.
not_available Have your teams hold their position and be ready to move.
not_available Believe me.
not_available You'll know when it happens.
not_available All right.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available Yeah, I'm here.
not_available You were right about the missiles.
not_available The president confirmed it.
not_available We're gonna have to carry this out as a covert operation.
not_available Larry and his men are standing by to lock down Starkwood 
not_available as soon as the missiles have been destroyed.
not_available Good.
not_available Tony, I need to know that you can do this without being detected.
not_available Hodges has given his men standing orders to launch those missiles if there's a breach of any kind.
not_available Yeah, I can do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're done here.
not_available I'm gonna go run a perimeter check.
not_available You said you just finished one.
not_available I know.
not_available But I don't think we can be too careful right now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's me.
not_available The auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.
not_available Confirmed.
not_available I'll be down in a few minutes.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Freeze.
not_available Let me see your hands.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Put your gun on the ground.
not_available Slowly! Kick it.
not_available Drag him under the truck.
not_available Now! Let's go! 
not_available Hands up.
not_available What do you think you're doin'? You're gonna take me down to the fuel tanks.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Ah
not_available ah.
not_available Open it up.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available President will see you now.
not_available Very good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges.
not_available Madam President.
not_available This is Greg Seaton, my associate.
not_available He's a remarkable man.
not_available Doesn't look remarkable, but believe me, he's a genius.
not_available Yes, I know Mr.
not_available Seaton.
not_available Thank you, gentlemen.
not_available Never gets old, does it? Stepping into the
not_available the Oval Office.
not_available Almost smells of history.
not_available Can we sit? Please.
not_available You know, this is the first time I've been in this room since you were elected.
not_available I'm aware of that, yes.
not_available Under your predecessor, I used to drop by every couple of months.
not_available I'd brief President Daniels on what was really going on in the world.
not_available And you've been excluded now.
not_available Is that what this is about? 
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available It's about allowing Starkwood to fulfill the purpose for which it was founded.
not_available Protecting this country.
not_available You have been attacking this country.
not_available You and General Juma have killed hundreds of innocent people including my son.
not_available Madam President, I'm deeply sorry for your loss.
not_available And my heart breaks for all the lives that were taken today.
not_available But I'm shocked that you would think that I had anything to do with this.
not_available We have evidence that you've been working with Juma.
not_available Your intelligence agencies have failed you.
not_available If I had known whatJuma was up to, I would have done everything in my power to stop him.
not_available So let's push aside all these baseless accusations and maybe we can do some business here.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available Madam President, I know you're a student of history and so you're well aware our nation's independence was won with the aid of private armies.
not_available And we can't survive without them.
not_available Look how easy it was to get bioweapons into this country.
not_available Our defenses are fragile.
not_available They're on the verge of collapse.
not_available But it's not too late to do something about it.
not_available So what are you suggesting? In short, I want a seat at the table.
not_available Starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping of military policy
not_available domestic and global.
not_available It sounds more like you want a seat at the head of the table.
not_available Madam President, I'm not here to supplant your authority.
not_available What I'm proposing is a partnership.
not_available Think of Starkwood as the fifth branch of the military.
not_available Greg? This contains the protocols that will serve as the basis of our agreement.
not_available I suggest that we review them together.
not_available Jonas, I agreed to this meeting because I wanted to hear what you had to say.
not_available But what you're proposing is blackmail.
not_available Well, that's putting it in the worst possible light.
not_available You are threatening to kill thousands of people.
not_available I'm not proud of this chapter.
not_available I'm the first to admit it.
not_available And it's time to turn the page.
not_available This country has seen enough bloodshed today.
not_available For the sake of the American people, Madam President I implore you to work with me.
not_available And let's move past this.
not_available Pick up the document, Madam President.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get up now, or I'll leave you down here.
not_available And you don't want that, believe me.
not_available Get up! Let's go! 
not_available What is it? 
not_available Code 363.
not_available It's a government breach.
not_available We're supposed to launch.
not_available Are you sure it's not a false alarm? No way to tell.
not_available We've got standing orders though.
not_available Let's start the launch sequence.
not_available You're too late.
not_available Launch sequence complete.
not_available Target is locked.
not_available Enter the firing codes.
not_available Sir, we need to confirm this.
not_available That's not the correct protocol.
not_available We're about to kill 10,000 people.
not_available We should get someone on the phone.
not_available Enter the codes.
not_available Now! 
not_available No, sir.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's us.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're a go! We're a go! 
not_available Confirm that explosion.
not_available It's done.
not_available Tony? 
not_available Tony, do you copy? An explosion of that magnitude would have shorted out his comm.
not_available You're gonna have to wait for Larry and his men to move in.
not_available It says here that you want active status in the Pentagon's strategic planning group.
not_available That's correct.
not_available That would give you access to Level Six classified material.
not_available Not even the vice president has that clearance.
not_available These points are non
not_available negotiable.
not_available I'm not here to debate them.
not_available Let's review the next section, which concerns 
not_available Senate oversight of Starkwood field operations.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, Madam President, but I need to speak with you.
not_available Can't it wait? 
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available It can't.
not_available Will you excuse me for a moment? Of course.
not_available Satcom has just detected a massive explosion on the Starkwood compound.
not_available The bioweapons facility has been destroyed.
not_available Are you sure? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Judging by the size of the explosion, nothing could have survived.
not_available But I don't know how this happened.
not_available This wasn't us.
not_available Call F.B.I.
not_available And have them lock down Starkwood.
not_available They're already moving in.
not_available Good.
not_available And when this is over, I want to speak toJack Bauer.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available You know I'm not sure I'm reaching her.
not_available I think you handled it perfectly, sir.
not_available We'll see.
not_available What the hell is this? Put this document into evidence and take these men into custody.
not_available What are you thinking? Have you lost your mind? Jonas, we've taken out your missiles.
not_available It's over.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available And you're under arrest.
not_available You are a terrorist and a murderer, and I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that you pay dearly for your crimes.
not_available Sir! My only crime is that I'm trying to protect my country! You think this ends with me? 
not_available I'm just a small cog in a very big machine.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You can't even begin to imagine what you're up against.
not_available What are you talking about? You'll find out.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available Let's go, sir.
not_available Bring him out.
not_available Advance biohazard teams are reporting no trace of the bioweapon anywhere near the blast site.
not_available It was incinerated in the explosion.
not_available Good.
not_available Any word on Tony? Not yet.
not_available Larry's searching the compound now.
not_available We should hear something soon.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, you have a phone call.
not_available It's the president.
not_available I'll take it in the conference room.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, Jonas Hodges is under arrest.
not_available That's good news.
not_available That's very good.
not_available Jack, you and your team provided me with an option.
not_available And for that, I am deeply grateful.
not_available And so are the American people.
not_available Madam President, it was Tony Almeida who risked his life to destroy those missiles.
not_available And as you know, he's facing arrest for things he did leading up to today and I was hoping that maybe.
not_available You could
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available Bauer? Jack? Um, I'm sorry, I completely forgot what I was saying.
not_available You were talking about Mr.
not_available Almeida.
not_available And my answer is yes.
not_available I will take his actions into account.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's happening? L
not_available I'm not exactly sure.
not_available Jack, I am so sorry you're going through this.
not_available I wish that there were something I could do.
not_available Madam President, I appreciate this phone call.
not_available But I'm sorry.
not_available L
not_available I have to go.
not_available Of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jonas Hodges has been arrested.
not_available Let me know as soon as you got Tony.
not_available I need to go see Dr.
not_available Macer.
not_available Yes, Madam President? Call Ben Landry at C.D.
not_available C and tell him that I want real
not_available time updates on Jack Bauer's condition.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available You guys got the north side? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We've secured all entry points and command posts and are sweeping the compound on a gridby
not_available grid basis.
not_available Are you meeting any resistance? 
not_available Nope.
not_available They're surrendering peacefully and cooperating.
not_available Most of the men on this base, I don't think they had any idea what was goin' on.
not_available What about Almeida? 
not_available Uh, he's here.
not_available We found him.
not_available Is he okay? Some cuts and bruises, but otherwise, he's in pretty good shape.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available Jack'll be glad to hear that.
not_available Listen, Renee.
not_available We've known each other a long time.
not_available You know, so much stuff has happened today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We have a lot to talk about.
not_available I know.
not_available Excuse me, Agent Walker.
not_available Your visitor's arrived.
not_available She's in the waiting area.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Larry, I've gotta go.
not_available Kim Bauer's here.
not_available Jack's daughter? Yes, l
not_available I asked her to come.
not_available There's this experimental treatment forJack's disease but he needs compatible stem cells.
not_available It's a long shot, but it's the only hope he's got.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me know how it goes, all right? 
not_available I will.
not_available I'm goin' off comm.
not_available All right.
not_available Did they say something about Kim Bauer? 
not_available Yeah, she's at F.B.
not_available I helping with the treatment forJack, some kind of stem cell therapy.
not_available So they think he's gonna be all right? Didn't sound promising.
not_available Listen, Tony, this isn't easy for me, but, uh I'm under orders to take you into federal custody.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available You did a brave thing here.
not_available Probably saved thousands oflives.
not_available Just for the record I don't think this is how you should be repaid.
not_available Appreciate that, but, uh, I'm ready to pay for what I've done.
not_available Get the cuffs off him, will you? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chopper's on the way.
not_available We'll be taking you back to F.B.I.
not_available Memory loss is consistent with the disease, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available I just wouldn't have expected it to manifest this quickly.
not_available L
not_available It's not just memory loss.
not_available It feels like
not_available I don't know exactly how to explain it.
not_available I feel like l
not_available like I'm losing some part of myself.
not_available The disease profile includes personality changes, sometimes even hallucinations.
not_available But this is a weaponized pathogen we don't know much about.
not_available The military's still combing through the remains of the bioweapons lab in Sangala.
not_available So we expect to learn something very soon.
not_available You were able to give me something that controls the shaking.
not_available Is there anything you can give me that would help me with this? No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Jack, you all right? Yeah.
not_available Um, I'm gonna need to go on record about everything that happened today, and we need to do it soon.
not_available I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be able to provide you with the details.
not_available Okay.
not_available First, there's something that you need to know.
not_available What? 
not_available It's about Kim.
not_available She's here, Jack.
not_available I told her that you were sick and that she might be able to help with the treatment.
not_available You did
not_available You did what? Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Who the hell do you think you are? Who the hell do you think you are? You think this is easy? You think you understand what I'm going through? Because you don't.
not_available I am dying, and I was okay with it.
not_available I could handle it.
not_available And now you've put in front of me the one thing
not_available the one thing that is gonna make this unbearable.
not_available Jack, listen.
not_available No, you listen to me.
not_available I specifically told you, "Do not drag my daughter into this." No one dragged her into anything! She's been trying to see you all day.
not_available What? 
not_available She was at the Senate hearing this morning.
not_available She flew out from L.A.
not_available To be there, but we pulled you out before she could see you.
not_available She's been leaving messages at our office all day.
not_available Theyjust didn't get to me till now.
not_available If you want, I can tell her that you're not here.
not_available I can tell her that you can't see her.
not_available Can't do that.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available Down the hall.
not_available Show me.
not_available Daddy.
not_available How are you feeling? L
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You're not in any pain? 
not_available No.
not_available Come sit down.
not_available Did Agent Walker tell you that I was trying to find you? Yeah.
not_available I've tried everything to track you down
not_available State Department, private investigators.
not_available Every time I got a phone number or an address, you were already gone.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I thought I was doing the best thing for you by staying away.
not_available Daddy, I've missed you so much.
not_available I've missed you too.
not_available You need to know how sorry I am for everything that you've had to live through because of me.
not_available No, don't do that.
not_available Don't put that on yourself.
not_available I'm the one that should apologize.
not_available I pushed you away.
not_available And instead of taking responsibility for all the mistakes I made in my life, I blamed you.
not_available And it was stupid and immature.
not_available And now all the time that we've lostAgent Walker told me that there's a chance
not_available a small chance that I could help you and you don't want me to.
not_available The treatment is experimental.
not_available And I don't think it's going to work.
not_available And you don't want to because you're afraid to ask me.
not_available No.
not_available There's a risk to you.
not_available A small risk, worth taking.
not_available Not to me.
not_available Kim, I'm dying.
not_available And whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening it is not worth the pain for me to let you sit there and watch me die.
not_available Daddy, I don't wanna lose you.
not_available Come here.
not_available I don't.
not_available Sweetheart, it's gonna be all right.
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available I promise you.
