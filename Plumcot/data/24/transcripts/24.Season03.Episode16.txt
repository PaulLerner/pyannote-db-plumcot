
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available What happened, Sherry? I went to the house to speak to Julia.
not_available Alan interrupted us.
not_available There was an argument, and he had a heart attack.
not_available You stood there and you watched a man die? Complex problems sometimes have the simplest solutions, Wayne.
not_available Sherry, we can't cover this thing up.
not_available We can and we will.
not_available The deal was we get paid in full.
not_available The deal changed when you went down to Mexico.
not_available After you have hit the hotel, you'll get the rest of your money.
not_available Where's the virus, you son of a bitch You are too late, Jack We've got Amador What about the virus? I think we've got a high probability target.
not_available What is it? The Chandler Plaza Hotel on Wilshire Blvd.
not_available How can I help you? There's been a threat made against your hotel.
not_available As of this moment it's very important you not allow anybody in or out of the structure.
not_available What's the nature of the threat? The release of an infectious substance inside the hotel.
not_available If this virus gets out, you die, just like everyone else.
not_available Gael, the virus is in the central ventilation unit.
not_available The following takes place between 4:00 am and 5:00 am.
not_available Mr.
not_available Phillips, this is Agent Ortega The toxic substance has been released into the forced air unit My god You need to shut down the unit, where is the air conditioning control panel? On your left, there is a row of fuses running down the right side of the panel one for each floor Look, this toxic release, how bad is it? Agent Orgega? We are just taking precautions, Mr.
not_available Phillips.
not_available How much of the virus was released? Enough to kill everyone in the building Did you plant vials anywhere else? Don't you get it, we are all going to die Did you plant any other vials? My assignment was the hotel So there are others.
not_available Yes How many? Keep an eye on him.
not_available Dessler Michelle, what's the status? Alvers planted a vial containing the cordilla virus in the ventilation system It was on a timing device.
not_available It went off as Gael was trying to disarm it He was in direct contact? Yeah, he's shutting down the system now, but we have to assume it's permeated the entire building Michelle, within 14 hours, anybody exposed to the virus will become symptomatic They'll infect whoever they come in contact with.
not_available Yeah, I know No one can be allowed to leave the building We have to impose a total quarantine We will scramble a code 6 perimeter We have to be careful about this, Tony If these people realize what's going on, there will be widespread panic.
not_available All right, our people will hold a hundred yard radius, and stay out of sight.
not_available Then LAPD and Health Services will move in adjacent to the hotel Good, The vial that Alvers planted, he said there were 11 more Alvers told you this? I just left him You just left him? Michelle He could have been exposed to the virus How'd he get outside the hotel? Michelle? He didn't leave the hotel He is still in the basement.
not_available Are you inside? Yeah What the hell are you doing in there? I was trying to be a hero, Tony, That's the only decision I can make How far away you from the ventilation room I am not sure Health service is bringing protect gear, I want you to put it on as soon as they get there Now if they get you outside of the hotel¡­ Tony, Tony, I can't leave Are you listening to me? I am ordering you to get out But that's the order I can't obey, as it is there are only 7 agents including Gael and the hotel's full of people that need to be contained and controlled Communications, testing procedures, they all have to be coordinated And I am the ranking officer Michelle, look I have been exposed, there is nothing anyone can do Alvers said there were 11 more vials, He said he doesn't know where they are.
not_available I believe him Tony? Yeah I have to go Call me when you have a working protocol Can I have a moment alone? You and I both know I don't have a lot of time here I need to know who you're working for.
not_available Who is behind this? You said he knows me, just give me a name Do what you want to me.
not_available I am telling you nothing.
not_available We found the incubator with the virus in the room next door.
not_available If you don't tell me what I need to know, I will put you in there and I will open it up.
not_available Then I will die, but I won't talk.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, this is Chappelle The virus has been released into the ventilation system of the Chandler Plaza Hotel Alvers says there are 11 other vials, but won't or can't tell us where they are Amador is our only other link, Jack He says whoever's behind this knows me, but he is too afraid to give me a name Is it someone you worked with or against? That's what we're trying to figure out Bring Amador back to CTU Ryan, we don't have time for that We don't know when the 11 other vials are going to be released We'll put him in a room with Richards You put Nina in a room with Richards.
not_available You got no information and 3 dead agents Ryan, please, you are gonna have to let me handle this.
not_available You're gonna have to trust me All right Jack We've got some readings off the incubator That was Ryan The virus has been released at the Chandler Plaza Hotel There are411 other vials, we don't know where they are, and we don't know when they are gonna be released.
not_available Well, he probably does.
not_available He says he'd rather be dead than talk, and I believe him It's not going to matter though.
not_available As soon as we have his boss in custody, we turn him over as a witness Always thinking, aren't you, Jack? Shut up.
not_available Take the wall.
not_available Knees We'll be right back The powder was grinded into particles, small enough to suspend it in the air It's like an aerosol Well, most of the windows at the Chandler Plaza Hotel don't open, which means the contaminated air will just circulate within the hotel We can contain it Tony, it's Nicole Duncan Are you on your way to the hotel? Yeah, we're loading up now We'll be there as fast as we can What's the status of your people? They are setting up a covert perimeter Ok, we are bringing a mobile lab to test the people inside the hotel But that can only be accomplished if the situation is stable Yeah, Michelle has got that covered.
not_available She is inside the hotel? Unprotected? Yeah.
not_available Look, I will get back to you.
not_available Here is the protocol: total containment inside the hotel.
not_available No one is allowed to leave or communicate with the outside.
not_available Health services will establish an adjacent perimeter.
not_available LAPD will move in as soon as the area is deemed safe.
not_available All right.
not_available Have they been given degree of force parameters in case someone tries to leave the hotel? No, that's your call One person gets out, it could start a ripple effect of disease transmission throughout the city Orders are shoot to kill anyone who attempts to leave No exceptions Michelle, all the exits have been secured.
not_available Ok, we need to shut down the elevators and the phone system It's that serious? Potentially, yes.
not_available For now, no one can leave the building.
not_available Our first priority is to prevent a panic.
not_available Shutting down hotel operations, that will create one, and people still have their cell phones.
not_available We're directing a jamming signal at the hotel.
not_available How do you stay in contact with CTU if the cell phones are jammed? Our phones operate on pinhole frequency, we won't be affected.
not_available Is anyone going to survive this? That's what we're here to ensure.
not_available Look, we're going to rely on your leadership, Mr.
not_available Phillips.
not_available You and your employees will be our first line of defense.
not_available Ok? We also need to shut down the fire alarm.
not_available It's hardwired to the main grid.
not_available It has to be shut down one node at a time.
not_available I will take care of it.
not_available Thank you We have probably got an hour or so before people start waking up.
not_available Where is Alvers? He's downstairs with Peterson.
not_available He gave up nothing except that there are more vials somewhere Gael, I know you wouldn't have been exposed to the virus if it wasn't for me.
not_available You didn't have us do anything we wouldn't have done on our own.
not_available Margolis? Hey, I am going to need you to stay for a while I can't put in OT(Over Time), my wife is a week overdue.
not_available Oh, listen, the ventilation system may have released an irritant into the air and I need all available personnel to deal with the guests in case there is any reaction.
not_available I am not a doctor.
not_available What can I do? The health department people they are on their way, and I promise I will get you out of here as soon as I can This is Bauer Dad, it's me.
not_available Amador has left the building Which way is he headed? Hang on, I am triangulating him now.
not_available We are on.
not_available Hurry, Kim I got him.
not_available He is heading south on western and 16th Ok, we are on our way How many people in the hotel? About a thousand.
not_available All right, call the governor.
not_available If this thing spreads and there is a citywide panic, he needs to be ready to mobilize the state troopers and the national guard Yes, Mr.
not_available President But, I want him to hold off the order until he hears from us.
not_available Ok Sorry.
not_available Hi.
not_available You look tired David, I am bringing you a problem, but I'm also bringing you a solution Let's hear the problem Julia Milliken.
not_available She was interviewed by the police about Alan's death, and she is claiming I had something to do with it.
not_available Did you? Does that really matter? Only you could say that, Sherry.
not_available You know, you always claim to want the truth, but your whole life, you've been surrounded by people like me and Wayne who have protected you from it.
not_available I never asked to be protected.
not_available Well, that may be true, but the fact remains you have been Well, tonight I am going to take you at your word.
not_available I am actually going to tell you the truth.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I was with Julia Milliken when Alan had his heart attack.
not_available She was going to give him his medicine, and I stopped her.
not_available We both watched him die.
not_available That's murder.
not_available And Julia couldn't keep her mouth shut.
not_available She told the police everything.
not_available They just called me a little while ago, and I told them, I told them that I was with you at the time of Alan's death.
not_available So I expect they'll be contacting you to verify my story.
not_available And you expect me to do that? Oh, David, it would be a serious mistake not to.
not_available Because if you don't, I will tell them that I was acting on your behalf.
not_available No one's gonna believe that I asked you to kill Alan Milliken.
not_available No.
not_available But maybe they'll believe that you were having a problem with him, that you told me to take all necessary measures to solve it.
not_available Now, that's a nice sound bite for the media, don't you think? Take all necessary measures? I never used those words.
not_available Well.
not_available Think it over, David.
not_available Ok, Tony, I have got you on speaker.
not_available We are on Hoover headed south running parallel to Amador's position on Vermont.
not_available Yeah, we've got you both.
not_available Where did you put the transponder? In the banage on his hand.
not_available You know, this could all backfire, Jack.
not_available We didn't have a choice, we had to let him believe that he had escaped I am just saying that while you are tied up following him, he may just be heading out of town.
not_available No, whoever Amador's working for has got connections all around the world.
not_available He's gonna need his help to get out of here.
not_available You want some backup? No.
not_available There's not very many cars on the road.
not_available If we get any closer, he'll make us.
not_available Look, did Michelle compile the list of all the contacts I have had over the last 5 years? Look, I had to put Chloe on it.
not_available Michelle's inside the Chandler Plaza Hotel.
not_available I am sorry, Tony Look, we think the virus has been altered Altered how? It was combined with another chemical.
not_available It's on its way over to NHS to get tested now.
not_available So you are saying she might have a chance.
not_available Maybe, I hope so.
not_available Look, Tony, we'll get back to you as soon as we have got anything, ok? Yes? It's Amador.
not_available I was detained by some CTU agents.
not_available They put me through hell, trying to force me to give you up.
not_available Did you? Of course not.
not_available I need a way out of the country.
not_available Of course.
not_available Was Jack Bauer one of the agents? Yes.
not_available I need you to be certain you are not being followed before we meet.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Understood.
not_available Good Call me when you are sure.
not_available You have the location? When do you want it released? This will ring twice.
not_available Once you set the timer, make sure it's destroyed.
not_available How long before you can move in? About half an hour.
not_available We found out that the virus was altered, ombined with another compound Yeah, well, until that compound's analyzed, e have no idea what we're dealing with.
not_available So, what's the mortality rate among those exposed to the virus? In its unaltered form, approximately 90%.
not_available Look, if if somebody was exposed for just a short time, would leaving the hotel make a difference? I mean I know I am not making sense here, but Once you are exposed, you are exposed.
not_available The length of exposure has no real bearing on survivability.
not_available All right, look, you said ten percent would survive.
not_available Now, if the virus was altered, is there a chance the percentage would go up? It's possible, Tony.
not_available We'll do everything we can for her.
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available The whole floor? Have you check the service areas? No, I have the corridor.
not_available Stairwell.
not_available Which floor? All levels.
not_available Elevator shaft.
not_available I am getting inconsistent readings on that.
not_available Ok, well, recheck it and get back to me.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Ok, out.
not_available Floors one through five show 30 parts per million or greater.
not_available Yeah, same as the rest of the hotel.
not_available Even the lobby's contaminated.
not_available Ok I will call CTU.
not_available You call NHS.
not_available All right.
not_available CTU, Koppel.
not_available Hello? I'll call you back.
not_available Gael.
not_available Michelle, stay back One of my agents just started showing symptoms.
not_available What the hell is going on? Does that really matter? The incubation period is supposed to be 14 hours, you are the chemist, what did you do? Tell me Under one condition.
not_available You're in on position to be making demands.
not_available I am the only one who knows what I did.
not_available And that dies with me, unless you do what I want.
not_available What do you want? I know what the virus does.
not_available I don't want to die like that.
not_available I will tell you what you want to know if you swear you will kill me once the symptoms start.
not_available Come What's the latest on the hotel? It still unclear how much of that virus was released or how many people were exposed.
not_available Now I think you might want to make an announcement as to how to deal with the outbreak No.
not_available I am not making any announcements until more facts are known.
not_available Listen, David, I just heard from LAPD.
not_available They consider Sherry to be a flight risk.
not_available Now, David, they have a warrant for her arrest if you don't back her alibi that she was with you when Milliken died.
not_available You mean lie.
not_available There is nothing to think about here.
not_available Perjury and obstruction of justice are nothing to think about? David, you have the most powerful legal apparatus in the world at your disposal.
not_available Now, you let me call the AG's office and this so called problem disappears.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available It just widens the conspiracy, and it'll never hold.
not_available Are you gonna let everything you have accomplished and I do mean everything be destroyed because of, what? because of ..what, because of Sherry's indiscretion? Listen to yourself, Wayne, you are calling murder an indiscretion? Oh, for God's sakes, grow up.
not_available Who the hell do you think you are talking to? To an ex
not_available president, David, unless you do the only thing that makes sense here.
not_available Now, Sherry said if she goes down, she's gonna take you down with her.
not_available Then do your job and make sure that doesn't happen.
not_available Then stop tying my hands.
not_available I want to see the chief of police.
not_available Damn it, David, we can stonewall.
not_available We can survive this.
not_available Get him out of bed and bring him directly to me.
not_available So where are we? Caltrans just redirected all the traffic within a two block radius of the hotel.
not_available Chloe, how long before we have enough agents around the hotel to keep everybody in? We are at least a half hour away.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Tony, I have got Michelle on line three.
not_available All right, I willl take it over here.
not_available Hey.
not_available The situation is worse than we thought.
not_available What are you talking about? Gael has started hemorrhaging from the nose and mouth less than an hour after exposure.
not_available So the incubation period is no longer 14 hours.
not_available According to Alvers, the compound had added to the virus acts as an accelerant.
not_available Is Gael the only one showing symptoms? As far as I know.
not_available Where is he? I isolated him in a room in the basement.
not_available Were you exposed to any of his blood? No.
not_available But we've tested the air throughout the hotel.
not_available The virus is everywhere and I have been breathing it.
not_available All right, look, reinforcements are on their way.
not_available Everyone knows we need a hard perimeter as soon as possible.
not_available I will get back to you.
not_available Michelle We can't do this now.
not_available We have to focus on making sure no one gets out of here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ok.
not_available Mr.
not_available Phillips, you gotta tell me what's going on.
not_available What are you talking about, Bruce? Don't' say you don't know.
not_available There are people outside this hotel with guns, and every door I have tried is locked.
not_available They are federal agents, and they are dealing with a problem.
not_available What kind of problem? Are we in trouble? Please.
not_available The only thing I can tell you is all they have told me.
not_available I don't know any more.
not_available And you are sticking around? Look, we don't have a choice.
not_available They have the authority to keep us here.
not_available So what are we supposed to do? All we can do until they tell us more is to stay calm, and hope for the best Ok? Yeah Yeah It's Michelle.
not_available How are you feeling? Ok, all right.
not_available The bleeding stops and starts.
not_available But I just feel very very weak As soon as NHS gets here, they have gonna send a doctor in to see you.
not_available To track the progress of the virus.
not_available And to make you more comfortable.
not_available You have gotta get them here soon.
not_available You are gonna have a had time keeping people in the hotel once they wake up.
not_available What's that, Michelle? I will call you back.
not_available I thought the fire alarm was disconnected.
not_available I thought so, too.
not_available Well, can you shut it off? Yeah, I am on my way.
not_available I have to find the override.
not_available Get on the intercom.
not_available Tell people it was a false alarm and to stay in their rooms.
not_available The two of you, I need you to go to the stairwell and turn people back around.
not_available Everyone else, man the doors.
not_available Nobody gets out.
not_available Look, I have doubled back on my route a few times now, there is no one on my tail.
not_available You're certain? Yes, the streets are empty.
not_available Just bring me in.
not_available How far are you from the location? I will be there soon.
not_available Park a few blocks away and walk.
not_available Look for a silver Ford.
not_available I told him we'll be waiting with your travel documents.
not_available Look, I will need some cash to help me get out of the country.
not_available He will have that for you as well.
not_available Good.
not_available Amador's making a UTurn.
not_available He is heading downtown.
not_available Ok, we've got him.
not_available Bring in the follow teams.
not_available Tell them to stay at a safe distance.
not_available Amador's not going to lead us to who he is working for unless he feels absolutely safe.
not_available Coordinating the follow teams now.
not_available Copy.
not_available What's your status? The lower level is all clear.
not_available So hold your position.
not_available Copy that.
not_available It was a false alarm, you all go back to your rooms.
not_available Everything will be ok.
not_available I deactivated the alarm node, but the system still has to cycle down.
not_available Well, how long is it going to take? I don't know.
not_available I just want to know what the hell is going on.
not_available Take it easy, Sir.
not_available Everything is fine.
not_available You just need to relax.
not_available Well, everything doesn't seem fine, ok? It was a false alarm, it's no problem.
not_available Then why is this guy telling me I can't run outside.
not_available Please, Sir, I just need you to go upstairs.
not_available No, not until someone tells me what is going on.
not_available That's right.
not_available What are those people doing outside? I saw them from my room.
not_available They are wearing gas masks.
not_available You can't keep us in here.
not_available I want an explanation.
not_available Please, please, if I can have your attention, I will explain the situation.
not_available I am a federal agent.
not_available I am here because about half an hour ago, a toxic substance was released outside, around this building.
not_available Why didn't you tell us that before? Because we didn't want people to panic and rush outside and expose themselves to this dangerous substance.
not_available Now, you are safe as long as you stay inside this hotel, but until we get a cleanup crew out there, it's not safe to go outside.
not_available Well, how long are we going to be here? Why don't the phones work? Please, please, we will work this all out, I promise you.
not_available If you go back to your rooms, everything will be ok.
not_available Excuse me, Agent Dessler, someone got a fire door open.
not_available Where? Signal came from the west side of the hotel.
not_available All those emergency exits feed the same corridor.
not_available All right, I need you to stay here and help my people out.
not_available How do I get there? Down this corridor to the right, and downstairs.
not_available All right, people, let's head back up to your rooms.
not_available You heard the lady.
not_available There is no problem.
not_available Yeah, like hell there isn't.
not_available Please.
not_available Everyone, it's gonna be just fine.
not_available Please, please, Ma'am, back to your room.
not_available Please, everyone, it's gonna be just fine.
not_available Stop right there.
not_available I am getting out of here.
not_available I am a federal agent.
not_available Now, drop the gun.
not_available No.
not_available I just want to go.
not_available It's not safe to leave.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Why isn't it safe? A toxic substance was released outside around this hotel.
not_available You are lying.
not_available No, I am not lying.
not_available No.
not_available I know about the man in the storeroom.
not_available I know that something bad is in this hotel.
not_available You are right.
not_available It is.
not_available That's why you can't go outside.
not_available What are you talking about? Everyone in this hotel is going to get very sick.
not_available Sick? How sick? Most of us are going to die.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available I just want to get home to my wife.
not_available My wife.
not_available If you do, you will give this to her.
not_available Anyone who leaves this hotel, will spread this disease.
not_available Tens of thousands of people could die.
not_available You don't want to be responsible for that, do you? Oh, God Oh, God Give me the gun.
not_available Now that you know, we have to isolate you.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Dessler.
not_available We need you back in here.
not_available There is a problem.
not_available What's going on? Someone just started bleeding from the nose and mouth.
not_available The blood keeps coming and we can't stop it.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Chief Hendricks.
not_available Chief.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Please have a seat.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I realize this is an irregular hour for a meeting.
not_available The circumstances are irregular, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Yes, they are.
not_available I assume you have been briefed on the Milliken case.
not_available I know Julia Milliken stated that Mrs.
not_available Palmer contributed to the death of Alan Milliken by withholding his medication.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Palmer indicated to our detectives that she was not at Milliken residence this evening, that she was here with you.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, my question is: was she? Yes, she was.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Thank you, Chief Hendricks.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Is there any reason you can think of that would have prompted Mrs.
not_available Milliken to accuse Mrs.
not_available Palmer? People do inexplicable things in a moment of crisis, Chief.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available The police chief was just here.
not_available And I told him that you were here with me tonight.
not_available And no one will ever know anything different.
not_available I will.
not_available What you have done is unforgivable.
not_available David, you called me precisely because you needed someone to do your dirty work.
not_available So don't turn around and just try to wash your hands of this.
not_available Don't you dare insinuate that I knew what you were about to do.
not_available You took a life.
not_available It's not that clear cut, David.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Alan Milliken is dead because of you.
not_available You needed help with Milliken, and I gave it to you.
not_available Neither of us had any idea that it would work out like this.
not_available So let's not forget, it did work out in your favor.
not_available You should be thanking me.
not_available I despise you for what you have done.
not_available And I despise my role in helping you get away with it.
not_available Now get out of my sight.
not_available Ok, I have got him.
not_available Are the following cars in place? Affirmative We have the pursuing cars in position Here is your money and travel paper.
not_available Move Damn it You get on the radio.
not_available You tell the follow teams to cordon off this entire area.
not_available I don't want anybody coming down here except for the bomb squad and forensics Two block perimeter around ¡­ This is Bauer.
not_available Hello Jack.
not_available I knew you were better than Amador.but you are not better than me.
not_available Amador said you knew me.
not_available Who is this? First thing first, Jack.
not_available There are 11 other vials, each containing the same amount of virus that was released at the hotel.
not_available I will use them the moment my instructions aren't followed.
not_available What do you want, money? I need you to put me in touch with a friend of yours.
not_available Everything is going to be ok.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Sir.I need phillips,it will be ok They are lying to us.
not_available There is something wrong inside the building.
not_available It's inside the building.
not_available sir,clam down.everyone,on my way Keep away from the doors.
not_available Stay back.
not_available Hold it right there Step away from the window.
not_available I said step away from the window If you try to leave, I will shoot you No, you won't Mr.
not_available President, I have Jack Bauer for you.
not_available Thank you Jack Mr.
not_available President, the man in possession of the Cordilla virus has demanded to speak with you.
not_available We don't have a name on him yet, sir.
not_available But I do believe that if you don't speak with him, he'll release more of the virus.
not_available Unfortunately, Mr.
not_available President, right now at this time I think you are going to have to give in to this demands.
not_available I will speak to him.
not_available Yes, sir, I will connect you.
not_available You're on with President.
not_available I'll make this brief.
not_available As you are no doubt aware, I am in possession of enough of the virus to decimate a good portion of the population of this country.
not_available And as I have shown at the Chandler Plaza Hotel, I will do so unless you follow the instructions.
not_available You will be receiving over the next few hours.
not_available Do you understand, Mr.
not_available President? I am listening.
not_available You are no longer in control of your country, and if you do not use the full power of your office to execute my wishes, the virus will be released, and it will be impossible to stop.
not_available You will be hearing from me.
