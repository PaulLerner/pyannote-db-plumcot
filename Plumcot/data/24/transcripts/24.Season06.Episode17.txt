not_available Fayed has the bombs.
not_available Where is he? I don't know, but I can help you find him.
not_available Preparing the tracker now.
not_available We can track up to 15 miles.
not_available And we are locked on the isotope signature that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm.
not_available You led them to me.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available I'm heading in.
not_available Which direction, Milo? He stopped and entered the building on the left.
not_available Milo, no one's in here.
not_available My God! They cut off Gredenko's arm! Ryan, move your men in now! I want Fayed alive.
not_available We're trapped.
not_available This way.
not_available I recognise him from the news! It's the terrorist they're looking for! 
not_available That is him.
not_available You bastard.
not_available Back off! Gredenko is not here.
not_available Lock down the area, initiate a search.
not_available One of the cabinet votes is invalid.
not_available The tally's seven to six in favour of invoking the 25th Amendment and removing President Palmer from power.
not_available I'm sorry, Wayne.
not_available Noah, don't waste your apologies on me, because I won't let you steal the presidency.
not_available As I'm sure you're aware, sir, conspiracy to commit perjury is a felony offence.
not_available My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favour so that you can do 
not_available what's right for this country.
not_available You're right.
not_available Do it.
not_available Turn it off.
not_available Wayne.
not_available The Supreme Court was just notified Daniels withdrew his suit.
not_available You're still the President of the United States.
not_available President Palmer.
not_available What? He's about to go ahead with the nuclear strike.
not_available This makes no sense, sir.
not_available It's what you risked your life to stop! 
not_available I risked my life to reassert my authority.
not_available Mr President.
not_available We have a successful launch.
not_available Good.
not_available Mr President the missile is just entering target's airspace.
not_available Mr President 
not_available I'm done talking.
not_available We both agreed a nuclear strike is pointless.
not_available Fayed's actions are not state
not_available sponsored and his country cannot be held accountable.
not_available Five minutes to impact.
not_available The ambassador assured us his country's doing everything possible to find the nukes.
not_available They simply don't know anything.
not_available One way or another, Tom, we're about to find out if that's true.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available It's me.
not_available Have you gotten anything from Fayed? 
not_available Jack's interrogating him.
not_available He's not optimistic about breaking him.
not_available What's going on? The president's gone ahead with the strike.
not_available He what?! 
not_available He's launched it, Bill.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know why.
not_available He fought the vice president and now he's just going ahead with Daniels' plan.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available We've gotta stop this.
not_available Bill, can I tell the president that you have a solid lead from Fayed on the location of the suitcase nukes? Provide a pretext to bring the missile down? Karen, I can't do that.
not_available Fayed's not talking, Gredenko's dead.
not_available I don't have anything.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Me too.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Sir, we have confirmation their radar's tagged the missile.
not_available They're scrambling fighters and readying air defences.
not_available They know we're coming.
not_available Good.
not_available I just got off the phone with CTU.
not_available Bauer's interrogating Fayed.
not_available He'll soon have the location of those bombs.
not_available No, Karen.
not_available We can't afford to wait.
not_available Sir, we can't afford not to.
not_available Please, why are you doing this? Four minutes to impact, Mr President.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We have the ambassador for the president.
not_available This is President Palmer.
not_available My government has alerted me of the nuclear weapon heading toward my country.
not_available That's correct.
not_available We've made good on our threat.
not_available For God's sake, I implore you to stop it.
not_available On what grounds? We have uncovered new information regarding your situation.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available We have identified a general in central command, Mohmar Habib, who has also been in contact with Fayed.
not_available It's our belief he's been helping orchestrate the attacks.
not_available Have you arrested Habib? 
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available He's being interrogated.
not_available Please, you must abort this attack before it's too late.
not_available Does Habib know the present location of Fayed's nuclear weapons? It is my understanding his last contact with Fayed was during the drone operation.
not_available He has no current knowledge of the weapons' whereabouts or intended targets.
not_available Mr President two minutes to impact, sir.
not_available Ambassador, your government has known about this man for some time, haven't they? Mr President, this development has come as a shock.
not_available Stop lying to me! That missile will hit in less than two minutes, so please don't try my patience again.
not_available You must understand the fragile political climate of our country.
not_available General Habib is a high
not_available ranking military commander.
not_available I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of World War III.
not_available The missile will be aborted.
not_available But in the meantime, I strongly suggest you get me a full dossier on General Habib.
not_available I want a thorough update on his interrogation.
not_available I'm also demanding that you return here to the White House immediately.
not_available I want direct access to you, sir, for the duration of this crisis.
not_available As you wish, Mr President.
not_available Commander, abort code alpha, zero, delta, nine.
not_available Ditch it in the Gulf.
not_available My God, they were lying to us all the time, withholding information, and you knew it.
not_available I suspected it.
not_available Well, I'll see that the Vickery sends a recovery team to retrieve that nuclear warhead.
not_available That won't be necessary, Tom.
not_available The president ordered the launch of a secondary missile on board the Vickery.
not_available An unarmed one.
not_available What?! This was all a bluff? The vice president was right, well, about one thing, anyway 
not_available that it was gonna take a willingness to strike back before getting any real cooperation.
not_available The difference is I wasn't about to take innocent lives to prove my point.
not_available Now, let's get this information to CTU.
not_available Perhaps it's the key to breaking Fayed.
not_available This country is planning a retaliatory strike against your people.
not_available I can stop it, but tell me where the bombs are.
not_available Where are the bombs?! Fayed, this is over.
not_available You lost.
not_available Save your people.
not_available Just tell me where the bombs are.
not_available Are you enjoying yourself, Bauer? As much as you enjoyed butchering my little brother? Your brother was responsible for the death of dozens of innocent lives.
not_available Now you're responsible for thousands.
not_available Trust me, I haven't begun to enjoy myself.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available You'll get nothing from me and you know it.
not_available We'll see.
not_available This is not working.
not_available Let me have a go at him.
not_available No.
not_available That's exactly what he wants.
not_available He knows he's lost.
not_available He wants us to martyr him.
not_available Hold on.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available It's Bill.
not_available What's your status with Fayed? Same as before.
not_available We're getting nowhere.
not_available I've just got new intel from the White House.
not_available Fayed's government arrested one of its generals 
not_available Mohmar Habib.
not_available He's been running Fayed, helping him coordinate the attacks.
not_available Then Habib knows where Fayed's men are.
not_available No.
not_available He claims there's been no contact since the drone attack.
not_available They're interrogating him.
not_available Unless Habib gives us something more useful, we have no location for these bombs.
not_available We have to try something more drastic.
not_available How soon can Fayed be transported? 
not_available Immediately, but we've got a play.
not_available You really think you'll be remembered as some great martyr for your people? You blew up a little city and you killed a lot of people today, but let's face it, that's gonna be of no real political significance.
not_available Your number two guy, once he realises that you're out of the picture, he's gonna take those remaining suitcase nukes and blow up a substantial target, something that's really gonna hurt this country.
not_available If by some chance he succeeds, he's gonna be the hero of yourjihad, and you will be forgotten.
not_available Is that what you want? Do you honestly believe you can manipulate me by playing on my vanity? I serve the will of God.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available And if you don't believe me, ask Him when you meet Him.
not_available Agent Doyle, lower your weapon.
not_available I said, lower you weapon! Buchanan wants us to transport Fayed to CTU.
not_available His men are probably on the move.
not_available The only way to break him is with a pharmaceutical package.
not_available Burke is ready.
not_available We don't need Burke.
not_available Just give me time.
not_available Those are your orders.
not_available Agent Doyle, do you have a problem? 
not_available No problem.
not_available Good.
not_available Get your men ready.
not_available Now we're gonna have some fun.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Here's the file on Habib.
not_available Is this the complete dossier on Habib? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available It's preliminary.
not_available I was told by the ambassador's staff that more would be forthcoming and relayed to CTU.
not_available Good.
not_available How soon before the ambassador gets here? Within 15 minutes.
not_available And I spoke with Secret Service.
not_available Your sister's on her way back to the hospital to be with Walid.
not_available She's gonna call you soon.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I did want to say your handling of the crisis I know you're not happy you were kept in the dark.
not_available The joint chiefs agreed we keep the plan closed.
not_available That's not it.
not_available I just want to say I'm sorry I doubted your strength and your leadership.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Well, respectfully, sir, no.
not_available It's not all right.
not_available Tom, you and I go back a long time.
not_available So let's be honest with each other.
not_available You believed the vice president was better suited to lead this country through this crisis.
not_available And I was wrong about that, sir.
not_available If that missile had detonated on foreign soil, Russia, China, every nation with a nuclear capability, might have inserted themselves into this.
not_available This could've been a world war.
not_available Unfortunately, we're already in a world war.
not_available It's just taken me some time to realise that.
not_available If it hadn't have been for Vice President Daniels, I would've had no gambit to play and the ambassador would never have come forward with this intel on Habib.
not_available I'm not David, Tom, and I never will be, but I am learning that who I am is not so bad.
not_available Yeah, we're all doing some learning here today, aren't we, sir? Tom Daniels withdrew his challenge to my competency very suddenly and, from what I know, without any discernible reason.
not_available Change of heart, maybe? 
not_available Something must have changed it.
not_available You have something on him, don't you? Sir, as chief of staff, I'm here to inform you and also to protect you.
not_available Those jobs don't always work in combination.
not_available We're northbound on Washington.
not_available ETA about six minutes.
not_available Tell Agent Burke we're gonna need everything he's got.
not_available What if it doesn't work? I've never found pharmaceutical torture that effective.
not_available I have.
not_available If this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time.
not_available I won't tell you a thing.
not_available Whether you do or not, I get to watch you suffer.
not_available Agent Doyle, I don't want you talking to Jack! Watch out! Everybody OK?! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're trying to flank us on both sides.
not_available We're sitting ducks here! Try and get Fayed out the back.
not_available I'll cover you from this side.
not_available All right.
not_available We're clear! We're clear! Bill, it's Jack.
not_available Do you copy? Bill, do you copy? 
not_available We're here, Jack.
not_available Cover team just picked up Fayed.
not_available Do you think he bought it? We'll know soon enough.
not_available Is the AVfeed up yet? 
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Agent Doyle, you're bleeding.
not_available I must have cut myself in the crash.
not_available Mike, do you need medical assistance? 
not_available No, it's superficial.
not_available Thanks for your concern.
not_available Jack, I'm patching it through to you now.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Talit, take evasive measures.
not_available Keep off the main streets.
not_available My name is Jamal Nasawa.
not_available We're with the Al
not_available Tahireen cell.
not_available General Habib sent us.
not_available The general? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How did you find me? 
not_available Through contacts in American intelligence.
not_available He learned of your route and ordered us to intercept.
not_available He wants us to help you rendezvous with your men.
not_available Give me a gun.
not_available I want to speak to him 
not_available General Habib.
not_available That's not possible at the moment.
not_available Why not? He's under tight scrutiny by the government.
not_available It's not safe.
not_available He said he'll call us when he can.
not_available Fayed, where do you want us to take you? I'll let you know after I speak to the general.
not_available As you wish.
not_available Bill, did you copy? Fayed's not going anywhere unless he talks to Habib.
not_available I don't know if I can make that happen.
not_available We've got to, otherwise this falls through.
not_available We have no other way to find the bombs.
not_available I'll call the White House.
not_available We need to involve the president.
not_available I've got Bill Buchanan on the phone.
not_available I'm patching him through.
not_available Bill, you're on speaker with Tom Lennox and myself.
not_available So what's the situation? Jack wasn't able to extract any information from Fayed.
not_available He considered it a dead end.
not_available Consequently, we implemented a plan intended to trick Fayed into leading us to the suitcase nukes.
not_available What sort of plan? 
not_available We staged a fake rescue of Fayed by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib.
not_available We hoped that Fayed would lead us to wherever his men are holed up.
not_available But he hasn't, right? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Fayed is stalling until he can get confirmation from Habib that these men are taking orders from him.
not_available He wants to speak to the general, sir.
not_available Habib is still being interrogated.
not_available We don't know how cooperative he's being or even if he will be.
not_available I appreciate that, sir.
not_available Our agents on the inside are trying to circumvent his request, but Jack believes Fayed will not lead us to the location of the nukes unless he speaks directly to the general.
not_available Where is the ambassador now? 
not_available He just arrived.
not_available Karen is meeting him.
not_available I'll do my best to pressure the ambassador.
not_available Maybe they can force Habib to make that call.
not_available Keep doing what you can, just in case I'm not successful.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We'll keep you apprised.
not_available All right.
not_available Sir, if this ruse isn't working, we might be better off getting information out of Fayed by conventional means.
not_available If Jack Bauer says that's a dead end, then I believe him.
not_available Let's not keep the ambassador waiting.
not_available Whoa! Are you all right, sir? I'm fine.
not_available Ambassador.
not_available Mr President.
not_available The prime minister has asked me to convey his gratitude to you for stopping the attack, and his relief that a catastrophe was narrowly avoided.
not_available Don't get too comfortable, Mr Ambassador, because there may be one yet.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Let me get right to the point.
not_available At this very moment, Abu Fayed is travelling with CTU agents posing as a terrorist cell allied with General Habib.
not_available You have Fayed? 
not_available Yeah, but not the suitcase nukes.
not_available The problem is, Fayed will not rendezvous with his men until he speaks to that general, presumably to confirm the legitimacy of our undercover agents.
not_available So we need that phone call to take place now.
not_available I appreciate your dilemma and I will gladly pass on your request, but I'm not sure the general will be accommodating.
not_available He has proven stubborn.
not_available Perhaps you should be a little bit more persuasive.
not_available I resent your tone.
not_available I don't need you to tell me how dire the situation is.
not_available This is not a moment for indignation.
not_available It's your country's own inactions that have brought us to this point.
not_available I can assure you every effort is being made to get information from him.
not_available We have even arrested his family.
not_available Have you threatened to kill them? I beg your pardon? 
not_available Mr President These are desperate times.
not_available I spared you a nuclear strike that would've killed thousands.
not_available What is your country willing to do to ensure that another bomb does not go off in mine? 
not_available What you're suggesting is barbaric.
not_available I know how your country treats dissonance.
not_available Don't you dare speak to me of barbarism.
not_available I don't care how you do it, but General Habib needs to call Fayed and give him his orders directly, without compromising CTU's operation.
not_available You'll make the call now.
not_available If Habib makes the call, it'll be to Jamal's phone, but the general doesn't speak English.
not_available I'll set up a separate channel and translate their conversation.
not_available Milo, I need you to uplink a proprietary channel on socket D to my terminal.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Why don't you just do it yourself? I don't have level
not_available five security clearance.
not_available It hasn't stopped you before, now has it? Milo, is there something on your mind? I just don't get it.
not_available A few hours ago, Doyle was threatening you, hurting you.
not_available Now you two are best buddies.
not_available Just because I show concern for an injured field agent, it doesn't make us friends.
not_available Milo, besides, he might not be as bad as you think he is.
not_available No, he is.
not_available The guy's a creep and a sadist.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available I can have Chloe do it.
not_available That's it? That's all you're gonna say? Let go of me.
not_available Psst.
not_available I know it's none of my business, but do we have a bit of a problem? No.
not_available I'll set up your channel.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Are you all right, love? 
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available Don't mention it.
not_available Pull into that garage up there.
not_available We'll wait there.
not_available Right over here.
not_available Fayed, I understand your caution, but we can'tjust sit while the Americans are looking for us.
not_available I told you, we're not going any further until the general calls.
not_available Tell me, Jamal, if you take your orders from General Habib as I do, how is it I've never heard of you or your cell? 
not_available This is going south, Jack.
not_available Be patient.
not_available Don't be a fool, Fayed.
not_available You know how this works.
not_available Every cell is autonomous, without knowledge of the others.
not_available It is the only way we can protect ourselves and our operation if we get captured.
not_available Yes? The general.
not_available Hello.
not_available Fayed.
not_available "Fayed, I can't speak long.
not_available I suspect I'm being watched.
not_available " "So I was told.
not_available " "General, these men who rescued me, did you send them?" "Of course I sent them.
not_available " "Do you still have the bombs?" "There are two left.
not_available They're with Halil at a safe house.
not_available " "Why haven't you used them?" "The Russian, Gredenko, failed to provide us with the means to a secondary target.
not_available " "You failed, Fayed.
not_available " "We should've sent Sameer in your place.
not_available " "Are the bombs operational?" "They are.
not_available " "Good.
not_available " "Connect with your men get the bombs ready to move out.
not_available " "Call me back at this number.
not_available " "By then, I will have chosen a new target for you.
not_available Do you understand?" "Yes, General.
not_available " Are we good? The safe house isn't far.
not_available Head east toward the 110 freeway.
not_available The target vehicle is moving.
not_available Copy that, Jack.
not_available Looks like it worked.
not_available I'll let the White House know.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Mr President? Hm? Are you feeling all right? 
not_available I'm fine, Karen.
not_available Just a I'm just a little tired.
not_available Mr President, I just got word from CTU.
not_available The general's call appears to have satisfied Fayed.
not_available He's leading them to the bombs.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available I'm pleased we were able to help, Mr President.
not_available So am I.
not_available Karen, would you please show the ambassador to his car? Yes, Mr President.
not_available Forgive me, Mr President.
not_available I believe you asked me to remain here That won't be necessary any longer.
not_available Thank you again for your cooperation.
not_available Of course, Mr President.
not_available You handled him well, sir.
not_available The door, Tom.
not_available Excuse me, sir? 
not_available The door lock it.
not_available Mr President.
not_available No one can know.
not_available Mr President! Shadow teams for Bauer and Doyle are standing by.
not_available They'll advance when Fayed is at the safe house.
not_available No one moves until Jack confirms that the nukes are there.
not_available Make sure Fayed's vehicle and the follow car have a wide berth 
not_available nothing to tip Fayed off.
not_available Right.
not_available Sir, I think we have a problem.
not_available What? The transcript between Habib and Fayed 
not_available there's an inconsistency.
not_available The general spoke of a man named Sameer.
not_available That's right.
not_available Sameer Al
not_available Afted served on the general's staff throughout the '90s.
not_available He was implicated in money laundering for radical organisations.
not_available That's probably the guy.
not_available The problem is, Sameer Al
not_available Afted was killed two years ago in a raid by Afghan forces.
not_available But the general spoke about him as if he were alive.
not_available He could be referring to another Sameer.
not_available Or it could be a code.
not_available I think the general was telling Fayed he was speaking under duress.
not_available I'd better warn Jack and Doyle.
not_available Nadia good work.
not_available Jack, they're turning north onto Adams.
not_available We just detected what might be a duress code in the conversation between Habib and Fayed.
not_available Give me the specifics.
not_available The general mentioned Sameer Al
not_available Afted.
not_available But Sameer's been dead for two years.
not_available I'll call Jamal.
not_available If they're wrong, you could blow this.
not_available If they're right, this is already over.
not_available Now, give me your phone! Yes? This is Agent Bauer.
not_available I'm in the follow vehicle behind.
not_available I need you to listen very carefully.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We believe General Habib may have given Fayed a distress signal.
not_available Fayed might know that this is a setup.
not_available Jamal? Jamal, do you copy? Dammit! What the hell just happened? CTU, we just lost video and audio.
not_available They went into a tunnel.
not_available It may just be interference.
not_available How long is it? 
not_available Checking.
not_available Only 120 yards.
not_available They should've come out by now.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Aerial One, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available We lost the target vehicle.
not_available It entered a tunnel on Adams.
not_available Seal off the north end.
not_available We're going in.
not_available Roger that.
not_available We've got a visual on the target vehicle.
not_available It stopped in the tunnel.
not_available We're gonna engage.
not_available Dead.
not_available They're both dead.
not_available Jamal's alive.
not_available Stay with him.
not_available Call in a medic.
not_available Aerial One, did you see anything leave the north end? Aerial One, do you copy? Aerial One, negative.
not_available It's me.
not_available I'm on my way to you now.
not_available I'll explain when I get there.
not_available Bill, it's Jack! Do you copy? 
not_available Jack, go ahead.
not_available Fayed is in a sanitation truck headed east! Jack, say again.
not_available We didn't get that.
not_available Dammit! Jack? Jack? No contact from Agent Doyle.
not_available Aerial One says they're in the tunnel.
not_available Send the call to audio forensics to pull what Jack said.
not_available Chloe, replay the satellite feed.
not_available Back
not_available time it 60 seconds.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Bill, this is Doyle.
not_available I don't have a 20 on Jack, but I have a dead body at the loading dock.
not_available Doctor, what is happening to him? 
not_available His blood pressure's dropped to 80 over 40.
not_available It could be any number of things 
not_available vascular damage from the adrenaline shot, intracranial swelling.
not_available Mr President, we have to get you down to Medical.
not_available No.
not_available No, I'm not going anywhere.
not_available Just give me another shot of adrenaline.
not_available No, sir.
not_available Another injection would kill you.
not_available I should never have given you that last one.
not_available I won't make that mistake again.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Sir, what are you doing? 
not_available I'm going back to work.
not_available Please listen to him.
not_available Let him perform some tests.
not_available When this is over and the nukes are secured.
not_available In my opinion, you won't last that long.
not_available I might surprise you.
not_available Mr President, if you don't get down to Medical now, you can have my resignation.
not_available I won't accept your resignation, Arthur, so don't bother.
not_available Will you excuse us? 
not_available For God's sake, talk some sense into him.
not_available It is his decision.
not_available Tom call CTU.
not_available I wanna know what's happening.
not_available All right, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available What's going on, Brother Fayed? What happened? Gredenko betrayed us.
not_available He led CTU right to me.
not_available What? 
not_available They may be tracking me.
not_available It's not safe here.
not_available Load the bombs onto the truck.
not_available Where are we going? To finish this.
not_available We're going to take out downtown Los Angeles.
not_available Let's move.
not_available You wait here.
not_available You guys, come with me.
not_available Say hello to your brother.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available How did you find me? 
not_available We tracked the sanitation truck by satellite.
not_available The bombs are on the table.
not_available CTU, this is Doyle.
not_available We're on site.
not_available Go ahead, Mike.
