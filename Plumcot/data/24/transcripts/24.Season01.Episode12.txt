
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.
not_available And people that I work with may be involved in both.
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
not_available This, is the longest day of my life.
not_available Take the next exit.
not_available Plesarita Canyon Road? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How much further is this place? I told you I'd take you to your family, and I will.
not_available That was the deal.
not_available You'd better hope my wife and daughter are still alive.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available I'm sure my being here has been a big adjustment.
not_available I appreciate the hard work and long hours you're all putting in.
not_available There's a high probability that Senator Palmer is still in danger but we are making progress on several fronts.
not_available Our most promising lead continues to be Jack Bauer.
not_available Local and federal law enforcement have made finding him a priority.
not_available We're also trying to locate the man who impersonated a photographer at the Senator's appearance this morning.
not_available This man may have been involved with Bauer.
not_available I've told the agencies we're working with that they can expect full cooperation from all of us.
not_available Hopefully we can repair some of the damage caused by Bauer's recent actions.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's all.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack.
not_available You were right.
not_available Kevin Carroll showed up.
not_available He gave us the information we've been looking for.
not_available I'm on my way to where Teri and Kim are being held now.
not_available Where? Somewhere in the North Valley, east of the 5, between Tampa and Reseda.
not_available I'm coming up on some orange groves now.
not_available Look I need you to Activate the GPS function on the Palm Pilot that you sent me.
not_available I need satellite photos so that I can see what I'm going into.
not_available Make sure that they're hi
not_available res.
not_available I need be able to identify structures and personnel.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna need time to download off the satellite.
not_available It won't be a fresh image.
not_available Alright, give me what you can.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available Jack? 
not_available What? Green she's still squeezing everyone here to bring you in.
not_available I will turn myself in as soon as I know my family is safe.
not_available She thinks I've been in contact with you.
not_available Deny it.
not_available I'll back you up as soon as I can.
not_available Nina look, I know you put yourself on the line here.
not_available No one's twisting my arm.
not_available I've got to go.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Was that Jack? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available In the North Valley.
not_available He's closing in on Teri and Kim.
not_available You gonna tell Green about this? Not until he gets them out.
not_available What if he can't? I'm gonna have to live with my mistake.
not_available Tony, I appreciate your looking the other way on this but you don't have to help me cover for Jack anymore.
not_available I'm not doing this for Jack.
not_available I'll have that confirmed in five minutes.
not_available It will be downloaded to your computer.
not_available Kimberly, he tried to kill us.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available Taking a person's life, believe me I feel sick.
not_available That's just it, Mom.
not_available I don't feel bad at all.
not_available I don't feel anything except happy he's dead.
not_available They're looking for him.
not_available We have to get out of here before they find him.
not_available Cover up the blood.
not_available Yeah, that's right, man.
not_available No time for this.
not_available There's two of them.
not_available When they're gone, we'll move.
not_available Nina? I've got the satellite photos, but they're a few hours old.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Okay, I'm ready to receive.
not_available Are you there yet? I'm just outside the perimeter.
not_available I see a dozen or so people on the ground.
not_available Some look like they're carrying weapons.
not_available That looks right from here.
not_available There could be more people inside the buildings.
not_available Jack, I think we should bring Green into this.
not_available Come clean with her so she can authorize backup.
not_available I don't want backup! Not until I know my family is safe.
not_available You cannot go into an armed camp by yourself.
not_available If something happened to you
not_available Nina! My family is being held hostage because of me.
not_available If you bring CTU into this, they could screw up and make this another Waco.
not_available Send me the photo now! I'm sending.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available What are you doing, Jack? Damn it, Jack, will you get a hold of yourself? We had an agreement.
not_available I bring you here, you let me go.
not_available The agreement was as soon as my family is safe, I would let you go.
not_available Jack, don't be stupid.
not_available Even if you get in there, you're never gonna find them without me.
not_available Come on.
not_available Jack, please.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available You drive.
not_available Jack, if Gaines thinks for a moment that I brought you here he'll have no problem killing us both.
not_available Then we should avoid Gaines.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay Just relax.
not_available Real or not, the threat on your life will probably give you a bounce in the polls.
not_available What's wrong, David? 
not_available I'm tired.
not_available It's something else.
not_available You've been off your game since you spoke to Carl.
not_available Carl's gonna stop the Kingsley story from coming out by cutting off her source.
not_available Keith's therapist? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did Carl say how he planned to do this? No.
not_available He just said I'd better stay out of it.
not_available Maybe that's good advice.
not_available You don't seriously think Carl would do something to hurt this guy? You know Carl better than I do.
not_available You tell me.
not_available I think you're being paranoid, but if you're really concerned I'll call this therapist, tell him to be careful.
not_available I already tried.
not_available I got his voice mail both times.
not_available You called him? Exposing yourself like that.
not_available For God's sake, David, you're running for president.
not_available What were you thinking? If anything goes wrong, everyone around the car dies, starting with you.
not_available Gaines has been waiting for you.
not_available I know.
not_available What happened to you? I had a fight with your wife.
not_available Are you gonna open up the gate or do I have to do it myself? Roll up the window and go.
not_available Stop here.
not_available How may men on site? Which is it, 15 or 20? I didn't do the hiring.
not_available My wife and daughter are in one of these buildings.
not_available Which one? I don't know.
not_available Take a guess.
not_available This whole rescue act you really think it's gonna make up for how you screwed up your marriage, Jack? Teri's told me everything.
not_available How you were never around, the separation.
not_available I mean
not_available You're wasting your time.
not_available Teri's been very lonely.
not_available For the last time, which building are they in? It's this one.
not_available It used to be used for cold storage.
not_available Ah! Damn it! 
not_available You understand my concern.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You do realize what's at stake here, don't you? You know we're working against the clock.
not_available Don't worry, Mr.
not_available Drazen.
not_available We'll be out of here within the hour.
not_available If there's a problem, you'll be the first to know.
not_available I want an update soon.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey Rick, where's Eli? I haven't seen him.
not_available I sent him to take care of the women a half
not_available hour ago.
not_available Find out what's taking so long.
not_available You want me to go load this up first? Yeah.
not_available Damn it! Hello? This is Dr.
not_available Ferragamo.
not_available Thank you for returning my call.
not_available Your message said it was urgent.
not_available Yes, I wanted to talk to you about my son.
not_available You know I can't do that.
not_available Doctor
not_available patient privilege.
not_available That didn't stop you from talking to the press.
not_available If you're calling to threaten me, Senator
not_available I'm not the one who's threatening you.
not_available Really? Whatever you leaked to Kingsley there are certain people who want to stop you from confirming it.
not_available By certain people, I assume you're referring to yourself.
not_available No.
not_available I'm trying to protect you.
not_available You've already covered up one murder and now you're threatening me if I don't keep quiet.
not_available You're twisting my words.
not_available I think I'm hearing you clearly.
not_available You've reached the office of Dr.
not_available Ferragamo.
not_available Leave your name at the sound of the tone.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ferragamo, pick up the phone, please.
not_available I need you to hear me out.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ferragamo.
not_available Doesn't sound like it went very well.
not_available I need to see him, Mike, talk to him face to face.
not_available Later.
not_available Now.
not_available David, You're supposed to be delivering your policy statement on public health care in one hour.
not_available I'll be late.
not_available What are you going to do, pull up to his office with your motorcade? I'll ride with the Secret Service.
not_available You're getting in way over your head.
not_available Pull over.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Are you ready? Kimberly.
not_available Mom, don't say anything, I know.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available Teri, it's me.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available It's me, baby.
not_available You okay? Where's Kim? 
not_available She's here.
not_available Kim, sweetheart.
not_available Daddy! It's gonna be okay.
not_available I knew you'd come.
not_available It's all right, baby, it's all right.
not_available Can we leave now? Baby, we're gonna get out of here soon.
not_available Just one minute.
not_available Making any progress? We're working on the projected threat assessment.
not_available I think you both know where Jack is.
not_available If either of you are interfering with a criminal investigation, harboring a fugitive
not_available Jack is not a threat to Palmer.
not_available How do you know that, if you haven't talked to him? And why is he still missing? Polygraph us if you think we're lying.
not_available So you can stall some more? Save us all a lot of time and trouble, and just tell me where he is.
not_available Tony, go to Holding Room 2.
not_available I'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available Nina, go to 1.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm suspending you both.
not_available What? Until one of you tells me where to find Jack, you're both suspended.
not_available You don't have the authority to do that.
not_available The first one who tells me will have a career and a future here.
not_available The other one will be prosecuted and discharged.
not_available Rick, I thought I told you to go check on Eli.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Who is he? They sent him to kill us.
not_available When? 
not_available About a half hour ago.
not_available That means someone's gonna come looking for him.
not_available Hey, sweetheart.
not_available Come here, come on.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Really, I'm fine.
not_available Kim, it's me! Dad, it's okay.
not_available He's the one who gave us the gun.
not_available Get away from the door.
not_available Dad! Go back to your mother.
not_available Dad, stop it! No! Jack, you're killing him! He wants to get out of here as much as we do.
not_available It's true.
not_available Jack, please! Why are you helping them? Because I got Kim into this.
not_available But I didn't know how heavy it was gonna get.
not_available Get away from him.
not_available Get up.
not_available Is anyone else coming? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Good.
not_available Go sit with your partner.
not_available I'm glad you're okay.
not_available We both know why Nina's covering for Jack.
not_available But I think the only reason you're covering for him is to cover for Nina.
not_available From where I'm sitting, Tony, it looks like she's using you.
not_available You don't know what you're talking about.
not_available I'm just trying to help you see the situation clearly.
not_available Somehow, Jack Bauer is connected to the threat against Palmer.
not_available By not telling me where he is, you're endangering the life of a U.<br>S.
not_available Senator who stands a damn good chance of becoming the next President.
not_available What's Jack doing, Tony? Why did he show up at the Palmer breakfast and grab the gun of a Secret Service Agent? He claims he was trying to create a diversion.
not_available I know what Jack said.
not_available I want to know what you think.
not_available Look, if I knew where Jack was
not_available You do know.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Help me here, Tony, or getting fired will be the least of your problems.
not_available I will make sure you're prosecuted.
not_available You will go to prison.
not_available I'll give you 10 minutes.
not_available Take the time to decide if it's really worth ruining your life over this.
not_available The car is parked at the north end of the compound.
not_available I just need to go get it, and I'm gonna pick you both up right there, okay? You're not leaving us.
not_available Sweetheart, I'm not leaving you.
not_available I'm going to be right back.
not_available Bad things have only happened to us because we weren't together.
not_available We're not separating again, Jack.
not_available Maybe you don't have to.
not_available There's another way out.
not_available A better way, I think.
not_available How? Gaines still thinks I'm on his side so I can get one of the vans without them noticing.
not_available Even if they stop me, your car will still be there and you can all be together.
not_available He's right, Jack.
not_available You trust him? I do.
not_available Rick, it's Gaines.
not_available Rick, what's going on down there? Answer him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaines? Where's Eli? 
not_available He's outside.
not_available He's digging a hole to bury the girls.
not_available Get him, damn it! I need him back here right now.
not_available When Eli doesn't come back, Gaines is coming down here.
not_available Let me get the van.
not_available You've got five minutes.
not_available Stack those on the side, you know.
not_available Should I bring these down on the other side? We ain't got no time for lunch.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available There's been a change of plans.
not_available No, I need to know now, not later.
not_available Now.
not_available What's so hard to understand about that? Come on guys, let's go.
not_available Will you guys hurry with the truck down there.
not_available Hey Joe, where's Eli? What are you doing? Taking the van.
not_available I can see that, Rick.
not_available Where are you taking the van? To help Eli get the bodies from the guest house.
not_available You two can't move a couple of women yourselves? I don't know.
not_available He told me to get the van.
not_available So I'm getting the van.
not_available But if it's a problem, I don't have to.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaines? What? I was out patrol and I found Kevin.
not_available What? Is he alive? Yeah, but he's out cold.
not_available Someone messed him up pretty good.
not_available Where are you? I'm in the North Grove, near the generator.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available You're driving.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Open the damn door.
not_available At the very least, be careful what you say to Ferragamo.
not_available I'll be careful.
not_available I mean, it's not like he's so squeaky
not_available clean in this thing.
not_available By talking about Keith to the press, he violated every professional ethic.
not_available I know what he did, Mike.
not_available Pull over here.
not_available Here's the office.
not_available No.
not_available Let me find out what happened.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What happened? What caused this? A possible gas explosion.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No problem.
not_available It's Ferragamo, isn't it? 
not_available There was a fire.
not_available They say it might have been a broken gas line.
not_available He didn't get out in time.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available They torched his office.
not_available And you can bet his records were destroyed.
not_available We don't know anything yet.
not_available It could have been an accident, David.
not_available But it wasn't.
not_available It was murder.
not_available David, stop! Wait.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Hear me out.
not_available Just hear me out.
not_available Look, David, think this through.
not_available Even if you're right, this is the absolute wrong way to play it.
not_available Damn it! Go.
not_available Time's up, Tony.
not_available Have you thought about what I said? I have.
not_available And? Excuse me.
not_available You have a call.
not_available I said no interruptions.
not_available It's Bauer.
not_available Where the hell are you, Jack? Alberta, you might have my office, but if you want to do my job, then listen.
not_available I don't take orders from you.
not_available I located the people behind the Palmer hit.
not_available You're one of them, unless you can prove otherwise.
not_available They kidnapped my family, my wife and daughter.
not_available But I'm with them now.
not_available That's why had to work underground and why I couldn't contact CTU.
not_available You're telling me you haven't spoken to anyone here? I couldn't risk it.
not_available Believe me, I wish I could.
not_available It's not my job to believe you, Jack.
not_available It's my job to find you.
not_available I'm at an orange grove, three miles north of the split on the 5.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You got that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've identified 11 hostiles.
not_available They're traveling west on the compound service road.
not_available Bring in air support.
not_available I'll get back in touch.
not_available Get me Central Dispatch.
not_available Find out where Jack's wife and daughter have been for the last six hours.
not_available Damn it.
not_available You ready to go home? 
not_available Definitely.
not_available We'll finally finish our chess game.
not_available I'm two moves from checkmating you.
not_available Yeah, oh yeah, I know.
not_available We're gonna be all right, I promise.
not_available Let me know as soon as you see him.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Teri, it's gonna be okay.
not_available Between us, you and me.
not_available I love you.
not_available And I promise you, everything is gonna be different from now on.
not_available No, I want two choppers.
not_available If Villa has a problem with that, he can call me.
not_available Jack called with his location.
not_available I sent three field units to back him up.
not_available Is he all right? We'll find out soon enough.
not_available So, which one of us are you gonna suspend? Neither of you.
not_available Only because I don't have enough actionable evidence that you withheld information.
not_available But I plan to keep looking.
not_available I want to find out who's running point on the field units so we can monitor what's happening.
not_available You okay? Alberta worked me pretty hard in there.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I gotta tell you, if Jack hadn't called when he did.
not_available You took a lot of chances for me.
not_available I won't forget it.
not_available Kevin.
not_available Kevin! Kevin, what the hell happened? Bauer.
not_available He's here.
not_available What? I went to meet Cofell, but Bauer had already gotten to him.
not_available How long have you been here? I don't know.
not_available Rick! Bauer's on site.
not_available Whoever's near the guest house, we're going in strong.
not_available Seal the gate, make sure no one gets out.
not_available Stay in the door.
not_available It's him.
not_available He brought the van.
not_available Come on.
not_available Gaines is coming.
not_available He found the guy you came in with.
not_available I'll drive.
not_available Hold on! Get down, get down.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Stay down! Get up to the van.
not_available Everybody out.
not_available Stay low.
not_available Get to the back of the van.
not_available Use the wheels for cover.
not_available Take cover.
not_available Cover me, I'm going across.
not_available Move, move! On the satellite photo you'll see an old water tower down by the service road.
not_available Go straight through these woods, follow the creek bed and run like hell.
not_available I'll make sure CTU finds you.
not_available What about you, Jack? 
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available There's too many of them.
not_available Not if I help.
not_available You know how to use that thing? 
not_available Yeah Teri, stay there! I got a clear shot.
not_available I'm not leaving you, Jack.
not_available You won't be leaving, you'll be taking care of our daughter.
not_available But Dad
not_available Don't argue with me, sweetheart, please.
not_available Both of you go, now.
not_available Go! Run! Keep covering me.
not_available Go to the tree line.
not_available Go.
not_available Come on, get up.
not_available Move! Let's go.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available I'll be able to stop the bleeding when we get through the trees.
not_available Come on, I'm not leaving you behind.
