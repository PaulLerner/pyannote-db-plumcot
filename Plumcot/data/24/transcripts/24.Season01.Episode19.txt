
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been targeted.
not_available And people that l work with may be involved in both.
not_available l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.
not_available l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder? What we've got is a tape of Carl Webb admitting that he set my son up for murder.
not_available l destroyed it.
not_available That wasn't the real tape.
not_available Set up a press conference.
not_available When? 
not_available Now.
not_available Still no sign of the women? 
not_available l'll find them and kill them.
not_available Just tell me how you plan to find them.
not_available l'm going to the Bauer house.
not_available l don't know you.
not_available My name's Kim.
not_available How do you know Rick? 
not_available She's a friend of mine.
not_available She's gotta get home.
not_available She's not going anywhere.
not_available Till Dan gets back with the money, nobody leaves.
not_available Jack, where are you? 
not_available We're on our way to a meet.
not_available What kind of meet? 
not_available Alexis was supposed to make a payoff.
not_available l think l got him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where's the money? First let's go over it again.
not_available At 7.<br>20 tonight l'm gonna shut down the power on grid 26 double G.
not_available What else? What happened to your accent? 
not_available You're not Alexis.
not_available He's moving.
not_available l can take him.
not_available No! Get me a medic down here now! Who are you? 
not_available A good friend who wanted to be a lot more.
not_available l don't remember any of this.
not_available l think you have dissociative amnesia.
not_available We need to get you checked out.
not_available No.
not_available Please, Phil, just take me home.
not_available The first time you invited me back here, you left your keys in my car.
not_available lt was pouring rain.
not_available We didn't wanna run back, so we used your HideA
not_available Key.
not_available What do l do? l don't know what to do.
not_available l don't know what the code is.
not_available Just take your time.
not_available Maybe it'll come to you.
not_available Just make this stop! Hello? 
not_available This is SuperiorAlarms.
not_available Could you turn this off? 
not_available l'll need your password.
not_available What? Ma'am, what is your password? 
not_available l don't know the password.
not_available Are you having an emergency there? Alan Morgan Saugus.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pacific Electric.
not_available Got it.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Jack? His name was Alan Morgan.
not_available He worked for Pacific Electric in Saugus.
not_available Saugus? OK, he was paid off by Alexis to kill the power in a section of the grid.
not_available Did you get the coordinates? 26 
not_available Double G.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We need to know where that is.
not_available l'll get this to Tony.
not_available Shall l stick around? 
not_available No.
not_available Just get hold of me if you get anything.
not_available OK.
not_available See you at the office.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available None of these are working.
not_available Superior Alarms! Stay where you are! Please.
not_available This woman, she lives here.
not_available She just forgot her code.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Teri Bauer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you have any lD? 
not_available Um Sure.
not_available lt's probably in my purse.
not_available l'll go check.
not_available No lD necessary.
not_available You obviously live here.
not_available She just couldn't remember her code.
not_available l don't usually set it.
not_available My daughter must have.
not_available lt's all right.
not_available Just sign this.
not_available OK.
not_available l'm gonna reset the alarm and check the contacts around the outside of the house.
not_available That should take about 15 minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nice, Jack.
not_available There's always a body count everywhere you go.
not_available l gave Hanlin clear orders not to shoot.
not_available Where'd he go? 
not_available He's over there.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's David Palmer.
not_available Yes, Senator? 
not_available l just heard from my source at the Pentagon.
not_available l had to twist a lot of arms to get the missing Drazen file.
not_available What was in it? 
not_available Dates and locations.
not_available lt seems to relate to the last months of Victor Drazen's life.
not_available Anything we can use? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available The last entry is an address unrelated to everything else.
not_available What is it? 
not_available 21911 Kipling, in a city called Saugus.
not_available l don't know where that is.
not_available Senator, did you just say Saugus? Does that mean anything? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l'll get back to you.
not_available Thankyou, Senator.
not_available This is going to help.
not_available All right.
not_available CTU.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available Take down this address.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available 21911 Kipling Avenue, in Saugus.
not_available l got a feeling it's in the grid coordinates Nina gave you.
not_available All right.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available lt's right in the middle of sector 26
not_available GG.
not_available OK.
not_available Find out what's there.
not_available Get back to me.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where are you headed? Saugus.
not_available Alexis paid this guy off to knock the power out at a specific address there.
not_available l wanna know why.
not_available Slow down.
not_available l'm on your side.
not_available Fill me in.
not_available Two and a half hours ago Robert Ellis was killed because he almost found this location.
not_available We got the address from the Drazen file.
not_available The senator just gave it to me.
not_available OK.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What do you mean ''let's''? You wanna go, l'm your chaperone.
not_available You want a ride? Yeah.
not_available Hop in.
not_available Where's my brother? These guys are gonna be here in 20 minutes.
not_available l told you, we split up.
not_available He said he was gonna meet me here with the payoff from Gaines.
not_available Look, if l was ripping you off, why would l come back here? Damn! Where are you going? 
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available What you doing? 
not_available l'm not waiting here to get killed.
not_available You're not going.
not_available She'll tell the police about the deal.
not_available l don't care about the deal! l came here cos l wanted you to help find my mom.
not_available That was a dumb idea.
not_available You came for Rick.
not_available l did not! 
not_available Don't worry about her.
not_available Just leave.
not_available What do you mean ''Don't worry about me''? 
not_available Come with me.
not_available l can't.
not_available Whatever's out there is better than in here.
not_available You heard Frank.
not_available Nobody leaves until Dan gets back.
not_available Dan is not coming back! What do you mean? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available l just l don't What do you mean?! 
not_available Leave her alone.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available He's dead.
not_available What are you talking about? Gaines killed him.
not_available He was gonna kill me too.
not_available l swear to God.
not_available Gaines was out of control.
not_available So who's got the money now? Nobody.
not_available Gaines never paid us.
not_available These guys are gonna be here in half an hour.
not_available These are not the kind of guys you come up short with.
not_available Then call it off.
not_available Too late to call it off! What are you gonna say down there today, David? 
not_available He's gonna tell the truth.
not_available Don't start.
not_available You've caused enough pain in this family.
not_available Sherry! Well, l'm sorry, David, but somebody's got to say the words.
not_available This thing wouldn't have started if Keith hadn't taken matters into his own hands.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Nobody's defending what Keith did.
not_available He acted on the moment.
not_available lt wasn't right.
not_available That doesn't make you right for covering it up, or make me right for not being there.
not_available So we're all to blame.
not_available Let's just leave it at that.
not_available That's right, Mom.
not_available l'm willing to pay the price for this, even if it means going to jail.
not_available You still think this is just about you, don't you? When are you gonna get it through your head that your father is running for president of the United States? A black man.
not_available You don't just decide to ease your conscience at the cost of what might be best for this country! l didn't, Mom! 
not_available Both of you, calm down.
not_available Look, l kept it inside.
not_available And l was gonna suck it up for as long as it took.
not_available But someone murdered Dr Ferragamo.
not_available You can't tell me hiding that is best for this country.
not_available You know what? l never saw it until just this minute.
not_available You're your father's son.
not_available You cover up your weakness with a bunch of bleeding
not_available heart sentimentality.
not_available That's enough! Am l wrong?! And when are you gonna be man enough to do what it takes to be president?! Nicole? Nicole, you OK? What's wrong? 
not_available Nicole Keith, get me some water.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available We need a doctor in here! Easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available Relax.
not_available Come here.
not_available Gimme your hand.
not_available l'm sorry, Daddy.
not_available Why? About what? Honey, talk to me.
not_available This is all my fault.
not_available Don't you ever say that.
not_available No, sweetheart.
not_available Don't you say that.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Sorry, Daddy.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available Sorry, Daddy.
not_available l just got in.
not_available l've got some more info on that location in Saugus.
not_available OK, hold on.
not_available OK, go.
not_available lt comes up as a wildlife preserve.
not_available Great.
not_available We're going to a Sierra Club meeting.
not_available Who's with you? Mason.
not_available A wildlife preserve in Saugus? That doesn't make sense.
not_available Saugus is industrial.
not_available What about the GPS maps? 
not_available l've got three on the way.
not_available Good work.
not_available We'll callyou when we find what's out there.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available So correct me if l'm wrong, but this day basically boils down to a personal vendetta against you and Palmer by the Drazens.
not_available Yes.
not_available Palmer authorised the mission, l carried it out.
not_available Today is the second anniversary of Victor Drazen's death.
not_available Happy anniversary.
not_available So what is it we're expecting to find out here in Saugus? l don't know yet.
not_available l gotta tell you, Jack, it never gets dull with you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, for what it's worth, l'm sorry about last night.
not_available What, shooting me in the leg with a trank? Don't give it a second thought.
not_available Needless to say, l was pretty wound up.
not_available l feel a lot better now, knowing my family's safe.
not_available What's the matter? 
not_available No.
not_available Just beat, you know? 
not_available Could use a little sleep.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available Everything looks familiar but l don't understand any of it.
not_available l don't feel anything.
not_available l should, shouldn't l? No.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Sometimes music can help unlock memories.
not_available Did you ever meet Kim? 
not_available No.
not_available You didn't want her to know you were seeing anyone.
not_available You said she was taking Jack's side in the separation.
not_available You didn't wanna give her any more reason to be angry with you.
not_available And why did my husband Jack Why did Jack leave me? You asked him to.
not_available You told me he was too removed.
not_available There was no connection between you two any more.
not_available How about you and l? 
not_available l thought there was one.
not_available But, what, l didn't? Truth is, l think you did.
not_available But you were scared.
not_available You didn't wanna lose your family.
not_available And when Jack asked to move back in, you let him.
not_available lt's funny.
not_available What? l don't remember you at all.
not_available But being with you makes me feel good, and maybe l don't feel so scared.
not_available Thank you for doing this, Phil.
not_available Did Chuck come through? l hope not.
not_available Just park in the back.
not_available Just sit tight.
not_available l can't stay here.
not_available l need to find my mom.
not_available l don't know how to get you outta here.
not_available l'll make a run for it.
not_available l wouldn't.
not_available Frank's a psycho.
not_available You don't wanna cross him.
not_available l'm gonna go.
not_available No.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no, no.
not_available Get in the kitchen.
not_available Come on in, man.
not_available You, be careful.
not_available No, he's cool.
not_available Come on.
not_available lt's all right.
not_available Let's see it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's what l'm talking about.
not_available These the guys with the ecstasy? 
not_available No, these are just friends of mine.
not_available Frank, what are you gonna do? What does it look like? We can't pay if we don't have any money.
not_available You're gonna rip 'em off? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available You all right, honey? 
not_available l'm absolutely fine, Daddy.
not_available Good.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available They're waiting for you.
not_available OK.
not_available l'm gonna head down now.
not_available This is a test for us.
not_available lf we love each other, support each other nothing else will matter.
not_available Sherry? l need you now more than ever.
not_available l've always liked this tie on you, David.
not_available Senator? lt's time.
not_available Anything look familiar? lt's so weird.
not_available Looking at what l did for the last few months, it doesn't mean anything to me.
not_available ''Yvonne's birthday.<br>'' ''Kim in Cambria for the weekend.<br>'' ''Dinner with Phil.
not_available lvy at the Shore.<br>'' Was it nice? Well, the wait was over an hour, so we decided to walk down the pier and have some hot dogs.
not_available And you beat me at air hockey.
not_available Air hockey, huh? What's in there for today? Nothing.
not_available Although yesterday l had a conference call with Kitty, whoever that is.
not_available Kitty 
not_available she's a friend of yours.
not_available You work with her sometimes.
not_available You do commercial interior design.
not_available lt's just freelance right now, but you wanna expand when Kim goes off to college.
not_available How come l can sort of remember air hockey but l can't remember what l do for a living? 
not_available Maybe that's Jack.
not_available He wouldn't ring the bell.
not_available lt's probably my friend Chris.
not_available Remember? l wanted someone here, to be on the safe side.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Stay here, just in case.
not_available Hey, Phil.
not_available Hey, Chris.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Teri, this is Chris.
not_available Hi.
not_available Why does he have a gun? 
not_available He's here to l don't care.
not_available Get him outta the house with that gun.
not_available Chris, will you just give us a couple of minutes, OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Teri, Chris is a friend of mine 
not_available That doesn't mean anything to me.
not_available l don't know who you are.
not_available l don't know who he is.
not_available l don't want any guns.
not_available OK.
not_available l'll tell him to stay outside.
not_available ls that OK? But we need him here, just in case.
not_available Teri, your husband could have been the one who roughed you up.
not_available l want you safe.
not_available Teri, look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available l'm your friend.
not_available You trust me.
not_available You told me so yourself.
not_available So you're gonna have to trust my judgment.
not_available OK.
not_available What's going on over there? 
not_available The wife is here.
not_available The daughter? 
not_available No.
not_available What are you waiting for? 
not_available There's a little interference.
not_available But it'll pass soon.
not_available Did you find Alexis? Not yet.
not_available Call me when it's done.
not_available Yes.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen of the press, if you will please take your seats now.
not_available Senator Palmer is just about here.
not_available We will begin.
not_available Senator Palmer? Last night l received a phone call regarding my son, Keith, and my daughter, Nicole.
not_available That call has unfortunately set off a chain of events that has culminated in a tragedy.
not_available Whether or not what l have to say jeopardises my campaign is for the voters to decide.
not_available l'm doing this for my family.
not_available A large portion of the financial support for my campaign comes from a group of businessmen right here in Los Angeles.
not_available Every presidential campaign relies on 
not_available l'll take care of it.
not_available Too late, Carl.
not_available l have apparently misjudged these local businessmen.
not_available More importantly, they have misjudged me.
not_available How it was acquired, l am not at liberty to say.
not_available l have already handed this incriminating tape over to the Justice Department.
not_available Whether or not it's admissible in court, it will still implicate the men who have been supporting my campaign.
not_available l'll emphasise again that these men acted without my consent or my knowledge.
not_available As for my son, Keith, he is prepared to turn himself in and face any consequences a grandjury deems necessary.
not_available He is my son, and l love him.
not_available And l will stand by him.
not_available l am confident that when presented with the facts it will be clear that there was no criminal intent or wrong doing.
not_available He will only be guilty of not reporting an accident.
not_available As for my daughter, Nicole, it is important for everyone to remember she was the victim of a horrible crime.
not_available A physical and psychological crime.
not_available She is not a source of information.
not_available This is about the cover
not_available up of an accidental death.
not_available This is not about rape.
not_available So l'm asking you now, as a father, please find your humanity and spare Nicole the indignity of having to relive this nightmare.
not_available We lost track of both of 'em.
not_available How long have you known this? Does Jack know about this? 
not_available Nina.
not_available Nina! 
not_available Not that l'm aware of.
not_available Did you know the safe house was hit? Relax, OK? Tony, answer me! 
not_available Yes, l knew.
not_available Why didn't you tell me?! Look, Mason didn't want you to know cos he didn't want you to tell Jack.
not_available His family is missing! He should know that.
not_available Yeah, l'm with you on this.
not_available Look, Mason gave the order, all right? He's deployed resources.
not_available He's called locals to help find 'em.
not_available You should have told me.
not_available You work for me.
not_available And you work for Mason.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available l should never have left Teri and Kim.
not_available Nina, you're not a field agent, all right? What could you have done? Jack needs to know about this.
not_available Mason.
not_available Have you told Jack about his family yet? 
not_available No, we're not there yet.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available You have to tell him.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Let him know so he can help us find them.
not_available They're exposed.
not_available lf Drazen's people find them first 
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available Listen to me, George.
not_available lf anything happens to them he's gonna hold you responsible.
not_available Think about that.
not_available l will.
not_available OK, let me know if you have any progress.
not_available George! Nina Jack, my battery just died.
not_available Can l use your phone for a sec? Yeah, sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah, it's me.
not_available No, all l wanna say is keep the backup units on stand
not_available by, all right? The cellular customer you are trying to reach is unavailable.
not_available OK.
not_available l got a signal.
not_available What'd Nina have to say? 
not_available She's just checking our location.
not_available What does GPS say? lt doesn't make sense.
not_available lt's saying the address is right up ahead.
not_available l know the whole thing was hush
not_available hush, but who was Victor Drazen? Drazen was Milosevic's shadow.
not_available He was in charge of all of his covert operations.
not_available He was responsible for organising the ethnic cleansing campaigns in Kosovo, Sarajevo and Bosnia.
not_available Your unit took him out? 
not_available That's right.
not_available You rolled the whole deal up? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So who'd have the kind of influence to run an operation like this against you and Palmer? My guess would be Serbian military exiles.
not_available They could pull this off.
not_available Alexis and Andre pulled together a cell without us knowing.
not_available lt's a hell of a cell to be able to infiltrate the CTU, turn Jamey.
not_available l agree.
not_available lt's hard to believe Jamey could work against us without some kind of umbrella.
not_available Any ideas why the Serbs would wanna spend this much money to turn the power off in the middle of the woods? No.
not_available George, look.
not_available A power transformer.
not_available The lock on it's new.
not_available Why would this be designated as a wildlife sanctuary? Think about it.
not_available There's no water.
not_available No water, no wetlands.
not_available No wetlands, no birds, no animals No nothing, as far as l can make out.
not_available Here they are, man.
not_available Let's get ready.
not_available Right on time.
not_available l like that.
not_available Who the hell's this? 
not_available Just some friends of mine.
not_available lt's cool.
not_available How you know Frankie? l'm a friend of Rick's.
not_available Who's Rick? 
not_available l am.
not_available Ah.
not_available And what happened to you? We gonna play twenty questions or do business? l just wanna know who's in the room.
not_available You got a problem with that? No, man.
not_available Knock yourself out.
not_available Get a medical history, take a urine sample for all l care.
not_available Let's just get on with it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Got the cash, Frankie? 
not_available l got what you need.
not_available Let's see the E first.
not_available OK.
not_available Pure MDMA.
not_available No caffeine.
not_available Wanna check it? No, man.
not_available l trust you.
not_available All right, homey.
not_available Where's the money? Did you hear that? This guy called me ''homey''.
not_available l got your money.
not_available lt's right here.
not_available Stand down! Come on, homey.
not_available Stand down or you're eating one.
not_available You pull that trigger, you're going down too.
not_available Let's just do 'em! Let's do 'em.
not_available All right.
not_available Everybody chill out, man.
not_available lt's all cool.
not_available We're gonna put the guns down.
not_available On the ground.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available lt's going down.
not_available Let's go.
not_available See what else they got on 'em.
not_available Get down.
not_available All this cos you couldn't keep my brother alive.
not_available They might not have registered with their real names.
not_available No, just use the description that we sent you, OK? You checking the hospitals? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l don't understand how Teri and Kim just disappeared.
not_available Well, it might be a good thing.
not_available lf Drazen's people had them, we'd have heard about it.
not_available After all, Jack and Palmer are the primary targets.
not_available What about Jack's house? 
not_available l sent Williams over, but l'll check on him.
not_available And Kim's phone call? 
not_available A phone booth.
not_available We're checking the area.
not_available Look, Nina, we're doing everything we can, right? Are you? What you gonna do now, man? Kill us? Yeah.
not_available l'll kill you if l ever see you again.
not_available You should get that stitched, man.
not_available How's that for a nose job? 
not_available Pretty good.
not_available l like it.
not_available Hey, Frankie? 
not_available What's that, homey? Speak up.
not_available You have the right to remain silent.
not_available Everybody freeze! 
not_available Arrest all of 'em.
not_available Please, don't do this.
not_available We didn't do anything.
not_available We're not a part of this! 
not_available Arms up! Up against the wall.
not_available Let me have your Handie.
not_available This is Krugman.
not_available We got a code four.
not_available One suspect down, five being booked.
not_available l think l got a broken nose.
not_available Look, l'll say it again.
not_available l bear full responsibility for not knowing about it.
not_available A senator's duty, a president's duty, an elected representative's duty, is not only to his country but also to his family.
not_available lf he cannot manage the interactions of the people close to him, then he can't expect the electorate to believe in his abilities to lead a nation.
not_available l don't deny l made a mistake.
not_available A serious one.
not_available l only ask you to consider that l am not the first person in public office to make one.
not_available Thank you.
not_available l love you, Dad.
not_available l love you, son.
not_available This is Emily.
not_available She's eleven.
not_available And this is Jennifer.
not_available She just turned nine.
not_available And l didn't meet them? 
not_available No.
not_available We decided to leave everyone outside of it until you were sure what you wanted.
not_available l'll get it.
not_available She made this for me.
not_available You want milk or sugar in it? Yeah.
not_available Phil, l think l'm remembering something.
not_available Really? l'll be right there.
not_available Rest room? 
not_available Right down the hall.
not_available Teri! Where's the girl? Your daughter.
not_available Where is she? l l don't know! Tell me where she is and l'll make this painless for both of you, l promise.
