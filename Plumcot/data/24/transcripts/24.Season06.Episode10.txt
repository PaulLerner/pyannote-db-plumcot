
not_available I'd like you to appear on television and appeal to members of Islamic communities.
not_available Your cabinet feels you're making a tragic mistake.
not_available The man has murdered countless innocents and you are putting your hopes for this country's safety on him.
not_available They will come after you.
not_available I assure you of that.
not_available We're talking about removing the president.
not_available We are in a national crisis and he is in over his head.
not_available He's brought this on himself.
not_available I need his itinerary, specifically in regards to Assad's televised address.
not_available Why? 
not_available The less you know, the better.
not_available Because of me, Fayed has a device that can arm all the suitcase nukes he wants.
not_available Don't blame yourself.
not_available When the next bomb goes off and thousands of more people die, everybody will remember I made it possible.
not_available CTU found me.
not_available I needed to preoccupy them with a bomb to enable my escape.
not_available The delivery system software was programmed for five detonations at five high
not_available priority targets.
not_available Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three.
not_available More than enough for our needs, Gredenko.
not_available Our country lost the Cold War because it was afraid to use these weapons against the Americans.
not_available Today we will correct that mistake.
not_available And the Arabs will take all the blame.
not_available Marilyn, it is vital that we find Gredenko.
not_available If we retrace the route you took that night, do you think you'd recognise the house? Maybe.
not_available What's goin' on with you and Jack? He's looking for someone.
not_available He thinks I can help.
not_available You mean Gredenko? What do you know about him? I followed Graem to a house one night.
not_available He met with some Russians.
not_available Jack wants to take me over there to see if it can jog my memory.
not_available You won't take Jack where Graem met the Russians but to a different address.
not_available Now, you do this for me, and I promise you you will see Josh again.
not_available If you don't, he dies.
not_available Marilyn, is any of this familiar? Yes.
not_available That's it 
not_available the blue house on the right.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go, go! Bomb! Everyone out! Come on, come on.
not_available Move.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Don't stop! Buchanan.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available What do you got? We've been ambushed.
not_available The house that Marilyn led us to was wired with explosives.
not_available Half my team is down.
not_available Send paramedics to 9407 Hindry Place.
not_available They knew we were coming.
not_available Gredenko? I think so.
not_available I'm trying to find Milo and Marilyn.
not_available I think they're being pursued by hostiles.
not_available I'll have a team there.
not_available I'll monitor local bandwidth.
not_available Bill, hurry.
not_available We need to find them.
not_available This way.
not_available This way, come on.
not_available Marilyn? I can't 
not_available We gotta keep moving.
not_available Move, move.
not_available I can't.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, this way.
not_available Over there.
not_available The other way.
not_available within miles of ground zero.
not_available Survivors are being treated at local hospitals and at makeshift medical facilities.
not_available Local authorities continue to urge people to stay in their homes until further notice 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We took out the CTU team.
not_available So is my son dead? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Right, well.
not_available Had to be done.
not_available Do you have Marilyn? 
not_available No, sir, not yet.
not_available Why not yet? She escaped with someone.
not_available We're tracking them now.
not_available Dammit.
not_available We'll find her soon, sir.
not_available The man she's with doesn't look like a trained field agent.
not_available Make sure you take her alive.
not_available I need her to find Gredenko so I can end this mess.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'll call you as soon as I have her.
not_available Ed.
not_available They know we're here.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Marilyn, listen to me.
not_available I'm gonna cover you.
not_available When I do, head back towards the alley.
not_available Run as fast and as far away from here as you can.
not_available You understand me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Targets are right behind us, behind those dumpsters.
not_available Remember, we need to take that woman alive.
not_available Just wait.
not_available Wait till I tell you.
not_available Go! Let's go, let's go.
not_available I told you to go! I couldn't! Oh! 
not_available Let's go.
not_available Wait, wait! Kill him.
not_available Drop your weapon! Let her go! 
not_available Drop your weapon or I'll kill her.
not_available If you wanted to kill her, she'd be dead by now.
not_available Drop your weapon or I will use mine.
not_available Do it! On your knees! Hands on your head, interlace your fingers.
not_available Turn around and face the fence.
not_available Milo, let me see it.
not_available There's no arterial bleeding.
not_available You'll be OK.
not_available CTU will be here in a minute.
not_available Take this gun, make sure he doesn't move.
not_available That call you took was from Gredenko.
not_available You tipped him off.
not_available Over half my team is dead! You don't understand! 
not_available What, that Gredenko knew we were coming? It wasn't Gredenko on the phone.
not_available Those aren't his men.
not_available If they weren't Gredenko's men, whose were they? Who sent them?! Your father.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available It's true, Jack, I swear.
not_available Your father called me in the car.
not_available My father? He told me to lead you to that house.
not_available He said if I didn't, he'd He said that he killed Graem and that if he had to, he would kill Josh.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He has my son! Marilyn.
not_available Do you have the address to Gredenko's safe house? Yes.
not_available I need you to give it to me now.
not_available I can't.
not_available Not till I have my son.
not_available I will help you get Josh back, but I need that address now.
not_available Gredenko is our only chance of recovering the nuclear weapons.
not_available You saw what happened in Valencia earlier today? This is going to be worse.
not_available Please, just give me the address.
not_available I recognised the house as we were driving.
not_available It's on Glasgow 
not_available 9421.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available I've got the correct address for Gredenko's safe house 
not_available 9421 Glasgow.
not_available Turner's team will be there.
not_available Run point.
not_available I want you to send me a smaller team to my location.
not_available I'm at an industrial park on Pine, just south of Oxford.
not_available Have the team bring me a vehicle with a full tactical kit.
not_available They have to transfer Milo to CTU.
not_available He's shot.
not_available It's not critical.
not_available Divert the rest of the team to the address on Glasgow to initiate attack.
not_available Get back to me when you've got Gredenko.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I'll explain later.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available Bill, please.
not_available Just trust me.
not_available This is personal.
not_available Jack! How could I have been so stupid? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you finish the vectors? 
not_available No.
not_available If you're having trouble, I can help you.
not_available I'm just not finished.
not_available And I don't want this to turn into another conversation about whether or not I'm OK.
not_available I'm sorry, love.
not_available If you can't talk to me, talk to a staff psychologist or your sponsor.
not_available I don't need them.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available We just heard from Jack.
not_available Marilyn Bauer is safe.
not_available She gave us Gredenko's location.
not_available Milo was shot but he's gonna be OK.
not_available What happened? He held off three armed hostiles till Jack got there.
not_available He's up for a commendation.
not_available Debrief him when Medical gives you the OK.
not_available I will.
not_available Thanks for rubbing that salt in the wounds.
not_available What? 
not_available The nukes are armed cos I'm a coward.
not_available And now you want me to listen to Milo talk about what a bloody hero he is.
not_available Coincidence? 
not_available It'll be taken care of.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Taken care of.
not_available We're coordinating the Gredenko operation.
not_available TAC teams are moving in on his location.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available I pushed you to work too soon.
not_available Someone from District will relieve you.
not_available They'll just make me feel worse.
not_available I need a few minutes.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available I'm gonna take a walk.
not_available I'll cover for you.
not_available Be back before we launch.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available We need to make the call.
not_available "Scramble caller" has to be enabled.
not_available Give us a second.
not_available Does he know where Phillip has Josh? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll have to force my father's hand.
not_available Meaning what? He'll call my father and tell him he's apprehended you, but you won't give him Gredenko's location until he takes you to see your son.
not_available What if Phillip refuses? You have to stay firm.
not_available Say it's not a negotiation, no matter what he threatens.
not_available Jack, you're asking me to put Josh's life at risk.
not_available Josh's life is at risk.
not_available My father won't give away his location unless he thinks he has to.
not_available Is that what this is about, finding Phillip? Josh is secondary? My father will have Josh with him.
not_available Marilyn, I will do everything in my power to make sure your son is safe.
not_available How do you know he won't betray us? He wants to live.
not_available Let's go.
not_available As biohazard and hazmat units make their way to the hot zone You don't want to watch this.
not_available You know, Josh.
not_available Your father was very proud of you.
not_available He'd tell me how blessed he felt knowing everything he was working so hard to build would be left in such good hands.
not_available Do we have to talk about this now, Grandpa? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available He loved you very much.
not_available Remember, I'll be able to hear both sides of this conversation.
not_available You're set, dial.
not_available Do you have her? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available But we took casualties.
not_available I'm on my own now.
not_available You're getting a team to take out Gredenko? 
not_available Yeah, I am.
not_available She won't say where Gredenko is until she sees her son.
not_available Put her on.
not_available I did what you asked.
not_available Now, where's Josh? 
not_available Marilyn, look.
not_available I know you're frightened.
not_available This doesn't have to end badly.
not_available If you help me find Gredenko, we can all survive this as a family.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available I just want my son! I'm just saying, you made your deal with Graem, now make a deal with me.
not_available With enough time, you and I and Josh can rebuild whatever is left of this family.
not_available After all, the legacy I'm trying to preserve will someday be his.
not_available We can do this.
not_available But first you have to tell me where Gredenko is.
not_available Only after this man takes me to see my son.
not_available That will only complicate things.
not_available I need Gredenko now.
not_available Tell me where he is.
not_available No.
not_available You may have misunderstood my offer as a sign of weakness, so let me make it clear.
not_available If you do not help me, I see no future for you or Josh.
not_available I will walk into the next room and I will kill him.
not_available Right now.
not_available Tell me or Josh dies.
not_available I will not tell you what you want to know until I have my son! Give him back the phone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bring her here to me at the Grandmont Hotel, room 2132.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available We got the address.
not_available You did great.
not_available Cuff him, put him in the back.
not_available Josh? 
not_available Uh I'll go downstairs to get a soda.
not_available You want anything? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Did you look in the mini bar? 
not_available Uh There wasn't anything that I wanted.
not_available Why don't you call room service? Well, I just feel like getting out.
not_available Josh.
not_available Don't even think about it.
not_available No one's life is worth the destruction of everything I've built.
not_available Now, step away from the door.
not_available I was beginning to worry.
not_available The meeting went long.
not_available Here is the president's itinerary.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available This will work.
not_available So when does all this happen? 
not_available Now.
not_available Authorise clearance for someone to get inside the bunker.
not_available Once he's in, he'll carry the ball.
not_available Carry the ball? You mean kill the president.
not_available I like to think we're beyond doubting ourselves.
not_available This president has endangered the lives of millions.
not_available You do not need to tell me what the stakes are here.
not_available So who are we putting inside? 
not_available A security specialist, private sector.
not_available I requested that he advise my group on several response options.
not_available He has level
not_available two clearance.
not_available Upgrade him.
not_available They will trace this thing right back to me.
not_available No, you won't even be investigated.
not_available We have a cover.
not_available A cover? Who? 
not_available Assad.
not_available You're trying to make it look like he did this? Just call in your authorisation code.
not_available That's all the information you need.
not_available Yeah, Dan? 
not_available The president's asked to see you.
not_available OK, tell the president I will be with him in a moment.
not_available Sir, our man will be here within the hour.
not_available Call me when you're done with the president.
not_available Oh, Tom, come in.
not_available You asked to see me? 
not_available I'd like to hear your thoughts on something.
not_available My thoughts? On what, sir? 
not_available Assad's speech.
not_available He's going live in less than an hour.
not_available Before I give him my thoughts, I wanted yours.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available It's just 
not_available What? I assumed you were no longer interested in my opinions.
not_available Tom, I still value yourjudgment.
not_available And if I've made you feel otherwise, I apologise.
not_available All right, sir.
not_available How much longer? I'm not sure.
not_available I have to recalculate the profile for two of the target cities.
not_available Hurry.
not_available I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary.
not_available You think the authorities know we're working with Fayed? If they don't, they will soon.
not_available I was in my kitchen when I saw the flash.
not_available I turned to look out my window and it just exploded.
not_available All the windows.
not_available There was glass everywhere.
not_available And then there was this sound.
not_available It was so loud.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Hell of a day, huh? 
not_available Yeah, you could say that.
not_available Can I get you anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Whiskey, pint, single malt.
not_available What kind? 
not_available That kind.
not_available This? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And these.
not_available OK.
not_available Wait, your change? 
not_available Keep it.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available From where? I told you, I went out for a walk.
not_available The TAC team is about to move in on Gredenko.
not_available I need you at your station.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Morris Come with me.
not_available I want you to put this on under your clothes.
not_available It's just a precaution.
not_available My hands are shaking.
not_available Here.
not_available I'm gonna do everything I can to get him back.
not_available He's the only reason I stayed with Graem.
not_available He's the only good thing I have left since.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get out.
not_available You do exactly what I tell you, you understand me? Let's go.
not_available Agent Pressman, I just want to make sure you understand that you need to not exert too much pressure 
not_available Hey, Milo.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available They say I'm gonna be OK.
not_available It's So, what happened? I was stupid.
not_available They don't pay me to be a field agent.
not_available Maybe they should.
not_available You protected Marilyn Bauer.
not_available That's what I heard.
not_available I had no idea what I was doing.
not_available The thing just happened so fast.
not_available You don't have to downplay it to make me feel better.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available OK.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available You OK? Yeah.
not_available Well done.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We'll push Assad to make these changes.
not_available Your suggestions are all excellent, Tom.
not_available Just doing my job.
not_available I'd like you to be there when he delivers this.
not_available I will be.
not_available Excuse me, I have a briefing with Senator Benson.
not_available Of course, Tom.
not_available Melinda, I have notes that need to be taken to Assad.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available What did he want? 
not_available He asked me to review Assad's speech.
not_available He'll never get the chance to deliver it.
not_available You need to authorise that clearance.
not_available Our man will be here any minute.
not_available It's in the works.
not_available It's just taking a while.
not_available We need it before he's here.
not_available I will call Security again.
not_available I'll call if there's a problem.
not_available Go meet with him.
not_available All right.
not_available Operations.
not_available I need to speak to the ranking Secret Service agent on site.
not_available Yes.
not_available Agent Hollister.
not_available This is Tom Lennox.
not_available I need to see you immediately.
not_available I can meet you as soon as I get someone to man my position in about 15 minutes.
not_available I've got something to show you.
not_available Where are you right now? 
not_available B wing, room 17.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Carson wondered if you were playing us.
not_available He didn't want to bring you into this.
not_available But I said that we could trust you.
not_available I told him that you understood! 
not_available Nothing justifies killing the president.
not_available This president is giving us no choice.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available It's already done.
not_available Operations.
not_available This is Reed Pollock.
not_available I have a message for Agent Hollister from Mr Lennox.
not_available Tell him the issue has been resolved and that Mr Lennox won't need to meet with him.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available We confirmed the intel.
not_available The Glasgow house is owned by a Russian shell corporation that Gredenko has an interest in.
not_available Is Turner's team in place? 
not_available They'll say when they're ready.
not_available Chloe, lock the satellite and establish a comm link.
not_available Nadia.
not_available I told you not to take too long.
not_available Sorry.
not_available The backup module needs to be reset.
not_available Do it.
not_available The operation starts in two minutes.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Do you realise what a betrayal this is? I was a little late.
not_available Morris, I can smell it on your breath.
not_available Yes, I took a drink.
not_available But I spat it out straight away.
not_available Please.
not_available I swear.
not_available Chloe, look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I am stone
not_available cold sober.
not_available You're losing control.
not_available You're placing other people's lives in danger.
not_available I'm gonna have to tell Buchanan.
not_available After everything that has happened.
not_available Something had to give.
not_available The important thing is that I realised I didn't want to throw everything away.
not_available Especially you, especially you.
not_available And I stopped myself and that is a little victory.
not_available Right? I swear it will never happen again.
not_available Don't tell Buchanan because you're right.
not_available Me getting back to work is the best medicine.
not_available I'll be watching you for the rest of the shift.
not_available Fine.
not_available Call your sponsor.
not_available I will.
not_available Terrorist team is taking final positions.
not_available Chloe, open the video link.
not_available Hal, what's your status? No sign of a lookout.
not_available Windows are covered but we're good to go.
not_available Commence at your discretion.
not_available Ryan, is your team ready? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available OK, we're going in on three, two, one.
not_available Cover, cover.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available First sweep all clear, sir.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Mr Buchanan, there's no sign of Gredenko or anyone.
not_available Hal, when you complete the sweep, process for evidence.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chloe, text Jack's cellphone and tell him we don't have Gredenko.
not_available Open it.
not_available Hold up here.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available It's nothing.
not_available Don't think about warning my father.
not_available Once he sees you brought me here, he's more likely to shoot you than I am.
not_available Understand? Both of you go up to the door.
not_available You knock.
not_available When he lets you in, I'll follow.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Marilyn, get back.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Now, go.
not_available Where the hell is my father? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I swear.
not_available Where's Josh? 
not_available Marilyn, just stay calm.
not_available Put these on.
not_available Answer.
not_available Put it on speaker.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hello, Marilyn.
not_available Jack, even when you were young I learned not to underestimate you.
not_available I didn't want to hurt Josh.
not_available You forced my hand.
not_available Take a look out the window, the adjacent roof.
not_available Oh, Phillip, please don't! Dad, you only have one play left here 
not_available that's to try and cut a deal with the government.
not_available Explain your connection to the nuke and that you'll help in exchange for immunity.
not_available That is your only option.
not_available You pull that trigger and that option is gone.
not_available Understand? I'm no fool, Jack.
not_available They're never gonna give me immunity after everything I've done.
not_available You don't know that for sure! Right now, they are desperate.
not_available But either way, for you, this is over.
not_available Dad, it's over! There is no empire to protect, there's no legacy left.
not_available There is Marilyn, Josh and me.
not_available That's it.
not_available Please, Dad.
not_available I know you don't want to hurt Josh.
not_available I'm the one you want.
not_available You let Josh go, I will surrender.
not_available Come alone, unarmed, and I'll let Josh go.
not_available But if you bring anyone else into this, I will kill him.
not_available I understand.
not_available Hang up the phone.
not_available Field Ops.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Send a team to the Grandmont Hotel to pick up a hostile.
not_available He's secured.
not_available He's in room 2132.
not_available Right away.
not_available Jack.
not_available This is our only chance.
not_available Hey, I need to talk to you.
not_available About what? 
not_available Morris.
not_available Not here.
not_available He came and saw me in the infirmary 
not_available I know he's been a little shaky.
not_available Has he been drinking? You smelled it on his breath? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I did too.
not_available We talked.
not_available He didn't metabolise the alcohol.
not_available "He didn't metabolise the alcohol"? It sounds weird, but it's true.
not_available He spit it out.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available Cos he told me.
not_available And you believe him? 
not_available We were married.
not_available If he was drunk, I'd know.
not_available He's not drunk.
not_available He's been sober for three years.
not_available I didn't know he was an alcoholic.
not_available Now you know.
not_available You don't think Buchanan should know? 
not_available No.
not_available If he slips up again, I will personally tell Buchanan.
not_available Let's just leave it for now.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, I want you to wait here for Josh.
not_available Do you think your father will keep his word? If I keep mine.
not_available You know how to use this? 
not_available No.
not_available Point, hit, shoot.
not_available Do you want me to call CTU and tell them to send help? No.
not_available I need to take care of this myself.
not_available Jack thank you.
not_available Everything is gonna be all right.
not_available Just wait here.
not_available I'm unarmed! Dad? I'm unarmed.
not_available Come out.
not_available I am unarmed! 
not_available That's close enough.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Now show me that you're not wearing an ankle holster.
not_available Take one step toward me for every step Josh takes away.
not_available Josh.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Your mother is waiting in the stairwell.
not_available Go! Go! That's it.
not_available Oh, Josh! Oh, God! Are you OK? Are you OK? Let's go.
not_available Go! I never meant for this to happen, Jack.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available I don't know how, but Gredenko found out about my role in Palmer's assassination.
not_available So he blackmailed me.
not_available Forced me to cooperate.
not_available So Gredenko had you divert the bombs your company was responsible for destroying? He's a radical nationalist.
not_available Told me that he wanted to preserve arsenal for the day when the Soviet Union would be re
not_available established.
not_available I believed him because I had to.
not_available When did you know he sold them to Fayed? 
not_available When the bomb was detonated in Valencia.
not_available That's the truth? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I've been looking for Gredenko ever since so that I could find out what he knew about Fayed and stop this.
