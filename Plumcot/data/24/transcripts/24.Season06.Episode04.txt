
not_available Curtis! Everyone back! The hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able to recover the most recently accessed file.
not_available Some kind of wiring schematic.
not_available How much of the file do we have? About a page and a half.
not_available Mostly in Arabic, some of it Russian.
not_available Do you know what this is? This is a list of electronic components for a nuclear device.
not_available Hello.
not_available You have the package? 
not_available Not yet, but I'll have it soon.
not_available Call me when you have it.
not_available I don't wanna hurt you, but I will unless you do exactly what I say.
not_available There's a package in there.
not_available I'm supposed to take it to a man who has an item for me.
not_available When you pick up the item, you'll call me and I'll give you further instructions.
not_available There it is.
not_available Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.
not_available I deleted those files.
not_available It wasn't right to arrest you for my actions.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available Let him alone! 
not_available Sir, get back in line.
not_available Not until you let go of that man.
not_available Mr President.
not_available What do you want? You are holding 110 so
not_available called enemy combatants at your Palmdale military facility.
not_available Have these freedom fighters on a nonmilitary aircraft in the air by the end of the hour.
not_available If you don't release them by the deadline, the consequences will be devastating.
not_available Jack, a nuclear device has been diverted to a scientist with known terrorist ties.
not_available Pulling up the file now.
not_available Do you recognise him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I saw him with Fayed a year ago.
not_available His name is Hasan Numair.
not_available We need to know where this man is now.
not_available He's one of the terrorists being released from Palmdale military prison.
not_available Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now.
not_available Sergeant, Numair is not on the plane.
not_available Repeat, Numair is not on the plane.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Fayed is waiting for you.
not_available His escape was planned in advance.
not_available I agree.
not_available Fayed's demand for the prisoners was a ploy.
not_available He never intended for us to fly Numair out.
not_available He wanted him free inside our borders.
not_available That's right.
not_available Do we know where along the route Numair escaped? After the highway.
not_available He must've had inside help.
not_available Is there anyone unaccounted for? 
not_available A sergeant is missing.
not_available We're looking for him now.
not_available I'll call you when I have more information.
not_available Chloe, what about satellite? 
not_available We have coverage, but it's not continuous.
not_available There are two tunnels and three locations where coverage is partial.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Numair is a known terrorist with possible access to suitcase nukes and he escapes in broad daylight.
not_available We have to do better than we're doing and we have to do it faster! What else do we know about Numair? 
not_available He's a nuclear engineer trained in Germany.
not_available Ran a weapons programme in Frankfurt.
not_available Eight years ago he moved to the Middle East.
not_available Is his training relevant to existing systems? He knows it all and he's up to date.
not_available If he gets his hands on the nuke, he can prep it on site.
not_available I want this at the top of our list.
not_available Capturing Numair is our number
not_available one priority.
not_available We won't be able to set up satellite parameters.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Partition the grid.
not_available Send half to me and half to Morris.
not_available Morris? 
not_available Just do it.
not_available Morris.
not_available We haven't seen a thing.
not_available We're monitoring.
not_available As soon as I have anything new, I will share it with you.
not_available As soon as you do? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What are you working on? Setting up image processing in the area where Numair escaped.
not_available Dobbins can do it.
not_available I need you.
not_available Now's not the time to pull rank.
not_available Chloe's assigned me a task.
not_available Please find somebody else.
not_available OK.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What's Morris doing for you? What are you talking about? 
not_available He said he's on task for you, but I need help.
not_available He's not doing anything for me.
not_available Is this ajoke?! 
not_available You're upset.
not_available Our alert level's high and you're playing games.
not_available If you can't work with me, then you quit! The files are on your system.
not_available Filter them now.
not_available I will.
not_available We assume there is a rogue nuclear weapon on American soil, or there will be soon.
not_available All agencies are to proceed under that assumption.
not_available What are we dealing with, Karen? 
not_available Suitcase nukes.
not_available The term refers to a number of devices manufactured by the former Soviet Union.
not_available Small enough for one individual to carry and they have a yield of one kiloton or less.
not_available Potential damage? The kill radius is about a half
not_available mile.
not_available The radiation greatly extends that radius, depending on winds and weather conditions.
not_available Let's just arrive at the point.
not_available How many casualties are we talking about? That depends on the population density.
not_available In a crowded city, many thousands would die instantly.
not_available Taking the radiation into account, the number of deaths and serious injuries would multiply into the hundreds of thousands.
not_available Get me Jack Bauer immediately.
not_available There's nothing here.
not_available We're wasting time.
not_available You keep saying "we".
not_available There's you and there's us.
not_available There is no "we".
not_available Give it a minute.
not_available Anything that isn't incinerated could give us prints or trace DNA.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Hold for the president.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Sir, Jack Bauer's on the line.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Jack.
not_available We're in the process of verifying what Assad told you about his peace initiative.
not_available Good.
not_available So far, everything he's told us has been true.
not_available He's given us no reason to doubt him.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available I also want you to take charge of the search for Fayed and Numair.
not_available Mr President, I 
not_available After the way the country treated you, I Well after the way that I treated you, I know I don't have any right to ask you anything.
not_available But you're on top of the situation and I want to make it official.
not_available Mr President, the truth is, I don't think I'm up to it.
not_available We are behind the curve, but if it weren't for your efforts today, we'd be nowhere.
not_available I need you to lead this search.
not_available Then I'll do my best, sir.
not_available Report to Bill Buchanan at CTU.
not_available Call me anytime you think necessary.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The president wants me to run the search for Fayed and Numair.
not_available I can't do this without your help.
not_available I need you to accept Assad as part of this investigation.
not_available He knows these people.
not_available He will see things you and I would miss.
not_available He knows them because he's one of them.
not_available Trust me.
not_available We need his help.
not_available I can't believe I'm hearing this.
not_available Time was you would've seen through this guy in a minute.
not_available What did the Chinese do to you? Is there something you need to tell me? 
not_available Like what? Is there some kind of a history between you and Assad? Jack.
not_available They found this.
not_available What is it? It's a PDA damaged in the blast.
not_available The message is still readable.
not_available What does it say? 
not_available "Visitor arrived on Thursday.
not_available " "Visitor" couldn't be Numair.
not_available He was still in custody then.
not_available "Visitor" is a codeword within the cell.
not_available It refers to "weapon".
not_available The suitcase nuke.
not_available Fayed must've received it last Thursday.
not_available If they had the weapon then, why get Numair out of prison now? He must be key to making it operational.
not_available Get everything packed up.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Move.
not_available Nothing is more important than finding Fayed and Numair.
not_available You understand me? Yeah.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available I need you to do something.
not_available I want you to run a crosscheck on Curtis Manning and Assad.
not_available Is this important? I've got a lot on.
not_available Curtis has a problem with Assad.
not_available It's personal.
not_available I need to get them to work together.
not_available I'll get it as soon as I can.
not_available Numair is here.
not_available My brother.
not_available Fayed.
not_available I was starting to worry.
not_available Yes.
not_available The escape went as planned, but I had to be careful crossing the city.
not_available Where is it? This was the last model the Soviets produced.
not_available Where are the tools? You're missing what I need to reprogram.
not_available The device will be here soon.
not_available By what means? A young man named Ahmed.
not_available A recent recruit, but reliable.
not_available Ahmed, we have known you and your family so long.
not_available I can't believe you want to do this.
not_available It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
not_available I am a soldier.
not_available You said your father knows nothing of this.
not_available When he finds out, will he be proud? Yes? 
not_available I have what you want.
not_available Good.
not_available Now you're going to deliver it to a man named Fayed.
not_available No.
not_available What? I won't deliver it until you let my family go.
not_available Ray, do what I say or I will shoot them.
not_available Then I will destroy it and the people you work for will be disappointed.
not_available Listen to me 
not_available You listen to me.
not_available I just killed a man for this and I'm not gonna deliver it anywhere until my family are safe.
not_available I'll release one of them.
not_available Both.
not_available If I do that, I have no leverage and you know it.
not_available Decide now.
not_available Which one do I release? 
not_available My son.
not_available Release my son.
not_available I will release your wife.
not_available I just told you to release my son.
not_available You told me who you value most! Your wife will call you when she's clear.
not_available Deliver the component and I will release your son.
not_available That's it, Ray.
not_available Don't push your luck.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, let her go.
not_available Get in the car and drive.
not_available Then call Ray and tell him you're all right.
not_available This is the number that he called from.
not_available Will you remember this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Tell him to call when you're through.
not_available And understand that if I see any police, I will shoot Scott.
not_available Do you understand? I love you! Go! 
not_available Jillian.
not_available Ray.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What about Scott? 
not_available He's still with Ahmed.
not_available He says if we go to the police, he'll kill Scott, but do you think even if we do what he says He'll still kill Scott when this is over? I don't know, but we cannot take the chance.
not_available We have to handle it ourselves.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Look, I'm gonna deliver the package.
not_available He already let you go, so we have to tell ourselves he's got no reason to kill Scott.
not_available Look, I'm gonna call Ahmed back.
not_available Do not call the police.
not_available OK.
not_available Honey, I love you.
not_available I love you.
not_available Hello.
not_available Ahmed, I heard from Jillian.
not_available Good.
not_available Take the package to 351 Old Mill Road, Valencia.
not_available Do you know where that is? 
not_available 351 I can find it.
not_available I will call Fayed and tell him to expect you.
not_available Call when you get there.
not_available It should not take longer than 30 minutes.
not_available If it does I understand.
not_available I'm leaving now.
not_available 911.
not_available What is your emergency? A terrorist is holding my son hostage.
not_available I need to speak to the police.
not_available Dammit, I didn't want this tabbed.
not_available I wanted it in tables.
not_available I work much faster with tabs.
not_available I thought that is what you'd want.
not_available You're just being a pain in the ass.
not_available Nobody speaks to me like this.
not_available I just did.
not_available Get back to work.
not_available This has got to stop.
not_available Everyone is extremely busy and you two are distracting everyone.
not_available Explain how to get him to follow directions.
not_available That's what you call this power trip? OK, excuse me.
not_available We all know what this is about.
not_available Milo, you and I dated a couple of times before Morris and I got back together.
not_available We saw a couple of good movies, but we agreed it wasn't really happening.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you.
not_available So I dated Milo a couple of times, but I chose you.
not_available Get over it and stop trying to beat him up.
not_available You think this is about my insecurities? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Isn't it? No.
not_available OK, fine! If you want it in table format, you'll get it in table format.
not_available Let's just stop this mad terrorist guy before he detonates a nuke on Wilshire Boulevard.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sorry about that, mate.
not_available And, just for the record, there's no lingering jealousy about any films you two may have seen together.
not_available No problem.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available The police got a call from a woman claiming her son is held by terrorists.
not_available Is she credible? 
not_available I'm not sure yet.
not_available She says she was held too, but got out somehow.
not_available Is she on the line? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Jillian Wallace.
not_available Patch her through.
not_available Ms Wallace, this is Bill Buchanan.
not_available I'm transferring you to one of our men.
not_available Hello? My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Your son is being held by a terrorist? Yes, and he's forcing my husband to deliver a package.
not_available What kind of package? 
not_available I I don't know.
not_available There are other people involved.
not_available What's the name of the man with your son? 
not_available Ahmed Amar.
not_available Did he mention any other names? 
not_available Yes, one.
not_available Fayed.
not_available Ma'am, how do we reach your husband? You can't.
not_available He isn't carrying a cellphone.
not_available Do you know where he took the package? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Whatever you do, just don't let them hurt my son.
not_available We're gonna do everything we can.
not_available We'll get back to you.
not_available What do you think, Jack? 
not_available She knew Fayed's name.
not_available What location? Channing and Fifteenth, Granada Hills.
not_available Where's your nearest TAC team? 
not_available You're as close as anybody.
not_available Take your team.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Do we have a lead? 
not_available Hostage in Granada Hills.
not_available It might be connected to the bombings.
not_available Go to Fifteenth and Channing.
not_available We can't take him on a tactical mission.
not_available We might need him when we get there.
not_available All teams, proceed to Fifteenth and Channing, Granada Hills.
not_available Mr President.
not_available It's good to see you, Mr Ambassador.
not_available And you, sir.
not_available Please, sit.
not_available How do you do? 
not_available Karen Hayes.
not_available How do you do? 
not_available Tom Lennox.
not_available The events of these past few weeks are deeply distressing for all of us.
not_available If there's anything we can do to help, tell me.
not_available You can help right now by having a candid conversation with us.
not_available I'm always candid.
not_available Mr Ambassador, we've been in contact with Hamri Al
not_available Assad.
not_available He has been the driving force behind a number of terrorist attacks around the country, around the world, for the past two decades.
not_available I know who he is.
not_available Assad claims he's renounced terrorism.
not_available He says he's willing to negotiate, to use political means to gain his ends.
not_available Now, do you think he's telling the truth? 
not_available I have reason to that believe he is.
not_available How much influence does he have? Does he speak for a large number of terrorist groups? As you know, there are literally hundreds of such groups.
not_available Assad's reputation is such that many of them, not all by any means, but a substantial number, would follow his lead at least for a while.
not_available So this really could be a significant step towards peace? I sincerely hope so.
not_available Thank you, Mr Ambassador.
not_available You've been extremely helpful.
not_available You're welcome, Mr President.
not_available Mr Ambassador.
not_available So this corroborates everything Jack told us about Assad.
not_available We need to formalise our relationship with him now, lock him into cooperation.
not_available Tom? 
not_available I have a problem forming a partnership with a man who is responsible for the deaths of so many innocents.
not_available Is Assad still with Jack Bauer? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's get Jack on the phone, please.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Hold for the president.
not_available Jack.
not_available Yes, Mr President? Do we have leads on that nuclear weapon? 
not_available We're following one.
not_available It's too early to tell if it's meaningful.
not_available All right.
not_available I just had a meeting that confirms Assad is serious about negotiated peace and that he does, in fact, have the influence to make that happen.
not_available I'd like to come to an arrangement.
not_available Is he with you? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let me speak with him, please.
not_available One moment.
not_available The president wants to speak to you.
not_available Yes, Mr President? I am prepared to offer you full protection and a pardon for all crimes in the past.
not_available There are conditions, however 
not_available that you continue tracking Abu Fayed and that you pledge your commitment to a broader peace.
not_available Is that acceptable? In principle, yes.
not_available Forgive me, Mr President, but I need to see this in writing.
not_available You'll have it within the hour.
not_available Let me speak with Jack, please.
not_available Of course.
not_available Yes, sir? 
not_available This was not an easy thing to do.
not_available I do believe the greater good requires it.
not_available Do you agree? I'm glad it's a call I didn't have to make, sir.
not_available Thank you, Jack.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Your president, do you believe he is an honourable man? Yes, I do.
not_available Mr Lennox, I have Sandra Palmer calling for the president, but he's on another line.
not_available Could you transfer that call to my cellphone, please? She specifically asked to speak to the president.
not_available And do it now, please.
not_available Yes, Sandra? Tom Lennox here.
not_available I need to speak with Wayne.
not_available It's important.
not_available The president's tied up.
not_available Will you please let him know I'm on the phone? The president's asked not to be disturbed.
not_available Does this concern your friend Walid? Yes, that's exactly what it's about.
not_available He's still in custody.
not_available You continue to arrest innocent people, you're giving the terrorists what they want.
not_available The president is more concerned with the fate of the country than the fate of one man.
not_available An innocent man, jailed without charges.
not_available If you believe the fundamental principles of this country, there is nothing more important.
not_available You've got the makings of a great law
not_available review article.
not_available I will pass this message along.
not_available If you'll excuse me 
not_available Mr Lennox, pass along another message.
not_available What is that, Sandra? 
not_available I will do what it takes to protect my client.
not_available If it embarrasses the administration, so be it.
not_available Do I detect a threat here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And so is this I am holding you personally responsible for whatever happens to Walid.
not_available Next, Samir Hadad, Samir Hadad.
not_available Walid Al
not_available Rezani.
not_available Is there someplace I can get a drink of water? Brother.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for helping me earlier.
not_available No problem.
not_available Did you tell them anything? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll tell you something, brother, before this day is over, they'll all pay.
not_available What do you mean? Salim what are you doing? It's all right, he's a friend.
not_available Khamsa ziwar OK, take it easy.
not_available I I got a package from Ahmed, OK? Ahmed.
not_available Fayed.
not_available Who is this? 
not_available He says Ahmed sent him.
not_available Your name? 
not_available Ray Wallace.
not_available Ahmed should've called you.
not_available You have to call Ahmed and tell him to let my son go.
not_available We had a deal.
not_available Quiet! Is this what you need to reprogram the trigger? Yes.
not_available This should work.
not_available How long will it take to complete assembly? 
not_available 20 minutes.
not_available In less than an hour, it will detonate and strike a blow that the Americans will never forget.
not_available You're insane.
not_available Don't kill him until you're ready to leave.
not_available He still may be of some use as a bargaining chip if something goes wrong.
not_available Look, my my son.
not_available He's just a boy.
not_available Could you call Ahmed and tell him to let him go? I mean, I've done everything I've been asked to.
not_available Please! I may if you remain cooperative.
not_available I will.
not_available I swear.
not_available I still have much to do.
not_available I have everything I need.
not_available When you've finished, meet me at the safe house.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Ahmed, it's me.
not_available Did the device arrive? 
not_available Yes, but it was wrong to involve anyone.
not_available I understand, but I had to.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available Never mind.
not_available It arrived, that's what counts.
not_available You have a hostage, this man's son.
not_available Yes.
not_available You have no further use for him? 
not_available No.
not_available Then leave.
not_available Join the others.
not_available But before you go, kill the boy.
not_available Is that necessary? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's seen and heard too much.
not_available Do you understand? Yes, Fayed.
not_available The pardon for Assad looks satisfactory.
not_available Tell the Attorney General to proceed.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Mr Lennox and Ms Hayes are here.
not_available Show them in.
not_available I approved the agreement with Assad.
not_available That was quick.
not_available It had to be.
not_available We don't have the time to stand on ceremony.
not_available Tom, I know you disapprove of this agreement, but put it behind you.
not_available The issue now is, how do we position this with the public? 
not_available It must be kept from the public.
not_available That's not practical.
not_available It's to our advantage to make it known Assad is on our side.
not_available Don't disclose the formal agreement, don't use the words "pardon" or "amnesty".
not_available We're cooperating.
not_available I agree.
not_available Let's portray Assad as a man who's not a terrorist, but someone who wants peace.
not_available Terrorist turned statesman.
not_available The point is saving lives.
not_available That's our focus.
not_available OK, so for every life that was lost in the past because of this man, ten more may be saved in the future by working with him.
not_available On the face of it, the logic is compelling.
not_available Let's make a set of briefing points and get them to our media people.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available I do have to say, Mr President I still don't like this.
not_available I understand, and it makes me appreciate your loyalty all the more, Tom.
not_available The Wallace kid's still being held.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Curtis, you and your team take the back of the house.
not_available Come with me.
not_available We'll find an entrance point from the side.
not_available Go on my command.
not_available All personnel, it is imperative we take the suspect alive.
not_available Right now, he's our best chance of finding the nuke.
not_available Slowly move into position now.
not_available Yard is clear.
not_available Cover me.
not_available Why aren't you talking? What's going on? Did my father deliver the package? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Is he OK? Did he do exactly what you told him? Your father's fine.
not_available So then you can let me go, too.
not_available Get up.
not_available What? 
not_available Get up! Why? My father did exactly what you told him to do.
not_available I swear I promise you I won't tell anybody what I know.
not_available Scott, don't make this any harder than it is.
not_available Kneel down.
not_available I can't see what's happening in the house.
not_available Does anybody have a visual inside? Not yet.
not_available My men are almost in position.
not_available Turn around.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Turn around now! Set.
not_available All teams set.
not_available Curtis, make the call.
not_available I'm sorry, Scott.
not_available Go! Freeze! 
not_available He's coming your way, Jack.
not_available Drop the weapon! Hold your fire! Hold fire! Is he alive? 
not_available Barely.
not_available Get the EMT up here now! I need him to tell me where the boy's father took the package.
not_available Get me an EMT down here now! 
not_available Uh, I I might know.
not_available Jack.
not_available When he was on the phone with my father, he told him to take something to an address.
not_available Um um 
not_available Buchanan.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available We've got an address.
not_available Got it.
not_available Nadia, alert the two TAC teams.
not_available We have a strike target.
not_available Deploy them there.
not_available Are you gonna save my dad? We're gonna do everything we can.
not_available When we get the satellite feed, download it to the TAC teams.
not_available Here are the satellite downloads to Fayed's location in the last ten minutes.
not_available Nobody entered or exited.
not_available What's the exterior layout? 
not_available Favourable.
not_available TAC teams won't be seen.
not_available Nadia, get me the president.
not_available We just don't have enough specifics to go public, but I still want all first
not_available response teams in Los Angeles to be briefed on the possibility of a nuclear detonation.
not_available Mr President, you have an urgent call from Bill Buchanan.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Bill? 
not_available Mr President, we have some good news.
not_available We believe that we've found the suitcase nuke.
not_available Where? 
not_available Valencia, 20 miles north of the city.
not_available TAC teams will be there in 15 minutes.
not_available Should I patch you into that feed when it's available? Absolutely, Bill.
not_available Good work.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available I'll let you know when the feed comes up.
not_available Um, can we have a moment alone, please? 
not_available I'm getting you out.
not_available I'm not going.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Sandra, listen to me.
not_available I think some people in this place have a connection with the terrorist attacks.
not_available How would you know that? They were speaking Arabic, which I don't understand, but there was one phrase they used several times.
not_available "Khamsa ziwar.
not_available " Pass that on to the FBI or somebody.
not_available It may help.
not_available They're being held illegally.
not_available Any statements they make Dammit, Sandra! Stop being a lawyer for one damned minute! These guys may be planning something that will harm a lot of people.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll pass it on.
not_available "Khamsa ziwar.
not_available " 
not_available I have to get back.
not_available Be careful.
not_available I just got it.
not_available Thanks, Bill.
not_available Let me know as soon as the TAC teams arrive in Valencia.
not_available Will do, Jack.
not_available This is everything you and the president talked about.
not_available You'll receive a full pardon in exchange for continuing to help stop these attacks and for bringing your political group to a negotiated peace with the West.
not_available I need a moment to look through this.
not_available I understand.
not_available Unfortunately, I need to get back to work.
not_available Agent Boorman will take you to CTU.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What's the document? 
not_available Come here.
not_available I wanted to talk to you before it was executed.
not_available I didn't think it would happen this fast.
not_available We made a deal with Assad.
not_available Who's "we"? The United States government, personally authorised by the president.
not_available Assad will receive a pardon in exchange for full cooperation, which he has given.
not_available In other words, he walks.
not_available Like I told the president, it's not my call.
not_available It's not your call either.
not_available The responsibility lies with him alone.
not_available It's out of our hands.
not_available All right.
not_available If that's the way it has to be that's the way it has to be.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Scott.
not_available Scott.
not_available Oh, Scott.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Ms Wallace.
not_available Is there any word on my husband? We think we know where he is.
not_available We've got agents en route.
not_available Is he all right? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available We will do everything we can to protect him.
not_available Excuse me for one second.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available You were right about Curtis and Assad having a connection.
not_available Go on.
not_available Curtis was in the army after Desert Storm.
not_available His squad was ambushed by Assad's people.
not_available They killed five of Curtis's men and took two hostage.
not_available Curtis was wounded.
not_available He couldn't go after them.
not_available The next day, a tape was sent to the television station.
not_available Assad's lieutenant forced Curtis's men to beg for their lives and then personally beheaded them both.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Jack? Uh, I'll get back to you.
not_available Where's Agent Manning? 
not_available He was here just a second ago.
not_available Boorman, go ahead.
not_available I got him.
not_available You still don't remember? Special Forces Battalion, Curtis, put your weapon down! I can't do that.
not_available By order of the President of the United States, put down your weapon! Stay out of this, Jack! 
not_available I can't.
not_available I gave him my word that we would protect him.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Curtis, please.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Please.
not_available I can't let this animal live.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available Sprague told me what happened.
not_available Curtis didn't leave you any choice.
not_available That's what I keep trying to tell myself.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available We need Assad alive.
not_available He's on his way back.
not_available I think you should come in, too.
not_available Tell the president that I'm sorry.
not_available I can't do this any more.
not_available The hell you can't.
not_available We're gonna find that suitcase nuke because of you.
not_available You've done great work today.
not_available Good.
not_available Then you don't need me any more.
not_available I'll send a car for you, Jack.
not_available Come back here.
not_available We'll talk.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Yes? Mr Buchanan, I received word that Ahmed Amar, the terrorist who held the Wallace family hostage, died en route to the hospital.
not_available Thank you, Nadia.
not_available Mr Buchanan, the TAC team is ready.
not_available Patch me in.
not_available Make sure the White House is connected to the feed.
not_available Watch your six.
not_available Here.
not_available Two, one side.
not_available Go, go.
not_available Delta Unit, move in.
not_available Delta moving in.
not_available Watch it, watch it.
not_available Engaged.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available Almost finished.
not_available I just need to reconnect the fuse.
not_available Sabir.
not_available I think I saw someone out there.
not_available Who? 
not_available Police.
not_available Somebody.
not_available I saw something.
not_available Are you done? Yes.
not_available Can you detonate now? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do it now! Do it! No! Oh, my God.
not_available Alert first
not_available response teams in Los Angeles and the surrounding counties.
not_available Let's put them in touch with the military.
not_available Tell them Tell them the resources of the entire nation are at their disposal 
not_available whatever they need.
not_available Karen? Yes, Mr President.
not_available Mr Buchanan, I just got a message from the FBI.
not_available They said it's important.
not_available It's some Arabic phrase.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It was overheard in a detention centre.
not_available This phrase kept coming up.
not_available I'm not sure about the pronunciation.
not_available "Khamsa ziwar.
not_available " It means "five visitors".
not_available Assad said "visitor" was a codeword for "weapon".
not_available There are four more of these things out there.
