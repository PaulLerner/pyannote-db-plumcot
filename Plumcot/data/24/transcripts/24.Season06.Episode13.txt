
not_available Bomb! We're at emergency med bay with the president.
not_available Vice President Daniels runs this country now.
not_available He will implement your security plan.
not_available Lowry, these men are responsible for the attempted assassination.
not_available I have the vice president for Mr Buchanan.
not_available I see from the White House flashes that President Palmer granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough.
not_available Logan claims he can help us find Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available How? 
not_available Through the Russian consul.
not_available The bomb that exploded was a Russian suitcase nuclear device, supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available Where is he? I don't know.
not_available Yes? The United States has connected you with terrorists.
not_available The reason we brought the Arabs into this was to conceal our involvement.
not_available Now we are exposed.
not_available Russia is exposed.
not_available You spent nearly two years in a Chinese prison because you violated the sovereignty of their consulate.
not_available Now you plan to go back into the consulate and take a chance on that happening again? How do I find Gredenko? Mohave Desert.
not_available Shadow Valley.
not_available What is he doing? Launching drones.
not_available How soon will the drones be ready? In two hours, all the bombs will be in the air.
not_available Don't move in yet.
not_available He's too close to Markov.
not_available Now! I've gotta set the transcript codes for the debrief.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Who are you? I'm just Chloe O'Brian.
not_available I need to do something on this computer.
not_available Do you know what's going on with Jack Bauer? He's still being held in the Russian consulate.
not_available I need to talk to Bill Buchanan right now.
not_available He'll be here after his meeting.
not_available Does he know that I'm all alone here in a holding cell? This isn't really a cell and you're hardly alone.
not_available This is standard procedure for someone under house arrest.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm feeling ambivalent.
not_available I'm gonna go.
not_available All right.
not_available I want to introduce everyone to Mike Doyle.
not_available He's the new head of field ops in from Fort Bragg.
not_available I want all tactical and comm agents to report to him directly.
not_available Jack's being held captive in the Russian consulate.
not_available I haven't opened up that to anyone on the outside.
not_available Doyle will help you put a tactical profile together for an assault on the consulate.
not_available So, we're prepared to provoke an international incidentjust to liberate one operative? No.
not_available Liberating Jack is a secondary goal.
not_available Our primary objective is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul.
not_available According to Jack, Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who controls the suitcase nukes.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is nobody worried this could be considered an act of war against Russia? Ultimately, it's the vice president's decision if we go in or not.
not_available If Jack is right and Markov is working with Gredenko, the Russians will have to back down.
not_available Sir, Logan is ready for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I want a comprehensive siege profile on my desk ASAP.
not_available Who has the control keys for the servers? 
not_available I do.
not_available Bracket scenarios into three.
not_available I want projected outcomes based on personnel.
not_available Doyle, normally we run general attack I don't care what you normally do, Pressman.
not_available And I wasn't speaking to you.
not_available I was talking with her.
not_available Yeah, it's so weird.
not_available I had this thought that you might come here and not be ajerk like in Denver, but you are.
not_available That's right.
not_available Just like Denver.
not_available Let's get to work.
not_available I take it you know him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't like him very much.
not_available Does he know what he's doing? 
not_available Yeah, he's good.
not_available What did Buchanan say? We're ready to move pending White House approval.
not_available Is Jack on his own? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is all about getting Markov, not saving Jack.
not_available Yeah? I'm terminating the American.
not_available Do you confirm? Yes.
not_available And you're sure there won't be any political complications? Not if we stick to our story.
not_available The American kills the head of security, tries to escape.
not_available The American has shot Vasili.
not_available He's in the basement.
not_available Find him.
not_available Consul Markov.
not_available Yes? We haven't found the American, but I locked down the perimeter.
not_available There is no way to leave.
not_available He can't be allowed to call out.
not_available Shut down the phone lines, DSL, everything! 
not_available CTU, O'Brian.
not_available Morris, it's Jack.
not_available I know how to find Gredenko.
not_available He's Morris? 
not_available Jack? Jack? Jack? Come on.
not_available Dammit! Sir, Morris just got a call from Jack.
not_available The line went dead, but he says he knows where Gredenko is.
not_available Did you trace the call? 
not_available He's still inside.
not_available Monitor everything.
not_available Tell Doyle Bauer has got key intel and is no longer dispensable.
not_available Got it.
not_available I'm sorry, we have to reschedule our debrief.
not_available Why? 
not_available We have a situation at the consulate.
not_available Does this have something to do with Bauer going back in there to question Markov? Please, Bill.
not_available Maybe I can help.
not_available Jack was able to get Gredenko's location from Markov.
not_available He tried to call us, but was cut off before he could say more.
not_available He's either being held prisoner in the consulate or he's being pursued.
not_available Then I was right, Markov is involved.
not_available And he will do whatever it takes to keep Jack quiet.
not_available We have to extricate Jack.
not_available Failing that, we have to go in and remove Markov and interrogate him ourselves.
not_available We don't have time to go through red tape.
not_available There's no red tape.
not_available I'm launching an assault.
not_available No, that's that is a huge mistake.
not_available Markov will not let himself be taken alive, and he will kill Jack Bauer.
not_available We have to try something.
not_available Have you tried any pressure from President Suvarov? Vice President Daniels has spoken to Suvarov.
not_available He's reluctant to act.
not_available It's a diplomatic standoff.
not_available He needs to be convinced to get involved.
not_available I don't know how to do that.
not_available I do.
not_available How? My ex
not_available wife, Martha.
not_available She became friends with the Suvarovs, especially the wife.
not_available Anya can get through to Yuri.
not_available He listens to her.
not_available They're a very good team.
not_available With all due respect, hasn't Mrs Logan been institutionalised? That's beside the point.
not_available She's in a unique position to help us.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll put a call in to her.
not_available Bill let me do it.
not_available Martha can be very difficult.
not_available I think it would be best if I talked to her.
not_available I didn't realise you were on speaking terms.
not_available We're not.
not_available But I think I can get through to her.
not_available I know I can.
not_available Please, let me try.
not_available That's the way I want it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How many on each of those teams? 
not_available Five.
not_available Make it three.
not_available More teams, more coverage.
not_available Fine.
not_available Who's estimating defence figures? 
not_available That would be me.
not_available Where are the numbers? 
not_available I'm just sorting them.
not_available Of course you are.
not_available Where are the numbers? 
not_available This is about how many seconds it takes.
not_available There are your numbers sorted three ways.
not_available Pick one.
not_available Hey! Do I have your attention? Cos I only wanna do this once.
not_available I have 25 soldiers that are about to put their asses on the line.
not_available Whether they live or die largely depends on what gets done here.
not_available That's not to mention three nuclear weapons that may be down the street for all we know.
not_available So if anyone has a problem taking orders from me without giving me lip, tell me now, and I will have you reassigned.
not_available Doyle.
not_available You keep your hands off my people.
not_available Is that clear? 
not_available They need to know what I expect from them.
not_available I know what you expect.
not_available That's enough.
not_available You have a problem with somebody on my team, you come to me.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available Have your team merge their results and download them onto my system.
not_available You all right? 
not_available The shirt's a blend.
not_available It doesn't wrinkle.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available Yes.
not_available I am all right.
not_available You thought I was a pain in the ass.
not_available The vice president likes you.
not_available He hopes you have the right answer.
not_available Well, I hope so, too.
not_available Tom Lennox.
not_available Man of the hour.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You can leave us alone.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available So, have you given any thought to our earlier conversation? 
not_available Yes, I have, sir.
not_available And? And I agree that the priority here is to protect our country, and I am prepared to look the other way regarding details of the assassination plot.
not_available To a point.
not_available Well, what does that mean? It means the truth must ultimately come out.
not_available Reed and Carson need to be punished for what they did.
not_available And they will.
not_available Look, all I'm trying to do is keep America united.
not_available I can't have our critics screaming, "Look at how bad we are.
not_available " "We're worse than the terrorists.
not_available " 
not_available We need to keep our eye on the ball now.
not_available On that point, sir, we are in agreement.
not_available Good, cos I need you to tell the ambassador of Assad's country that you saw Assad plant the bomb that injured the president.
not_available Sir, looking the other way is one thing.
not_available Choosing to tell a lie to the ambassador, that becomes a matter of record.
not_available Now, you listen to me.
not_available If we expect to navigate through this crisis, I need you to cooperate.
not_available I would like to cooperate 
not_available I'm still talking! Come on now, Tom.
not_available Let's just count our blessings here for a minute.
not_available President Palmer survived this attack.
not_available Neither you nor I had anything to do with this heinous plot to kill him.
not_available And the most beautiful fact of all is that we now have the opportunity to implement the correct policy to stop these terrorist lunatics.
not_available Can you just put aside your distaste for my methods for one minute? Think about the great gift that's been given to us.
not_available I will think long and hard, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Now I need you to tell the ambassador that Assad carried in the bomb.
not_available I'll take it from there.
not_available OK? OK.
not_available Lisa, get the ambassador clearance and bring him down here.
not_available Let DOJ know that Lennox has been cleared of any wrongdoing and will continue serving as Chief of Staff.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir, I would like to know what you hope to achieve in your talk with the ambassador.
not_available I want him to know that I hold his country responsible for all of it 
not_available the nuke and the presidential assassination attempt.
not_available They need to be motivated to rein in these terrorists, and I want them to know that America is mad as hell and ready to retaliate with a nuclear option if they don't.
not_available Here's Fayed.
not_available It's about time he got here.
not_available We need to start loading the bombs.
not_available Mr Vice President.
not_available Bill, I'm here with Tom Lennox.
not_available What's going on at the consulate? Jack Bauer's still at large somewhere inside.
not_available It appears he knows Gredenko's location, but can't get it to us.
not_available All right.
not_available What's the plan? Former President Logan believes he can convince his ex
not_available wife to call Anya Suvarov.
not_available He thinks the Russian First Lady can get through to her husband.
not_available That's as likely as the terrorists knocking on my door and surrendering.
not_available I agree.
not_available That's why we've also prepared a siege plan.
not_available A strike force will enter the consulate and extract Markov for interrogation.
not_available You realise an attack on a Russian consulate is technically an act of war? 
not_available I do, sir.
not_available I'm reluctant to go the tactical route here.
not_available We've got our hands full.
not_available We don't need to open up another front.
not_available It's your decision, sir.
not_available I understand the politics are sticky, but my responsibility is to stop these nukes.
not_available Markov will not surrender willingly.
not_available We have to go in.
not_available How long will it take you to put together this siege? 
not_available 20 minutes.
not_available About 20 minutes.
not_available All right, proceed as if you're going in.
not_available If Logan can be effective before then, great.
not_available But don't wait on him.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Take your team and await our word.
not_available Got it.
not_available Agent.
not_available Martha? Just me.
not_available Did you get some rest? 
not_available I've been worried about you.
not_available Worried about me? You shouldn't be driving around with that fallout in the air.
not_available I'm keeping a good distance away.
not_available How are you? I've decided to read my book and listen to music.
not_available I've lived with enough fear over the years.
not_available I don't need any more.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Got your magazines.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And I stopped by Mel's.
not_available Did you get raspberries? 
not_available And blackberries and fresh kiwi fruit.
not_available Oh, thank God for Mel.
not_available What would I do without that man's produce? Oh, these look beautiful.
not_available Mm! 
not_available Oh, here.
not_available Have one.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Go on.
not_available Could you get that? Martha Logan's bungalow.
not_available May I speak to Martha, please? 
not_available Who is this? It's Charles, Aaron.
not_available Put her on.
not_available It's important.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available It's Charles.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available Important to whom? 
not_available Mr Logan, she doesn't wanna talk to you.
not_available I heard what she said.
not_available Listen, I am at CTU in Los Angeles on government business and it has to do with the nuclear attack.
not_available I don't understand how Martha could possibly be of any help.
not_available What you understand really doesn't matter.
not_available I no longer have to tolerate your sarcasm.
not_available This was not sarcasm.
not_available Something needs to be done and I think Martha might be able to help.
not_available I don't know what to tell you, but Martha simply doesn't wanna speak with you.
not_available She hasn't taken your calls in almost two years.
not_available I don't know why she would now.
not_available Tell her it's about the Suvarovs.
not_available What? Just do it.
not_available Please.
not_available Martha, he wants to ask you something 
not_available I told you, I don't wanna talk to him.
not_available It's about the Suvarovs.
not_available What's wrong? Has something happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What is it? Is Anya OK? 
not_available Anya's fine, Martha.
not_available They're both fine.
not_available Then what the hell do you want? It's a very delicate matter.
not_available There's an international incident brewing and I think that you might be able to help diffuse it.
not_available Let me get this straight.
not_available The government is desperate so they come to you to fix the world, and you come to me.
not_available I can't be dragged into another drama with you.
not_available I won't.
not_available You know what's going on today.
not_available You know that this is important.
not_available This is absurd.
not_available You still there? 
not_available Yes, I'm still here.
not_available I wouldn't play games on a day like today.
not_available I know.
not_available You need to convince her to see me.
not_available I'll take a chopper and I'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available Aaron? All right.
not_available This is Shavers.
not_available Stan, let me talk to Logan.
not_available Sir, it's Mr Buchanan.
not_available Yes, Bill? We've dispatched personnel for an assault on the Russian consulate.
not_available Bill, attacking the consulate is a huge error in judgment.
not_available This has been decided.
not_available The only way to avoid full confrontation with the Russians is for you to get Martha to make that call before we engage.
not_available Slowly, both of you against the wall.
not_available Please, don't hurt her.
not_available I have no attention of hurting you, but if you don't cooperate, I will kill you.
not_available You understand me? Both of you speak English? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I need to make an outside call.
not_available You can't.
not_available They've cut all communications because you killed Stovich.
not_available I didn't kill Stovich.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I don't have to convince you.
not_available Whatever you want.
not_available In case of an emergency, how do you contact the outside world? Please, there's a satcom phone upstairs.
not_available Get it and bring it down here.
not_available We're in a lockdown.
not_available That's your problem.
not_available Get me that phone.
not_available Now! 
not_available OK.
not_available Get against the desk.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Hello, Aaron.
not_available Martha's waiting for you.
not_available She's inside.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Martha.
not_available I'll get her.
not_available Charles is here.
not_available Send him away.
not_available But, Martha, he flew here.
not_available I know, but I've changed my mind.
not_available I don't want to see him.
not_available What's the matter? 
not_available She's changed her mind.
not_available Sorry, but she doesn't wanna see you.
not_available Aaron you have to convince her this is not about us, this is for the good of the country.
not_available I told her that.
not_available If we don't do something quickly, there's gonna be a US
not_available led assault on the Russian consulate here.
not_available So on top of everything else, we will effectively be at war with Russia.
not_available You've lost weight.
not_available Martha.
not_available So this is the new improved Charles Logan.
not_available Reborn.
not_available You look beautiful.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I need you to call Anya Suvarov.
not_available What do you want me to say? She has to convince Yuri to order the Russian consul here in Los Angeles to surrender.
not_available And why would he do that? Because the man, Anatoly Markov, he's a criminal working outside Russian authority.
not_available So what? 
not_available He's also a mass murderer.
not_available The bomb that went off this morning was supplied to the terrorists with Markov's help.
not_available There are other bombs out there.
not_available He knows where they are.
not_available Why doesn't the White House contact Yuri directly? 
not_available They did.
not_available It didn't work.
not_available Why not? This is very complicated.
not_available Please don't make me explain everything in detail Oh, oh, I'm sorry! Just do as you say without asking.
not_available I'm sorry! You haven't changed a bit.
not_available Look.
not_available Look at this.
not_available I'm still under arrest.
not_available After this is over, I go back to prison.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available "Prison"? Oh, is that what you call a 10,000 square
not_available foot house with a pool and a tennis court? Yuri has to be convinced that this man, Markov, is a traitor to his country.
not_available Anya can make our case for us.
not_available You're the only person who can reach her fast.
not_available Do you think I should do this? Yes, I do.
not_available I need a drink.
not_available Not that knocking me off the wagon wouldn't be a small price to pay for saving the world.
not_available Get Anya on the phone.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available How far are you from the consulate? 
not_available A few minutes.
not_available Any change of plans? No.
not_available As far as I know, the assault is still a go.
not_available I'm about to talk to Buchanan now.
not_available Call me if anything changes.
not_available OK.
not_available Have a seat, Mr Ambassador.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How is President Palmer? Well, the president's a tough man.
not_available He's injured, but we're confident he'll make a full recovery.
not_available What a tragic and despicable act.
not_available I agree.
not_available What is more troubling is a citizen of your country, Hamri Al
not_available Assad, was responsible for the attack.
not_available I understand that Assad lost his life in the blast.
not_available I was led to believe that he was working with President Palmer to promote a peace plan.
not_available Well, I'm afraid that was all a ruse, Mr Ambassador.
not_available Assad's real intentions became clear when he detonated the explosive.
not_available You have proof of this? 
not_available Conclusive.
not_available Forensic evidence, as well as at least one eyewitness who saw the detonator in Assad's hand immediately before the explosion.
not_available Isn't that right, Tom? Yes, sir.
not_available That is correct.
not_available Even if what you say is true, you must know that Hamri Al
not_available Assad was not working at the behest of our government.
not_available He was as much a wanted man in our country as he was in yours.
not_available Oh, not as much.
not_available But that's gonna change.
not_available What are you referring to? The terrorists presently on US soil are acting under the orders of citizens in your country who have the support of government.
not_available I know it and you know it.
not_available That is not true.
not_available I say it is, and I'm willing to bet you that I'm right.
not_available What do you mean? I have a carrier group within striking distance of every major city in your country waiting for my order.
not_available You would attack us? 
not_available Abu Fayed, a citizen of your country, enters the United States and detonates a nuclear bomb killing thousands.
not_available Next, Assad attempts to assassinate the president.
not_available We cannot be held responsible.
not_available We have cooperated since the inception of this crisis.
not_available These threats are reckless.
not_available I had an understanding with your president.
not_available And now you're gonna have one with me.
not_available You help us find those nukes before another goes off or I'm gonna unleash the full power of our military on your country.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Doyle is approaching.
not_available We can be in the consulate in less than 15 minutes.
not_available It's gonna come right down to the wire.
not_available What? Charles Logan and I are trying to arrange a call between his ex
not_available wife and Anya Suvarov.
not_available When? 
not_available Mrs Suvarov's giving a speech in Omsk.
not_available We have to wait till she's finished.
not_available Even if Mrs Logan gets through to Anya, it'll take time to change her husband's mind.
not_available I agree.
not_available It's a long shot.
not_available It shouldn't take much longer.
not_available It's important.
not_available Why not interrupt the speech? It's Russian politics.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available Fine.
not_available It's gonna be a few more minutes.
not_available What's the matter, honey? 
not_available It's taking forever.
not_available I know.
not_available Aaron, do you promise you'll stand by me if I can't go through with this? Course I will.
not_available Martha, I'm sorry.
not_available The last thing I wanted to do was upset you.
not_available Funny, you always managed to get to that last thing.
not_available May I ask you something, Charles? Does it bother you to see me with another man? 
not_available Martha, please.
not_available We may as well talk to fill the time.
not_available We never really had any closure.
not_available Well? Yes, it's very difficult, if you wanna know the truth.
not_available But you've had a rebirth.
not_available You should be happy for my happiness.
not_available I am happy for you, Martha.
not_available I'm sure you are.
not_available You know, Charles, Aaron has taken such good care of me.
not_available I don't know what I did to deserve such a good man.
not_available I never knew what that was before 
not_available a really good man.
not_available If it makes you feel better to insult me, feel free.
not_available I didn't come here to fight with you.
not_available It does make me feel better.
not_available I can say exactly what I want, finally, without having to worry about your wrath.
not_available The great Charles Logan.
not_available The president of the universe, the great leader, the murderer! Martha, I want you to stop this right now.
not_available You're gonna get all stirred up.
not_available Oh, well, God, we couldn't have that, could we?! Mr Logan, if you'd be more comfortable waiting outside, I'd understand.
not_available I appreciate that, Aaron, but I think I'll stay right here.
not_available Actually, I'm very thankful you've been able to be here for Martha.
not_available You are a good man.
not_available She's very lucky to have you.
not_available Now you're trying to irritate me, aren't you? 
not_available No, Martha, no.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Oh, cut the crap.
not_available All the sincerity, the new enlightened soul.
not_available At least you used to be an honest crook.
not_available That's enough, please.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'll be a good little girl.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I did it.
not_available I did it.
not_available He he wouldn't stop.
not_available He 
not_available We need a medic in here right now! He just wouldn't stop.
not_available And I Oh! It must have hit an artery.
not_available We need a medic in here now! Agent Foley, get in here now! 
not_available Somebody, come on! Oh, no! Stay with us! He's going into shock.
not_available Let's get him out of here.
not_available Now.
not_available It happened too fast, Bill.
not_available I couldn't stop her.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available I've been ordered to send an assault team into the Russian consulate 
not_available unless President Suvarov intercedes.
not_available I understand.
not_available Is Martha capable of having a coherent conversation with Anya Suvarov? 
not_available Honestly, I don't know.
not_available Chloe's putting the call through.
not_available Find out.
not_available Will do.
not_available Why are they doing this to me? I should be given a medal.
not_available He was one of the biggest criminals in history.
not_available They gave him house arrest.
not_available Martha, we're still in a crisis situation.
not_available Are you able to handle the conversation with Anya Suvarov? Of course I am.
not_available I'm not crazy.
not_available I know what the stakes are.
not_available Are you sure? Mr Pierce, CTU has got Anya Suvarov on the line for Mrs Logan.
not_available They're putting it through now.
not_available Do you know what you're gonna say? Anya, it's Martha.
not_available How are you? I'm fine.
not_available I've been worried about you there in California.
not_available Stop worrying, everything's gonna be fine.
not_available I know we have a lot to catch up on, but I'm gonna have to be rude and get to the point.
not_available There's not a lot of time.
