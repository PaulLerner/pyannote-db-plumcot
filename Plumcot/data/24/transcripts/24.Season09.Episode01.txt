
not_available Where are we on real
not_available time tracking? Backdooring off a satellite the Brits have overhead.
not_available Hey, Kate, friendly reminder.
not_available I'm gonna need your passcodes and decryption keys before you clear out at the end of the week.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm not gonna forget Oh, Mariana.
not_available What's going on out there? Got a tip that a high
not_available value suspect is here in London.
not_available Is it connected to the President being here? That's the speculation.
not_available ERIK: Positive ID on the target.
not_available Thirty feet from the south wait.
not_available Here we go.
not_available NAVARRO: It's him.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available All right, he's taken Miller out.
not_available Has his weapon.
not_available Armstrong, Cutler, he's coming your way.
not_available Ahhh! ERIK: Continuing pursuit.
not_available He'll head for the roof.
not_available That's the best way out.
not_available Target's on the move! He's heading outside! Well, that doesn't make sense.
not_available Kate, please? Get out of the way! Move! Move! Damn it! Move, move! ERIK: Target is moving west, on his way to the river.
not_available MAN 1: Stay where you are! MAN 2: Rooftop! MAN 1: Copy that.
not_available ERIK: I got him.
not_available He's in my sight! On your knees! Hands behind your head! ERIK: We got him.
not_available MARK: Prime Minister is putting pressure on parliament to extend their lease, but the vote is too close to call.
not_available People are just not comfortable with our using drones for targeted assassinations.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? I'm thinking I don't blame them.
not_available I'm uncomfortable with the drones, also.
not_available The ugly truth is, what we're doing is working.
not_available Worst
not_available case scenario, if we lose the base, do we have anything new? No other country in the region is willing to host an American base rig ht now.
not_available In part, because the Chinese are making it clear that they don't want us in the area.
not_available Yeah, they're spreading their wings.
not_available Beijing just acknowledged they have a carrier group heading for the Mediterranean.
not_available For the first time in history.
not_available It's clearly intended to intimidate the British over the lease.
not_available The Chinese Navy are calling it their friendship tour.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Taking a page from, uh, Franklin Roosevelt.
not_available Sir? Well, FDR, he sailed the Great White Fleet all over the world, early 1900s, called it the goodwill tour.
not_available Basically the same thing.
not_available Just a show of force.
not_available I have to work on my speech.
not_available Thank you, gentlemen.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? It was, um It was Theodore Roosevelt.
not_available Who? You said Franklin Roosevelt sailed the Great White Fleet around the world.
not_available It was Teddy.
not_available Well, thank you, Mark.
not_available When you retire as my Chief of Staff, you're gonna have a real place on Jeopardy! Don't worry about me.
not_available That's an order.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right, give me a second.
not_available Sir.
not_available You have a call from a local CIA head of station.
not_available He say what it was about? He didn't.
not_available This is Mark Boudreau.
not_available Steve Navarro, sir.
not_available My station just apprehended a man with a multi
not_available agency warrant issued against him.
not_available You're at the top of the alert list.
not_available Who is he? Jack Bauer.
not_available Are you sure? Yes, sir.
not_available Where was he caught? The old Chatham and Dominion factory of central London.
not_available It can't be a coincidence.
not_available I agree.
not_available Jack Bauer is a traitor and a psychopath who killed two Russian diplomats, and came close to assassinating their President.
not_available And now after all these years, he surfaces in London the same time as President Heller? We have to consider the possibility that he is here to do the President harm and there may be other people involved.
not_available I'll be interrogating him shortly, and find out.
not_available We don't have time for the interrogations you'll conduct.
not_available I understand there are Special Activities people on site.
not_available Well, they have a unit inside our facility, but they operate under a separate charter.
not_available We don't share intel or prisoners with each other.
not_available But I can have him formally transferred into their custody? Yes, sir.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll get started on that.
not_available Send me over Bauer's case file and keep his presence there on a needto
not_available know basis.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No one finds out Bauer's surfaced on our end either, do you understand? What about the President, sir? I said no one.
not_available Hey.
not_available Congratulations on apprehending Bauer.
not_available That's a big win.
not_available I hate to lose you, Kate.
not_available It's not fair and it's not your fault.
not_available I'll let you get back to it.
not_available Why didn't he go to the roof? What? Bauer.
not_available He could have gone to the roof when our men were moving in.
not_available And from there, he would've made it to any of the other buildings on the block and he'd have gotten away.
not_available It just doesn't make any sense.
not_available Maybe he didn't scout out an escape route.
not_available Bauer stayed off the grid for the last four years.
not_available He didn't do that by being careless.
not_available He's up to something.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Not for long.
not_available Major Shepherd wants you to call him as soon as you arrive.
not_available Sounded pissed.
not_available About what? Didn't say.
not_available Drone holding at Good luck with Shepherd.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sir, it's Lieutenant Tanner.
not_available You knew your mission was to fly cover while I escorted British officers to their unit.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yet, you didn't notify their air command.
not_available Sir, that wasn't in your orders.
not_available Shouldn't have to be.
not_available Get it authorized.
not_available Right away.
not_available Yet another dereliction of duty.
not_available You're on base until further notice.
not_available Sir, I have a weekend pass.
not_available My wife and I Your pass is revoked.
not_available Bastard.
not_available Get that file to the Chief of Staff.
not_available And set Bauer up in interrogation.
not_available But I thought Special Activities was gonna handle that.
not_available I want to see what I can get out of him before that transfer comes through, and those people do Godknows
not_available what to him.
not_available Sure.
not_available Lock him down in interrogation.
not_available OFFICER: Yes, sir.
not_available Good grab, Erik.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'd like to take a look at the original intercept from Prague, the one that gave us Bauer's location.
not_available Why? I just want to make sure that we're not missing anything.
not_available Like you thinking Bauer would head for the roof, when he didn't? I just want to take a quick look.
not_available You're not cleared for that.
not_available Look.
not_available ERIK: Sir.
not_available Uh Yeah? I thought you should know, Kate was asking about the Bauer op.
not_available She wanted to see the intercept that helped us catch him.
not_available Is that right? Yeah, but I didn't give it to her.
not_available I just wanted to make sure you were aware.
not_available And that she's still being transferred stateside? She's still leaving at the end of the week, and you're still on track to get her job.
not_available That's not even what I'm asking.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available And instead of shoving her out the door, you should be learning from her.
not_available She was a good field agent.
not_available With all due respect, how could that be? I mean, considering what happened You have a lot of strong opinions for someone who just got here.
not_available I'm just telling it like it is.
not_available I mean, her own husband selling secrets to the Chinese? And she didn't know? And no one knows that better than her, so cut her some slack until she goes.
not_available It's just a few more days, you can manage that, right? Hey.
not_available To hell with Erik.
not_available I pulled that intercept for you, but first there's something I want to say.
not_available You've worked your whole life to get here, Kate.
not_available You can't let them do this to you, you have to fight the transfer.
not_available Jordan, I did fight, for two months locked in a room while they accused me of being a part of what Adam did.
not_available But you were cleared.
not_available You deserve to be here, Kate.
not_available Do I really? Because I think Adam proved otherwise.
not_available Well Here.
not_available Did you look at this? I brought it straight to you.
not_available Look at the message from Prague police about Bauer.
not_available You see the header? Yeah.
not_available Time stamp's out of sequence with the rest of the traffic.
not_available Which means the tip couldn't have come from Prague.
not_available That it was planted.
not_available Exactly.
not_available We need to find out by who.
not_available Well, we better do it soon.
not_available Bauer's about to be transferred to Special Activities.
not_available Once he's down that rabbit hole, he's gone.
not_available You able to establish a baseline? Not a reliable one.
not_available His readings are so steady, it's unnatural.
not_available Pulse and thermal, all completely static.
not_available Let's see if we can shake him up.
not_available Steve Navarro, Head of Station.
not_available Listen, you've been on my side of this plenty of times so I'm just gonna lay it out.
not_available There's a long line of people who will make sure that you answer for the crimes you committed four years ago.
not_available All I care about right now is to find out if you're here in London to harm President Heller.
not_available And I'm not the only one who cares.
not_available There's an order coming to transfer you to the Special Activities division for enhanced interrogation.
not_available You more than anyone know what they're going to do to you down there.
not_available Now, I know how many lives you've saved.
not_available How much the country is in your debt.
not_available But they're just gonna see a man who snapped.
not_available Who went on a revenge spree.
not_available Killing and mutilating with no regard to the law or conscience.
not_available A man who's labeled by his country a criminal.
not_available A terrorist.
not_available Son.
not_available I think talking to me is your best option.
not_available Tell me why you're in London.
not_available And I will do everything in my power to stop Special Activities from getting their hands on you.
not_available Come on, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Why are you here? Jack Bauer's being transferred down to you, here's his file.
not_available AUDREY; Hey, Mark? Yes, hon? I'm almost ready.
not_available AUDREY: Hey, is my jewelry box in there? Yeah.
not_available Got it.
not_available Wow.
not_available Here.
not_available You read my mind.
not_available Maybe you shouldn't go to the reception.
not_available Why? Well, with you looking like that, no one's gonna pay any attention to politicians.
not_available No, they're gonna be distracted by your tie.
not_available My tie? Here.
not_available We should probably get going.
not_available Your father's probably downstairs waiting for us.
not_available How's he doing? He's doing good.
not_available I heard he made a mistake in your meeting.
not_available Well it's a mistake anyone would make.
not_available The doctors said he wouldn't be symptomatic for another year.
not_available Well, they also said that stress could exacerbate his condition.
not_available Trust me, he's handling the stress better than I am.
not_available I don't want you to worry, okay? Okay.
not_available Come in.
not_available I have an update on the Bauer situation.
not_available Good morning, Mrs.
not_available Boudreau.
not_available Just, uh, want to let you know your car is here.
not_available Thanks, Ron.
not_available We'll see you downstairs.
not_available Okay, I'll be right down.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available The transfer order's being processed.
not_available Special activity should have Bauer shortly.
not_available I'm thinking about what happens next, after they get what they can from Bauer.
not_available Well, I imagine he goes on trial.
not_available That may not be the best thing for this country.
not_available Is there an alternative? He could disappear.
not_available The Russians have wanted Bauer's head since he murdered their people.
not_available I want you to explore the possibility of handing him over to them.
not_available Clandestinely.
not_available The President should be made aware.
not_available The President has enough on his mind.
not_available Look, you weren't there.
not_available You don't know what Bauer did to that family, what he did to Audrey.
not_available She was lifeless, she was unresponsive.
not_available Under psychiatric care.
not_available Not expected to recover.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available I stood by her for three years.
not_available I held her hand, I loved her, and I brought her back.
not_available As long as she lives, she'll never hear the name Jack Bauer.
not_available Understood.
not_available Just get me what I need.
not_available NAVARRO: Jack.
not_available Can I call you Jack? Your options are running out fast.
not_available That transfer order is coming through.
not_available After that, I can't help you.
not_available Or I can arrange it so that you can see your daughter again.
not_available Did you know that Kim had another baby? A boy.
not_available Any update on the Bauer intercept? Actually, yeah.
not_available The intercept originated from a local Internet cafe, just on the other side of town.
not_available Did you check the cafe for surveillance cameras? Snake eyes on that, but look.
not_available Here.
not_available JORDAN: The cafe, see where it is? That's three blocks from where we got Bauer.
not_available Whoever planted that intercept had to know our comm protocols, and where Bauer was hiding.
not_available That's a pretty shortlist.
not_available Yeah, I only know one person on it.
not_available What if Bauer sent the message himself? Why would he plant a tip he knew would get himself caught? And that's what we need to find out.
not_available Where you going? Navarro needs to know.
not_available NAVARRO: What are you doing? I need to talk to you.
not_available It's important.
not_available This better be good.
not_available The intercept that gave us Bauer's location, it didn't come from Prague police.
not_available Back up.
not_available How do you know about the intercept? It was planted.
not_available It originated just three blocks from where we grabbed Bauer.
not_available I think Bauer may have planted it himself.
not_available So you're saying that Bauer wanted us to catch him? Which explains why he didn't go to the roof during the operation.
not_available He wasn't trying to get away, he was trying to get caught.
not_available That intercept could've been sent by anyone who wanted to catch Bauer.
not_available We need to ask him about it.
not_available If we're right, maybe he'll open up.
not_available MARIANA: Excuse me, sir.
not_available The transfer order.
not_available Well, that's it, Kate.
not_available It's now in Special Activities' hands.
not_available Sir, we can't just let this go.
not_available Get Erik over here.
not_available I want him to take care of the transfer.
not_available Got it? MARIANA: Yes, sir.
not_available Damn it! Get that door open! That tip from Prague was sent by you, wasn't it? You arranged to be caught.
not_available You wanted to be brought here to this facility.
not_available You're after something or someone.
not_available Kate! Kate Get out of here right now.
not_available Look, he is flat the entire session, but when I hit him about faking the intercept and wanting to be caught, he spikes.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's a reaction.
not_available It's means I'm onto something.
not_available Kate! Bauer is here for a reason and we need to find out what it is, and what he's planning on doing.
not_available This isn't about Bauer, this is about Adam.
not_available Adam? Your husband betrayed his country and he betrayed you and now you're transferring your frustration onto Bauer.
not_available That's not what this is about.
not_available Believe me, I understand how you feel.
not_available Adam was my friend.
not_available He betrayed me, too.
not_available You're psychoanalyzing me instead of listening Kate, let it go.
not_available If Bauer's going to Special Activities, then it's a damned good bet that's exactly where he wants to be.
not_available You know what? Forget finishing out the week.
not_available You're leaving now.
not_available Escort her out of here.
not_available MAN: Yes, sir.
not_available I'll send your personal effects later.
not_available You ignore this, and you're putting the entire building in danger.
not_available Bauer is a violent criminal.
not_available Kate, I really am trying to help you.
not_available It's for the best.
not_available Jordan, it's me.
not_available Where are you? I just heard Navarro was having you escorted out of the building.
not_available Listen, I need you to find out if anyone in this building has a prior history with Jack Bauer.
not_available Personnel, detainees, anybody.
not_available Okay, I'm running the cross
not_available check.
not_available I'll call you if I find something.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available ERIK: I used to study your missions back in training.
not_available You were really something, Bauer.
not_available Back in the day.
not_available Dean, it's me.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Take me to her now.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You know who I am.
not_available Trigger an alarm, and I'll blow your head off.
not_available Now open the door.
not_available Did you do this to her? It's nothing you haven't done.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Come on.
not_available Chloe, wake up.
not_available Damn it.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jack, what are you doing here? We got to get out of here.
not_available Come on.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available You were right about Bauer.
not_available He does have a connection with someone being held by Special Activities.
not_available Please don't ask me how I got into their system.
not_available Who is it? Chloe O'Brien.
not_available She's one of those free
not_available information hackers.
not_available Sending this to your phone now.
not_available for releasing over 10,000 classified DOD files.
not_available Is charged with treason.
not_available She worked with Bauer at CTU for years.
not_available Served time for helping him escape the country.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available He's here to break her out.
not_available I'm at Special Activities.
not_available Bauer's gone.
not_available Erik's down.
not_available Erik and Brandon are down but alive.
not_available Listen, I want you to initiate a level five lockdown.
not_available Do it on my authority.
not_available You don't have any authority! Just do n! What the hell is going on? Why are we on lockdown? Bauer's trying to escape, sir.
not_available Kate's down there right now.
not_available Kate? Come on, Chloe.
not_available You can make it! I need you to take cover behind that wall.
not_available This way.
not_available Stay down here.
not_available Stay down.
not_available KATE: Bauer! You're done.
not_available You're not getting out of here! Drop your weapon! Drop it! Okay, now put your hands behind your head.
not_available Come on.
not_available Put your hands behind your head.
not_available Do it.
not_available On your knees.
not_available Where's O'Brian? Go ahead.
not_available You got her? We gotta go.
not_available Get down! Get down! I just love this city.
not_available You can feel the history.
not_available I know that look.
not_available What's your problem? The mistake you made in your meeting.
not_available Mark said it was nothing.
not_available That I shouldn't worry.
not_available It's progressing a lot quicker than the doctors anticipated.
not_available It's terrifying, the thought of slowly losing yourself.
not_available Not just the memories, but all of it.
not_available What do you want to do? Right now, I want to lock up this treaty with the British.
not_available Okay.
not_available HELLER: Don't say anything to Mark.
not_available I'll speak to him when the time is right.
not_available Running recovery protocols.
not_available It's gonna be at least 20 minutes before I can try and access local CCTV to look for Bauer.
not_available Let me know as soon as we're back up.
not_available JORDAN: Yes, sir.
not_available We're laying down a search grid, starting with a 10block perimeter, activating off
not_available duty agents.
not_available You're not gonna find him.
not_available Thanks for the confidence.
not_available Well, look at how he planned this.
not_available He knows our protocols, he knows the layout of this facility, he even knows that Special Activities keeps the identity of their prisoners classified.
not_available So what do you suggest, we just give up? I want everything that Special Activities has on Chloe O'Brian.
not_available We track down her known associates, we break down the intel for where she might go.
not_available There's no "we." You are not part of this station anymore.
not_available Can I talk to you alone' please? Sir.
not_available Make sure local fire and police follow our security protocols.
not_available And if they give you any trouble, remind them we've got consular status.
not_available Sir Do it.
not_available KATE: Look at what Jack did, and he was here for how long? Look, we need to find him.
not_available So let me do it.
not_available Put me back in the field.
not_available You have to understand, I am under a microscope here, all right? The President's Chief of Staff is already all over me about Bauer.
not_available And I'm your best shot at getting him back.
not_available Look, yes, Adam was a traitor, and I missed it, but I didn't miss this.
not_available I'm the only one who saw it coming.
not_available I got inside Bauer's head.
not_available Nobody else did that.
not_available Not Erik, and not even you.
not_available And if you think the Chief of Staff is up your ass right now, imagine what he's gonna do when he finds out that you had a heads up on this and you dismissed it.
not_available Kate, are you threatening me? I can do this, okay? I can find Bauer.
not_available I'm asking you to let me.
not_available Belcheck, pull over at the end of the block.
not_available Chloe, Chloe, look at me.
not_available Are you all right? Yeah.
not_available Okay, good, 'cause we need to move fast.
not_available Take this phone.
not_available It's gonna be secure for at least an hour.
not_available They're gonna mobilize after me, so we need to separate.
not_available Can you get somewhere safe? Chloe? Can you get somewhere safe? I think so.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available I will find you on that cell phone as soon as I'm secure.
not_available Now we gotta go, okay? Now come on.
not_available You got a signal from the transmitter that we put in her phone? Yes.
not_available I still think you should have just asked her to help.
not_available I couldn't take the chance she'd say no.
not_available I thought you said she was your friend.
not_available I don't have any friends.
not_available Let's go.
not_available D11
not_available 3, angels five, all clear.
not_available Mission complete.
not_available Moving on to next assignment.
not_available Turning south.
not_available What is this? What the What's going on? Oh, no, no! My God.
not_available Major Shepherd.
not_available Sir, you need to get away from that vehicle! You're being targeted! What are you talking about? Targeted by who? Somethings taken control of my drone! It's armed a missile to attack! What? I don't understand it either, sir, but you need to get to cover right now! Taken casualties.
not_available I repeat, we have taken casualties.
not_available It's done.
