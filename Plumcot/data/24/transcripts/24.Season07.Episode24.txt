not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Before his death, Jonas Hodges told us that there were other parties involved with him in the creation of this bioweapon.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Has apprehended Tony Almeida.
not_available He is a key figure in this plot.
not_available Jonas Hodges was killed outside F.B.I.
not_available Headquarters and Ms.
not_available Taylor might be involved.
not_available Olivia's capable of many things, but I can't believe committing murder is one of them.
not_available I need you to access the digital recording system
not_available to see if their conversation was recorded.
not_available What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this.
not_available My operatives are with your daughter.
not_available In fact, I'm looking at her right now.
not_available You will help Tony Almeida escape, or my people will murder your daughter.
not_available Don't move! 
not_available Jack, why? The people that are working with Tony have operatives with Kim right now.
not_available They've threatened to kill her if I don't break him out.
not_available The people who were watching you
not_available they're our only lead to finding your father.
not_available That laptop has the camera that they were using to track me.
not_available We may be able to backtrace to the people that have my father.
not_available Your people are gonna be able to launch their biological attacks just as they originally planned.
not_available How? 
not_available We haveJack.
not_available The pathogen's in his organs.
not_available We'll be able to harvest everything we need from his body.
not_available Tony believes in what we're doing.
not_available Are you suggesting I meet with him? I'll look Almeida in the eye, and if for any reason I don't like what I see I can't let him walk out of that meeting alive.
not_available How much longer does he have? 
not_available Couple ofhours, give or take.
not_available The pathogen can survive up to two hours after death.
not_available In fact, the only sure way to destroy it is by exposure to extreme temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius.
not_available Get him ready to move.
not_available The following takes place between 7:00 a.m.
not_available And 8:00 a.m.
not_available Tell me if you need more people on this, and I will get them for you.
not_available We don't need people.
not_available We need to get lucky.
not_available The transmitter node on the laptop is encrypted with multiple relays.
not_available Can you source the transmission or not? I'm trying to come up with a work
not_available around.
not_available Call me as soon as you have something.
not_available I will.
not_available They still can't source the transmission? 
not_available They're working on it.
not_available Chloe and Janis are doing everything they can.
not_available Is there no other lead, no other way to find my father? This is a good lead, Kim.
not_available The only reason we have it is 'cause of you.
not_available Yeah, except my father is dying, and we don't know how much time he has left.
not_available No! 
not_available Come in.
not_available What are you still doing here? Just finishing up the conversation we started.
not_available Aaron, I told you to escort Ethan to the gate.
not_available Now take him out of my office and off the White House grounds.
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available I am not gonna do that.
not_available I'm calling security.
not_available Having me dig up dirt on Noah Daniels is one thing.
not_available This is a whole different animal.
not_available I'm aware of that, Martin.
not_available I want this to happen.
not_available I want this person taken care of.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available It's Jonas Hodges.
not_available The digital card you confiscated from me was blank.
not_available I gave the real one to Agent Pierce.
not_available How long have you known, Aaron? I had my suspicions, ma'am but I was hoping I was wrong.
not_available I'll wait outside, sir.
not_available Ethan, this doesn't tell the whole story.
not_available Sounds pretty clear to me.
not_available Hodges is dead.
not_available You're responsible.
not_available I know, but I tried to stop it from happening.
not_available Oh, save it, Olivia.
not_available You can't talk your way out of this situation.
not_available Not this time.
not_available All right, Ethan.
not_available You win.
not_available I'll resign.
not_available Come up with some excuse.
not_available You could have your job again.
not_available Everything will go
not_available This isn't about getting my job back! It's about the truth.
not_available The truth could destroy my mother's administration.
not_available I am fully aware of the implications if this goes public.
not_available You don't have to spell them out for me.
not_available Then what do you want? 
not_available For the president to take the next step.
not_available Whether she decides to prosecute this or bury it, that's her call.
not_available But she needs to know the truth.
not_available I'll let you tell her yourself.
not_available I can't believe you're doing this.
not_available You're betraying everything that you've ever worked for.
not_available I know you think this country failed you and I don't care what kind of ideology you believe in now.
not_available This is no way to fight for it.
not_available What you're doing is wrong.
not_available This is wrong, and you know it! Damn it, Tony.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Please as someone who was once your friend let me die in peace.
not_available Don't let them use me to kill innocent people.
not_available I have no intention of letting them use you as a pathogen, Jack.
not_available I never did.
not_available I overheard you.
not_available This was your idea.
not_available You sold it to them.
not_available It was just a play.
not_available A play? 
not_available To get the man who's coming here right now.
not_available Took me three years to find him.
not_available Took me another year to get him to meet me faceto
not_available face.
not_available I had to prove myself to him by taking down Jonas Hodges.
not_available I had to convince him that I was a true believer in his cause.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? His name is Alan Wilson.
not_available He was the man behind Charles Logan.
not_available He's the one who ordered the hit on David Palmer.
not_available And he had Michelle killed to cover his tracks.
not_available This is the man who murdered my wife, Jack.
not_available Everything that you've done today is for personal revenge? It's about justice.
not_available Justice? You killed innocent people, Tony! Ten times as many people would have died if it hadn't have been for me.
not_available The deeper I dug to find the person responsible for Michelle's death the more I kept running into men likeJonas Hodges.
not_available They're the ones with the crazy ideology, Jack, not me.
not_available I'm the one who had a plan to bring them down.
not_available I'd enlisted Bill and Chloe to help me track all the elements of this group.
not_available And when I finally got what I wanted they would turn 'em in and shut 'em down.
not_available But you screwed that all up, didn't you, Jack? You see I'm the one who saved lives today, Jack, not you.
not_available I'm the one who helped you recover the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available I'm the one who warned you about the White House attacks! I'm the one who stopped Jonas Hodges from launching those missiles! You tell yourself whatever you want.
not_available You launched a biological attack on Washington Center Station and if we hadn't gotten there in time, thousands of innocent people would have been killed! I did what I had to do to get Alan Wilson there.
not_available And now he's gonna die.
not_available You kill him, and no one will ever know the full extent of this conspiracy.
not_available I'm not gonna kill him, Jack.
not_available You are.
not_available Damn you, Tony.
not_available Damn you.
not_available I'm sorry that it has to be you.
not_available But the truth is, they wouldn't let me within 50 feet of the guy.
not_available You're the one he's coming for.
not_available You're not honoring Michelle's life.
not_available You are reveling in her death, and she would despise you for this.
not_available We're clear.
not_available When's Wilson coming? 
not_available Soon.
not_available He wants to see Bauer's medical record.
not_available It's right over there.
not_available Wilson doesn't know about us.
not_available And it's best to keep it that way, at least for now.
not_available Sure.
not_available I understand.
not_available He's here.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Put your hands behind your head.
not_available We're all clear, sir.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available That's far enough for you.
not_available Hello Cara.
not_available This is Tony Almeida.
not_available Been looking forward to this, sir.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Where's Bauer? Right inside, second door on the right.
not_available You'll need this.
not_available So, Cara thinks you should be playing a larger role in our organization.
not_available You've been an asset.
not_available Thank you, sir but I believe there's a lot more I can bring to the table.
not_available But first I want to see Bauer's pathology report.
not_available I have it right here.
not_available This is the F.B.I.
not_available You're surrounded.
not_available Lay down your weapons.
not_available Fire at will! Tony! 
not_available Set us down.
not_available I need you to get me to that green vehicle.
not_available Jack.
not_available Stay away from me.
not_available I'm wired with C
not_available 4.
not_available Tony's got the detonator.
not_available Stay away! 
not_available Wait.
not_available I know this trigger mechanism.
not_available I can disarm it.
not_available Where's Kim? 
not_available She's safe.
not_available She was the reason we were able to find you.
not_available Tony's been playing both sides all along.
not_available You need to stop him.
not_available He's trying to kill the man who's behind this conspiracy.
not_available His name is Alan Wilson.
not_available He was responsible for killing Tony's wife, Michelle.
not_available That's why he's doing this.
not_available You want to end this for good, you need to stop Tony from killing him otherwise you're gonna lose any chance of exposing the others.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're clear.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's the Woodside Industrial Complex.
not_available We're in the southeast quadrant, on our way to the perimeter.
not_available Call me when you have an exfiltration point.
not_available How did this happen? Huh? How did they track us? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Tony! 
not_available Thank God you're okay.
not_available The extraction team will be here soon, but we gotta move.
not_available It took me a long time to find you to peel back all the layers of people you hide behind.
not_available But I stayed patient.
not_available 'Cause ever since the day you had her killed the only thing that kept me alive was this moment right here.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You sound like you were involved in some kind of a tragedy but I had nothing to do with it.
not_available Oh, no, no, no.
not_available No.
not_available Uhuhuhuhuh
not_available uh.
not_available See, Michelle and me had gotten out of all this.
not_available We made it out together.
not_available And we were gonna start a whole new life until you came along and took it all away in a split second.
not_available It wasn't just my wife you murdered.
not_available She was carrying my son.
not_available You killed my son! My son! And now I'm gonna kill you.
not_available Tony, don't move.
not_available Tony, don't move! 
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available These people think they can take everything away from us, Jack! Somebody had to stop 'em.
not_available And what did you do, huh? You ran away! That's right! You ran away, Jack! You're one of them now! Congratulations! How would Teri feel about that, huh, Jack? Huh? 
not_available A lot of people died today because of you including someone close to me.
not_available You will be charged with treason and conspiracy to launch terrorist attacks against this country.
not_available The only way that I see you avoiding the death penalty is by cooperating.
not_available Tell me who else is involved in this conspiracy and I will make sure that your cooperation is taken into account by the grand jury.
not_available Hmm.
not_available How can I cooperate if I have no idea what you're talking about? That's not gonna work, Wilson.
not_available Whatever this conspiracy is that you think that I'm a part of I guarantee you won't find a shred of material evidence connecting me to it.
not_available In the eyes of the law, I'm an innocent man.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Anything else you need to say, you can say to my attorneys.
not_available Ma'am, they're almost ready to take Bauer to the hospital.
not_available You wanted a heads
not_available up.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Hmm.
not_available I'm giving you hydromorphone to make the ride to the hospital easier.
not_available It'll make you a little sleepy, but it will break the pain cycle.
not_available No.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Please.
not_available Jack.
not_available Could you give us a moment? Dr.
not_available Macer wants you at the hospital.
not_available It's all right.
not_available She can wait.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What happened? He's denying everything.
not_available Claims that we don't have a case against him.
not_available Is he right? Maybe
not_available which means he has absolutely no reason to tell us who else is involved in this with him.
not_available But I can make him talk.
not_available If we don't find these people, one day they will launch another attack and I don't see how I can live with myself knowing that there was something I could have done to stop it.
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available I can't tell you what to do.
not_available I've been wrestling with this one my whole life.
not_available L
not_available I see 15 people held hostage on a bus, and everything else goes out the window.
not_available I will do whatever it takes to save them
not_available and I mean whatever it takes.
not_available I guess maybe I thought if I save them I could save myself.
not_available Do you regret anything that you did today? 
not_available No.
not_available But then again, I don't work for the F.B.I.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You took an oath.
not_available You made a promise to uphold the law.
not_available When you cross that line, it always starts off with a small step.
not_available Before you know it, you're running as fast as you can in the wrong direction just to justify what you started in the first place.
not_available These laws were written by much smarter men than me.
not_available And in the end, I know that these laws have to be more important than the 15 people on the bus.
not_available I know that's right.
not_available In my mind I know that's right.
not_available L
not_available I just don't think my heart could ever have lived with that.
not_available I guess the only advice I can give you is try to make choices that you can live with.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Don't say anything at all.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, we really need to go.
not_available Henry! What are you doing out of bed? What's going on? 
not_available Olivia wouldn't say until you got here.
not_available You'll understand when I tell you.
not_available It's gonna be hard enough to say once.
not_available I'm listening, Livy.
not_available What's this about? Jonas Hodges.
not_available He's dead because of me.
not_available Oh, Livy.
not_available Don't tell me you were the one who leaked the information.
not_available It's worse than that.
not_available Olivia talk to us.
not_available He killed Roger.
not_available Hodges killed my brother and then you agreed to put him into witness protection.
not_available And the thought ofhim getting away was too much for me.
not_available So I called Martin Collier.
not_available He had once told me he knew someone who could do this kind of thing.
not_available You're saying Collier hired someone to killJonas Hodges? No.
not_available I did.
not_available I tried calling it off, but it was too late, and everything was happening so fast.
not_available Olivia, who else knows about this? Ethan.
not_available He has a recording of my conversation with Martin.
not_available He's agreed not to turn it over to the Attorney General.
not_available He says he'll respect whatever you decide to do with the evidence.
not_available Mom, say something.
not_available How could you do this, Olivia? How could you do something so stupid? I'm sorry.
not_available I tried to call it off.
not_available I swear.
not_available It doesn't matter, darling.
not_available It happened.
not_available For God's sake, Allison.
not_available Stop yelling at her.
not_available Hodges killed our son.
not_available I know what he did.
not_available Then you know, if anyone deserves to die, it's him.
not_available All you should be thinking about now is how to protect our daughter.
not_available Protect her? How? Destroy that recording.
not_available And cover up a murder? Henry, I can't just disregard the law.
not_available Allison, spare me your sanctimony.
not_available You're Olivia's mother.
not_available I'm also the president of the United States.
not_available And our family's already paid a steep enough price for that.
not_available What are you saying, Henry? You know exactly what I'm saying.
not_available Your job cost our son his life.
not_available That is a cruel thing to say.
not_available I couldn't have done anything to prevent Roger's death.
not_available But you can do something about this.
not_available For God's sakes, Allison.
not_available We've already lost one child.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, Madam President, but there's some news from the Bureau you need to hear.
not_available Uh, good news.
not_available I'll be down in a moment, Tim.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Go, Allison.
not_available But so help me destroy that recording and save what's left of this family.
not_available Go.
not_available Dad, what did I do? We're going to figure this out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We'll figure it out.
not_available He's a high
not_available value suspect.
not_available Make sure you restrict access until I get there.
not_available Agent Walker's bringing him back now.
not_available What's their E.T.A.
not_available About 10 minutes.
not_available I'll be there in 20.
not_available Have Wilson's transfer papers in order by then.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Chloe.
not_available I've gotta work on Wilson's transfer papers so we're gonna have to schedule debriefing for later.
not_available I can come back later, or tomorrow.
not_available You staying in town? I want to be here forJack.
not_available I'd like to thank you for all the help you gave me today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was interesting.
not_available Given what you have to work with, uh, you're doing a pretty good job.
not_available I'll take that as a compliment.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good.
not_available That's what it was meant to be.
not_available Because the pathogen was weaponized, the disease is at an advanced stage.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available All I can do is administer morphine which will induce a coma.
not_available But you won't feel any pain.
not_available No morphine.
not_available Not yet, please.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Macer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer has a visitor.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's all right.
not_available He'll see you now.
not_available I'll be outside.
not_available Thank you for coming.
not_available I was surprised to get your call.
not_available I'm dying.
not_available I know.
not_available I made so many mistakes.
not_available A
not_available And I always thought that I would have the time to correct them.
not_available You have the time.
not_available Right now.
not_available You don't know what I've done.
not_available We live in complex times, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Nothing is blackand
not_available white.
not_available But I do know this: I see before me a man with all his flaws and all his goodness.
not_available Simply a man.
not_available Let us both forgive ourselves for all the wrongs that we have done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's time.
not_available Olivia, come and sit down.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I never imagined that this job would
not_available would be so hard on both of you.
not_available I had no idea of the price this family would pay.
not_available And for that, I am so sorry.
not_available But I have a sworn duty to enforce the Constitution.
not_available Failing to honor that oath would be the worst kind ofhypocrisy.
not_available Olivia, I love you more than anything in this world and I will do everything I can to help you through this but as president, this is what I have to do no matter how much it breaks my heart.
not_available Agent Pierce will remand you to federal custody.
not_available Ma'am, I'm escorting you to theJustice Department where you'll be held until formal charges have been issued.
not_available I'm sorry, honey.
not_available Henry.
not_available Allison.
not_available Um if you'd like to talk later
not_available No.
not_available As much as I wanted to cover this up, l
not_available I couldn't.
not_available You don't have to explain yourself to me, Madam President.
not_available I understand completely.
not_available Henry doesn't.
not_available He'll come around.
not_available In time.
not_available I don't think he will, Ethan.
not_available I really don't.
not_available I've lost my family.
not_available I've lost everyone.
not_available Not everyone.
not_available Then you'll take back your letter of resignation? If you want me to.
not_available I do.
not_available I need your help, Ethan.
not_available And I need it now.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Has taken a man into custody.
not_available His name is Alan Wilson.
not_available Woods is on his way to pick up Wilson.
not_available You need to sign the transfer documents.
not_available What's wrong? What's going on? 
not_available Get out of here, Janis.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available I said get out of here.
not_available What are you doing? Get out! No.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available I'm staying right here until Wilson is transferred.
not_available Fine.
not_available What are youRenee, what are you doing? 
not_available Put your hands over your head.
not_available I said do it now, Janis! Secure your hands to that pole.
not_available Now! 
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available JustJust calm down, all right? Just
not_available Renee, please don't do this.
not_available Please don't do this.
not_available You've done yourjob.
not_available You arrested him.
not_available Let the courts take it from here.
not_available Stop this now, before it's too late.
not_available Don't throw away your career.
not_available This is absolutely insane.
not_available Larry would not have wanted this.
not_available Don't dishonor his death like this.
