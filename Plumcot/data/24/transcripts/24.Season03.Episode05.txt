
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available What's wrong? Keeler.
not_available He's bringing your ex
not_available husband into this debate.
not_available The SEC's investigation into his company.
not_available Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and trust that the people will be able to tell the difference.
not_available Jack, what's going on? Where's Tony? He's been shot.
not_available How bad? 
not_available He was hit in the neck.
not_available He's still alive, they're getting him to the hospital now.
not_available With Tony down, you're in command.
not_available Deliver Ramon Salazar to the Van Nuys dam.
not_available Whoever sent this message is controlling Kyle Singer's movements.
not_available We have two hours to find him before they release the virus.
not_available What are you into Kyle? These cops, they came to my apartment today and they were saying something about using me to, to bring some weird disease into the country.
not_available A disease? Go! Run! I didn't do anything, man! No! Stop! You're going to see Salazar? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My dad said questioning him was a waste of time.
not_available No.
not_available Sitting around here is a waste of time.
not_available Kim, I need you to generate a prisoner transfer document.
not_available What's this about? I need to move Ramon Salazar.
not_available This has top priority clearance.
not_available No one at CTU is supposed to know.
not_available Either I hand over Ramon Salazar or his brother will release the virus.
not_available I understand that this is an impossible choice.
not_available I have another option for you to consider.
not_available Ramon Salazar would be broken out of prison and delivered to him.
not_available Sounds like quite a plan, Jack, but who'll break Salazar out? I will, sir.
not_available This would be my last assignment.
not_available If you play this cool, Ramon, you're walking out of here with me.
not_available Open the cell blocks now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Move! The following takes place between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm Good evening to those of you on the east coast and good afternoon to those of you in the west.
not_available Welcome to first of three debates between President Palmer and Senator John Keeler.
not_available We'll begin tonight with a two minute opening statement followed by the first question which will go to President David Palmer as decided by a coin flip backstage just moments ago.
not_available How're you feeling? Is that a medical question or a personal one? Both.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available That will be conducted within formats of rules agreed to by each member of the debate and by the two campaigns.
not_available Now we will bring to the stage the candidates.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, Senator John Keeler.
not_available David, I'm sorry you have to deal with my ex
not_available husband's lies.
not_available It's alright.
not_available We have the truth on our side.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, President David Palmer.
not_available Thank you, John.
not_available Good luck tonight.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Keeler.
not_available Good evening.
not_available I'm looking forward to discussing some of the critical issues When I tell you to, you start fighting with me over the gun.
not_available I gotta try and pull two guards off the main corridor.
not_available Okay.
not_available They're coming.
not_available Help! Help! Help! That's enough! Put on his uniform and helmet now! Split up your men.
not_available I want a team at every security.
not_available No, Jack and Salazar are somewhere on east block.
not_available You need to put your men over there.
not_available I got to control this prison, your partner is not my only problem.
not_available Warden, today he is.
not_available He and Salazar need to be contained and they need to be kept alive.
not_available You want me to redeploy my men? Then I need to know how real this terrorist threat is.
not_available Come here.
not_available Ramon Salazar's brother will spread a deadly virus into the population unless we release him unharmed.
not_available If we don't the death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands.
not_available This is Warden Mitchell.
not_available Tactical unit five, report to control center.
not_available You're now under the command of agent Edmunds.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Chase, it's Michelle.
not_available What the hell is going on over there? Jack tried to bring Salazar out of prison.
not_available He started a riot.
not_available What? I think in his own twisted way he thinks he's gonna deliver him to Hector and stop the virus from being released.
not_available Well he's gonna get himself killed not to mention Salazar.
not_available I know.
not_available I know, I'm trying to protect him.
not_available What about Kyle Singer? We're getting close to locating him.
not_available Michelle as soon as you do, call me.
not_available If Jack knows we got the carrier of the virus he'll give Salazar back.
not_available We got everyone working on it Chase.
not_available We'll find him.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry, Linda.
not_available Linda.
not_available Am I gonna die? It depends if they find us in time.
not_available What do you mean? The guy from the government He told my dad that I had a couple of more hours before I Before I become contagious.
not_available Maybe they'll find us by then.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available Yeah maybe.
not_available What are you doing? There must be some wires in here.
not_available What do you need wire for? To get you out of this.
not_available Adam.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Got it from a Caltrans server.
not_available Traffic camera, right near the mall.
not_available Look at that.
not_available It's a blue shirt.
not_available Isn't that what Kyle Singer was wearing? Yeah.
not_available I think there's enough to enhance.
not_available Release it to my screen.
not_available Got it.
not_available Kim.
not_available Yes.
not_available I need you a second.
not_available You got this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Alright.
not_available Is something wrong? You haven't been following what's going on at the prison, have you? No, Adam and I have been working on finding Singer.
not_available Why, what is it? Your dad's trying to break out Salazar.
not_available What? Yeah, he's not out yet but he's acting on his own authority.
not_available He's trying to remove Salazar by force.
not_available I don't understand what you mean "by force".
not_available Looks like he started a prison riot to cover the escape.
not_available Why is he doing this? That's what we're trying to figure out.
not_available When's the last time you heard from him? About a half hour ago.
not_available He asked me to issue a transfer order for Ramon Salazar and he gave me a password.
not_available And you did it? Yeah, he said that Salazar needed to be moved.
not_available But now you're telling me this isn't true? No, Kim.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Your dad lied to you.
not_available Why would he do that? Because he knew if he asked anybody else they would know he was violating protocol.
not_available What's gonna happen to him? We're gonna try to find him.
not_available The best way out of this whole situation is to find Kyle Singer.
not_available Then your dad will give up Salazar.
not_available So go back to work, help Adam.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available We're clear.
not_available We gotta find all their forces through one entrance to keep the personnel count.
not_available There must be another way, Jack.
not_available There is, but the prisoners have taken control.
not_available We're gonna have to fight our way through them.
not_available Get ready.
not_available Hit them up.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get them on their feet.
not_available Come on, let's go, let's go! Move, move it! Let's go! Hold your fire! We have hostages so back off! Hold your fire! Come on man! We can make it through.
not_available We've got to move.
not_available Let's go! Move! Let's go! Go! Move it! Move it! And in order to do this, our fossil fuels most be conserved.
not_available Kim, did you send me that Kalman filter? What? The Kalman filter, I needed to clean up that image.
not_available Oh, shoot! I forgot about it.
not_available It's in my help box.
not_available How can you forget about it? It's the only thing you're working on.
not_available I'm sorry, look I'm sending it to you, right now.
not_available Done.
not_available Kim, I don't know where your head is at, but we need to find Kyle Singer before he's contagious.
not_available Relax! I'm doing the best I can.
not_available The best I can isn't what we do around here, Kim.
not_available It's either done or it's not.
not_available So why are you lecturing me, it's in your system.
not_available Kaufman.
not_available Is there a problem? I just need to make sure things are running smoothly around here Look, Adam.
not_available I haven't had the chance to brief you but Jack created a situation over at the prison.
not_available What kind of situation? He started a riot to free Salazar.
not_available Now they're caught up in the middle of it.
not_available Wow.
not_available He even used Kim to create a transfer order that started the whole thing.
not_available So cut her a little slack.
not_available Umm Yeah, okay, I understand.
not_available We're all under a lot of pressure here.
not_available So let's just find Kyle Singer before it's too late.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Thanks, Michelle.
not_available Kyle, what are you doing? There's no way out of here.
not_available You don't deserve what happened.
not_available I do.
not_available If I die¡¦ the virus is dying with me! Kyle! Kyle! Put your feet up here! Kyle! Kyle, hold on.
not_available Oh, Kyle.
not_available A "Welcome Home" party? You shouldn't be doing this.
not_available What are you talking about? You've been running things.
not_available Show Ramon you're gonna be his partner.
not_available Not his caterer.
not_available Why do you care? You don't want to be involved in my business.
not_available No, puppy, I care about you.
not_available And I want you to get what you've earned.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Riot's still going on.
not_available But we know Ramon's alive.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But Bauer's got to get him out soon.
not_available CTU is getting close to finding Kyle Singer.
not_available And if they do, they'll never let Ramon go.
not_available Then make sure they don't find Singer.
not_available I'm working on it.
not_available Get it done.
not_available That's him, that's Singer.
not_available Was that a gun? Yeah.
not_available Someone's got him.
not_available We're not gonna be able to get the truck's license plate from this shot.
not_available I'll get access to the traffic cameras in the direction they're heading.
not_available See if we can find them again.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Michelle.
not_available We found Kyle Singer being driven away from the mall, 47 minutes ago.
not_available Are you working up a vehicle ID? We will, as soon as we're able to get any visual.
not_available This camera's damaged.
not_available It's malfunctional.
not_available Must have the hostages on the right.
not_available Try and pan the camera over.
not_available They may see the camera move.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Do it.
not_available There they are.
not_available We got to get in there before they start killing everyone.
not_available Come on! Come on! Faster! Faster! Let's start wasting the guards unless they let us walk First step outside, bang! Headshot from a sniper.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available I know, cause that's what went down in Chino They'll let the guard get wasted cause all they care about is keeping us in.
not_available What the hell are we doing here then? Give me your gun.
not_available Bring them over here.
not_available We're gonna have a little fun with them.
not_available Put them on their knees.

not_available You hear me? 
not_available You're gonna do it.

not_available It's easy, see? All you gotta do is smile and pull the trigger.
not_available Now it's one in five.

not_available Come on! If you're not gonna do it, we will.
not_available We have a winner.
not_available Let's hear it for the new guy.
not_available We're now seeing concrete results.
not_available This is a road we will continue to travel.
not_available I got a shot coming in from a camera at the next intersection definitely the same truck.
not_available Can you read the license plate? We won't be able to read anything until it finishes downloading.
not_available I just saw the IAD inquiry coming over the system about what you're father's doing at the prison.
not_available They're questioning the transfer you generated for him.
not_available I heard.
not_available If you want me to say that you didn't know he was gonna use it to break out Salazar¡¦ I will.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available Hold on.
not_available It stopped downloading, I'm getting an error message.
not_available Error 402 that means trouble with the internal router.
not_available Gael.
not_available What are you doing? There's a problem with one of the routers.
not_available I'm trying to fix it.
not_available Why don't you call Tech.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available I think I found the problem.
not_available Checks on circuit kicked in.
not_available Must have been one of the line surge.
not_available Should be up and running now.
not_available Let me know if you have any more problems.
not_available I will.
not_available Hey, it's back up.
not_available What was it? I'm not sure.
not_available Is it possible a line surge could have knocked out a router? Well not from my side, you can ask Chloe? Got it.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Michelle, I've got a plate on the pick up.
not_available Good, where do you last have it? The shots on the north part of Santa Fe Springs, it was driving west.

not_available I want everyone looking for this vehicle.
not_available Okay, right.
not_available Alright, Ryan, I'm back.
not_available So do you have any idea if Bauer is trying to break out Salazar on his own or if he is working with someone? I'm trying to figure that out now.
not_available I'll get back to you when I found out.
not_available You do that.
not_available Chloe? Yeah, Michelle? Are you following what's going on at the prison? I just saw the update come over.
not_available What the hell's happening? We don't have all the details yet but Jack's behind it.
not_available I need you to check his phone logs, e
not_available mail¡¦ See what case files he's accessed recently.
not_available What am I looking for? Anything that'll help us figure out why he's doing this.
not_available Are you sure? You really want me snooping in his office? Yes.
not_available You got it.
not_available Surgery? Yeah, this is Tony Almedia's wife Michelle.
not_available How's he doing?

not_available ing OR4.
not_available Yeah, they are.
not_available Where do you want it? 
not_available Send it to my desk top.
not_available Alright.
not_available It'll take a second.
not_available Right, there you go.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Four by four.
not_available More pressure.
not_available Hold that down.
not_available I've got it.
not_available /
not_available There you go.
not_available Do you have another clamp? Clamp.
not_available The laundry room's a hundred yards in.
not_available I'll ID the exact locations for the explosives once we get there.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir, we're ready for you.
not_available Monitor's up.
not_available You should be seeing it on your IPC.
not_available It's working.
not_available Okay.
not_available Alright, let's go.
not_available Radio silence while we're in there.
not_available If they hear us, they might kill everyone.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Alright! Round two! Then you.
not_available I'm a prisoner, not a guard.
not_available I'm Ramon Salazar.
not_available I'm sure you've heard of me.
not_available You should pick someone else, he's telling you the truth.
not_available He's just transferred to cell block less than a week ago.
not_available I'm a federal agent, I was escorting him out of the prison.
not_available That's why you've never seen us here before.
not_available Good.
not_available Federal agent.
not_available What's your name? Jack Bauer.
not_available Alright.
not_available It's gonna be agent Jack against Ramon Salazar.
not_available A battle to the finish! Come on, Jack.
not_available Show this foreigner how it's done.
not_available If I die, 
not_available my brother will find you.
not_available Shut up! Do it! Alright.
not_available You're up.
not_available Looks like your mother's a title, Jack.
not_available Ramon, stay down! Come on! All clear! Hold your fire! Jack! Jack! I have no triumphs.
not_available Only defeats.
not_available God! 
not_available Lab.
not_available This is Chloe O'Brian.
not_available I'm in Jack's office.
not_available Could you send someone up the drug kit, please? It's on its way.
not_available The differences on the issues are clear.
not_available But I believe you don't elect a platform.
not_available You elect a man.
not_available And I am frankly troubled by some of the personal choices that this president has made and continues to make.
not_available We're all aware of the allegations and indictments surrounding the President's former wife.
not_available Most of us have operated under the assumption that the President will not repeat his history of associating with the persons of questionable moral character.
not_available However, my office has just learned that the woman with whom the President is currently involved, Doctor Anne Packard is being accused of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial.
not_available A drug which later led to the deaths of three innocent people.
not_available This is outrageous.
not_available This debate is not a court of law nor is it a tabloid paper.
not_available This is neither the time nor the place to launch a personal attack on a private citizen.
not_available Mr.
not_available President the Senator still has 30 more seconds.
not_available Sir, please.
not_available This is exactly the right time.
not_available Because I believe the choices your leaders make in their own lives reflect the choices that they will make on your behalf.
not_available And so the question remains.
not_available Did the President know of these accusations and choose to ignore them? Or is he repeating past mistakes once again? Mr.
not_available President your rebuttal.
not_available I can tell you with complete confidence that the Senator's accusation is false.
not_available And that I believe it is the Senator's way of aborting the issues at hand.
not_available Now I came here tonight to discuss the real issues pressing our country.
not_available Oh, god.
not_available I assume that the Senator was 
not_available Now do you get it? I do not believe this is something to be swept under the rug and forgotten.
not_available It's positive.
not_available I'll go tell Michelle.
not_available Chloe, what are you doing in my dad's office? Michelle wanted me to go through your dad's stuff.
not_available Why? To find anything that can help us understand what he's doing.
not_available What's up? I wanted to know if a line surge could shut down a router on your side of the ITS room.
not_available No, my circuit protectors are upstairs.
not_available Not in my ITS.
not_available Why? Ah, it's probably nothing.
not_available Did you find anything? I can't talk about this.
not_available Why not, maybe I can help.
not_available You can't help so just go, okay? What's in the box? Just stuff I'm taking to Michelle.
not_available This is really an inappropriate behavior, Kim.
not_available Why are you doing this, Chloe? I mean I'm just trying to help you.
not_available You can't help.
not_available And I don't have to have this conversation.
not_available Under field op mandate, there's a regulation.
not_available I believe it's 40 or 41 that says that I have jurisdictional prerogative.
not_available So could you just leave? Not until you tell me what's in the box.
not_available I think your dad's been using drugs.
not_available What? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Rubber tourniquet, syringe.
not_available We just had the vials tested of opiates, It was positive.
not_available He's been acting really weird.
not_available Okay? It's really not fair you made me do this.
not_available It's very uncomfortable.
not_available Michelle? I didn't find anything in Jack's records but there is something you need to see.
not_available You found this in his office? I wanted to make sure what it was before I showed you.
not_available The liquid in these vials tested positive for opiates.
not_available Probably heroine.
not_available I think Jack's a user.
not_available I got it.
not_available A patrol car just found the truck Kyle Singer was in parked in a industrial complex in Fuller and fourth 2000 block.
not_available Pipe these into the teams on standby.
not_available Assume everyone on the site is contagious and use level 1 CDC protocol.
not_available Let's get him! Damn! Is there any other way out? No, we're pinned in.
not_available We must have known this could happen.
not_available What's the plan, Jack? Give me the shotgun.
not_available Give me the shotgun.
not_available Take off your uniform.
not_available I have worked the past year with my administration on my overall academic plan.
not_available The projection could not look better.
not_available Dessler.
not_available This is Cowgil.
not_available Approaching the industrial complex on Fuller.
not_available There are three warehouses on the property.
not_available I'll see if we can narrow it down with infrared.
not_available Roger.
not_available Kaufman.
not_available Adam, see if you can pull up an infrared satellite on the industrial complex.
not_available On it.
not_available Kim, log into the NHA server.
not_available We need to see if they have any satellites in position.
not_available Kim! Okay.
not_available What's the matter? Nothing, I'm fine.
not_available We just swept these blocks.
not_available There's no sign of Jack or Salazar.
not_available Look I got a team in the assault block.
not_available They can't do a proper search until we lock it down.
not_available That can take up to a half hour.
not_available If you want to get out of this thing, you gonna have to trust me.
not_available And do everything that I tell you.
not_available You understand? Alright.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Okay, here's what I want you to do.
not_available I want you to take that chopper and I want you sweep the perimeter.
not_available Chase! What are you doing, Jack? 
not_available You get these people to move back.
not_available Or you're gonna have to take me out.
not_available We need that chopper.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available I just spoke with Michelle, we're close to getting Kyle Singer.
not_available Close ain't gonna cut it this time.
not_available I gotta deliver Salazar now! I'm not letting you go, Jack! How long is it gonna take to find Kyle Singer? A half an hour? An hour? I gotta get Salazar in the air, in that chopper in the next 60 seconds.
not_available Or hundred thousand people will die.
not_available Let him go.
not_available Let him go? Let him go.
not_available We'll track the chopper.
not_available I need you to keep your people under control, Warden.
not_available Please.
not_available I can't have anything happen to Salazar.
not_available Alright.
not_available This is Warden Mitchell, I want all teams to stand down.
not_available I repeat, stand down! Agent Bauer will take Salazar to the SWAT chopper.
not_available I want a conformation from all teams on the stand down order.
not_available Let him take the chopper.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Alright? Back off.
not_available Alright, Jack.
not_available No one's gonna try and stop you.
not_available Get these men to back off and holster their weapons.
not_available Back off! Stand down! Let them through! Let's go.
not_available Get them to holster their weapons.
not_available Holdster your weapons! Lower your weapon! Stand down! Get the snipers down, off the roof, now! Now! 
not_available Off the roof! Get off the roof! Back off! Do what he says! We have Singer plus one.
not_available Center, Singer plus one.
not_available What's he doing? Disabling or calming the locator.
not_available Yes? Chase, it's Michelle.
not_available We have Kyle Singer.
not_available I can't hear you.
not_available We found Kyle Singer.
not_available We've got Kyle?! 
not_available Yes! Jack! Jack, we found Kyle Singer! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack!! You can talk about facts or figures all night, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Once again I see this as a question of judgment and integrity.
not_available Ignore this issue, an issue of rectitude and foresightedness Congratulations.
not_available Now you are an even bigger enemy to your country than me.
