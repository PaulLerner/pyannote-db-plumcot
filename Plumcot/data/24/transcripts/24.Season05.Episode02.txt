
not_available What's going on? 
not_available What do you mean? I'm your brother.
not_available Whatever it is, you can tell me.
not_available It's all right, really.
not_available Okay.
not_available One more chapter and we'll take a break.
not_available David ! Get help! Whoever did this, I want them dead or in custody by the time the Russians get here.
not_available I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty, Sir.
not_available No.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available I think that David was killed because of something he was about to tell me.
not_available He said that it concerned national security and that it involved you.
not_available Was she all right? No, Walt, she's not all right.
not_available She's having another one of her delusions.
not_available What is this, an interrogation? I just don't like being lied to.
not_available No one's lying to you, Derek.
not_available Yeah, I'm not hungry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You don't owe me an explanation.
not_available If you had wanted to tell me about your past, you would have told me already.
not_available Yeah? Jack, I know this isn't protocol, please don't hang up on me, I need your help.
not_available They got Tony and Michelle, Michelle is dead, Tony's in critical condition, now they're gonna kill me.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? I'm sorry I followed you, I'm just I'm just worried about my mother.
not_available You're going with me.
not_available Hold your fire, Chloe! Palmer was the primary target.
not_available Set you up.
not_available Make it look like you did it.
not_available You're the one that killed Palmer.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The President's retreat is still vulnerable.
not_available You need to post 2 more people here at Delta.
not_available It's a high probability point of infiltration.
not_available We'll have to pull assets from somewhere else.
not_available Yeah, Marcie, hi.
not_available Can you give me the figures? Excuse me, Sir.
not_available Sorry to interrupt.
not_available What is it, Edgar? We have a visual on a suspect, I thought you might want to know.
not_available He may be the Palmer shooter.
not_available Were you able to make an ID? I think you should see for yourself.
not_available About an hour before President Palmer was shot someone broke into the service entrance of the building across the street, the one the sniper used.
not_available We have a frame grab from a security video.
not_available I ran it through a high
not_available res filter, so it may take a few seconds to render.
not_available Audrey.
not_available What is going on here, Jack? They're setting me up to take the fall for Palmer's assassination.
not_available Palmer's not even president anymore.
not_available Why would they want him dead? I don't know.
not_available You need to get as far away from here as you can.
not_available Just disappear.
not_available No, what I need to do is to find out who really killed President Palmer.
not_available How are you gonna do that? Start at the beginning.
not_available Investigate the original crime scene.
not_available David Palmer was visiting his brother when he was shot.
not_available Maybe he left something there that can help me.
not_available That's crazy.
not_available Palmer was assassinated an hour ago.
not_available The place is gonna be crawling with Secret Service, FBI, local police.
not_available I need access to a building schematic and an interagency deployment grid.
not_available Can you get that for me or not? Yeah.
not_available I should be able to log on remotely from the site.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available How could you kill that guy? I'm sorry you had to see that, Derek.
not_available Get in the van.
not_available I'm not going anywhere with you.
not_available You're gonna do exactly what I tell you until I pass you off to your mother.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Let's get something straight, kid.
not_available The only reason you're still conscious is because I don't want to carry you.
not_available Now get in the van.
not_available Preliminary analysis indicates the video hasn't been doctored.
not_available Then Jack was in the building the sniper fired from at the same time President Palmer was assassinated.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available This whole thing is impossible.
not_available Bill, you were there when Jack was shot.
not_available He had not pulse, no vitals.
not_available And I have no idea how Jack staged his own death.
not_available But I understand his reasons.
not_available He was about to be handed over to the Chinese government to spend the rest of his life in prison.
not_available None of that explains why Jack would want to kill David Palmer.
not_available I had Curtis pull the phone logs.
not_available Palmer, Tony and Michelle were all talking to Jack right before he was supposedly killed.
not_available Our working theory is that they conspired to help Jack fake his own death.
not_available Now you're saying that Jack was behind the attack on Tony and Michelle, too? Why would Jack want to kill the people who helped him? Something may have happened and he stopped trusting them to keep his secret.
not_available Jack would never murder his friends.
not_available Audrey I don't want to believe Jack did this, either.
not_available But right now, it's the best explanation for the evidence that we have.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available The White House needs to know about this.
not_available Yeah, I'll call the President.
not_available Bill.
not_available What is it, Curtis? I had Adamson run a data recovery operation on Tony's phone records.
not_available They show Chloe was on those calls with President Palmer and Tony.
not_available Chloe knew Jack was alive? Apparently.
not_available We called her in an hour ago, she should have been here by now.
not_available I've been trying to call her on her cell but she's not answering.
not_available I wanted to run a locate but Spencer talked me out of it.
not_available If anything happens to her 
not_available Stop ! Have Adamson track her cell, we need to get to her before Jack does.
not_available Put out an interagency alert.
not_available Jack Bauer is now the prime suspect in President Palmer's assassination.
not_available Emphasize that he's a former agent, well
not_available trained and should be considered extremely dangerous.
not_available Excuse me, Sir.
not_available What is it Walt ? Mrs.
not_available Logan called again.
not_available I can't keep putting her off about this phone call with David Palmer.
not_available Why would David Palmer call my wife about a national security threat? That's what she says he wanted to talk to her about.
not_available A matter of national security.
not_available Maybe if I investigated the phone call? No, you need to stay focused on the Summit.
not_available I am, Sir, which is why we can't risk having Mrs.
not_available Logan obsess about this phone call.
not_available Showing her the truth might help her get on with her responsibilities today.
not_available So what are you what are you suggesting? Well, if David Palmer called her yesterday, our communications office will have a recording of their conversation.
not_available Get that for me.
not_available Yes, Sir.
not_available And Walt thank you for doing this.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Audrey Raines is holding on line 3.
not_available Ms.
not_available Raines, this is President Logan.
not_available You're also on with Walt Cummings.
not_available Sir, CTU has a suspect in the assassination of President Palmer.
not_available Good! Who is it? Ms.
not_available Raines? It's Jack Bauer, Sir.
not_available Jack Bauer's dead.
not_available We've all been living under that assumption, Sir.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What makes you think it's Bauer? CTU has verified surveillance video placing Jack Bauer at the same time, in the same building as the sniper who killed President Palmer.
not_available Audrey, this is Walt Cummings.
not_available Let me get clear on this.
not_available Are you saying that Bauer shot David Palmer? We're proceeding under that assumption, yes.
not_available Why? For what possible reason? David Palmer might have known that Jack Bauer was alive, knowledge that he shared with three other CTU agents, all of whom have been targeted in the last hour.
not_available The man does have a history of insubordination, irrational behavior, drug addiction.
not_available Jack Bauer has a history of great service to this country.
not_available How does this affect your threat assessment for the Summit? We're still recommending that you delay or reschedule until Jack Bauer's apprehended.
not_available Ms.
not_available Raines, you have a suspect.
not_available Find him.
not_available Yes, Sir.
not_available Sir, President Suvarov arrives within the hour.
not_available Should we think about informing his security chief that he's a potential target? No.
not_available No.
not_available I want this information limited to those involved in the manhunt for Jack Bauer.
not_available Understood? Yes, Sir.
not_available I found Haas.
not_available He and his men are all dead.
not_available How did this happen? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available The last time I spoke to Haas he was about to move on Bauer and the woman.
not_available Is there any sign of Bauer now? No.
not_available I'll dispatch a team and track him.
not_available We'll have him in 24 hours.
not_available No, let CTU find Bauer.
not_available Once they have him in custody, we'll take him out.
not_available You're not concerned Bauer will impede the operation? He won't have chance.
not_available We launch in less than an hour.
not_available All of their hardware's military spec.
not_available Fragmentation grenades, percussion grenades Here's a comm unit we can use.
not_available Who are these people? Yeah? Frank, will you please tell me what's going on? Diane, I know it's hard, but please try not to worry.
not_available Derek is fine.
not_available Where are you now? I'm about a half hour outside of L.A.
not_available Just tell me where to meet you.
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available Just keep heading towards the city.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
not_available Can I talk to him? Of course, yeah.
not_available It's your mother.
not_available Talk to her.
not_available Mom? Derek, are you okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm all right.
not_available Are you sure? Jack, we're about a block away.
not_available Say good
not_available bye to your mother.
not_available I have to hang up now, Mom.
not_available Derek, I love you.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available Get to the back of the vehicle.
not_available Go! While security agencies are remaining hushed, speculation begins to grow.
not_available We're told, though, that that speculation will not be addressed because the government says security right now is of utmost importance.
not_available Now, look behind me, you'll see the Los Angeles apartment building where President David Palmer was assassinated a little more than an hour ago.
not_available You can also see Americans of all ages have started to gather to mourn and pay their last respects to the beloved former president, who surprised many, almost three years ago with his 11th
not_available hour announcement, that he would not be seeking a second term.
not_available All right, go on through.
not_available Let her through.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Come on up front.
not_available Hold the light on the bag.
not_available Can you get a wireless access point from down here? Yeah, I'm reading the agents' transponders.
not_available I can track their locations to within three feet.
not_available Jack! There are 167 agents in and around the location, alone.
not_available I know that's why we better hope that this is gonna be the last place they're gonna be looking for me.
not_available Testing 1, 2, testing 1, 2, 3.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is field ops communication unit.
not_available All you need to do is put it in your ear and we're set to go.
not_available Derek, put out the light.
not_available Officer.
not_available I live in the building and I was told that I needed to check with one of the agents to get clearance to my appartement.
not_available All right, let me check that.
not_available What 
not_available Relax.
not_available He's really good at this.
not_available You sure he's okay? Yeah.
not_available I think.
not_available Chloe, do you copy? Yeah.
not_available Wayne Palmer's apartment is the penthouse.
not_available Going up now.
not_available Jack, there are four agents waiting at the lobby.
not_available Hold off on going up if you can.
not_available Too late.
not_available I'm entering the apartment.
not_available Most of the agents are in the living room.
not_available That must be where Palmer was shot.
not_available There are two rooms to the north, probably bedrooms they're clear, no agents.
not_available This first room is a study.
not_available Let me know if anyone comes this way.
not_available Will do, Jack.
not_available You keep calling him Jack.
not_available He told my mother and I his name's Frank.
not_available Who is he, really? His name's Jack Bauer.
not_available Up until a year and a half ago, he worked for the government.
not_available Is that why we're in the building where the president was killed? Please don't ask me any more questions.
not_available Can't you at least tell me why he had to pretend he was someone else? Certain people thought the best way to cover up their mistakes was to get rid of Jack.
not_available You mean, kill him? Yes.
not_available Jack had to give up everything and everyone in his life, including his daughter.
not_available He has a daughter? I've already told you more than I should.
not_available I have the computer in the study booted up.
not_available President Palmer had a user account.
not_available Is it password
not_available secured? No.
not_available There are about a dozen files.
not_available Only one of them's encrypted.
not_available That's where I'm gonna look.
not_available Okay, give me the computer's IP address.
not_available I'll upload a decryption program to it.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Someone's at the door.
not_available Not according to the deployment grid.
not_available There are no agents there.
not_available Do not move.
not_available Do not raise your voice.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available You killed my brother.
not_available Mr.
not_available Palmer, you know I didn't do that.
not_available Whatever evidence they showed you against me has been fabricated.
not_available I served your brother for years.
not_available I would've gladly given my life for his.
not_available He was my friend.
not_available The only reason that I am here, is to try and figure out why and how he was assassinated.
not_available I was hoping to find clues on that computer.
not_available Why don't you step into the next room, Jack, and ask the Secret Service to help you find it? Because I'm being set up.
not_available Whoever's behind this has planted evidence against me making me the shooter.
not_available It would be useless to try and convince the authorities otherwise.
not_available You think you're gonna convince me? If I killed your brother, why didn't I kill you when you walked through the door? Think about this, Wayne.
not_available Why would I be here? Please I need your help.
not_available Jack, how do you expect me to believe you under these circumstances? Take the gun.
not_available Jack, what are you doing? Take the gun.
not_available that after two terms in the House and one in the Senate, David Palmer was elected president with a 60% plurality.
not_available There you are, Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available states that he's been helped by the opposition for over David and I first got to know each other when he was elected to Congress.
not_available He and Charles never saw eye to eye politically, but David never let that get in the way of our friendship.
not_available Oh that picture's from his inauguration.
not_available At the ballI was one of the first people David asked to dance.
not_available and above all, honor! I need a few more minutes with your hair I know! I can do it myself.
not_available Just trying to help.
not_available I'm sorry, Evelyn, I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan May I have a word? 
not_available Of course.
not_available The president asked me to look into the call from David Palmer that you told him about.
not_available I was beginning to think you were ignoring me.
not_available So when did this call take place? Last night.
not_available It woke me up.
not_available I had fallen asleep watching the news, so it was somewhere between 10:00 and 11:00.
not_available Well, I'll have someone pull up the call from the audio archives.
not_available very thing that will defeat our enemies Walt.
not_available He doesn't believe me, does he? Charles.
not_available He thinks I'm making the whole thing up.
not_available I wouldn't say that, Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available Well, of course you wouldn't say it.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan 
not_available Walt, you can go now.
not_available partially scarred and weakened.
not_available He leaves behind a son and daughter, as well as a shocked and grieving nation.
not_available President David Palmer, dead today at age 55.
not_available Your brother say or do anything out of the ordinary before he was shot? He was acting distracted ever since he came to Los Angeles.
not_available I finally called him on it this morning.
not_available What'd he say? He never had the chance to say anything, Jack.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The decryption program's finished running.
not_available You should be able to open the file.
not_available Okay, I'm going into it now.
not_available That's the first chapter of his memoir.
not_available That doesn't make any sense why would he encrypt that? I mean, there are printouts of it all over the place.
not_available Maybe he hid some information in the document.
not_available We're gonna have to compare this to the printout, see if he added or changed anything.
not_available Got one right here.
not_available You haven't sent the file allocations.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available I need a higher level access code.
not_available Look, if you're still upset about me and Chloe I don't care about that.
not_available I care that if you hadn't left her on her own this morning, maybe she'd be okay right now.
not_available Don't you think I know that? Look, you're just making it harder for me to do my job.
not_available Use Chloe's access code: JJ72.
not_available You won't get fire
not_available walled with it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Edgar.
not_available What? This is weird.
not_available I tried logging in under Chloe's access code the system says I'm already signed in.
not_available Let me see That's because Chloe's logged in, remotely.
not_available Are you sure it's her? Yes see the way the traffic's redirected through an external socket? Even I don't know how to do that.
not_available Then she's alive.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Sir, it's Edgar.
not_available I think we can find Chloe.
not_available How ? She's accessing our system through a laptop.
not_available I'm running a locate now.
not_available What's she using our system to do? All I can see from here is she's tracking Secret Service and FBI deployments.
not_available The locate came back.
not_available She's at Wayne Palmer's building.
not_available The signal's faint.
not_available It's possible she's in the parking garage under the building.
not_available Let me know if she changes location.
not_available Why would Chloe be at the scene of Palmer's assassination, tracking agents? She wouldn't be unless someone was forcing her.
not_available What do you mean? Maybe Jack left evidence behind he needs to erase.
not_available Surrounded by all of those agents? Bill, that doesn't make sense.
not_available Jack can explain it to us when we apprehend him.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan at CTU.
not_available I need to speak to the Secret Service field director immediately.
not_available Yes.
not_available Have you left yet? No, we were delayed.
not_available We're still loading the truck.
not_available You should be on your way by now.
not_available Be there in 20 minutes, as planned.
not_available Call me when you're approaching.
not_available Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop Right there he added something in the middle of a sentence: a name and an address.
not_available There.
not_available "Chevensky 
not_available 16 Transport Way." Chloe, did you get that? It looks like an address.
not_available Yes.
not_available Transport Way is a street at the Ontario airport.
not_available Okay, I want you to check all inbound flights into Ontario.
not_available Look for a passenger Chevensky.
not_available Try and make the connection.
not_available Jack, the Secret Service is changing its deployment.
not_available How? Suddenly, there are a lot of agents moving into the building.
not_available I'm on my way down.
not_available They know that I'm here.
not_available Let me help you get out of here, Jack.
not_available No.
not_available You can't risk being connected to me.
not_available And until we know who to trust, you can't tell anybody about what we found, do you understand? I'm going to do everything I can to find out who did this to your brother.
not_available I'll be in touch.
not_available Chloe, I need another way out of here.
not_available Checking.
not_available Jack, across the hall, through the kitchen.
not_available One agent at the door.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'm in the elevator.
not_available Where are they concentrating their agents? Jack, they cut off access to my grid.
not_available I don't know where the agents are.
not_available They were grouping in the lobby.
not_available I'm getting out on the second floor.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available What'd you get for me on Chevensky? He's not a passenger, he's a baggage supervisor at the airport.
not_available Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian! The perimeter is sealed! There is no way out! Step into view with your hands in the air! We know you're down here! Step into view with your hands in the air! Do not shoot! We need them alive! No one fire! No one fire! Do not fire! Step out of the vehicle! Check the back! Get the side! Step to your left! Get down on your knees! Cuff her! Open the back! Bauer's not here.
not_available Secure the area.
not_available Get in! Give me my bag! Come on Got it.
not_available Frank.
not_available Yeah, it's me.
not_available Listen, Derek is all right.
not_available I just need to know where you are.
not_available I'm on the 210 at the 10.
not_available Okay, I want you to take the 10 East to the Ontario Airport.
not_available When you get there, I want you to go to the parking lot in front of the terminal.
not_available I'll meet you on the west side of that parking lot.
not_available Do you understand me? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Diane, listen to me.
not_available I am so sorry that I got you involved in this.
not_available But everything's gonna be all right.
not_available I'll be there in a few minutes, okay? Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, this is Agent Jennings.
not_available There's no sign of Jack Bauer yet, but we've apprehended your agent, Chloe O'Brian.
not_available She was trying to escape our agents and get away from the building.
not_available You're telling me she wasn't under duress? Not as far as I can tell.
not_available Put her on the phone.
not_available Uncuff her.
not_available Bill Buchanan wants to talk to you.
not_available Hi.
not_available Chloe, what the hell's going on? Jack didn't kill anybody.
not_available He's being framed to cover up the real reason Palmer was assassinated.
not_available This is according to Jack.
not_available This is according to the man who killed Palmer.
not_available I heard his dying confession.
not_available You'll find his body at the refinery, just north of the city, at Variel and Topanga.
not_available Chloe, do you have evidence that Palmer's assassination has anything to do with the Summit? No.
not_available Jack's trying to figure all that out.
not_available How? Where is he? I can't tell you.
not_available Why not? Because I don't think you believe him.
not_available I think you're just trying to arrest him.
not_available Chloe, I'm not going to ask you again.
not_available I'm ordering you to tell me where Jack is.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'd like to tell you, but I can't.
not_available Chloe! Sir? Bring her back to CTU.
not_available Curtis, take a team to the refinery.
not_available See what you can find there.
not_available Edgar, make sure Chloe goes into a holding cell when she gets back.
not_available That woman, Chloe she told me some stuff about what you used to do.
not_available Yeah, well, she shouldn't have.
not_available Why did you have to lie? Couldn't you have just told us the truth? First of all, Derek, you have to understand that I never thought anything like this could ever happen.
not_available After your mother rented me that room, I started to remember what it was like to have a family.
not_available How nice it was.
not_available I started to believe that a guy like me could actually get a second chance.
not_available I know you don't believe this now but I really do care about you.
not_available And I care about your mother.
not_available I hope, one day, you can understand that.
not_available Charles? Evelyn said you wanted to talk to me? I do.
not_available Did Walt find the tape of the phone call? I told him approximately when it took place.
not_available Why don't we sit down? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't want to sit down.
not_available All right.
not_available You don't need to be concerned that there's any connection between David's death and the phone call that he made to you.
not_available He said it was a matter of national security.
not_available Those were his exact words.
not_available There's got to be a connection, of course.
not_available There isn't.
not_available David was killed by an unstable ex
not_available CTU agent.
not_available This was not a conspiracy.
not_available This was one man acting out of some kind of grudge.
not_available Did you hear the call? Marty, can we just drop this? Did you or didn't you hear it?! Martha, it's David Palmer.
not_available Did I wake you? No, no, David, not at all.
not_available What's going on? I need to talk to you.
not_available It's hardly a matter of national security, but I'm hosting a charity dinner next month for the Art in Action Scholarship Program.
not_available No.
not_available That's not what he said.
not_available No.
not_available That's not it.
not_available I would very much like you and the president to be there No.
not_available That is not it.
not_available That is not it, Charles.
not_available That's not it.
not_available Let me 
not_available Martha, listen! Thank you, Martha.
not_available Of course.
not_available Please send the president my best.
not_available That's not what he said.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available No, that is that is a trick.
not_available I am not crazy.
not_available Listen to me Marty Martha! I know what I heard! 
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I know what I heard.
not_available I spoke to Dr.
not_available Hill.
not_available He said if you were not consistent with your medication, you could become disoriented.
not_available Your memory can be affected.
not_available He said that? 
not_available Yes! That's why you remember something different.
not_available I know you don't like how these pills make you feel, but you need to take them.
not_available If Jack was responsible for President Palmer's assassination, why would Chloe cover for him? It just doesn't make sense.
not_available There's something else going on here, and we're missing it.
not_available NSA just intercepted some chatter identifying the summit as a target.
not_available We're sourcing it now, but the reliability is approaching 95%.
not_available Is there a timeframe? Within the next 15 minutes.
not_available That's when the Russian President is scheduled to land.
not_available President Logan said he will not postpone this summit.
not_available In light of this, he may not have a choice.
not_available Put me through to Mike Novick.
not_available I'm watching Suvarov's helicopter leave the airbase.
not_available His arrival at the retreat is on schedule.
not_available As are we.
not_available We'll go dark now.
not_available No communication until after you strike.
not_available I will monitor your progress from here.
not_available Understood.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? Yeah, Mike, what is it? CTU has confirmed intelligence suggesting President Suvarov's helicopter will be targeted.
not_available How good is this intelligence? 
not_available Very good.
not_available They're updating their recommendation that you delay or reschedule.
not_available No.
not_available I've told them, I'm telling you.
not_available I will not postpone this summit! Then at least, have Suvarov alter his arrival plan.
not_available His chopper can land at a different site and he can be brought here by motorcade.
not_available The risk would be substantially reduced.
not_available And the impact of his arrival would also be reduced.

not_available Ma'am, it's a matter of security! I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation.
not_available She's not going to be a problem? No.

not_available It'll only be a matter of time until the president is notified of the demands.
