not_available Previously on 24.
not_available l don't want to see either one of you ever again.
not_available Do we have a deal or not? 
not_available Yeah, we got a deal.
not_available l'm going after him.
not_available We're done.
not_available We're just gettin' started.
not_available Jenny! We need to talk about you having Tarin arrested.
not_available l know you consider Tarin a friend.
not_available We are more than friends.
not_available We're in love.
not_available You've been carrying on with this man behind my back? Who are these men, Samir? 
not_available These are men I have recruited.
not_available We can't get the rods out of the country, so let's use them as a radiological bomb.
not_available We'll show the Americans how strong we are.
not_available Samir! Over here! Î¤here are people chasing me.
not_available Î¤hey have the rods you're looking for.
not_available l thought you had the rods.
not_available They turned against me.
not_available Just get me out of here.
not_available We'll get you out, Mr.
not_available Hassan.
not_available When things get this colossally screwed up, people look for someone to blame.
not_available So what have you got in mind? Renee Walker
not_available she killed one of our main leads.
not_available We're talking about a woman who put her life on the line when she didn't have to.
not_available Someone has to pay for this, Brian.
not_available I'm sending someone over from Justice
not_available Kristin Smith.
not_available She'll take care ofeverything.
not_available Î¤hey're setting you up.
not_available Don't say another word.
not_available It's too late.
not_available This is over.
not_available We're leaving now.
not_available Îands in the air.
not_available Do it now! You offering to bring in Farhad? Yes.
not_available lf you drop the criminaI investigation against Renee Walker.
not_available lf we do this, Jack, it's not for one rescue operation.
not_available lt's till this whole thing is over and done.
not_available DeaI.
not_available The following takes place between 1:00 a.m.
not_available and 2:00 a.m.
not_available We're about to transport him to the embassy.
not_available You have two minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bashir, clear the room.
not_available Tarin, did they hurt you? Not yet.
not_available Î¤hey won't until they get me to our embassy.
not_available l tried to reason with my father, but he wouldn't listen.
not_available Îe thinks you're involved in the conspiracy with his brother.
not_available Even after l told him about us, he doesn't trust you.
not_available You told him about us? 
not_available l hoped it would change his mind.
not_available But if anything, it's made things worse between us.
not_available Come closer.
not_available Listen to me, Kayla.
not_available Î¤here is a way out of this.
not_available There are a few men still loyal to me.
not_available Bashir is one of them.
not_available He's agreed to help me escape.
not_available As soon as he's able, Bashir will slip me a handcuff key, and he's placed a gun in the car for me to find.
not_available You won't hurt anyone? 
not_available The gun is so I won't have to.
not_available Once l'm free, l have a place to stay until the Americans grant me asylum.
not_available Kayla, I want you to come with me.
not_available Meet me at the Teodore Hotel.
not_available Promise me you'lI come.
not_available Tarin, we need to go.
not_available Cole, he's dead! Just go.
not_available What? Just go.
not_available Nobody knows you had anything to do with this.
not_available lt's my fault.
not_available l lied about everything
not_available who I am, what I've done.
not_available l'lI call the police.
not_available l deserve to take the blame for this.
not_available What's done is done.
not_available We're cleaning this up, and no one's ever gonna know what happened.
not_available l don't want you involved.
not_available I'm already involved.
not_available We're gonna strip down this van so it can't be I.D.
not_available 'd.
not_available We'll dump the bodies in the swamp.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey! They're scum, Dana, and no one's gonna miss 'em.
not_available Do you want to go to prison for the rest of your life? For them? Get started on the van.
not_available I'll go get the other one.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, the president's on the line.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is Îastings.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, I'm here with Rob Weiss.
not_available l was told you have urgent news.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available We received a call from Farhad Îassan.
not_available Farhad? Yes.
not_available As we suspected, he was trying to smuggle the nuclear rods out of the country.
not_available The people he's working with have turned against him.
not_available What do we know? Farhad believes they want to use the rods to construct a dirty bomb and set it off somewhere here in New York City.
not_available Why would they do this? Between Îassan's crackdowns and C.Î¤.U., we've backed them into a corner.
not_available This is their response.
not_available Do you believe him? Yes, l do.
not_available Farhad is turning himself in.
not_available Îe's agreed to help us prevent this attack.
not_available Where is Farhad now? He's in a warehouse just outside the city near Forest Hills.
not_available l've enlisted Jack Bauer to lock him down.
not_available Now, Madam President, the men who turned against Farhad are covert assets for the I.R.K.
not_available lf we can get access to the I.R.K.
not_available intelligence files, Farhad may be able to help us I.D.
not_available these men.
not_available lt will put us that much closer to tracking them down.
not_available Î¤hose files are the lifeblood of Îassan's intelligence operation.
not_available Îe'll never hand them over, especiaIly in his current frame of mind.
not_available Îell, the man's gone off the deep end.
not_available Well, maybe this will pull him out of it.
not_available Tell Hassan we have found his brother and l need to speak to him immediately.
not_available Contact Tim Woods at Homeland.
not_available Have him put together a briefing.
not_available l need to know exactly what we're facing if, God forbid, this attack happens.
not_available Î¤hank you, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available l'll be in the counsel chamber.
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Weiss.
not_available Yeah? Are we alone? Yeah.
not_available What is it? l want to let you know that I've decided not to pursue charges against Renee Walker.
not_available What? Why not? I told you
not_available We have a lot more to worry about right now than blaming Walker.
not_available Walker murdered a valuable lead that might have gotten us to those nuclear rods.
not_available You're not hearing me.
not_available We have a new lead nowFarhad Hassan
not_available and that is what I am pursuing.
not_available You want to replace me as head of C.T.U., be my guest.
not_available But until you do, stay the hell out ofmy way.
not_available Îastings, you're making
not_available I'll let you know when Bauer reaches Farhad.
not_available Farhad Hassan is located in the northeast corner of the warehouse.
not_available We're gonna have to move fast because he's injured.
not_available King, Lynch, you're gonna go in from the south.
not_available Owen and l will cover your flank.
not_available Understood.
not_available Soon as we've got him locked down, we're gonna initiate our interrogation.
not_available C.Î¤.U.'s gonna upload files on probable suspects.
not_available l need that available and on a computer soon as possible.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, we're getting a call routed through C.T.U.
not_available lt's Farhad Îassan.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available How close are you? Ten minutes out.
not_available Are you okay? There's someone here.
not_available They're close.
not_available They're looking for me.
not_available Please hurry.
not_available Madam President.
not_available l'm told you have my brother.
not_available What happened? Please.
not_available Îe called C.Î¤.U.
not_available and surrendered himself.
not_available l don't understand.
not_available Î¤he men that Farhad was working with turned against him, and they have taken the nuclear rods.
not_available Îe believes that they intend to construct a dirty bomb to attack this city.
not_available Now, apparently, these men are members of your covert intelligence operations here in the United States.
not_available l find that hard to believe.
not_available Your brother has no reason to lie.
not_available By turning himself in, he's facing the death penalty.
not_available We have to assume he's telling the truth.
not_available l need for you to give us intelligence files for every asset you have in this country so Farhad can identify these terrorists.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I have given you a great deal of latitude to sort out your domestic situation.
not_available And now there is a threat to my homeland, and I need your cooperation.
not_available l suggest you turn Farhad over to me and let my people question him.
not_available We'll get the answers you need.
not_available There's no time for that.
not_available There's a C.T.U.
not_available team moving on Farhad as we speak.
not_available They need to question him on
not_available site.
not_available l need the files.
not_available What you're asking is a serious breach of our security.
not_available l understand that.
not_available But you need to understand that, if this radiological attack takes place, l will be forced to retaliate.
not_available You will attack my country? l will have no choice.
not_available l need those files.
not_available And I need them now.
not_available l'll call my acting head of security.
not_available You'll get the files in a few minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I want you to know, Tarin, that I don't believe you are guilty of treason.
not_available But I have no choice but to follow orders.
not_available You don't have to explain yourself, Nabeel.
not_available l would do the same thing in your position.
not_available l don't hold any of this against you.
not_available Whatever happens to me, you must not blame yourself.
not_available Never forget that.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Don't move.
not_available What are you doing? Nabeel, give me your weapon now.
not_available Slowly, two fingers.
not_available Come on.
not_available Driver, pull over here.
not_available Remove your seat belts.
not_available Put your hands on your head.
not_available Both of you.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Now.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available Put your hands down.
not_available Tarin, don't do this.
not_available You'll only make things worse for yourself.
not_available You know what they'll do to me at our embassy.
not_available It can't be any worse.
not_available lt's President Îassan.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Come on! 
not_available Let's go.
not_available In the back.
not_available Open it up.
not_available Take out your cuffs.
not_available Lock yourselves down.
not_available Nabeel isn't answering.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Transporting Tarin to the embassy.
not_available Keep trying to reach him on his mobile.
not_available lf he doesn't answer, send a security team to track him.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And contact Colonel Al Jhanis.
not_available Î¤ell him on my authority to give C.Î¤.U.
not_available access to the files requested.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hello.
not_available It's me.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm leaving the U.N.
not_available right now.
not_available ls everything all right? 
not_available Yes, it worked.
not_available Meet me at the hotel.
not_available I'll be there in 1 0 minutes.
not_available l love you, Kayla.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available Go ahead, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Farhad, are you there? 
not_available Yes, yes, l'm here.
not_available Our field team is approaching the south entrance.
not_available Stay where you are until they secure the site.
not_available Îe's almost on me.
not_available l can't stay here.
not_available Do not move until they lock down that shooter.
not_available Do you understand me? 
not_available Farhad? Farhad? Farhad, talk to me.
not_available Over here! Medic! Come on! Medic! That's him.
not_available That's Farhad.
not_available Owen, take your team and sweep the area.
not_available Chloe, we've got Farhad, but he's been hit.
not_available I need those files immediately.
not_available l.R.K.
not_available lntelligence just sent them over.
not_available Good.
not_available [ C.T.U.
not_available Agents Shouting In Distance .]
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's done.
not_available Farhad is no longer a problem.
not_available Are you sure? l shot him twice, but the police arrived, and I had to get out of there.
not_available You know where to find us.
not_available Yes.
not_available [ C.T.U.
not_available Agent .]
not_available Clear! 
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Speak to me.
not_available We got two large
not_available caliber slugs to the abdomen.
not_available He's bleeding out.
not_available l don't think he's gonna make it to the hospital.
not_available Do whatever you have to do to stabilize him.
not_available We need to talk to him.
not_available Now.
not_available Go! 
not_available This is "B" team.
not_available We found their truck.
not_available There's no sign of the rods.
not_available Let me know as soon as these files are uploaded.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hassan, in a few seconds, l'm going to show you photographs of covert operatives working for your country within the United States.
not_available l need you to identify the men who stole the rods from you.
not_available Can you do that for us? Yes.
not_available Are those files uploaded yet? Almost.
not_available Come on! Blood pressure's dropping.
not_available We got a rapid heartbeat.
not_available What the hell's happening? 
not_available He's going into shock.
not_available Give me 30 c.c.'s epinephrine.
not_available You keep that man alive! You understand me? Keep him alive! Let me do my job! 
not_available Please make that your top priority.
not_available Right away.
not_available The Î¤elePresence conference is ready, Madam President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good to see you, gentlemen.
not_available Madam President, Brian Hastings at C.Î¤.U.
not_available has brought us up to speed.
not_available And we're ready to review some specifics with you.
not_available Good.
not_available l'm listening.
not_available lf you would refer to your monitor and the diagram of Midtown Manhattan.
not_available According to C.T.U., the stolen nuclear rods have a maximum explosive yield of 300 pounds.
not_available That's enough radiological material to contaminate approximately one square mile.
not_available If the device were detonated in a more densely populated area of Manhattan, we could be looking at casualties in the tens of thousands.
not_available Dr.
not_available Landry? Most of the deaths would be from severe radiation poisoning.
not_available The remainder of the victims would expire from radiationinduced illnesses
not_available primarily leukemia and other cancers.
not_available We also have to consider that the affected area would be rendered uninhabitable for approximately 40 years.
not_available Obviously a citywide evacuation is out of the question.
not_available That's right.
not_available There are millions of people on this island with few points of egress.
not_available lt would take days to get them out.
not_available Not to mention that going public with this information would cause mass panic.
not_available l agree.
not_available We need to keep this threat from the public for now, focus our efforts on making sure that this attack never happens.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available believes the nuclear rods are still outside the city, so they're fortifying radiation
not_available detection efforts at the bridges and tunnels.
not_available We are also hardening high
not_available value targets such as the financial district, landmarks, subways.
not_available We can't ignore that the U.N.
not_available may also be a target.
not_available Given the danger, I think we should evacuate the entire building.
not_available We can resume the conference from a safe location.
not_available All right, inform the delegates of the situation.
not_available Thank you, gentlemen.
not_available Madam President.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available has your brother in custody.
not_available He's been shot.
not_available They're trying to stabilize him.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Sir, Agent Rahim is calling for you.
not_available He says he's located Nabeel.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we found Nabeel and his driver locked down in the back of their vehicle.
not_available Tarin has escaped.
not_available What? 
not_available Nabeel wishes to speak to you, sir.
not_available Yes, okay, put him on.
not_available l'm sorry, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Î¤arin had a gun with him.
not_available I don't understand how.
not_available Are you saying somebody helped him escape? lt would seem so.
not_available But, Mr.
not_available President, there's something else you need to know.
not_available Right after he escaped, l overheard Î¤arin on the phone.
not_available l believe he was speaking to your daughter.
not_available Kayla? Are you sure about this? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available lt sounded like he was going to meet her somewhere in the city.
not_available Okay.
not_available Kayla, call me back.
not_available Call me back, Kayla.
not_available Come inside.
not_available Oh, thank God, you're all right.
not_available Oh! l've contacted an American lawyer who's an expert at international law.
not_available Îe's agreed to meet us in two hours.
not_available This is such a terrible situation.
not_available Yet l've never felt so happy.
not_available l feel the same.
not_available Mmm! Mr.
not_available Bauer, we did our best.
not_available He didn't make it.
not_available l know you did.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We swept the area, sir.
not_available It's clear.
not_available No hostiles.
not_available No trace of the nuclear rods.
not_available Copy that.
not_available C.T.U., this is Bauer.
not_available We lost him.
not_available Farhad's dead.
not_available Damn it.
not_available l still think we've got another play.
not_available Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed.
not_available We came up on him too fast.
not_available They don't know how badly he was wounded.
not_available What are you proposing, Jack? l'm saying we use Farhad as dead bait.
not_available Leak it to the press that we've got him in custody and he survived.
not_available We're transporting him to a local hospital where authorities are going to question him.
not_available They'll have to make a move on him.
not_available He knows too much.
not_available Sounds like a Îail Mary.
not_available Right now, it's the only play we've got.
not_available But if they make a move on Farhad, which l think they wilI, we'll be waiting for them.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, you said you wanted me in till this was resolved.
not_available This is it.
not_available We have Îassan's intelligence files.
not_available We can scan and crossreference with facial
not_available recognition software, maybe spot the terrorists before they attack.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available lt's not exactly standard procedure ferrying a dead man's body across the city, but I am willing to give it a shot.
not_available We'll figure out a hospital route and put a press statement together.
not_available You get ready on your end.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Get that body ready for transport.
not_available Owen, assemble your men.
not_available Briefing in less than five.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Aerial 1 is in position over the route, sir.
not_available Sniper teams have checked in.
not_available They're all in place.
not_available Come on, hurry up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available lt's over, Dana.
not_available Let's get the other body and get cleaned up before we head back to C.T.U.
not_available Cole.
not_available Cole, what about us? l don't know.
not_available We have just received word from New York Counter Î¤errorist headquarters that Farhad Hassanbrother of Islamic Republic of Kamistan President Omar Hassan
not_available has been found alive.
not_available We're told that Farhad Hassan contacted C.T.U.
not_available a short while ago and agreed to turn himself over to authorities.
not_available Farhad is alive.
not_available What? C.T.U.
not_available responded immediately, but, when they arrived, they found him shot.
not_available No word yet on how Farhad Hassan sustained these gunshot injuries, but we do know that he is expected to survive and he's being transported to St.
not_available Julian's Hospital under heightened security where he will be questioned by authorities.
not_available This is impossible.
not_available Farhad has been on the run since early this evening
not_available l shot him twice.
not_available But you didn't make sure he was dead.
not_available I told you I didn't have time.
not_available l'll make this right.
not_available I'll go back.
not_available You're too conspicuous.
not_available Farhad will be heavily protected.
not_available But if Farhad talks, the authorities could find us before we can build the weapon.
not_available You think we don't know the implications? We're sending Marcos.
not_available Îis mother's American.
not_available They won't suspect him.
not_available Îe's in the truck with the rods.
not_available Îello? Mom, it's me.
not_available Marcos? Yes.
not_available Listen, I can't talk for long.
not_available What is it? Are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine, Mom.
not_available l need you to do something for me.
not_available It's very important.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, what is it? l need you to get up right now and leave the city.
not_available Go to Aunt Shelley's.
not_available Aunt Shelley's? Just do it for me, okay? Don't ask me why.
not_available Leave right now.
not_available Marcos, this is crazy.
not_available l'm not gonna leave the apartment in the middle of the night for no reason.
not_available There's a reason.
not_available l just can't tell you what it is right now.
not_available Please, Mom, do this for me.
not_available Where are you? Don't worry about me.
not_available Well, l'm not going anywhere unless I know you're all right.
not_available l'll meet you at Aunt Shelley's, and I'll explain everything.
not_available Go, Mom.
not_available Now.
not_available Okay, I'm leaving.
not_available l have to go.
not_available I love you.
not_available Are you ready, my friend? Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available lt's time.
not_available You need to keep him looking alive the entire way.
not_available You're all clear on what you need to do? Yes, sir.
not_available Jack, it's Îastings.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We've coordinated with news outlets.
not_available Î¤hey put out the false report of Farhad's arrest and transport to the hospital for questioning.
not_available Î¤he hook has been baited.
not_available The most logical place for them to attack is when we're en route.
not_available That's where we're gonna be most vulnerable.
not_available N.Y.P.D.
not_available and SWAÎ¤ are mobilizing now.
not_available Î¤hey're going to be embedded at strategic points along the way.
not_available Î¤hey're also securing St.
not_available Julian's Hospital.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Î¤ell the teams it is imperative we take these terrorists alive.
not_available They've been briefed, Jack.
not_available Okay, we're moving out.
not_available You two take the follow van.
not_available Owen, you're with me in the ambulance.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Îey.
not_available You all right? Yes, sir.
not_available l know you and your men have not had a lot of field experience, and we have put you in an extreme situation.
not_available But l promise you, if we are attacked, every part of this route is covered.
not_available We've got a lot of support out there.
not_available l'm fine, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Our delegation is preparing to head to Fort McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available We'll be setting up a temporary ops center there where we'lI be able to monitor the situation.
not_available And the other delegates? U.N.
not_available Security will coordinate the evacuation.
not_available Everything should go smoothly.
not_available Can l get you anything, Madam President? No.
not_available Î¤hank you, Rob.
not_available You have done more than enough.
not_available l'm just sorry that your first few months on the job have been so challenging.
not_available l wouldn't have had it any other way.
not_available l'll see you in a moment.
not_available l spoke to one of my aides.
not_available He told me my brother is dead.
not_available l'm afraid so.
not_available When C.Î¤.U.
not_available is finished with their operation, l would like Farhad's remains to be returned to my country.
not_available Personally, l don't care where his body rots, but my mother will want a proper burial.
not_available l'll see that it's done.
not_available But right now, Mr.
not_available President, we need to evacuate the U.N.
not_available l am not leaving, Madam President.
not_available l'm staying here.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available My daughter, Kayla, is missing.
not_available Missing? Kayla is romantically involved with my former head of security.
not_available She's run off with him.
not_available Tell me what we can do to help.
not_available l appreciate that, but my security teams are searching for her now.
not_available l understand how worried you must be, but there is nothing that you can do to help her by staying here.
not_available Please, come where you'll be safe.
not_available l can't, Madam President.
not_available She's somewhere in the city, with no idea that a nuclear threat exists.
not_available l won't go anywhere until she's been found.
not_available All right.
not_available l understand.
not_available l will talk to you very soon.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Î¤hey're turning west on Sixth Street, pulling into the hospital.
not_available Chloe, bring up the hospital security feed.
not_available Get facial recognition up and running.
not_available C.Î¤.U., this is Bauer.
not_available We're moving into position.
not_available Farhad's body is being taken to his room.
not_available Let's go! Secure these doors! 
not_available Bring up the exterior cameras.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's me.
not_available Hey.
not_available l've been released.
not_available I'm free to go.
not_available Good.
not_available Chloe told me what you did.
not_available You leveraged Hastings, said that you would head up Field Ops until this crisis was over in exchange for C.Î¤.U.
not_available dropping any possible charges against me.
not_available l
not_available l didn't ask you to do that, Jack.
not_available l know you didn't.
not_available Someone in the White House is trying to set you up to take responsibility for the failure of our mission.
not_available And I couldn't let that happen, because you did nothing wrong.

not_available lt looks like a remote detonator.
not_available l think he's wearing a vest.
not_available Chloe, can you disarm it from there? Possibly.
not_available If l can pin down the detonator model, l may be able to scramble the arming code using the transmitter in the mobile comm.

not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available We're moving to the third floor.
not_available Where are we at with the vest? 
not_available l've identified the detonator, Jack.
not_available lt's German
not_available made, K7 variant.
not_available But that model is used in a lot of configurations.
not_available l'm gonna need a visual on the vest.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Owen, it's Jack.
not_available C.Î¤.U.
not_available cannot disarm the vest unless they see it.
not_available Get the hostile underneath one of the surveillance cameras and make him show it to you.
not_available l repeat.

not_available We're set in position near Farhad's room.
not_available Now, what's the status? lt's a D.D.R.
not_available configuration.
not_available l just need to pull up the frequency of the receiver.
not_available Chloe, you've got about 30 seconds before they reach that room.
not_available Got it
not_available 3.1 5 gigahertz, standard G.S.M.
not_available Running it through the mobile comm now.

not_available They can't get in here.
not_available At least, not yet.

not_available they scrambled the arming code.
not_available You need to set it off manually.

not_available l'll talk you through it.
not_available Can you open the detonator control? Yeah.
not_available l
not_available l think so.
