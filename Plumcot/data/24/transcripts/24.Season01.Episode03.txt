
not_available Kim got an email this morning from Janet York.
not_available They might be out together.
not_available You're going to the valley with Alan York? 
not_available l'm starting to worry.
not_available Can't you get here? l don't have time to explain.
not_available Very bad things are happening.
not_available Our daughter is missing.
not_available That's pretty bad.
not_available My dad is a government agent.
not_available lf l'm not home in the next half
not_available hour, he'll be all over this.
not_available Time to call Mommy.
not_available Go to hell! Call your mom! The firstAfrican
not_available American with a shot at the White House.
not_available Palmer has left the suite.
not_available He is exposed.
not_available We have a very high confidence that there will be an attempt on his life today.
not_available A 747just blew up over the Mojave Desert.
not_available You look just like Martin Belkin.
not_available So when do l get the lD? 
not_available Soon.
not_available There may be an element inside the agency involved with the hit on Palmer.
not_available Don't trust anybody.
not_available l'm gonna go lD 'em.
not_available Take this card.
not_available Give it to Jamey.
not_available She'll match it to a computer.
not_available Find the computer, you've got the dirty agent.
not_available l got a match on the card.
not_available lt came from Nina's computer.
not_available Authorisation? Bauer, 4393, CTU.
not_available OK, we're on it.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you get a match.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, l talked to her.
not_available Thank God.
not_available What'd she say? 
not_available She and Janet went to some party.
not_available So are you gonna pick 'em up? 
not_available l don't know where she is.
not_available She wouldn't say.
not_available What? Well, l don't know, maybe l'm being paranoid, but she sounded different.
not_available l don't know.
not_available She told me that she loved me before she hung up.
not_available That's not Kim.
not_available She knows she'll get grounded.
not_available She's trying to reduce the sentence.
not_available Yeah, you're probably right.
not_available How are you? Are you OK? Yeah, yeah, l'm fine.
not_available Look, is that guy York still with you? 
not_available Yeah, he's gonna take me home now.
not_available Shouldn't you wait by Janet's car? Who knows what shape the girls are gonna be in when they get back? Well, no.
not_available Alan doesn't seem to think that's necessary.
not_available Why don't you put Alan on the phone? 
not_available Jack, don't do this.
not_available Teri, just put him on the phone.
not_available OK.
not_available Alan, my husband would like to speak with you.
not_available Hi, this is Alan.
not_available Alan, Jack Bauer.
not_available Can't thankyou enough for helping out with this.
not_available l'm just glad the girls are with each other.
not_available Me too.
not_available Look, l'm stuck at work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Teri said l would appreciate it if you would hang out at the store and wait for them to return.
not_available Uh, l don't think they're gonna be back here for at least a couple of hours.
not_available lt's a pretty rough neighbourhood and l'd hate for there to be a problem when they return.
not_available Sure.
not_available We'll stay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available We had a deal, Mandy.
not_available You promised to get Belkin's lD in exchange for $1 million.
not_available Now she wants to double it? 
not_available She doesn't know how this works.
not_available No, this is your fault.
not_available You should never have involved an amateur.
not_available lf l'm such an amateur, how 
not_available l'm just trying to get us more money.
not_available There is no money.
not_available Not any more.
not_available lra, don't turn this into something else.
not_available l will fix it.
not_available What? No, we don't have it yet.
not_available Yes.
not_available No, of course.
not_available l will get back to you as soon as we're ready.
not_available Talk to her.
not_available Explain what l do.
not_available l will, but our deal stands.
not_available Take care of it! l need to get out of here, my friend.
not_available lt'll just be a little longer.
not_available We've been getting death threats ever since my husband announced his candidacy.
not_available What is different about this one? 
not_available l'm not privy to that kind of information.
not_available All l can tell you is that my unit is only called in when the threat becomes more serious.
not_available Then why did you let him walk out on his own? We will find him, Mrs Palmer.
not_available l, uh, l'm sorry.
not_available We're grateful to have you here.
not_available He's not in the lobby.
not_available l looked everywhere.
not_available You shouldn't leave the suites.
not_available Let these men do their jobs.
not_available There's a coffee shop a few blocks down.
not_available l bet he wanted to be by himself.
not_available l'll get him.
not_available No, Keith.
not_available You're not going anywhere.
not_available Secret Service knows this city a lot better than we do.
not_available l'll be right back.
not_available l'm sorry, son.
not_available We need you to stay here.
not_available Why? We treat a threat on a candidate's life as a threat to the entire family.
not_available We need to protect you as well.
not_available Keith Your father's going to be fine.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Gaines.
not_available l need an update on the Bauer girl.
not_available Everything's copa.
not_available We're just waiting for you.
not_available l'm running a little late.
not_available We're not going anywhere.
not_available That's right, you're not.
not_available She's in a lot of pain, man.
not_available l think you broke her arm.
not_available Think so? Should we take her to the hospital and get some x
not_available rays? Gaines is running late.
not_available l'm gonna smoke another j.
not_available You want one? Sure.
not_available My arm My arm Dan, please.
not_available She needs to see a doctor.
not_available At least give her something, man.
not_available l'm not wasting my stash on her.
not_available So, what, is Dan the boss and you do everything he says? Thought l told you Don't press me, man.
not_available l should never have used you.
not_available You're gonna give her that? Want me to take away the pain or not? Hey.
not_available Hey, man, this is a private lot, homey.
not_available You gotta pay to park here.
not_available l see.
not_available And you're the attendant? That's right.
not_available And it's gonna cost you a hundred dollars.
not_available So deal it up.
not_available You that dude! Uh, Palmer.
not_available No.
not_available That's not me.
not_available Yeah, it's you.
not_available lt's him! Yo, this guy's running for president, dog.
not_available l seen him on TV.
not_available Yeah? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So what you gonna do for me, Mr President? See, that's your problem.
not_available You want everyone else to do the work.
not_available What are you gonna do for yourselves? See, man? All y'all, y'all got the same rap.
not_available Keep going like this and you'll be dead in five years.
not_available Man, like you know my life.
not_available More than you think.
not_available Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! 
not_available CTU.
not_available Myers.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Jack, where are you? 
not_available About a block away.
not_available l need you to print up a hard copy of Tony's passenger breakdown and put it on my desk.
not_available Wait for me.
not_available l wanna talk to you, but not in front of the others.
not_available Sure.
not_available Great.
not_available l'll be there in a minute.
not_available Bye.
not_available Keep working.
not_available Has Division responded to the two dead agents yet? 
not_available Yeah, they're picking them up now.
not_available Good.
not_available Anyone we know? 
not_available Someone we know.
not_available l'm afraid it was Richard Walsh.
not_available l'm sorry, Jamey, l know what he meant to you.
not_available What is going on? ls this anything to do with Palmer? That's what we gotta find out.
not_available Look, l don't have time to go into all the details, but l've got to put you in a difficult position.
not_available You're the only person l can trust.
not_available What do you mean? Walsh said we've got a problem on the inside.
not_available He told me to talk only to you.
not_available This is the key card l sent you.
not_available On it is pertinent information to the hit on Palmer.
not_available How long is it gonna take you to pull all the data off it? Depending on the kind of encryption, it could take hours.
not_available Palmer's day starts at six.
not_available l need it before then.
not_available One more thing.
not_available l need to be certain that it was Nina's computer that burnt that card.
not_available Why? Because if it was, she's dirty.
not_available l'll need a few minutes alone at her workstation.
not_available Fine.
not_available You got it.
not_available Did you cut yourself? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What are you working on? 
not_available l gave Nina the passenger list.
not_available l'm cross
not_available checking everything else we've got.
not_available Good.
not_available l'll be down in a sec.
not_available So why were you at Dunlop Plaza? 
not_available l had a meeting with Walsh.
not_available ls that the passenger list? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Anything unusual? There's one red flag.
not_available A man in first class.
not_available His information is inconsistent.
not_available l'm trying to piece it together now.
not_available Good.
not_available l don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but not letting me know where you are, holding back information How can l help you without you letting me? Do you think that it's possible that someone from within the agency is behind the hit on Palmer? Anything's possible.
not_available Do you have a lead? No.
not_available Not really.
not_available No.
not_available Why do l feel like you're not telling me the truth? lf you've got something, tell me.
not_available l'll work it up with you.
not_available No, l'm l'm just thinking out loud.
not_available OK.
not_available Fine.
not_available ls there anything else? No.
not_available Actually, there is.
not_available Are you seeing Tony? Why? ls it serious? What is this, Jack? What do you want to know? Am l over you? Why are we talking about this now? l'm trying to understand why he's been giving me such a hard time.
not_available Yeah, well, l can't answer that for you.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available l confirmed it.
not_available The file on the key card definitely came from Nina's computer.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available lt's Division.
not_available They want the passenger breakdown.
not_available Please send it to them.
not_available Sure.
not_available By the way, your wife called.
not_available Bauer.
not_available This is Data Services.
not_available You called in a thumbprint an hour ago? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We checked every database we have.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Either this guy doesn't exist or his identity was wiped off the record.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is gonna work out better for both of us.
not_available l don't care, Bridgit.
not_available Where is the lD? This is not some secret l'm keeping from you.
not_available This is for both of us.
not_available Do you wanna get both of us killed? 
not_available They hired you to blow up a plane.
not_available Another million dollars means nothing to these people.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available Money is the only thing ''these people'' care about.
not_available Let's do it anyway.
not_available You know he can't hurt us.
not_available Baby Nobody can hurt us.
not_available One million for you, one million for me.
not_available Don't you like the way that sounds? OK.
not_available We're gonna do this your way.
not_available Great.
not_available OK, let's tell him.
not_available No.
not_available lt'll be better if l do it myself.
not_available You're always looking out for me.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Do you remember anything? Yeah.
not_available We were at the furniture store dancing Where's Dan? Shh.
not_available Dan broke your arm.
not_available He didn't break my arm.
not_available Dan likes me.
not_available Yeah, look at it.
not_available Ow My arm OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available This is serious.
not_available We're being kidnapped.
not_available We need to escape.
not_available Can you walk? 
not_available l guess.
not_available OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get ready.
not_available When l say ''go'', we go.
not_available Go where? Just stay with me, OK? You gotta understand this, OK? We could die if we don't get out of here.
not_available Hold my hand.
not_available Go.
not_available Hey! Hey! No! Get back here! 
not_available We gotta get them.
not_available Hey! Catch them! l am! This is your fault! This is what l was talking about! Shut up! Get back here! 
not_available We gotta get them.
not_available They can not get away.
not_available This is good work.
not_available Keep me informed.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Certainly.
not_available Thanks, Jack.
not_available Shut the door.
not_available Are we saying Nina's a traitor? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available We need to know more.
not_available Should l shut down her confidential access? No, that'll slow everything down.
not_available There's gotta be some kind of explanation for this.
not_available Right now what l really need is the data off that card.
not_available But aren't we obligated to seal off her channels with this much evidence? Look, you were seeing her, weren't you? 
not_available That is none of your business.
not_available l think in this case it is.
not_available Yes.
not_available When my wife and l were separated, yes, l was seeing Nina.
not_available Did you say anything you shouldn't have? 
not_available No.
not_available l don't think so.
not_available l trusted her with everything that was coming through here, but 
not_available Fine.
not_available Shut down her access.
not_available OK.
not_available What's she working on? 
not_available 747 passenger list.
not_available Good.
not_available That's not on a secure socket.
not_available l can do it without her knowing.
not_available Good.
not_available Jamey? 
not_available Don't worry, l won't say anything.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Gotta get them.
not_available Hey, get outta here.
not_available Where'd they go? 
not_available Ah, forget it.
not_available Aw, come on, man.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't.
not_available Hey, come back! Scumbag.
not_available You just cost me 50 bucks! You're gonna pay for this.
not_available Word up.
not_available Did you see two girls run past here? 
not_available Yeah, l seen 'em.
not_available Which way did they go? Who are they? Did you see 'em or not? 
not_available They went down Central.
not_available Check it out.
not_available l'll look around here.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available lt's Gaines.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available Change of plan.
not_available We meet at a new location.
not_available Just let me know.
not_available l'll meet you there.
not_available We need to get to a phone.
not_available No, you need to pay up.
not_available ls this real? Thank you very much.
not_available What couldn't wait till morning? 
not_available Maureen Kingsley called.
not_available Said she had some new information.
not_available David, you got me out of bed at 2am.
not_available What did she say? She said the Gibson boy, the one who raped Nicole, didn't commit suicide.
not_available That he was thrown out of the window.
not_available So, he was thrown out of a window.
not_available Who cares? She said it was Keith! She's gonna publicly accuse my son of murder.
not_available OK, there's a couple of ways to handle this.
not_available lt's a lie, Carl.
not_available lt's dirty politics and l won't stand for it.
not_available My family lived through that nightmare and l won't put Nicole through it again.
not_available And Keith? Keith couldn't 
not_available This bastard, Hodges, he waits till the day of the primary so you can't respond.
not_available l don't care what day it is.
not_available lt's a lie 
not_available l know.
not_available But we can't pretend today isn't important.
not_available l'll put a lid on Kingsley until the polls close.
not_available We win the primary then take it from there.
not_available No.
not_available We find the source, make them recant.
not_available Oh, l'll figure out where this is coming from and l'll cut it off, but, David We go back years.
not_available You have your principles, you don't compromise, blah blah blah.
not_available That's why l love you.
not_available But you knew the gloves would come off.
not_available Well, they are off.
not_available That's why you have me.
not_available Go back and forget about this.
not_available l'm on it.
not_available l can't let them throw my son to the wolves.
not_available David, l'll take care of it.

not_available We gotta find them! 
not_available You're in my space.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available We'll leave.
not_available ls there a phone around here? 
not_available No.
not_available What are you looking for? You wanna score some dope? We need to get rid of those guys.
not_available ls there any way you can help us get to a phone? You want me to help you? What are your little designer jeans worth? 500 bills? And those kicks, like another, what, 25? You wanna trade places with me for a while? Wanna turn some tricks while l go snuggle with your daddy in the Hollywood foothills? Go away.
not_available We've been kidnapped.
not_available l don't know Her arm is broken.
not_available Those guys are still out there.
not_available Welcome to the neighbourhood.
not_available Well, is there any other way out besides the front door? But if we just

not_available l wanna know who you work for and who you smuggled this card to.
not_available You're delirious.
not_available Who are you working for? 
not_available l work for you.
not_available Who are you working for? Who are you working for?! 
not_available l work for you! Whoever programmed this card is involved with the hit on Palmer.

not_available And l can't believe that you think l did.
not_available There it is.
not_available One million in your account in addition to what we already agreed on.
not_available Where's the lD? Let's get it.
