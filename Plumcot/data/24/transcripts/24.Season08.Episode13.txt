
not_available Kevin Wade.
not_available You know him, don't you? Mr.
not_available Prady, we are in the middle of a national security crisis.
not_available I have to go back to my desk.
not_available Okay, perhaps if I talk to your supervisor, he could let you take a few minutes off.
not_available It's over.
not_available The parole officer looking for Kevin is here in CTU.
not_available He's after the raw feed.
not_available I'm gonna give it to him, Cole.
not_available Why don't you wait? Do you hear me? He knows everything.
not_available He'll go to Hastings.
not_available Do what he says and you won't get hurt.
not_available Who is he? Another traitor? The only traitor is your father.
not_available We haven't disabled the American radiological detectors yet.
not_available Where are the nuclear rods? They're still outside the city.
not_available How will you bring the rods to me? It's been taken care of.
not_available Let's go! Stop them! Tarin, no! Oh! Mr.
not_available Hastings, you better take this.
not_available It's Kayla Hassan! She's in a car.
not_available She's escaped.
not_available They tried to kill me, but Tarin got me out.
not_available They shot him.
not_available He told me to call CTU! Ms.
not_available Hassan, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available We need to know where you were being held.
not_available We got the location, Jack.
not_available Targets are heading north on Orchard.
not_available They're getting into an SUV.
not_available We ID'd one of the targets as Tarin Faroush.
not_available Kayla said he sacrificed himself to save her, but he's still alive.
not_available Chloe, the car that Tarin got into where is it now? Taking the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge.
not_available You've gotta put Hastings on now.
not_available I'm on, Jack.
not_available You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.
not_available The terrorists faked her escape.
not_available They wanted to get her to CTU.
not_available She's in the tunnel.
not_available Stop the car! Whoa, whoa! Put your hands where we can see them! It's an EMP! What the hell's happening? Contact NSA.
not_available Terrorists just took down CTU.
not_available Central comm node is totally fried.
not_available Reroute to peripherals.
not_available I already tried that.
not_available Try again, Chloe.
not_available Sir, I can't give you the status on the drones.
not_available Everything's down.
not_available Which means what? That they're going to fall out of the sky? Not yet.
not_available The nav systems should default to autopilot.
not_available They'll circle until they run out of gas.
not_available But we've lost all aerial surveillance and radiological detection capability.
not_available Basically.
not_available All right.
not_available Agent Skaggs is heading outside on foot.
not_available Have him contact FAA with the drones' default flight paths.
not_available They need to be taken down before they crash into populated areas.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Are you okay? Am I okay? An EMP just took us out of play and now we're dropping So, no, Chloe, I am not okay.
not_available And I won't be until we find those rods.
not_available Sir, Kayla Hassan is finished in Medical.
not_available Okay, I need her taken back to the UN so she can be evacuated with her family.
not_available Okay, I'll do it.
not_available No, I'll do it.
not_available I need you to assemble division heads.
not_available Tell them that we have a briefing in ten minutes.
not_available Tell them to come with full damage assessment reports.
not_available Sir, their systems are down.
not_available They can't generate reports.
not_available Then tell them to use a pen and a damn legal pad.
not_available Phil Holden.
not_available Phil, it's Jack Bauer.
not_available Ah, Jack, I heard you were back in play.
not_available Phil, look, I don't have a lot of time, I need you to listen to me carefully.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available There's an IRK splinter cell trying to smuggle weapons
not_available grade uranium into the city.
not_available Yeah, I just read the threat assessment.
not_available It says you've got a CTU team tracking them.
not_available We did, but we lost them.
not_available CTU just got hit by some electromagnetic pulse device, wiped out all our visual and comm.
not_available I want you to try and locate our hostiles with one of your satellites.
not_available We don't have any birds over the metro area, Jack.
not_available All aerial surveillance was being routed through CTU.
not_available What about traffic cams? I can try.
not_available Give me the hostiles' last location.
not_available They got off the Williamsburg Bridge at the West Broadway Roebling Street exit.
not_available They're driving a gray SUV.
not_available I'll call you if we get a hit.
not_available Phil, I also need you to shut down all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city.
not_available Done.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available NSA's shutting all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city.
not_available There's only one way for them to get in.
not_available Across the East River.
not_available That's right.
not_available CTU is down.
not_available You have confirmation? I have a real
not_available time uplink to the power grid.
not_available It recorded a pulse surge and now nothing.
not_available CTU is blind, deaf, and dumb.
not_available Have you secured this area? 
not_available As you ordered.
not_available You've done well, Ali.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Load the rods into the Zodiac.
not_available I realize this was very difficult for you, but Hassan's daughter was a necessary sacrifice.
not_available Using her was the only way for us to get the rods into the city.
not_available Agents Beck and Henderson will escort you back to the UN.
not_available First, tell me what's going on.
not_available Agent Beck will brief you on the way.
not_available Now, once you're there, we need you to do something for us.
not_available Your father gave us a file of IRK covert agents operating in this country.
not_available We need you to identify the men working with Tarin.
not_available I'm not doing anything until you tell me what's happening.
not_available The car you drove here was rigged with an EMP device.
not_available It's a pulse weapon designed to disarm electronics.
not_available It's crashed all our systems.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Tarin put me in that car.
not_available He used you, Ms.
not_available Hassan.
not_available He staged your escape, put you in that car, and sent you back here.
not_available But he was shot.
not_available I saw him.
not_available He is alive.
not_available We spotted him a few minutes ago.
not_available I know it's a lot to take in, but you need to go with these agents back to the UN and start looking through those files.
not_available You've seen these terrorists.
not_available If you can help us to ID them, we stand a chance of finding them before they carry out their attack.
not_available Good.
not_available See you soon.
not_available Ahman has prepared the bomb.
not_available It'll be short work once we get the rods across the river.
not_available A vehicle is coming.
not_available Where is it? It's coming from the east.
not_available Black SUV, no markings.
not_available How many men have you got covering? 
not_available Three.
not_available Wait until the SUV's in the range, then take them out.
not_available Ali! Let's go! 
not_available Hold on.
not_available What is it? Thought I caught something in the infrared.
not_available Heat source down by the water.
not_available Now it's gone.
not_available See if NYPD can get some units down here.
not_available I'll contact NSA, see if they've got surveillance of the area.
not_available That's weird.
not_available I got four bars, but the call's not going through.
not_available Me neither.
not_available We're being jammed.
not_available They're here.
not_available Damn it! Get down now! Come on! The vehicle's dead.
not_available Pass your weapons up front! Cole, I want you to take the sniper to your north.
not_available Maintain coverage until we're clear.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I want both of you to get ready to unload all the weapons from the back, you ready? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go, go, go! How did they know where to look for us? They must have followed us from the vault.
not_available Cole, use your infrared! Call out the snipers as you see them! Ten o'clock, high and low! I'm counting four men.
not_available I recognize one from the hospital.
not_available He was the one that talked Marcos out of detonating the vest.
not_available It's Jack Bauer.
not_available Ex
not_available CTU.
not_available He was one of their best agents.
not_available Nine o'clock low! We can still cross with the rods.
not_available As long as we're certain Bauer and his men cannot warn anyone.
not_available It's not a risk.
not_available We started jamming their communications as soon as they were in sight.
not_available Now they can't leave.
not_available Not with the snipers in position.
not_available Good.
not_available Make sure none of them get out alive.
not_available I'll call you when we're across the river.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Reloading! I've got two men, leaving the dock in a boat.
not_available One of them is Tarin Faroush.
not_available They're carrying a box the right size and shape for the rods, Jack.
not_available Copy that! They went out of my range.
not_available We got to notify NYPD before they cross the river.
not_available I tried cell and radio frequencies.
not_available They're all jammed.
not_available There's a call box mounted on the building.
not_available Ten o'clock.
not_available It's gotta be a hard line.
not_available We can call from there.
not_available How do you wanna get there? The way the shooters are positioned, they'll pick us off one by one as soon as we step out from behind the vehicle.
not_available Our vehicle's armored.
not_available We can pull the panels, use them for coverage.
not_available Owen and King, start now! Eleven o'clock, Jack! Casualty reports are also coming in.
not_available Three fatalities from the bomb blast in the motor pool tunnel.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What else? 
not_available Minor injuries for the most part.
not_available Agent McCallan was burned in a small electrical fire.
not_available How is he? He's going to be okay.
not_available But with our infirmary down we had to transport him to the local hospital.
not_available Says here we have flooding.
not_available Yes, sir, the pumps are down, and certain sections of the basement have about six inches of water.
not_available Well, can you stop it or are we all going to drown? The repair crew's working on it, sir.
not_available Okay, give me another update in 20 minutes.
not_available Excuse me, sir? Yes, what is it? 
not_available A team from NSA is here.
not_available NSA? Brian Hastings, Director of CTU.
not_available Frank Haynam, senior engineer at the New York field office.
not_available I understand you've been hit by an EMP.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available I hope that you're here to help because we can damn well use it.
not_available We are indeed.
not_available Brought my best men with me.
not_available I thought we'd start by restoring your aerial surveillance and communications.
not_available So, where's your server room? 
not_available It's downstairs.
not_available I'll let my maintenance team know that you're here.
not_available You boys can put your heads together.
not_available I prefer to work with my own people.
not_available There's no one more familiar with this facility than my crew.
not_available Not exactly true.
not_available I was part of the group that helped design this place.
not_available Can't say I'm thrilled with what you've done with it.
not_available How did you find out we were hit? Jack Bauer called our regional headquarters.
not_available Told us your situation.
not_available Bauer was pursuing the men behind this attack when we lost contact with him.
not_available Do you know where he is? NSA's been trying to call him back.
not_available He's not answering.
not_available They're not sure why.
not_available Right this way.
not_available Chloe, we're supposed to be writing damage assessments.
not_available What are you doing? There might be away to tap in, get some of our systems up and running.
not_available Really? How? I haven't figured it out yet, and I won't if you keep talking to me.
not_available All right, people, listen up.
not_available This is Frank Haynam, senior engineer of the NSA's New York field office.
not_available Now, he and his team are going to help us restore aerial surveillance and communications.
not_available So we can get back to tracking the nuclear rods.
not_available They also brought along a fresh batch of cell phones.
not_available Give them your full cooperation.
not_available Whatever they need, make it happen.
not_available Now, we have been knocked down, but I promise you, we are going to get back up.
not_available Let's get to work.
not_available Agent Blochard, can you get Mr.
not_available Haynam and his team down to the server room? Has NSA heard from Jack? Yeah.
not_available They spoke with Jack and his team about 20 minutes ago, but haven't been able to reach him since.
not_available Why not? 
not_available They don't know.
not_available He could be in some kind of trouble.
not_available You need to send men out looking for him.
not_available Even if I had agents available, I wouldn't know where to send them.
not_available Jack was heading toward the East River.
not_available That's four square miles of real estate Too much for me to commit resources that we don't have.
not_available He was pursuing the terrorists.
not_available He's our best chance at stopping this attack.
not_available We're going to focus on our efforts here.
not_available When we get our eyes and ears back, we'll find them.
not_available It might be too late.
not_available If anyone can take care of themselves, it's Jack.
not_available Now, I want you to go to the server room, make sure Haynam has everything he needs.
not_available Wait.
not_available What was the um It's worse than I thought.
not_available We're going to have to swap them out and install new server boards.
not_available Mr.
not_available Haynam.
not_available I'm Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings wanted me to make sure you have everything you need.
not_available We're fine, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're going in through the CLR processor? That's right.
not_available We're going to isolate it from the main servers and create a brand
not_available new subnet.
not_available Creating a brand
not_available new subnet from scratch? That'll take forever.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian, thanks for offering your help.
not_available We'll take it from here.
not_available Look, I think there's another way.
not_available I've been looking at the CTU schematics.
not_available Why not tap directly into the trunk line? Because I'm not insane.
not_available Mr.
not_available Haynam, we need to make sure those nuclear rods don't get into the city.
not_available What I'm suggesting will be a lot faster.
not_available Yeah, and it could make things a whole lot worse.
not_available How could things be any worse? You reopen that trunk line without system buffers in place, you could cause an overload, wind up electrocuting yourself, not to mention starting a fire that can burn down half the building.
not_available I'm aware of the risks.
not_available I think I can create a workaround.
not_available You couldn't keep an EMP from taking out your whole operation.
not_available Forgive me if I don't bow to your expertise.
not_available If you'd stop with the cheap insults and just listen to me.
not_available Look, I'm not here to brainstorm.
not_available I'm here to clean up your mess.
not_available You need to leave.
not_available Now.
not_available I said now, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I won't ask you again.
not_available Start prepping the CLR for a diagnostic.
not_available Arlo, is there any other way to get into the trunk line besides the server room? No, that's the only way in.
not_available Why? I think I have a faster way to get us back online, but Haynam says it's too dangerous.
not_available I think he's a raging egomaniac.
not_available Seems to be a prerequisite for engineers these days.
not_available You talk to Hastings? If I tell Hastings, he'll just shoot me down.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available And maybe the moon will fall from the sky.
not_available Just let it go.
not_available These NSA guys seem to know what they're doing.
not_available And if they don't, what happens to Jack? What's Jack got to do with this? Never mind.
not_available Hello? Renee, it's Chloe.
not_available Where are you? I'm at Jack's apartment.
not_available What's going on? Everything.
not_available CTU's just been hit by an EMP.
not_available All of our systems are down.
not_available It's a real mess.
not_available How did that happen? I can't go into it right now, but we think the terrorists were trying to take out our radiological detectors.
not_available Where's Jack? That's why I'm calling you.
not_available I think he might be in some kind of trouble.
not_available We need to find him.
not_available Slow down, Chloe.
not_available Uh, what what do you mean? What what kind of trouble? Jack was tracking the terrorists when the EMP hit.
not_available He called NSA, and they lost contact, too.
not_available Does Hastings know about this? He's the one who told me.
not_available What's he doing about it? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available He won't send anyone out to look for them.
not_available He says he can't spare the men and that Jack can take care of himself.
not_available Where was Jack before you lost contact? He took the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge.
not_available I'm going to try to find him, Chloe.
not_available You need to get CTU back online as soon as you can.
not_available Once you acquire Jack's position, you can direct me to him.
not_available Yeah, well, that might take a while.
not_available NSA brought in a repair team and they're going about it all wrong.
not_available I have a faster way to get us back online.
not_available Well, then tell them.
not_available I tried.
not_available They won't listen.
not_available Then you need to make them listen, Chloe.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available Okay.
not_available I will.
not_available Call me when you're back up.
not_available The EMP took out all of our systems.
not_available And since we don't know how long it's going to be until we're up and running again, we're going to have to evacuate all non
not_available essential personnel.
not_available You're going to follow Agent Combs through our access tunnel.
not_available I need to speak with Mr.
not_available Prady, please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Please.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm really sorry that it took me so long to get back to you.
not_available I've been a little busy.
not_available I know.
not_available They briefed me on what happened.
not_available It's a terrible thing.
not_available Yes.
not_available And I have some bad news because of it.
not_available The surveillance video that you wanted has been erased by the EMP.
not_available Erased? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Everything in the building has been fried.
not_available Well, that's a damn shame.
not_available So what you're telling me is whoever helped Kevin Wade rob that evidence locker they just caught a huge break.
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available Are you sure that it was all erased, Ms.
not_available Walsh? I mean, don't you have a backup system? Yes, yes, we do, but it's on
not_available site.
not_available And like I told you, all the servers have been wiped clean.
not_available I know how much Kevin means to you.
not_available I really wish I could do more.
not_available So you're sure that there's nothing else you can tell me? Anything that would help me find Kevin? Believe me, I have told you everything that I know.
not_available I'm sure you have.
not_available Mr.
not_available Prady, I really have to get back to work.
not_available Good luck finding Kevin.
not_available I hope that he's okay.
not_available Me, too.
not_available If anything changes with those files, I'll be in Little Rock.
not_available You have my number.
not_available Of course.
not_available I hope you get your lights back on.
not_available Mr.
not_available Haynam, I think I found a way to deal with the safety concerns you had with my idea.
not_available Here's the workaround.
not_available I thought I made myself clear.
not_available We're not going anywhere near that trunk line.
not_available I'm going to ask you one last time.
not_available We really need to do this my way.
not_available We have agents in the field who are close to finding the nuclear rods and they need our help.
not_available And I'm going to ask you one last time.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Get out or I'll call security! You get out.
not_available Now.
not_available What the hell All of you, get out now.
not_available Look, look, take a second to think.
not_available Do you really want to do this? Mr.
not_available Haynam, I don't want to hurt you.
not_available You're probably an okay guy when you're not at work.
not_available And you're wearing a wedding ring.
not_available I swear to God, if you don't leave right now, I will shoot you.
not_available Get out! Go! Go get Hastings and tell him to bring security.
not_available They're starting to flank us! We're almost there! Jack, they're almost on us.
not_available We cannot stay here! Just give me one more second.
not_available Okay, I'm ready.
not_available We're gonna use these plates to form a way so that we can make it over to the call box.
not_available Remember, we need to move slow and steady.
not_available It is imperative that we stick together for this to work.
not_available You understand? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available No matter how difficult it gets out there, this armor is gonna protect us.
not_available You need to trust that.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Okay.
not_available Cole, you're with Agent King.
not_available Owen, you're with me.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available The armor's not gonna hold up.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Maintain formation.
not_available Can you get a shot? Not from this angle.
not_available It's not holding up.
not_available We gotta go for it.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Slow down! We're almost there.
not_available Move! No! 
not_available No, no, no! There's nothing we can do for him now.
not_available We can't just leave him there.
not_available I'm with Owen.
not_available We don't leave our men behind.
not_available You try and bring him in now, you're dead.
not_available They're trying to draw us out.
not_available Best thing we can do for him is make it to the hard line and try and call for help.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available You cover the north, Owen the east.
not_available I can get there.
not_available Owen! 
not_available Owen! Cover him! I'm sorry.
not_available I couldn't leave him behind.
not_available You did great.
not_available Is he all right? Did he make it? Did he make it?! Yeah, he made it.
not_available Come on, Owen.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Jack, they're repositioning.
not_available Stay on them.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you sure? Yes, Mother, I'm okay.
not_available I'm so sorry, Father.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available You were right about Tarin.
not_available I should have listened to you.
not_available You are safe.
not_available That's what's important.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, CTU is preparing a subterranean evacuation route.
not_available If there is a radiological attack, you'll be shielded underground.
not_available When do we leave? 
not_available As soon as possible.
not_available President Taylor's waiting for you with the other delegates.
not_available The files Mr.
not_available Hastings requested are inside.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Kayla, go with them.
not_available She's strong.
not_available She'll be all right.
not_available We almost lost her.
not_available And I almost lost you.
not_available All for a peace agreement that could fall apart at any moment.
not_available And it will only get more difficult, Dalia.
not_available My enemies will be waiting for me once we return home.
not_available Omar Despite everything that's happened, there's one thing I've never doubted.
not_available That what you are doing here is an absolute good.
not_available You have to be strong, too.
not_available We need to get in there fast before O'Brian can do any more damage.
not_available I understand the situation, Mr.
not_available Haynam.
not_available How long? I just need to drill into the locking mechanism.
not_available It shouldn't take more than a couple minutes.
not_available This woman is out of her mind.
not_available Where the hell do you find these people, Hastings? I can't believe she pulled a weapon on me.
not_available She was ready to use it, too.
not_available I seriously doubt that.
not_available I'm sure she was just trying to scare you.
not_available Yeah? Well, she did a very good job.
not_available You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, O'Brian's going off the deep end.
not_available She thinks she knows how to get the CTU up and running.
not_available But she's locked herself in the server room to do it.
not_available We'll be in there in a few seconds.
not_available What's she trying to do? She's trying to tap directly into the trunk line, which I don't have to tell you, is a catastrophe waiting to happen.
not_available Stop what you're doing, Chloe! Let's see the gun.
not_available Okay, don't shoot or anything.
not_available I know what I did is crazy.
not_available I know I'm in a lot of trouble.
not_available You're damned right.
not_available I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it could work.
not_available I'm almost done.
not_available I just need ten more minutes.
not_available Get her out of here now.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Let me give the orders.
not_available She pulled a gun on me! 
not_available I know what she did.
not_available Now just shut up and let me handle it.
not_available Chloe, what in the hell were you thinking? Jack's looking for those nuclear rods and he might need our help.
not_available I can get satellite and comm back up.
not_available I just need to finish tapping into that trunk line.
not_available I told Mr.
not_available Haynam, but he wouldn't listen.
not_available So I pulled a gun on him.
not_available I didn't want to.
not_available I don't even like guns.
not_available Dana, what's your take on this? Mr.
not_available Haynam is right.
not_available Tapping into the trunk line is dangerous and there's no guarantee that it'll work.
not_available What about Cole? He could be in trouble.
not_available Aren't you worried about him? Yes, I am.
not_available That's why I can't go along with your plan.
not_available It's reckless.
not_available I'm sorry, Chloe.
not_available You've never been my biggest fan.
not_available Why start now? Look, it's not as dangerous as they're saying.
not_available I've taken precautions.
not_available This can work.
not_available I just need ten minutes.
not_available If I can't get the systems online by then, fine, arrest me.
not_available When you brought me on for this job, you said it was because I didn't think like anyone else.
not_available Ever since I got here, I've been punished for that.
not_available I've been right more than once today.
not_available I think I've proven myself and I think I deserve that ten minutes.
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You can't be serious about this.
not_available You need any help? No, just let me work.
not_available All right, let's give the lady some space.
not_available That's all, gentlemen.
not_available You are making a huge mistake.
not_available Maybe, but I'm willing to take that chance.
not_available O'Brian proved herself today.
not_available I want to see what she comes up with.
not_available I'd appreciate it if you and your men would stand by.
not_available Yes? What is it? 
not_available Sir, there's a man here who wants to speak with you, Bill Prady.
not_available He says he's a probation officer.
not_available Probation officer? 
not_available From Arkansas, sir.
not_available What does he want? He didn't say.
not_available Put him in Holding 2.
not_available Tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes.
not_available Dana, stay here in case O'Brian needs anything.
not_available I'll be in my office.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, are you there? We're here, Chloe.
not_available What's your status? I'm into the trunk line.
not_available I'm about to activate the bypass circuit.
not_available Okay, what can we expect? Well, if I don't electrocute myself, some of our primary systems should start booting up.
not_available All right, whenever you're ready.
not_available We've got power to comm.
not_available And one of the sat links is back online.
not_available All right, that's good enough.
not_available Start looking for Bauer.
not_available Okay, Chloe, it's working.
not_available You all right? I just need a few more minutes.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, one more thing.
not_available If you do locate Jack, you need to call Renee Walker.
not_available Walker? She went out looking for him.
not_available She should be in the vicinity.
not_available Will do.
not_available Why don't you go see if Miss O'Brian needs a hand? And be civil this time.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available He's gone.
not_available I lost two of the snipers.
not_available If we're gonna make a move, we got to do it soon, Jack.
not_available We can't lay down cover fire for something we can't see.
not_available We need to give them something to shoot at.
not_available I'll make a break to the north, try and draw their fire, you make a run for the call box.
not_available But that's a suicide play, Jack.
not_available You'll never make it.
not_available But you will.
not_available No.
not_available I can't let you do that.
not_available I'm in command here.
not_available That's what gonna happen.
not_available Do you understand? Yeah.
not_available I need you to do me a favor.
not_available What is it? You make sure that Hastings keeps his promise.
not_available That he doesn't bring Renee back in.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available You're not gonna have long before they start firing on you.
not_available Good luck, Jack.
not_available You make it to that call box.
not_available Go.
not_available Clear! Jack? Jack?! Jack? It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's me.
not_available It's Renee.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Shh.
not_available They got the fuel rods in a boat.
not_available They're heading across the river into the city.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Shh.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Nothing went through.
not_available Relax.
not_available You may have a collapsed lung.
not_available Try not to move.
not_available Jack, I got through to CTU.
not_available They just got back online.
not_available NYPD's sending choppers.
not_available We still got a real good shot at finding them.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, I just got a call from Agent Ortiz.
not_available The nuclear rods are on a Zodiac with two of the terrorists aboard.
not_available They were heading northwest across the river toward the city.
not_available Where are the choppers? One second.
not_available They just arrived at the port.
not_available Okay, redirect them.
not_available Start diverting all available NYPD units to that shoreline.
not_available We need to lay down a cordon.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chloe? Thanks.
not_available You you were I'm not good with praise.
not_available Go! Go! Get us out of here.
not_available What do you think you're doing, going to my boss? My job.
not_available I've answered all your questions.
not_available Why won't you just leave? I can't do that.
not_available I know you were involved with that robbery, Ms.
not_available Walsh.
not_available What? I think you know exactly where Kevin is.
not_available I think you're protecting him.
not_available You are out of your mind.
not_available And you're a liar.
not_available I'm not leaving here until I know the truth.
not_available This'll go a lot smoother for you if you just come clean right now.
not_available It's not too late, Miss Walsh.
not_available But I promise you, if you don't, I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall.
not_available Contact CTU.
not_available See if they picked 'em up going across the river.
not_available It's me.
not_available CTU's back online.
not_available I know.
not_available There are helicopters searching the river.
not_available They're getting close.
not_available You should have warned us earlier.
not_available I didn't have time.
not_available I was too busy preserving my cover.
not_available I don't know how much longer I'll be able to stay under.
not_available I thought you took care of that problem.
not_available So did I.
not_available It came back.
not_available Well, we can't stay here.
not_available The police must already be cordoning off the area.
not_available We're going to need your help getting clear.
not_available I will get you out of there.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Stand by.
not_available I'll call you in a few minutes.
