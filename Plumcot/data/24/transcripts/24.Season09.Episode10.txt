
not_available MAN: I looked into the protocol of handing Bauer over to the Russians.
not_available Rendition requires the President's direct approval.
not_available He needs to sign.
not_available How soon can we expect to take custody of Jack Bauer? Is there some reason you are uncomfortable involving President Heller? Chloe, I've got the override device.
not_available I want you to take a look at it.
not_available I'm not coming.
not_available Margot's dead, and it's not my problem anymore.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what? Another chance.
not_available I know that this was about Adam.
not_available Her own husband selling secrets to the Chinese? And she didn't know? ADRIAN: You said you were going to stop your analyst from retrieving the deleted partitions from Adam Morgan's files.
not_available If he sees those partitions, he's going to know that you're the source of Intel I've been selling to China.
not_available ls there someone you can send me? A cleaner? I'm just a middleman here.
not_available You've been well
not_available paid.
not_available Sort it out.
not_available They found Jordan, Steve.
not_available He's dead.
not_available NAVARRO: What happened? I'm not sure, but they said that they found two bodies.
not_available Two bodies? If it's the operative I sent to kill him, he can be traced back to me.
not_available I need money, paperwork and safe transport.
not_available I understand the override device is on its way to you.
not_available Bring it to me.
not_available And you have everything you ask for.
not_available General Coburn's sending over a DOD tech to analyze it.
not_available What we're dealing with here Unlimited access to any defense system out there.
not_available I'm going to find out who this guy is.
not_available I'm going to run his fingerprints through the database, see if I can find a match.
not_available We have a hit.
not_available JACK: Who was he associated with? Steve Navarro.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Kate, it's Jack.
not_available I need your help.
not_available What's going on? The operative that killed your agent was sent by Navarro.
not_available What are you talking about? Navarro and the killer were in the same covert unit together.
not_available He was his handler.
not_available Well, why would Navarro want Jordan killed? Before I could confront him, he took off with the override device.
not_available Kate, this thing is more dangerous than we thought.
not_available It's not restricted to drones.
not_available It can access multiple weapons systems.
not_available Even those from other countries.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm in pursuit now.
not_available I need you to send a tac team unit.
not_available Use satellite and closed circuit television, lock into my phone.
not_available Get back to me.
not_available Do you have it? Yeah.
not_available I'm almost at Finsbury square.
not_available Meet me at Liverpool Street station.
not_available How will I recognize you? Don't worry, I'll find you.
not_available Once it's in my hands, of course, the car will arrive, and all the arrangements have been made to take you safely out of the country.
not_available And once I hand over the device, how will I know you're going to keep your end of the bargain? Well, not keep up your end of the bargain, and spend the rest of your life in federal penitentiary, if you like.
not_available That is, if you can avoid the death penalty.
not_available It's your choice.
not_available I'll be there in five minutes.
not_available Hello? What's going on? I'm taking the override back.
not_available Yates' device? My device.
not_available You told me that Yates designed it.
not_available Yates engineered certain aspects of it, but I designed it.
not_available He stole it from me.
not_available And modified it for the US drone system, just so he could sell it to terrorists and line his own pockets.
not_available Never gave a damn about the fact that it could be worth far more.
not_available What are you talking about? Far more than killing hundreds of innocent people? We're going to save lives, Chloe.
not_available Millions of them.
not_available How? We're going to break into the world's arsenals, and exploit the vulnerability in their firewalls.
not_available We're going to share that information with every nation on Earth.
not_available How effective could a country's weapons systems be if its adversaries could take control of them? Not very.
not_available Right, so, one stroke and technological warfare is obsolete.
not_available Adrian, the override is locked up at CIA.
not_available How do you expect to get it out of there? It's out already.
not_available Navarro will be in momentarily to deliver ii.
not_available He and I did some business together.
not_available He provided me with classified files, some of which I then brokered to the Chinese intelligence.
not_available Operations cost, Chloe.
not_available Even ours.
not_available Chinese were willing to pay.
not_available They assumed they were exploiting me, I was using them.
not_available It's all part of the same fight.
not_available Better world.
not_available What you would have wanted for Morris and Prescott.
not_available Have some faith in me.
not_available We're so close.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're with me? Go ahead.
not_available Gavin Leonard, West London Station.
not_available Agent Morgan instructed me to call you.
not_available What do you got? Agent Navarro locked out our access to CCTV cameras.
not_available I'm not sure how long it's going to take me to get us back in.
not_available Okay, I want you to switch over to satellite, get a fix on my location, get the tac team over here now.
not_available Will do.
not_available I'm approaching the west side of the station.
not_available ADRIAN: There should be a blue construction wall just ahead of you on the left.
not_available I see it.
not_available Okay, I'm there.
not_available I'm at the wall.
not_available You'll find an envelope in the cement mixer.
not_available I see it.
not_available Okay, I've got it.
not_available Good.
not_available Drop the device through the slot directly behind you through the construction wall.
not_available Drop it now.
not_available Okay, it's done.
not_available Where's my car? Hello? Where the hell is my car? Talk to me, you son of a bitch! Don't you move! OFFICER: Drop your weapon! JACK: On the ground now! Interlock your fingers behind your head.
not_available OFFICER: Now! Get down! Where is it? Where is the override device? 'Cuff him.
not_available OFFICER: Hands behind your back.
not_available Come on.
not_available Damn it! Out of the way.
not_available Out of the way, move! Out of the way, move! Police emergency, out of the way! Move! Chloe! Yeah, it's Jack.
not_available I need you to track a train leaving Liverpool Street Station, heading westbound now.
not_available Someone triggered the emergency brake three minutes ago on the Circle line before the next station.
not_available Two people on the train got off in the tunnel.
not_available Where there's no closed circuit television.
not_available This was planned.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Jack, it's Kate.
not_available You've got me and Agent Ritter on speaker.
not_available We're back at CIA.
not_available What's your status? We got Navarro.
not_available But he handed off the override device to Adrian Cross before I could get to him.
not_available What does Adrian Cross have to do with any of this? I don't know yet.
not_available I'll put out an all
not_available agencies search on him now.
not_available You can try, but Adrian Cross has spent the last decade eluding authorities.
not_available Kate, Chloe O'Brian was with him.
not_available Jack, are you sure? Positive, I saw her.
not_available I tried calling, but the line's dead.
not_available That doesn't make any sense, Chloe's been helping us all day long.
not_available If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't have gotten to Margot in time.
not_available I know.
not_available You think O'Brian was playing us? Biding her time until we got the device back so she could give it to Cross? My gut says no, but I can't be sure.
not_available I'm coming in with Navarro now.
not_available Right.
not_available You're the ranking now.
not_available Can I have everyone's attention, please.
not_available As some of you may already know, Station Chief Navarro has been taken into custody as a suspect in the murder of analyst Jordan Reed.
not_available And for the theft of the override device used in today's attacks.
not_available As senior agent, I'm assuming the duties of Station Head for the time being.
not_available Recovering this device is our number one priority.
not_available I'll be issuing protocols and responsibilities shortly.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available I need you to get into Jordan's system and see if he was working on anything specifically to do with Navarro.
not_available Something worth killing him for? Yeah.
not_available Dad, you can't mix alcohol with your medication Just the one.
not_available I was asked to tell you that Air Force One is on the tarmac, and it's fueled and ready.
not_available Good.
not_available You know, I came over here to keep our drone bases in Diego Garcia.
not_available And now I'm going back with nothing.
not_available Except a slew of British and American lives on my conscience.
not_available You are not responsible for what Al
not_available Harazi did.
not_available You were willing to give up your life to save others, Dad.
not_available Do not blame yourself for anything.
not_available I think I'll leave that one up to the historians.
not_available We should tell the Secret Service that I'm ready to go home.
not_available Putin a call to the Vice President, tell him that I'm getting ready to make the announcement, and that he should prepare himself to take over.
not_available Dad, um We've already talked about this.
not_available Yeah, he's gonna be at Andrews Sir? Mark, please! Agent Ritter is calling from the West London Station.
not_available He needs to speak to you immediately.
not_available Well, put him on.
not_available Agent Ritter, you're on with the President.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm calling to alert you that the override device used in today's attacks was stolen from our facility.
not_available We believe that Adrian Cross and his people are in possession of it.
not_available How did that happen? Agent Ritter, where is your Station Chief Navarro? Agent Navarro is responsible for the theft.
not_available What? Jack Bauer just apprehended him.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it's important that you understand that this device seems to be far more dangerous than we realized.
not_available How's that? The tech that the DOD sent over was assaulted by Navarro before he could complete his analysis, but it seems from his notes that this device can get past the basic firewall security most countries use to protect their military command and control systems.
not_available Where's Bauer now? He's transporting Navarro back here for interrogation.
not_available When he gets back, give him everything he needs.
not_available And keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I want a full report from DOD and any counter measures that they can think of.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And, Mark, tell Air Force One to stand down.
not_available We're not going anywhere till we figure this out.
not_available Got it.
not_available Agent Morgan, I think I found something.
not_available That connects to Navarro? Yeah.
not_available Before Jordan left, he was running some data restoration protocol.
not_available What was he trying to recover? Some files that Navarro was working on sometime last year and then deleted.
not_available Those files, they contain classified material that was supposedly leaked to the Chinese by your husband.
not_available The intel originated from Navarro.
not_available You're telling me Navarro was the one who sold the intel to the Chinese, but he made it look like my husband did it? He set my husband up.
not_available Is that right? Yeah.
not_available Son of a bitch! ERIK: Kate! Kate, hold on.
not_available Kate! Do you understand what he did? I get it, I get it, I know.
not_available But this is not the time or place.
not_available Go to your office.
not_available KATE: I can't do that.
not_available Go.
not_available Now.
not_available That's an order.
not_available What's that about? I'm still finding out what else Navarro was into.
not_available Looks like he was the one who sold secrets to the Chinese, and set Kate's husband up to take the fall.
not_available I'm getting authorization to have him sent down to special activities for enhanced interrogation.
not_available That's not gonna work.
not_available Navarro was in covert ops.
not_available He's been trained to resist those exact same techniques.
not_available What do you suggest? Let me talk to him.
not_available Bauer He views you and everybody else here as a subordinate.
not_available He will not be afraid of you.
not_available But he knows my history.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, you can talk to him.
not_available Soon as he's set up in interrogation.
not_available But if you cross the line, I'm pulling you.
not_available Just so we're clear, I wasn't asking.
not_available That was me being courteous.
not_available JACK: Kate I don't need you to say anything.
not_available I know.
not_available At least your husband's name has been cleared.
not_available It's too late for that, Jack.
not_available My husband got a life sentence, and a month into it, he hung himself all because of that son of a bitch who I thought was my friend.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to interrogate Navarro.
not_available We need to find the override device.
not_available You need to decide whether or not you want to stay here.
not_available Nobody would fault you if you chose to step aside, especially me.
not_available MAN: Okay.
not_available The readings are coming in Respiration and thermal elevated, as you'd expect.
not_available It's gonna be hard to get a reading until we get him settled into a baseline.
not_available I don't need biometrics.
not_available As long as you remember the ground rules.
not_available Right.
not_available I'd like to observe.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Take off the restraints, give us the room.
not_available You know the drill, but I'm gonna lay it out for you anyways.
not_available The CIA knows you had Agent Reed murdered.
not_available And you've been selling secrets to the Chinese, and had Agent Morgan's husband framed for it, who was also a federal agent.
not_available I am an eye witness to you stealing the override device and handing it over to Adrian Cross, knowing its full potential as a weapon of mass destruction.
not_available There is only one outcome here, and that is the death penalty.
not_available Unless, of course, you cooperate.
not_available Help us find it.
not_available Then I'm pretty sure I can get them to take that off the table.
not_available The truth is I never knew I was dealing with Adrian Cross.
not_available He kept all of our interactions anonymous.
not_available But I do know how you can find him, and the override, if you move quickly.
not_available In return, I want full immunity.
not_available Signed by the President.
not_available Period.
not_available No negotiations.
not_available End of discussion.
not_available Nobody here is going to give him immunity, right? And before you bother to object, remember we are talking about a weapon of mass destruction.
not_available Aren't we, Jack? I'm going to ask you one last time nicely.
not_available Where's the override device? Come on now.
not_available You and I both know they're not going to let you hurt me.
not_available Agent Ritter is acting Head of Station, and there's no way he's going to let you screw up his career.
not_available Let's face it, Jack.
not_available Anything you say or do between now and me getting that immunity is just a waste of time.
not_available Tick took.
not_available Well, I can assure you full immunity is not on the table.
not_available But your hand is.
not_available JACK: Where is the override device? Clear this room! Get him out of here! Medic! Get off! Medic! Get a medic in here.
not_available Sergeant You're not going to get away with this.
not_available Not after what you did to Adam! Go! Put a guard on him.
not_available Take him down to the medical.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available No one near him.
not_available You cannot make a deal with this man.
not_available Go! Listen to me, Kate.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available If Navarro really does know how to find the override device, then I have to make the case for immunity in return for information that might lead to recovery of the device.
not_available The rest is up to the President.
not_available The President wants an immunity agreement drawn up for Steve Navarro.
not_available That's hard to understand after what he did.
not_available You don't have to understand, just draft it out for him as soon as possible.
not_available Okay.
not_available The AG needs to sign off on it too so set up a link to the Justice Department.
not_available You want me to patch it through to the office or the cell? Sir? Uh, the office.
not_available Thanks, Ron.
not_available You got it.
not_available I'm sorry that I snapped at you when I was with my father.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mark, look, I know that he put you in an impossible situation ordering you not to tell me that he was turning himself over to Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available But that's not what this is really about, is it? The distance between us? What do you mean? The moment Jack Bauer showed up in London, things changed for you.
not_available That's the truth.
not_available Admit it.
not_available Mark What happened between Jack and I, that was a long time ago.
not_available That may be true, but clearly you've not resolved your feelings for him.
not_available Why are you going there? Because I'm tired of dancing around like this.
not_available I want to know where we stand.
not_available I made a commitment to our marriage and I intend to honor it.
not_available Well, I'm glad that I'm an obligation that you're taking seriously.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available What did you mean? I can't talk to you when you're like this.
not_available Audrey.
not_available It's Mark Boudreau.
not_available Put him on the phone.
not_available It's him.
not_available I hope you're calling to tell me you have Jack Bauer ready to turn over to us.
not_available Not exactly.
not_available Moscow will be very sorry to hear that they'll be letting your State Department know you forged your President's signature on Bauer's rendition order.
not_available I suspect prison may be in your future, my friend.
not_available Look, I don't have Bauer but I can tell you how to find him.
not_available Go on.
not_available He's in the field.
not_available He's using an encrypted CIA comlink.
not_available I have the transmission code.
not_available Your men will be able to pinpoint his location.
not_available That would be satisfactory.
not_available My aide will text you on a secure channel.
not_available Upload the code to him there.
not_available Needless to say, my involvement in this remains between us.
not_available If we successfully acquire Bauer, no one will ever need to know.
not_available Adrian? Do you have it? ADRIAN: Yes.
not_available ls everything ready? Yeah, we should be fully operational in about Right, Chloe and I should see you then.
not_available Have you told her everything? ADRIAN: Yes.
not_available Speak to you shortly.
not_available Right.
not_available Adrian, I gotta go pee.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Yes? All right, all right.
not_available Hey! Wait, wait! No, wait, wait! Don't go! Give me that.
not_available Just give me that.
not_available Just give me that.
not_available Why do you insist on disappointing me? What is wrong with you? You can't actually think this would work.
not_available I would've thought, of all people, you might have understood.
not_available Distributing weapons to everyone? Get in the car.
not_available Just get in the car.
not_available Are you asking me or telling me? I think you know the answer to that.
not_available How about giving me something for the pain? I've been instructed not to.
not_available Naturally.
not_available Get your hands up right now.
not_available Kate, what are you doing? You, shut up.
not_available Get your hands up.
not_available Turn around, right now.
not_available Turn around, get against the wall, now.
not_available On your knees.
not_available You too.
not_available On your knees.
not_available Kate, you don't have to do this.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available You framed my husband.
not_available He's dead because of you.
not_available Just think about what you're doing.
not_available You've got a long career ahead of you.
not_available Do you understand that, when Adam was arrested, I blamed myself for not knowing he was a spy.
not_available And, all the while, you stood by me pretending to be my friend.
not_available Kate, if you kill me, the CIA will never get their hands on that device.
not_available I don't give a damn about that! Easy, Kate! Bauer, get her off of me! Kate, put the weapon down.
not_available Back off, Bauer.
not_available This has got nothing to do with you.
not_available We need him alive to know what he knows.
not_available He doesn't know anything.
not_available He's playing us.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Bauer! Agent Morgan, put it down! He's got no idea where the device is.
not_available He's lying just like he lied about everything else! No, I'm not! I put a tracker on the device.
not_available I can tell you where it is.
not_available You lying bastard! Please, put the weapon down and let him talk! I can give you the trackers code.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I'm going to put a bullet in your head.
not_available Kate, Kate! Put the weapon down! Three, eight, four, six, nine, romeo.
not_available Three, alpha, four, six, nine, romeo.
not_available That's the code.
not_available I'm telling you the truth.
not_available Did you get that? Gavin.
not_available Running the trace now.
not_available Seems to be legit.
not_available It's already triangulating within a four mile area.
not_available Copy that.
not_available He's logging onto the override device.
not_available It worked.
not_available You're done.
not_available You're going to be executed for murder and for treason.
not_available And I'm going to be thereto watch.
not_available ERIK: What the hell's going on? Agent Morgan broke Navarro.
not_available We got a lock on the override device.
not_available We need to move immediately.
not_available We don't know how long Adrian Cross is going to stay put.
not_available Kate.
not_available Weapon systems in the Middle East may also be vulnerable to the override.
not_available The Chinese carrier making its way into the Mediterranean is fraying a lot of nerves.
not_available What's your recommendation? Should we alert NATO? Sir, I'd be very wary about broadcasting the existence of a device that can access our defense systems.
not_available It would be extremely destabilizing.
not_available Sorry, I'm late.
not_available Here's that immunity agreement you asked for.
not_available Not going to be necessary.
not_available They managed to get Navarro to talk.
not_available That's good news.
not_available What did he tell them? He installed a tracker on the override device.
not_available We're not taking anything for granted.
not_available We're just praying that Jack and the lac teams can locate it and locate it quickly.
not_available Bauer's involved in the operation? Yeah, he's leading it.
not_available All right, General, what are we doing to protect ourselves against this? GENERAL: All branches of the military are on system
not_available wide security alert.
not_available Gavin, we're approximately five miles from the outer perimeter of the search grid.
not_available Do you have a location? It's taking a while to lock in.
not_available Something must be blocking the signal.
not_available Can you do something about it? Try and compensate.
not_available Send you approximate coordinates.
not_available Still going to be a large search radius.
not_available JACK: Work fast.
not_available Tactical one, do you copy? Tactical one.
not_available Over.
not_available We can't enter as a convoy.
not_available Adrian Cross's people will see us coming from a mile away.
not_available I want you to enter the grid from the south.
not_available Teams two and three from the east and west, respectively.
not_available Copy that.
not_available You okay? The last time I saw my husband, he was in custody.
not_available We were going to go over his appeal.
not_available He was really happy to see me until he realized that I no longer believed him.
not_available I'll never forget the look in his eye.
not_available I know that was the moment that he decided to take his own life.
not_available Not because he was convicted, but because I had deserted him.
not_available How am I supposed to live with that? You just do.
not_available Four years ago, my partner My friend was killed.
not_available And I took as much revenge as any man could possibly take.
not_available Cost me everything I had.
not_available What was left of my family.
not_available Everything.
not_available Somehow, I thought it would ease the pain, but it doesn't.
not_available And, somewhere in your heart, you have to really accept that.
not_available And then you can begin to forgive yourself.
not_available ADRIAN: I've moved everyone here.
not_available This way.
not_available It used to be a college tech lab.
not_available Budget cuts.
not_available They're all going to be very happy to see you.
not_available Do they know what you're planning on doing with the device? Yes, yes.
not_available Stosh? Chloe? Chloe? Chloe, we've got to go.
not_available Stosh.
not_available Chloe, come on.
not_available We've got to go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stay rig ht there.
not_available Cheng.
not_available CHENG: Take the device.
not_available How did you do this? What, this? I didn't do this, you did.
not_available When you tried to deceive us.
not_available Look, we've paid you to develop the override.
not_available Not for you to give it away to the rest of the world.
not_available Your government would have got what it paid for.
not_available He doesn't work for the Chinese government.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available You are along way from home.
not_available You're working with Chang? Are you insane? How do you know him? He was with Chinese intelligence, head of security at the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.
not_available His own country had him arrested.
not_available He's supposed to be rotting in prison.
not_available He kidnapped Jack, had him put in a secret prison outside Beijing, and tortured him for over a year.
not_available When Audrey Heller went to go look for him, he did the same thing to her.
not_available The device has been altered.
not_available What have you done? Yates has modified it so that it focuses on the US drones' core.
not_available Well, you will restore it to the original state.
not_available Look, I don't have the expertise for that sort of thing.
not_available All right? I believe you.
not_available But I'm sure you can manage.
not_available Right? I'm not going to help you.
not_available No! And the next one is in his brain.
not_available Okay, okay, stop.
not_available I'll help you.
not_available Come on, answer the phone.
not_available This is Anatol Stolnavic.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available Anatol, this is my third message.
not_available Call off your men.
not_available Do not apprehend Bauer.
not_available Call me as soon as you get this.
not_available Gavin, this is Bauer, do you have a lock on that location yet? Affirmative.
not_available Two
not_available story building, four ground entrances.
not_available I'm showing satellite uplinks, several T1 trunk lines.
not_available You're less than three minutes out.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Send the address over to Agent Morgan.
not_available Don't wait too long for calling in backup.
not_available I know you have a history with Chloe O'Brian.
not_available My priority is the override device.
not_available Stay focused on your job.
not_available Stop worrying about me.
not_available How much longer? I don't know.
not_available If you're stalling or trying to doing anything to compromise this device I'm working on the buffer configurations.
not_available If it was easy, you wouldn't have me doing it.
not_available It'll be done when it's done.
not_available What are you planning on doing anyway? Don't concern yourself with that.
not_available Just focus on the task at hand.
not_available Get up.
not_available We're good.
not_available I can handle it from here.
not_available What about the virus she planted? Deleting it now.
not_available Your screen was mirrored by his.
not_available I knew you were going to sabotage the device.
not_available You needed me to access the firmware interface.
not_available Thank you for opening the door, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available We're not going to get out of this alive.
not_available Don't say that There's something I Should tell you about.
not_available Your husband and your son What? About a year ago, I came across some documents that disproved what you had been led to believe about that car accident Their deaths.
not_available What do you mean? It was an accident, Chloe.
not_available No one was trying to kill you.
