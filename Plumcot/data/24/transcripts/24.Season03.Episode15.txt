
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Alan Miliken is dead.
not_available All signs point to a heart attack.
not_available What happened, Sherry? I went to the house to speak to Julia.
not_available There was an arguement and he had a heart attack.
not_available Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly what happened.
not_available I tried to get his medication.
not_available What do you mean you tried? Sherry stopped me.
not_available We believe Michael Amador's in possession of Cordina virus.
not_available He's either heading to Los Angeles or he's here already .
not_available Our only lead is Nina Myers She thinks Amdor's meeting with the man by the name of Marcus Alvers What about Nina? She's out of the pay check.
not_available I hope so.
not_available She can point to both of us.
not_available Just want to get you an update on Nina.
not_available Richards is working on her now.
not_available I think that's a mistake.
not_available Why? I don't think anybody should be in there that hasn't worked with her before doesn't know what she's capable of.
not_available All Richards does is inflicting pain.
not_available There's no way for her to manipulate him Nina, I don't think you've met Darron Richards.
not_available How much more of this you want to into it, Nina? I think this is about it.
not_available She hurt her neck.
not_available Let's call medical.
not_available No, she's bleeding.
not_available Come on, we've got to take her down now.
not_available Nina tried to commit suicide.
not_available Where is she now? She's in the clinic being operated on.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Put your hands on your head.
not_available Come on, kill me.
not_available Nina.
not_available Damn it.
not_available You don't have any more useful information, do you, Nina? I do.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available The following takes place between 3:00 am and 4:00am Tony What happened? Nina Myers is dead How? Jack shot her Chappell's on his way to talk to him right now Was it justified? Jack wouldn't risk this operation just to get vengeance Are you sure about that? This is the gun I used, send it over to ballistics for a match Yes, Sir.
not_available Secure this area till forensics gets here and pull the surveillance footage off of there Jack, can I have a word? Just give me a minute No, Jack.
not_available Now! Look it's ok, I'm fine.
not_available Go Be right back What the hell happened here? Nina tried to escape Yeah, I know she tried to escape How did she get shot? She pulled her gun I pulled mine in self defense Just like that? Just like that.
not_available Nina was our best chance at locating this virus She was a material witness in an ongoing investigation I know exactly what she was, Ryan Division's going to want me to certify this shooting Then do it You have to come with me and look at security playback Fine Kim, you all right? Yeah, I'm ok I got here as soon as I heard To go with Chappelle for a moment, I will be back as soon as I can.
not_available I will stay with her, Jack It's ok, I am fine She tried to kill me It's over now, ok? Your father stopped her Yeah, except, I don't know what happened What do you mean? He told me to leave the room, and I heard shots.
not_available Kim, you are safe.
not_available Ok? And that's all that matters.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Ever since she killed my mother, I have been wanting Nina dead, and now that she is It's not going to bring my mother back And I just didn't think I was gonna feel this way How do you feel? I'm not sure It's ok Come on He is here We were getting worried We have a job to do You have got plenty of time I am curious About what? Why you chose such a limited target? Why not the airport? Or a sports arena? If the objective was to inflict maximum casualties, That's not the objective.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Then why are you doing this? To send a message.
not_available Most of you already know, but for those of you who don't Jack Bauer shot and killed Nina Myers while she was trying to escape custody The order from division specified that we use non lethal force It's over, Chloe.
not_available She is dead.
not_available So how can we find the virus.
not_available Alvers has it, and Nina was our only connection to Alvers.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available The reason we were onto Alvers in the first place is because he was Michael Amador's contact in Los Angeles.
not_available The search order for Amador is still active.
not_available Technically, yeah.
not_available But we've pretty much exhausted all our leads Then run them again and widen the parameters.
not_available Cross reference financial transactions, travel itineraries, aliases, whatever it takes to find him.
not_available We are still operating under the assumption that Amador's in Los Angels with the virus? That's right, and the Russians have just sent us some intel that supports that assumption.
not_available It's a detonating device, part of the Soviet's bio warfare arsenal till late 1980s It's used to disperse pathogens throughout the atmosphere.
not_available Three weeks ago, a dozen of these were stolen from an armory in the Ukraine.
not_available They also believe that Alvers and Amador are arming these detonating devices with vials full of the virus, which means we all have to work fast, so let's get going.
not_available Place the vial here To actually arm the device, flip switches one and two Then wait ten seconds and flip the third switch, which activates the timer.
not_available When the timer goes off What's the dispersal radius? A hundred meters, and the dispersal rate increases geometrically, depending on wind and weather Better than I thought I made some modifications.
not_available So, Michael Tell me how it went down in Mexico.
not_available You don't think I would find out I didn't think you needed to know As long as you got what you wanted You were stupid enough to believe that Jack Bauer had turned against CTU.
not_available And now you've got every intelligence agency in the country after you.
not_available Bauer's story checked out.
not_available Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer What you did in Mexico was stupid, it was greedy and it may have cost me my advantage.
not_available Alvers and I still expect to be paid The authorization code is 7QV78 This is only half.
not_available I'll release the balance after I've received confirmation on the hotel The deal was, we get paid in full The deal changed when you went down to Mexico Now after you've hit the hotel, you'll get the rest of your money Fine Adam I've got to comb through these data streams, Chloe, so unless it's important I don't really have time right now..
not_available I think I have a thread on Amador.
not_available What are you talking about? A gold certificate account registered to one of Amador's aliases It's a Zurich bank, but it was activated by a local server.
not_available When? Just a few minutes ago.
not_available Kim, get over here I need you to run a back trace.
not_available What's going on? Chloe found a bank in Zurich that maybe talking to Amador Chloe, what's the sequencing program? Beta one If this turns out to be real, how long before you tag the location? Five minutes, ten tops She was down when you shot her She was going for her gun Yeah, that's what you keep telling me It's the truth You knew where the security camera was You stood in front of it to obscure any visual record of the shooting Ryan, she was going for her gun I wish I could believe that, but I don't For God's sake, Jack, there's something called due process.
not_available It's why we've got judges and juries and laws.
not_available Don't you dare tell me about the law Nina Myers killed my wife and they let her go, and she would have killed my daughter if I hadn't gotten there when I did Using drugs to maintain your cover is one thing I was willing to look the other way But I have got to answer to my bosses about the questionable shooting death of a key witness.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available we're in the middle of something here.
not_available I assume finding the virus is a priority What do you got? We may have Amador.
not_available Chloe flagged a Zurich account registered to one of his aliases Someone accessed it locally, we'll have point of origin any minutes now.
not_available Get the field teams ready Tony's on it Jack, this isn't resolved yet We've got a live lead, Ryan.
not_available And what do I tell division? That I let you stay on active duty while you've still the subject of an investigation? It's my ass on the line here, too.
not_available Look, I've been working with Jack all day, and with all that's happened, he's still operating at a higher level than anybody else in the field, including me I didn't ask your opinion I'm giving it to you anyway.
not_available Excuse me? Sir, if this lead turns out to be real, we need Jack on site.
not_available And believe me, you will want him there.
not_available They'll crucify me if I let you back out in the field Will you give me a minute? It's your call, Ryan I understand the position you're in But I give you my word, I can do my job.
not_available Thank You Listen, Julia I thought I was clear you can't be contacting me today I'm scared, Wayne.
not_available They've already started to question Beatrice, and I'm next.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Where's your lawyer? He's not here yet.
not_available Ok, first of all, you're innocent.
not_available Remember that, all right? I'm not innocent.
not_available I let Sherry convince me not to give Alan his medication.
not_available I could have saved his life.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available What about Sherry? Has she said anything to the President? No, No, she won't.
not_available She told him it was an accident.
not_available Now, whether he believes her or not is another matter.
not_available I just Wayne? Yeah Wayne Yeah, Bill, the President just walked in, so I'm going to have to get back to you on that.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so scared.
not_available Yeah, yeah, and I understand that.
not_available Just, remember what I said, ok? Yeah.
not_available All right Well, what did bill have to say? Uh, found out that Alan died That didn't take long.
not_available Yeah He wants us to know that we have his support on the health care bill That's good Have you spoken to Julia yet? No.
not_available Maybe you should call her.
not_available Get her side of the story.
not_available David, I think we should stay as far away from this as possible Which means you don't believe Sherry that it was an accident.
not_available Look, I don't know what to believe All I know is what it will look like You calling Sherry to deal with Milliken, and a few hours later he winds up dead.
not_available Let's go Dad, just heard back from division They're going to have a man on the inside His name is Jim Wong Here's an update on your strike team.
not_available Thanks You ok? Yeah, I'm ok Did Chappelle question you about shooting Nina? Yeah And? I told him I wasn't sorry that Nina was dead.
not_available I wasn't sorry that I shot her She posed an immediate threat to you, to me and to thousands of innocent people You had to do it, didn't you? Yeah Come here I got to go Wayne? What's going on? You tell me Look, it's late and I'm a little too tired Sherry, I know about Alan Milliken Yes.
not_available It's awful.
not_available I already told David what happened.
not_available Except you left out the part about you preventing Julia from giving Alan his medication.
not_available You stood there and you watched a man die.
not_available You would have done the same thing had you been there.
not_available I never would have been there in the first place! Listen, David asked me to come here to help clean up your mess.
not_available What do you think he expected me to do? What he expected was for you to get Alan off his back, Sherry, but no like this Complex problems sometimes have the simplest solutions, Wayne, you know.
not_available Oh, for God's sake You're upset.
not_available That's understandable.
not_available But what is done is done.
not_available This is insane.
not_available Sherry, you are insane We can control the situation, Wayne.
not_available We just need to be on the same page.
not_available Sherry, I'm sorry, but David's going to have to handle this.
not_available David can't know about this.
not_available For his own protection, if he doesn't know anything, he's got nothing to deny.
not_available Sherry, we can't cover this thing up.
not_available We can and we will.
not_available That's why you're talking to me instead of David Because you understand what has to happen, Wayne.
not_available Yeah, you've got it all figured out, don't you? Wayne What did you say to Julia? Not to talk to anyone until she spoke to a lawyer.
not_available Good.
not_available Then as long as she keeps her mouth shut, we'll be fine.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Milliken? I'm detective Norris I am sorry for your loss.
not_available Thank you I know this is a difficult time for you, but I'd like to ask you a few questions.
not_available Unless that's a problem.
not_available No, no, it's just that my lawyer wanted me to wait for him before I talked to anyone.
not_available Really? Did he say why? You know lawyers.
not_available Unfortunately, I do.
not_available But these questions don't require counsel.
not_available They are pretty straightforward.
not_available According to the officers, you told them that you were asleep in bed when the body was discovered.
not_available Yes.
not_available Alan and I have had separate bedrooms since the stroke.
not_available And you didn't hear anything until the housekeeper woke you up? That's right Because you see, she says she heard a car starting up and leaving the driveway.
not_available Our driveway? That's what woke her up.
not_available She got to the window in time to see a light colored car driving away.
not_available She thought it was a Mercedes.
not_available I didn't hear anything, so I wouldn't know.
not_available Do you have any friends that drive a light colored Mercedes? Detective, half the people we know own a Mercedes, and we know a lot of people.
not_available Are you aware that the security cameras in your surveillance system are shut down? According to the time code, it appears they were shut down about an hour before your husband's death.
not_available Beatrice is the one who arms the system before she goes to sleep, so you should ask her My partner did.
not_available She doesn't know anything about it.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Are you sure about that? Yes You don't sound very sure.
not_available Detective Norris, exactly what are you implying here? My husband was a very sick man.
not_available He died because he was sick.
not_available That's probably true.
not_available But it's beginning to look like he might have had some help.
not_available I'm sending you revised grid coordinates, so open up a data pipe.
not_available Tony, how close are you? Whoever accessed Amador's account did it from somewhere on this grid.
not_available We're guiding the field units as we go.
not_available Chase, did you get the new coordinates? Yeah, I got them You're too far north.
not_available You're gonna have to adjust toward Broadway.
not_available Ok, go right on college.
not_available I'm not going to have an address for another few minutes, so why don't I call you when I get it.
not_available All right Ok, I appreciate what you said to chappelle earlier I wouldn't have said it if I didn't mean it Still Finding the virus is all that matters right now Everything else can wait.
not_available You're gonna wait to tell Kim about your daughter? No, we talked about it How'd she take it? She's handling it fine.
not_available She's handling it fine? Look, it's between Kim and me.
not_available If you don't mind, I'd like to keep it that way.
not_available Yes, I mind.
not_available She's my daughter.
not_available She's a grown woman, Jack.
not_available We care about each other.
not_available We should stay focused on what we've got to do Where are you? I am here How long will it take? About 25 minutes Hurry I will Get it done so we can get our money It's got to be done right I don't want to be in any of the body bags they will be carrying out of here.
not_available Hello Is this Sherry Palmer? Yes.
not_available Who is this? I'm detective Michael Norris with the LAPD.
not_available I'm sorry to bother you this time of night.
not_available Detective Norris, how did you get this number? It was given to me by a woman named Julia Milliken.
not_available Do you know her? Yes, I do Were you with her tonight? Tonight? No, I wasn't She says you were.
not_available Well, she's lying.
not_available I have been right here all night And where is "here"? Here is in the district offices, with my ex
not_available husband president Palmer He asked for my help on a political matter, and I am sorry, detective, do you mind telling me what this is about? Mrs.
not_available Milliken's husband died about an hour and a half ago.
not_available Oh, I'm so sorry.
not_available She claims that you and she caused his death by withholding his medication.
not_available Well, that's preposterous.
not_available I haven't seen Mr.
not_available Milliken or his wife in over three years.
not_available And you say that you were with the President since what time? Since about 10 o'clock That's over five hours ago.
not_available And if we were to contact president Palmer, he'd be able to confirm that? I am sure he will Thank you, Mrs.
not_available Palmer.
not_available We'll be in touch.
not_available Wayne.
not_available Outbreak scenarios from the National Health Services.
not_available Nothing like a little light reading.
not_available They're sending over a liaison to answer any questions that you may have.
not_available No doubt I'll have many.
not_available Anything else? No.
not_available Wayne I'm your brother I think I know when there's something on your mind No, I just wanna make sure you're ok I'll let you know when this is all over David Yeah The reason I joined your administration was because I thought I'd be an asset.
not_available The last thing I ever wanted was to be thorn in your side.
not_available Wayne, you are an asset.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, There is a lot of smart people out there you could have hired.
not_available But none that I trust as much as you.
not_available Wayne Palmer.
not_available Wayne, it's Tony, we have lead with virus.
not_available Jack is on the way with a team now All Right I'll have someone updating you I want you to stay on the line with me I want to be apprised of everything that happens as it happens CTU may have located the virus.
not_available Jack Bauer's leading the operation What about this area? He's walking his way down Jack Hey, Bill This is my partner Chase Edmunds.
not_available Have you get a man on the inside? Yeah.
not_available He's been through about half the rooms in the club.
not_available Have you seen Alvers or Amador? Not yet Captain, north room is clear.
not_available I'm moving down the main corridor I count 15 people I'm still not seeing either target Copy.
not_available There are three rooms adjacent to the hall.
not_available They may be offices.
not_available I'm checking it now.
not_available Captain, I've got an armed man outside the door of the southernmost room Don't move He was looking in your room.
not_available Lieutenant.
not_available Lieutenant Wong Get your men in there now Team A, move on target.
not_available Team B, maintain perimeter.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Get down on the floor.
not_available Get down! Get in there! Let me see your hands! Target's been neutralized, repeat, target's been neutralized All units sweep the building Where's the virus, you son of a bitch? You're too late, Jack Chase Take him into one of the other rooms.
not_available We got some works to do I don't want to be disturbed by the SWAT guys.
not_available Set him down there You betrayed me, Jack You were with CTU all along That's all right, Amador, you betrayed me, too I am just better at it than you Yeah, well, it won't matter in the long run.
not_available You have no idea what you're up against.
not_available Why don't you tell me? He knows who you are, Jack What are you talking about? Who knows who I am? Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer.
not_available That's what he said If you go against him, you're a dead man.
not_available All I want to know right now is where the virus is.
not_available I don't know I've passed it off.
not_available Look, you can do what you want to me, I'm not gonna tell you anything.
not_available What are you afraid of? Who are you afraid of? We can protect you.
not_available Can you, Jack? Yes And my family? Yes You couldn't even protect your own.
not_available I'm going to ask you this one last time Where is the virus? Go to hell Chase Where is the virus? When he comes to, you do it again.
not_available This is Bauer Jack, I'm transferring you to Tony right now I'll take it over here Jack, I'm putting you on speaker.
not_available Ryan's with me.
not_available We've got Amador.
not_available What about the virus? No, we were late.
not_available He had already passed it on.
not_available Passed it on to who? We haven't been able to find out yet.
not_available Amador's terrified, and he doesn't scare easily.
not_available He did tell me one thing, though Whoever's behind this apparently knows me very well That's not much to go on, even if it's true Yeah, I understand that But we also just can't ignore it I want you to cross check everybody that I've worked with over the last 5 years on both sides of the law See what names we come up with We'll check it against what we know about the virus.
not_available All right, we're on it.
not_available Agent Bauer Yeah We found an incubator There is no contamination, but we are gonna isolate it, run a few tests, then send it back to NHS We also found some prints, a few hairs.
not_available We're sending them back to your lab for a workup.
not_available Ok, good work Jack, what's going on? They found the incubator There is no leakage.
not_available They're gonna run some tests and then send it over to NHS.
not_available All the other evidence is coming back to our lab We're gonna do the workup Agent Bauer Yeah We found Amador's laptop Tony, hold on one second Most of the files are heavily encrypted Can you read any of it? Chandler Plaza Hotel on Wilshire What about it? His hard drive has the dull architectural schematic.
not_available Structural, plumbing, electrical When was the last time this file was accessed? Tony, I think we got a high probability target What is it? The Chandler Plaza Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard.
not_available Adam, get me head of security at Chandler Plaza Hotel Sure.
not_available Jack, should we evacuate? No.
not_available We don't even know if the virus has been released.
not_available Evacuating the hotel could only accelerate an outbreak.
not_available We need to contain the building.
not_available We need to do it without starting a panic All right, look, I'll set up a soft perimeter, no police presence We'll send a team from here run the operation on site Tony, no one, and I mean no one, goes in or out of that building, Do you understand me? Copy that.
not_available Good Dennis Yeah.
not_available I need you to call NHS, have them send teams to the hotel as soon as possible.
not_available And most importantly, they have to operate under the radar, all right? Tony, I have the head of security for the Chandler Plaza Hotel, Craig Phillips Mr.
not_available Phillips, this is Tony Almeida, head of CTU.
not_available How can I help you? There's been a threat against your hotel.
not_available As of this moment, it's very important you not allow anybody in or out of the structure, you understand? I understand, what's the nature of the threat? The release of a infectious substance inside the hotel.
not_available You're saying that the substance has already been released? It's possible.
not_available We don't know for sure.
not_available Do we know who's responsible? You're probably looking for a man named Marcus Alvers.
not_available His description is being sent to you as we speak.
not_available Now, I want your people to do a search of the hotel as soon as you get it.
not_available Does that mean Alvers is already inside the hotel? We have to assume that's the case, yes.
not_available All right, I'll start a search All right, I'm bringing a CTU team.
not_available I'll call you as soon as we arrive.
not_available Right Thanks What the hell is this? Ryan assigned me to head the team that's going to the hotel.
not_available Ryan, this is not I don't want to hear it As the head of CTU, you have an obligation to stay here at the center of information flow Michelle has more hours of disaster control simulation than anyone else on staff, not to mention her practical experience from the DC anthrax outbreak Michelle will lead the team, Gael will second.
not_available You will be in constant communication.
not_available Pass on any guidance you can based on intel that comes in.
not_available They're waiting for me Michelle Look, I don't care what Ryan says.
not_available I can get somebody from division to take your place.
not_available No, he's right.
not_available I should be the one to go.
not_available All right, then you let me know the second you get your people set, all right? We're a couple minutes away from the hotel Where's NHS? They're getting ready.
not_available They should get there in a little while A while? What does that mean, two minutes? Ten minutes? Probably closer to 20 We don't have that kind of time, Tony I understand, but you wait until they get there, all right? I don't want anybody going inside that hotel without bio suits.
not_available We can't wait too long, Tony.
not_available if we have to go in and stop the virus Michelle, you wait All right, that's an order Fine Anything else? No What's wrong? Just stuff between Tony and me.
not_available Sorry Things haven't been right since he got back from the hospital.
not_available The last couple of months, Tony and I have been working pretty closely together, planning this operation It's been eating away at him that he wasn't able to talk to you about it.
not_available I just want this day to end Did you lock the garden doors? Yes, sir Good Mr.
not_available Phillips.
not_available CTU has just arrived.
not_available They're outside the front door.
not_available Good.
not_available Listen, a maintenance man just walked through.
not_available I don't remember seeing him before.
not_available Turnover's pretty high in engineering.
not_available Check it out anyway, all right? He was here not ten seconds ago.
not_available Yeah, sure Good This is Phillips Mr.
not_available Phillips, this is agent Michelle Dessler from CTU Have you circulated the Marcus Alvers photo yet? Yes, so far, nobody has seen him We're halfway through the common areas of the hotel After that, I need you to start on the guest rooms.
not_available That's going to take us some time unless you can lend us some manpower We'll be coming in as soon as the Hazmat suits arrive.
not_available My people don't have any Hazmat suits.
not_available I know that, Mr.
not_available Phillips.
not_available We'll bring some when we come in.
not_available Yeah Michelle, I pulled this off the security camera Alvers.
not_available How long ago was this? About half an hour ago Has he come back out? Not as far as I can tell Half an hour He may have already released the virus But if he hasn't, we may be able to stop him I can't order anyone in because it's against protocol But Alvers is in there, we might still have a chance to stop it.
not_available Did you find that maintenance man? No.
not_available But Pence says he just saw someone he didn't recognize heading toward the utility room.
not_available He's going to check it out Mr.
not_available Phillips, where can we set up? You can use this area or this area over there I thought you were going to wait for these Hazmat suites They'll let us know as soon as they get here.
not_available This guy you're looking for, we might have an idea where he is Let me take you there Why don't you tell me and I'll check it out? Put your hands in the air I am a federal agent Lady, lady, take it easy Slowly Move over to where I can see you I am a maintenance man, for God's sake I just set the thermostat in the other room Stop right there Put your hands on your head! Put your hands on your head!! Wrap your right arm around the pipe Now cuff yourself Where is the virus? If this virus gets out, you die just like everyone else It's in the central ventilation unit Gael, can you hear me? I hear you The virus is in the central ventilation unit I am on my way Found it.
not_available It's in a vial Stay clear, Gael NHS should be here any minute.
not_available I will send down a Hazmat suit There may not be enough time for that, Michelle The vial's inside a detonating device The timer is armed.
not_available I got to get to it and disarm it
