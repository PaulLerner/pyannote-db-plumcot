
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been targeted.
not_available And people that l work with may be involved in both.
not_available l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.
not_available Hello? 
not_available We're not leaving town today after all.
not_available When will you know? 
not_available l'll call you as soon as l know.
not_available ls that the girl? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The threat against Senator Palmer remains a high probability.
not_available These three men are the suspected shooters.
not_available A member of my advance team, Elizabeth Nash, she recognised one of the assassins.
not_available Mr Bauer, Senator Palmer told me about you.
not_available Would you be willing to keep your appointment? You want me to spy on him? George, what are you doin' here? 
not_available l'm the new quarterback.
not_available Bauer's wife and daughter are in a safe house.
not_available As planned, they will be dead soon.
not_available Hang on, Kim! l think we lost him.
not_available l'm just gonna go check.
not_available l want you to stay right here, OK? 
not_available Kim! What's your name? l don't remember.
not_available Mom! Mom! Mom! Do you remember anything yet? No.
not_available lt must be weird.
not_available l mean, l never met anyone that has amnesia before.
not_available l really appreciate you helping me out.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Tanya.
not_available Tanya.
not_available l hope you're not going too far out of your way.
not_available lt's fine.
not_available The hospital isn't far from here.
not_available So, you come from money.
not_available You look like you might.
not_available Or your husband.
not_available My husband? 
not_available Your little band of gold? On your finger? l don't have any memory of my husband.
not_available Agent Pierce, Jack Bauer.
not_available We met at the breakfast this morning.
not_available l'm sorry about that.
not_available We didn't know the pressure you were under.
not_available ls your family OK? Yes, they're fine, thank you.
not_available This is my partner, Nina Myers.
not_available Agents Johnson, Aleshire, surveillance technicians.
not_available You've met Miss Nash.
not_available She's part of the senator's advance team.
not_available Yes, from the senator's staff meeting.
not_available Can l just say how sorry l am to have caused so much trouble? You didn't know who Drazen was.
not_available Now you know he's a killer, 
not_available it takes courage to walk into the same room.
not_available l hate to interrupt, but we have to go.
not_available Drazen is down here in room 1243.
not_available We went over it.
not_available lt's nothing unusual.
not_available lt's ready to rig however you want to.
not_available That gives us less than 30 minutes to set up visual and audio.
not_available Fibre optics? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We also need to set up monitors in an adjacent room.
not_available We have 1242, across the hallway.
not_available lt's been vacated already.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Gentlemen, l want you to get started right away.
not_available l want coverage of every square foot of this room by at least two angles.
not_available Nina? 
not_available Yeah? Take Miss Nash into 1242.
not_available Start prepping her.
not_available We'll be there in a minute.
not_available Have you set up the other checkpoints? 
not_available Every entrance to the hotel is covered.
not_available So is every approach from a block away.
not_available Any civilians left on the floor? 
not_available No, we've sealed it off.
not_available Good work.
not_available Let me know as soon as Drazen enters this hotel.
not_available l think there's a hospital at the bottom of the canyon.
not_available l'm not sure how good it is.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Pull over.
not_available You see something you remember? 
not_available Yeah, l think so.
not_available The restaurant? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you recognise anything? 
not_available l've been here before.
not_available l was with someone.
not_available With your husband? Not your husband? Maybe we should keep going, to the hospital.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Just being here helps.
not_available Hey, is there a maÃ®tre d' or a manager or something? 
not_available Manager.
not_available Mr Martin.
not_available ls he here? No, but he should be in about 20 minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available l'm gonna wait.
not_available Maybe this Mr Martin knows something about me.
not_available This place seems so familiar.
not_available l think l'm gonna stay.
not_available You don't have to wait with me.
not_available So, listen.
not_available Why don't you give me your number, and when l'm better, l'll send you whatever l can afford.
not_available You know what? Send me whatever you can afford, plus ten bucks.
not_available lt's a cab fare to the hospital, in case Mr Martin can't help you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good luck.
not_available So, obviously, without compromising yourself, we need you to behave in the same way you always have with him.
not_available l know.
not_available lt's just the thought of letting him touch me again l understand.
not_available What do you usually talk about with him? His work? The truth is, we didn't really talk much.
not_available lt wasn't that kind of relationship.
not_available lt was more take the plunge and worry about the consequences later.
not_available You know what l mean? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, l'm waiting on the signal.
not_available Elizabeth? 
not_available Hi.
not_available l heard what's going on.
not_available Are you sure about this? 
not_available l'm sure.
not_available lf you have the slightest hesitation 
not_available No, l want to.
not_available Definitely.
not_available May l talk to you a minute? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available l told you to look after her, not put her in danger.
not_available Senator, l don't need to remind you, but the threat against you is very real.
not_available lt's no reason to put someone else at risk.
not_available l don't think l have.
not_available l'll be across the hall with a squad of men, ready to come in if something goes wrong.
not_available He's a professional killer.
not_available Things can happen fast.
not_available He is not working alone.
not_available Arresting him will not stop the others.
not_available lf you want to put an end to this now, sir, we keep him on the hook.
not_available l know you've been through a lot, and your family has gone through hell What does that have to do with this? l hope you're not letting a desire for payback cloud your judgment.
not_available Sir, this has nothing to do with payback.
not_available This is simply the best way to nail these guys, period.
not_available Elizabeth's father is one of my oldest friends.
not_available l have known her since she was born.
not_available lf anything happens to her, l'm holding you personally responsible.
not_available l understand, Senator, and l promise you l will take care of her.
not_available CTU.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Hi.
not_available l'd like to speak to Jack Bauer.
not_available He's not here.
not_available Can l take a message? Listen, it's really important.
not_available l need to speak to him now.
not_available Who is this? 
not_available Kim, his daughter.
not_available Are you calling from the safe house? 
not_available No.
not_available The safe house has been attacked.
not_available The agents that were guarding us are dead, and my mother is gone.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
not_available The agents are dead? Yes.
not_available And l think they've kidnapped my mother again.
not_available l need to speak to my father.
not_available He's not here, Kim.
not_available Where are you calling from? Um Can l speak to Nina Myers? 
not_available She's not here either.
not_available Where are you calling from? 
not_available A payphone.
not_available Kim? 
not_available Who did you say this was again? Tony Almeida.
not_available l work for your father.
not_available Tell me where you are.
not_available l'll have somebody come get you.
not_available Kim? 
not_available That's what they said to my mother.
not_available That was Jamey Farrell.
not_available She was dirty.
not_available That won't happen again.
not_available Where are you? l'll have somebody Listen to me.
not_available l need to speak to my father or Nina Myers.
not_available He's not here, Kim.
not_available Neither one of them are here.
not_available Kim? Hello? We got a problem.
not_available Jack's daughter says the safe house has been hit.
not_available The agents are dead.
not_available Call over there right now.
not_available Nothing.
not_available lt's not even ringing.
not_available Parker, get Biselli and head over to the safe house on Pine Canyon.
not_available Heads up 
not_available could be trouble.
not_available Call me when you get there.
not_available She also said that her mother might have been recaptured.
not_available How'd Kim get out? 
not_available She didn't say.
not_available She just said she was calling on a payphone.
not_available Access the phone company's computer for all recent payphone calls 
not_available within five miles of the safe house.
not_available All right.
not_available Are you gonna call Jack or you want me to? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available lt's his wife and kid.
not_available That's exactly why.
not_available He'll get emotional and distracted, put Elizabeth in jeopardy.
not_available She's going in with Drazen in 15 minutes.
not_available We need to keep Jack focused.
not_available Then when do we tell him? 
not_available We don't.
not_available l do.
not_available When the situation's under control, and not until.
not_available Clear? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Standing by.
not_available Copy.
not_available He's on his way down.
not_available Are you finished? 
not_available Ready in ten.
not_available How's Elizabeth doing? 
not_available She says she's OK, but, Jack, l don't know.
not_available Sure we're doing the right thing? 
not_available lf she can plant the device, it'll lead us to everything else.
not_available Yes, we are.
not_available lf she can't? 
not_available We'll arrest him, try and turn him.
not_available He can't touch her.
not_available We can protect her.
not_available l hope so.
not_available Stay focused and we can.
not_available Hey! 
not_available What? Are you all right? l'm sorry.
not_available l just can't stop worrying about Teri and Kim.
not_available When l think what they've been through 
not_available My little girl thought she was gonna die.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available We're gonna get them, OK? Look, if it's any help, from what l could tell, Teri and Kim seemed all right.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What did the doctor say? 
not_available Just some bruises.
not_available That's it.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nina? Yeah? You said that Paulson was gonna finish the debrief? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why didn't you stay and finish it? l thought you wanted me back as soon as they were safe.
not_available No, l specifically asked you to stay with them Hey, Nina! 
not_available Yeah, Mike, just a minute.
not_available Go back.
not_available l will be there in a minute.
not_available Yeah? l told you to take it off the hook! Yeah? 
not_available Rick, it's me.
not_available Kim, l told you you can't keep calling here.
not_available Look, the safe house was bad.
not_available The agents are dead and my mother is kidnapped again.
not_available l know they're after me.
not_available You need to help me.
not_available Listen, l'm coming to your place.
not_available No! You're the only person who knows the people that have my mother.
not_available l don't! l 
not_available Rick l can't go to the police.
not_available l don't trust them.
not_available After today, l don't trust anyone.
not_available But if you don't help me right now, l will tell the police everything.
not_available Now, what is your address? OK, l'm gonna call a taxi right now.
not_available l'm gonna meet you there as soon as l can.
not_available Wait for me.
not_available Who was that? Another wrong number? How's the election going? 
not_available Exit polls look very good.
not_available That's great.
not_available Dad, l'm sorry.
not_available Sorry about what? You weren't covering up Ferragamo's death to protect your campaign.
not_available You did it to protect me.
not_available Where'd you hear that? Your mom? No, not Mom.
not_available There is some physical evidence in George Ferragamo's office that leads directly to you.
not_available Subtle enough so the fire marshals didn't find it the first time.
not_available But with a little help, they'll find it.
not_available So l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder? 
not_available Like l said, whatever it takes.
not_available That's why your father backed off, and that's why you'll back off.
not_available Do you know how dangerous it was to go see Carl wearing a wire? Look, it doesn't matter.
not_available l got it.
not_available Now you can take it to the police.
not_available Give me the tape.
not_available What are you gonna do with it? Do you trust me, Keith? lt's me.
not_available There's been a development.
not_available Palmer is staying in Los Angeles after all.
not_available The Nash girl called you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l'm on my way to the hotel now.
not_available Did she say why the senator changed his plans? 
not_available No, he didn't tell her.
not_available Really? She's a highly placed aide.
not_available Well, they've tightened security since the attempt on his life at breakfast.
not_available l wonder that she wants to see you again so quickly.
not_available You were with her two hours ago.
not_available You don't understand women, Andre.
not_available l understand them well enough to know that they can use as well as be used.
not_available Not this one.
not_available Palmer should have been killed hours ago.
not_available We can't afford any more mistakes.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available He's as good as dead already.
not_available You have to trust me in this.
not_available The Nash woman will tell me Palmer's schedule.
not_available She doesn't suspect a thing.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Just to be safe, when you're finished kill her.
not_available Miss Nash, please follow me.
not_available We've been planting fibre
not_available optic cameras here, there and all through here as well.
not_available l'm not really sure what those are.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available Fibre
not_available optic cameras are tiny cameras.
not_available They're almost impossible to see, even if you know where to look.
not_available So when you come into the room, we'll have visual coverage of the entire suite.
not_available And you'll be able to hear everything too? 
not_available Yes, every word.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Mm.
not_available OK, now, he's gonna be here in a few minutes.
not_available This is the tracking device that we want you to plant on Alexis.
not_available Once he leaves the hotel, we'll be able to track every move that he makes without exposing ourselves at all.
not_available Where do l put it? 
not_available Preferably his wallet.
not_available He'll have it on him at all times, even if he changes clothes.
not_available As soon as you plant this device, l'll call you on your cellphone.
not_available l will tell you the senator is waiting for you.
not_available You make your excuses, and you get out.
not_available So l plant the tracker, the phone rings 
not_available And then you'll leave.
not_available OK.
not_available One more thing.
not_available lf at any point you think he's suspicious or you're uncomfortable in any way, all you have to do is utter the words ''l hope l'm not getting a cold.<br>'' ''l hope l'm not getting a cold''? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then l'll be in this room in a few seconds with half a dozen other agents.
not_available But that would ruin the plan.
not_available That doesn't matter.
not_available Right now all we're concerned with is your safety.
not_available Do you understand that? l understand.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available lf you're uncomfortable in any way, no one here will think any less of you.
not_available l'm fine.
not_available And thank you.
not_available For giving me this chance to redeem myself.
not_available You're going to be fine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Mrs Bauer? How good to see you.
not_available You know me? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Will Dr Parslow be joining you? Dr Parslow? l'm sorry.
not_available What's your name? Mrs Bauer, are you feeling all right? Actually, no, l, uh l must have been in an accident or something.
not_available l l seem to have lost my memory.
not_available But l was driving by and this place looked familiar, so You say my name is Bauer? Yes.
not_available Does that sound familiar? Yes, it does, but But this man you mentioned 
not_available Dr Parslow.
not_available You two used to come in here together quite often.
not_available But he's not my husband.
not_available Well he's a doctor, and he's a friend.
not_available Maybe he can help.
not_available l happen to know the hospital that he works at.
not_available Shall l give him a call? Yes, please.
not_available We're set.
not_available ls everything up and running? 
not_available Yep.
not_available How's Elizabeth? 
not_available She's in her room, waiting for Alexis to call.
not_available She said she wanted to be alone.
not_available Understandable.
not_available Yes.
not_available You wanna tell me what's going on? 
not_available What do you mean? You've been holding something back ever since you got back from the safe house early.
not_available This isn't the time.
not_available Let's not get distracted.
not_available lf you don't start telling me what's going on, l'm going to be distracted, so spit it out.
not_available All right.
not_available Teri knows about us.
not_available She guessed it.
not_available l don't know how she did, but she did.
not_available She asked me point
not_available blank.
not_available l couldn't deny it.
not_available She would have known.
not_available Did you tell her that it was over? Of course l did.
not_available l think she was just shocked that it was me.
not_available Someone she knows.
not_available When Teri and l got back together l tried to talk to her about this, but she said she didn't wanna know, so l just let it go.
not_available Look, Jack.
not_available You asked me to go to the safe house, so l did.
not_available l was just trying to help.
not_available l know, l know.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available This is all my fault.
not_available Agent Bauer, come in.
not_available Bauer.
not_available We're a go.
not_available Drazen just dropped off the car with the valet.
not_available Should be upstairs in two minutes.
not_available Copy.
not_available All personnel in the lobby and on the floors, we are a go.
not_available We're a go.
not_available He's in the room.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Advise when you are green to go.
not_available There's no wallet here.
not_available Let Elizabeth Nash know that the wallet is either in his pants, or the jacket on the bed.
not_available Copy that, Jack.
not_available Send her up in one minute.
not_available One minute.
not_available Hi.
not_available So good to see you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available l can't believe how much l've missed you.
not_available l know.
not_available Me too.
not_available Even though it's only been two hours.
not_available lt seems like two years.
not_available Are you OK? l'm fine.
not_available Why? 
not_available You seem a little tense.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available Well maybe a little.
not_available The polls back east close in less than an hour and we're alljust on pins and needles.
not_available Mm Well, you must have some idea about the outcome.
not_available Don't you take, uh 
not_available Exit polls.
not_available Yes.
not_available But they're not official.
not_available What can we do to help you relax? Well, it's a little early, but a vodka might be nice.
not_available Nothing else? lf you insist.
not_available You feeling any better? 
not_available Much.
not_available You still don't seem like yourself.
not_available l'll feel better after l've splashed some water on my face.
not_available She's going for the jacket.
not_available l want SWAT personnel ready at the door.
not_available Quietly.
not_available She's got the wallet.
not_available Oh, God, Jack, she's dropped it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, Elizabeth.
not_available You can do it.
not_available To the future.
not_available She's put it in her coat.
not_available SWAT team at the door, stand down.
not_available Stand down at the door.
not_available l'm sorry that this campaign is giving you so much stress.
not_available Goes with the territory.
not_available Maybe when the election is over, the two of us can go somewhere together.
not_available Like where? 
not_available lt doesn't matter to me.
not_available As long as we're together.
not_available So who do l have to thank for keeping you in town? 
not_available He's gonna feel the wallet.
not_available Just give her a second.
not_available She's all right.
not_available What made the senator decide to change his plans? l don't know.
not_available ls he gonna stay in town for long? lt's hard to say.
not_available What about his victory speech? Will he be delivering it here at the hotel? Why are you so interested in the campaign all of a sudden? l have no interest in the campaign.
not_available My interest is in you.
not_available And l know that you go wherever he goes.
not_available Well, l don't know where that is yet.
not_available Well, then l won't let you out of my sight.
not_available l must say, l do find it a little strange that the senator wouldn't include someone as smart and capable as you 
not_available in his inner circle.
not_available How would you know how smart l am? We've spent maybe 15 hours together, and most of that has been in bed.
not_available That wasn't smart.
not_available Was that a complaint or a compliment? Both, l think.
not_available l just realised that l haven't eaten all day, which may explain why l'm in such a foul mood.
not_available Do you think we could order something up? What are you hungry for? Where's the menu? l was hoping you would be hungry for something 
not_available There you go.
not_available Good girl.
not_available .<br>.<br>other than food.
not_available lt's in the jacket.
not_available She made the plant.
not_available Clear the hallway.
not_available Copy.
not_available Clear the hallway.
not_available l know this might seem a little soon l've fallen in love with you.
not_available The hallway's clear.
not_available Copy.
not_available l'm making the call.
not_available l thought that all women can sense these things.
not_available Pick up the phone! Aren't you going to answer it? 
not_available lt's just someone from the campaign.
not_available No, it could be important.
not_available They can call back.
not_available Say it again, Alexis.
not_available She hung up on me! 
not_available Say that you love me.
not_available What is she doing? 
not_available She's baiting him.
not_available l love you.
not_available And if l'm not very much mistaken, 
not_available it seems you are falling in love with me too.
not_available l got her voicemail.
not_available Wouldyou order me a hamburger? Ofcourse.
not_available What is she doing? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available Why did she take off her jacket? What is going on here? She has no intention of leaving that room.
not_available Room service.
not_available How may l help you? 
not_available Hello? A hamburger, please.
not_available All right.
not_available Everything on that? 
not_available Yes, everything.
not_available We'll send it right up.
not_available OK.
not_available What's that in her hand? So, now is there anything else? Yes.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available She's got a knife! 
not_available SWAT team, hit the room.
not_available Hit the room now! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Hold your fire! Get me some towels from the bathroom! Nina, call in a medevac.
not_available We're losing him! We cannot let him die! Dammit! 
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Um l'm looking for Rick.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available A friend.
not_available Are you the one that keeps calling? 
not_available He said that l could come over.
not_available Not to me, he didn't.
not_available Um maybe you should ask him, then 
not_available l was about to tell you.
not_available l just didn't think she'd get here so fast.
not_available What's going on, Rick? l'll explain everything.
not_available l'm listening.
not_available First let her come in.
not_available lt's OK.
not_available What does she want? Something got screwed up with Dan last night.
not_available Big surprise, right? That's why my arm was all messed up.
not_available The guys Dan was with shot me and You said you cut your arm on a fence.
not_available Um these people Dan knows, l need to find them.
not_available And l was hoping that l could go in his room and find something to lead me to them.
not_available A phone number, an address 
not_available So you wanna look through Dan's room? Yeah.
not_available l was wondering if l could borrow some money for the cab.
not_available Teri.
not_available You all right? You don't remember me? Phil? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you my doctor? No, not exactly.
not_available Henry, thanks for calling.
not_available Has she had anything to eat or drink? l offered, but she didn't want anything.
not_available No, it's Unless you want some water? 
not_available Sure.
not_available OK.
not_available Some water.
not_available All right, listen.
not_available We're gonna figure out what this is all about.
not_available We're gonna get you well again.
not_available Do you understand? lt's gonna be fine.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available What do you want me to say? We misjudged her emotional state.
not_available No, we didn't.
not_available You did.
not_available lt was an unexpected outcome for everyone.
not_available lt's what l said it would be.
not_available lt was a bad idea.
not_available Fine.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Now we need to figure out our next move.
not_available What is that? What's the status on Alexis? He has a fifty
not_available fifty shot, but even if he comes through, we don't know how long till he talks.
not_available Did you find anything in the room? Any phone numbers? Documents? 
not_available No, nothing yet.
not_available What do l tell District? Whatever you have to.
not_available Just keep them off my back.
not_available l need time before l fill out reports.
not_available Let me in! 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Where's Elizabeth? There was a stabbing? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available She's across the hall.
not_available She's in custody.
not_available What?! Why? 
not_available She stabbed Drazen.
not_available She was defending herself.
not_available No, that's not how it went down.
