
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been targeted.
not_available And people that l work with may be involved in both.
not_available l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.
not_available You and Sherry were childhood sweethearts? 
not_available That's right.
not_available There's never been anyone else? l'm running for president.
not_available l can't answer that.
not_available Come on.
not_available Are you flirting with me, Patty? l don't know.
not_available l think l might be.
not_available l did what you told me.
not_available And? l think it's working.
not_available But it's gonna lead to other things, Mrs Palmer.
not_available Teri, l'm busy.
not_available Nina can talk to you.
not_available You are not gonna let my husband die! No one is gonna let Jack die.
not_available We just can't go through with the trade.
not_available There's no difference.
not_available Without your help he doesn't have a chance.
not_available l am willing to trade the life ofJack Bauer for that ofmy son.
not_available OK, we're here.
not_available Here's Alexis.
not_available Where's Jack? Drop the weapon! You son of a bitch! lf your people deliver my brother as promised, you'll live.
not_available What about my daughter? 
not_available You'll hear from us when this is over.
not_available South ofthe platform there's a car.
not_available lfyou want to see Kim alive, talk to no one, get into it, and head toward Century City.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Proceed to Palmer's hotel.
not_available What do you want me to do? When your government abducted my father, they also froze $200 million of our assets.
not_available Palmer has the necessary clearance to unfreeze them.
not_available So everything that happened today was because of money? l wouldn't say that.
not_available That money is ours.
not_available We'll call Palmer at this number at exactly 10.<br>45.
not_available Once l receive confirmation of the transfer, l'll give you further instructions.
not_available What kind of instructions? 
not_available You want me to take out Palmer.
not_available Well, of course.
not_available That's why we let you go.
not_available That's why we have your daughter.
not_available Jack? 
not_available l'm still here.
not_available Remember, we'll call at exactly 10.<br>45.
not_available l trust l don't have to tell you what will happen if Palmer doesn't answer.
not_available Hello, Patty.
not_available You left the party early.
not_available l wasn't in the mood.
not_available What's up? l was just wondering if you had a chance to look at the Dallas schedule.
not_available lt's fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Um, do you need anything else from me? Sit down.
not_available A little while ago, we started down a road that was gonna take us to a dangerous place.
not_available l know.
not_available And l'm sorry.
not_available Are you? Sorry? l'm attracted to you, Senator.
not_available l always have been.
not_available Meet me in 20 minutes in room 907.
not_available l'll be waiting for you.
not_available Oh, David, good.
not_available l l, uh need to talk to you for a second.
not_available l'll just make those changes to the schedule.
not_available Thanks, Patty.
not_available l, uh told Keith and Nicole that we're going to stump it separately for the next couple of days.
not_available What did they say? 
not_available They know we're not getting along, David.
not_available Fine.
not_available What are they going to do? They'll stay with me.
not_available Unless, of course, you want them with you.
not_available No.
not_available l could use a couple of days alone.
not_available Great.
not_available We gotta work under a couple of assumptions here.
not_available The only way to find Jack is through Drazen.
not_available The only way to get to Drazen is if Alexis takes us there.
not_available So we gotta devote all of our resources to finding Alexis.
not_available Yeah, but he shed the trackers.
not_available l know.
not_available So we use the satellite and run computer simulators.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available George, it's me.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Drazen let me go.
not_available But l can't come in yet.
not_available What do you mean? George, listen.
not_available Tell Teri l'm out.
not_available l know she's worried about me.
not_available lfDrazen calls, don't tell him that we talked.
not_available lt'll put Kim in danger.
not_available Fine.
not_available But, Jack, let us help you.
not_available George, l gotta go.
not_available l don't like the sound of that.
not_available What do you think he's doing? 
not_available lf Drazen let him go for a reason Jack won't let us help him, he won't tell us what he's doing Whatever he's doing, he's trying to protect Kim.
not_available What's the one thing we know for sure that Drazen wants? Palmer dead.
not_available Jane, connect me with the Palmer suite, Secret Service.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available l can't stop the internal bleeding.
not_available Do not let him die! Father Alexie! Do something! l'm sorry.
not_available There's nothing more l can do.
not_available No.
not_available Leave us.
not_available We're family.
not_available First Mother and Martina Now Alexis.
not_available And it's Bauer! Andre, not yet! We still need her! 
not_available Call him.
not_available Let him hear her die! 
not_available Andre! Uh, could you wait for me, please? Thanks.
not_available Well? 
not_available He wants to see me.
not_available When? 
not_available Tonight.
not_available He didn't waste much time, huh? How are you doing? l told you, l feel really uncomfortable 
not_available No, no, Patty, please.
not_available Don't patronise me.
not_available You feel uncomfortable, but not because you're ready to be with my husband.
not_available You feel uncomfortable because you're doing it with my knowledge and consent.
not_available Why are you doing this, Mrs Palmer? lt's lt's important for David's career that l have his full confidence.
not_available And l no longer have that.
not_available And you want me to get it? Yes.
not_available And report back to me.
not_available We both know what it's going to? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We do.
not_available And you're OK with that? 
not_available No, l never said l was OK with it.
not_available But l'm willing to accept it because it's necessary.
not_available Your elevator's waiting.
not_available Just make sure that Palmer has an extra layer of security.
not_available lt's gonna be a little difficult 
not_available Yes, l know.
not_available Nina, got a minute? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available This is important.
not_available Paul, we're done.
not_available OK.
not_available What? The schematics to the detention facility where they were holding Victor Drazen.
not_available They've been tampered with.
not_available Who has access to these archives? 
not_available Division and District.
not_available Can you find out who's had access to these in the last month? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, do it.
not_available The sooner the better.
not_available You think this is a second dirty agent? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What did Tony want? He was just telling me why it was so hard to pick up a thread on Drazen.
not_available Listen, l need your help.
not_available Teri Bauer's a basket case.
not_available l don't know what you think l can do.
not_available You're good with her.
not_available You calm her down.
not_available Come on! l gotta deal with Chapelle, DOD's still trying to pass the buck All right.
not_available She's in the conference room.
not_available l know.
not_available ls it over? Did they make the trade? 
not_available Jack's safe.
not_available He's no longer a hostage.
not_available ls he on his way? 
not_available We don't know where he is.
not_available What? He called in to tell us he was OK, but he didn't say anything else.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Drazen wants him to do something else.
not_available That doesn't make any sense.
not_available Why would he do anything for that man? 
not_available l think it's to protect Kim.
not_available What are you talking about? Teri, the reason that Kim isn't back 
not_available Oh, no, no, no.
not_available Just listen to me.
not_available We think that's where Jack is now.
not_available He's trying to bring Kim back.
not_available He's not communicating with us to protect her.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available The task we have given your father is a simple one.
not_available And if he does it will you let me go? We will see.
not_available Jack, l just got your message.
not_available Senator, l need to see you right away.
not_available Your office said you might be coming.
not_available l am coming there.
not_available Why? 
not_available l have a message from Victor Drazen.
not_available They also said that Drazen has your daughter, and you could be a threat.
not_available They've added to my security.
not_available Secret Service has been instructed not to let you near me.
not_available They do have my daughter, but l'm not coming there to harm you in any way.
not_available What does Drazen want you to do? 
not_available He wants to speak to you at 10.<br>45.
not_available lt's a scrambled phone so that it can't be traced.
not_available What does he want to talk about? 
not_available Money.
not_available l'll explain when l get there.
not_available Just tell your people to let me through.
not_available Drazen's people, who are holding your daughter hostage, want me dead.
not_available You're asking a lot, Jack.
not_available They had my wife and daughter today, and l still managed to save your life.
not_available l'm not coming there to harm you in any way.
not_available l give you my word, sir.
not_available Hi.
not_available Anyone see you come up? No, l was careful.
not_available Why don't you sit down? Well, how much time do we have? Don't worry about that.
not_available l have something l wanna tell you, Patty.
not_available Yes? You're fired.
not_available Pack up.
not_available Get out.
not_available And don't bother to ask me or anyone else on my staff for a reference.
not_available Prospective employers won't like what l have to say.
not_available l don't understand.
not_available l know what you're doing.
not_available You're working with my wife against me.
not_available Senator, l'm sorry.
not_available l didn't mean to deceive you like this.
not_available But your wife insisted and l didn't know what to say.
not_available ''No'' would have done it.
not_available l know, l know.
not_available l should have.
not_available lt's just that she can be scary sometimes.
not_available So can l.
not_available Obviously l have made a terrible mistake in judgment, and if there's anything l can do l want you out of this hotel in 30 minutes.
not_available You gotta take a look at this.
not_available These six people have accessed the detention
not_available facility archives.
not_available The first five were just doing scheduled backups.
not_available Here's the sixth.
not_available George? George is the mole? lt's possible.
not_available He accessed that file four days ago.
not_available Why would he have done that if he wasn't involved? 
not_available You gotta call Chapelle.
not_available No, shut down his network access.
not_available You can't let anything go in or out.
not_available OK.
not_available l just gotta figure out how l'm gonna do it.
not_available Where were you? 
not_available Downstairs.
not_available Downstairs? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available ln room 907 with Patty.
not_available What? Save your energy, Sherry.
not_available No need to act surprised.
not_available l fired her.
not_available You know your problem, David? You think everyone's conspiring against you, when in fact we're just trying to help.
not_available By putting another woman in my bed? Do you realise how sick that is? Oh, come on.
not_available We chose a certain life, and we chose that a long time ago.
not_available lt's not about a house in the suburbs and PTA meetings.
not_available And whether you're willing to accept it or not, we serve a higher purpose.
not_available You are not qualified to talk about higher purposes.
not_available Oh, l'm not? 
not_available No, you're not.
not_available We are about to move into the White House.
not_available That's right.
not_available We.
not_available You and l.
not_available And all the issues, all the politics, all the hard work that's gonna help get us there l'm as much a part of that as you.
not_available So don't even try to deny it.
not_available Please, Sherry don't go there.
not_available l'm not begrudging a single thing, David.
not_available l don't need the limelight.
not_available You sent her to spy on me! That's right! And do you wanna know why? 
not_available Yes, l do.
not_available Because you need me to look out for you.
not_available And if you cut me out of your inner circle, like you threatened earlier today, you will fail.
not_available ln every way.
not_available You need me, David.
not_available What? 
not_available Jack Bauer just arrived, sir.
not_available l'll be out in a moment.
not_available We're not done here.
not_available Jack.
not_available Senator.
not_available Convincing Secret Service to let you come up to see me was difficult enough.
not_available They won't let me out of their sight.
not_available That's fine.
not_available All that matters is that you talk to Victor Drazen when he calls, listen to his demands and cooperate.
not_available How did they get your daughter? Senator, we don't have much time.
not_available He could call any second.
not_available OK, you said this was about money? 
not_available Yes.
not_available $200 million of his was frozen after he was abducted.
not_available And? 
not_available He wants it.
not_available He says you have the clearance to get it back.
not_available He'll give you instructions when he calls.
not_available That's why he sent you? To get me to release his funds? Once he has confirmation of the transfer, he'll ask me to take action against you.
not_available To kill me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Of course, l would never do you any harm.
not_available He has my daughter.
not_available l'm trying to buy time.
not_available Jack, l don't have the authority to transfer those funds, and Drazen knows that.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available He knows our system.
not_available That money's gone.
not_available l don't think that's the reason he's calling.
not_available Senator, please, answer this phone.
not_available OK, Jack.
not_available l'll do what l can.
not_available l'll tell him what he wants to hear.
not_available l can't guarantee he'll buy it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is David Palmer.
not_available Senator Palmer.
not_available lt must be nice being reunited with your friend Jack Bauer.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Drazen? Drazen? He knows you can't get the money.
not_available Senator No! Are you all right, sir? A detonation of this magnitude had to be military plastique.
not_available Get a powder residue.
not_available We'll try and trace it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Where is he? David! 
not_available Ma'am, this area's not Let her through.
not_available lt's OK.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Where's Keith and Nicole? 
not_available At the party.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available l'm fine.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Senator.
not_available This is Jack Bauer from CTU, the man who saved my life twice today.
not_available Mrs Palmer.
not_available The man that put your life in danger? Sherry, please! 
not_available Status report on the senator? Don't answer that yet.
not_available Senator, we need to talk about this.
not_available My daughter Tell them you don't know yet.
not_available This is Ron.
not_available We don't have a 20 on the senator yet.
not_available What's going on? The man that planned this explosion needs to believe that it was a success.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available You mean, you want the world to think that David is dead? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available David, what's this all about? His daughter is being held hostage.
not_available But we can't have people thinking David was assassinated.
not_available lt's preposterous! 
not_available lf we don't, ma'am, my daughter will die.
not_available Then what do you suggest we do, Mr Bauer? We keep the senator quarantined for a few hours.
not_available We leak a story to the press that he was killed in the explosion.
not_available You've got to be kidding.
not_available l've never been more serious in my life.
not_available No, it's not gonna happen.
not_available David, tell him.
not_available This is about the life of an innocent girl.
not_available David, we cannot keep playing games with the public and expect to keep their trust.
not_available Senator, if we're gonna do this, we need to do this now.
not_available Go downstairs.
not_available Bring the children up.
not_available Talk to no one.
not_available l mean it.
not_available l need all the agents that have seen the senator.
not_available Who is your senior chief of staff? 
not_available Mike Novick.
not_available Bring in Mr Novick as well.
not_available As soon as Mr Palmer's family gets here, no one is to enter or exit this area.
not_available Understood? Now, Sherry! 
not_available l'm very sorry.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Are you sure this is gonna work? 
not_available lt has to.
not_available Hey, Almeida.
not_available What's going on with my network access? What do you mean? 
not_available l can't access archives or Palmer's itinerary.
not_available l'll call lTS.
not_available l don't have time for that.
not_available Are you up? 
not_available Yeah, l think so.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Yeah, here it is.
not_available So Palmer's still going to Dallas tomorrow.
not_available Call Secret Service and find out what time his plane leaves.
not_available Division's got it covered.
not_available l don't think 
not_available Hey, real simple.
not_available Call Secret Service.
not_available Find out what time his plane leaves.
not_available And get my network up and running.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Well, he found out he's cut off.
not_available And he seems overly interested in what happens to Palmer after he leaves LA.
not_available We should alert Chapelle.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available lf we go to Chapelle without evidence, he'll slice us up.
not_available What about his access? 
not_available l'm gonna have to restore it.
not_available All right, but monitor everything and send it to me.
not_available Put it up on all the monitors! Everybody, eyes on monitors.
not_available Events are unfolding by the minute in this tragic and stunning development.
not_available The hotel has been sealed off.
not_available Only a limited number ofpersonnel are allowed inside.
not_available We have heard from a spokesperson from the Palmer camp, who hasjust confirmed that Senator David Palmer has been killed in an explosion.
not_available There is speculation this is related to this morning's assassination attempt, but at this time no one has been arrested.
not_available We did it, father.
not_available We did it.
not_available Ah, yes.
not_available All right.
not_available l'll take care of the girl, then we can leave.
not_available Do not do anything until we know that Jack Bauer is dead.
not_available Do nothing.
not_available Sir, we just contacted Mike Novick.
not_available He's on his way.
not_available Agent Bauer, it's for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available You're a very lucky man, Mr Bauer.
not_available l was calling to confirm your death, but l see you've survived.
not_available Andre.
not_available l have an offer to make you.
not_available You've killed Senator Palmer.
not_available l'm the last person on your list.
not_available l'll make you a trade: me for my daughter.
not_available Come to Port of Los Angeles.
not_available Dock 11A.
not_available What assurances do l have that you'll let her go when l arrive? Sadly, none.
not_available But we've decided the sins of the father need not be visited upon her.
not_available Port of Los Angeles.
not_available Dock 11A.
not_available l'll be there in 30 minutes.
not_available And, Jack, if you bring your colleagues or involve them in any way, we'll know.
not_available l understand.
not_available l have to go alone.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Why are you doing this to us? Yeah, Jack, l can tell him, but you should really let us help you on this.
not_available No, l can't, notyet.
not_available Give us a general position, so we can be nearby.
not_available No.
not_available lfDrazen's got someone else working on the inside, it could put Kim in danger.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me speak to Teri.
not_available OK.
not_available lt's Jack.
not_available Jack? How are you holdin' up? Where are you? Do you know about Kim? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l'm on my way to pick her up.
not_available She's fine.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available l can't say now, sweetheart.
not_available But l promise you, soon she's going to be with you.
not_available Thank God.
not_available What do you mean ''she''? What about you? 
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l meant to say both of us.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available l just don't think l can take much more of this.
not_available l need you both here, Jack.
not_available l know, sweetheart.
not_available Look, it's almost over.
not_available Just hang in there, OK? OK.
not_available Teri? What? 
not_available l love you.
not_available l love you too, Jack.
not_available Honey, um There's something l have to tell you.
not_available l've been waiting for the right time.
not_available What is it? You're gonna be a father.
not_available Again.
not_available What are you saying, that you're pregnant? Well, yes, that's generally how it works, Jack.
not_available Jack? 
not_available l'm still here.
not_available l'm sorry, it was the last thing l thought you were gonna say.
not_available Are you all right with this? Are you happy about this? Oh, yes.
not_available l am.
not_available l keep thinking that maybe it's the second chance we've been talking about.
not_available Are you there? 
not_available Yeah, l'm still here.
not_available Are you happy about it? Yes.
not_available Yes, l'm happy about it.
not_available l'm very, very happy.
not_available Good.
not_available Are you sure everything's OK? Yeah.
not_available Sweetheart l promise you everything is gonna be OK.
not_available lt's just been a really, really long day.
not_available Just get on back here so we can all go home, OK? OK.
not_available Teri l love you so much.
not_available l love you too, Jack.
not_available l'll see you soon.
not_available l had a sister once.
not_available She was full of life like you.
not_available She was a photographer and took hundreds of pictures.
not_available l used to love looking at them.
not_available Now l can't do that any more.
not_available You know how she died? Has anyone told you? Your father killed her.
not_available My father would never kill innocent people.
not_available You wanted to know.
not_available l don't believe you.
not_available Oh, he says it was an accident.
not_available But when a man goes halfway round the world to set off a bomb, he's responsible for any ''accidents'' that result.
not_available Has your father ever talked about his work? About where he goes on those long trips overseas? Of course not.
not_available He can't.
not_available Because he's a criminal.
not_available My father is a good man.
not_available No.
not_available He's not.
not_available Palmer's still alive.
not_available The suite at his hotel blew up, but apparently he got out unscathed.
not_available Why the reports? 
not_available l haven't been debriefed, but l guess it makes sense as a defensive strategy.
not_available Palmer's safe as long as the hitters think he's dead.
not_available This goes no further than the three of us until the public's made aware that he survived.
not_available What about the perpetrators? 
not_available lt's unclear.
not_available Our intel is being refreshed by Secret Service as we speak.
not_available So, stay at your stations.
not_available Start rebuilding profiles based on the incoming information and we'll have a new plan in place within the hour.
not_available Have you spoken to Jack since the first time he called? Not me.
not_available lt doesn't matter.
not_available This'll all be over soon anyway.
not_available Have you talked to Jack? 
not_available Yeah, he called, but he won't let us help him.
not_available lt's kind of cold.
not_available Do you mind if l have some coffee? Aaargh! Hey.
not_available Have you talked to anyone else besides me since Jack called? No.
not_available Why? lt's nothing.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Nina The past is the past, and until today you were mostly a voice on the phone for me.
not_available But l want you to know that l have nothing but respect for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And l think all three of us owe you our lives.
not_available Well, that's a bit of an overstatement, but Actually, no, it's kind of an understatement.
not_available There's something else l want to tell you.
not_available l'm pregnant.
not_available You are? Well, that's that's wonderful.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available That's great.
not_available lt's great.
not_available Well, l 
not_available Sure.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available How are we going to do this without the girl? Bauer has no choice but to trust us.
not_available Oh, there you are.
not_available We just got some new intel from Langley.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Yeah, take a look at this.
