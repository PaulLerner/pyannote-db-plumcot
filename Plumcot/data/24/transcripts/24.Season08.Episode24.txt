not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Jack planted a bug on Charles Logan.
not_available Î¤urns out Suvarov's the one who gave the order for Renee to be killed.
not_available l think Jack's targeted Suvarov.
not_available Does Jack have a recording of that conversation? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available We're gonna need it.
not_available Chloe, I don't know that getting proof is our first priority anymore.
not_available We can't stand by and Iet Jack assassinate the president of Russia.
not_available You knew the Russians were behind my husband's death, and you said nothing? l will not make peace with the people who murdered my husband or with you.
not_available You will sign the treaty your husband and I agreed to.
not_available l will not.
not_available You will.
not_available Because if you don't, my administration will retaliate against the l.R.K.
not_available with the full force of the American military.
not_available We'll find Bauer.
not_available It's only a question of time.
not_available Maybe a little quicker than you thought.
not_available I came in after Hassan and Renee Walker were killed.
not_available l didn't have anything to do with that.
not_available You have to believe me.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available Please, Bauer, I'm telling you the truth.
not_available l've got a family, I've got a little girl.
not_available I just got a call from Arlo.
not_available He picked up a facial recognition hit on Jack.
not_available Where? Across the street from the U.N.
not_available l'm gonna go find him.
not_available Give me 20 minutes.
not_available lf you don't hear from me, sound the alarm about Jack, and secure Suvarov.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? If I don't get you out of here in 10 minutes, Cole's gonna send in every agent we have.
not_available You should let them after me.
not_available You're my friend.
not_available l didn't have a choice.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available l have a 556 rifle pointed straight at your head.
not_available You need to do exactly what l say.
not_available Do you understand? What do you want? 
not_available l want you to call President Suvarov and have him meet you where you are as soon as the press conference is over.
not_available What am I supposed to tell him? 
not_available Try the truth for a change.
not_available Tell him you've got credible intelligence about a threat to his life.
not_available The following takes place between 3:00 p.m.
not_available and 4:00 p.m.
not_available Events occur in real time.
not_available As we gather together for this great occasion, we must not forget that we all stand in the shadow of Omar Îassan's tragic death.
not_available But the peace agreement we're about to sign will be his living memorial.
not_available Îis courage brought us all to this historic day, and his vision will continue to guide us as we move into the future together.
not_available So on behalf of the people of Russia, l extend the open hand of friendship to my partners in peace
not_available President Î¤aylor, President Hassan.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available There'll be time for questions after the signing ceremony.
not_available Please, please.
not_available lf there's nothing more, l wilI see you both at the signing.
not_available lt appears I am not the only one who does not want to be here.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hassan is distraught.
not_available Understandably.
not_available Îer husband was killed six hours ago.
not_available ls that why she refuses to look at me? She knows.
not_available A reporter told her of your complicity in her husband's murder.
not_available Dalia came to me.
not_available And you confirmed this journalist's allegations.
not_available l told her the truth.
not_available And yet, knowing what she knows, she is still here.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hassan understands the benefits of peace.
not_available Because you helped her come to that understanding.
not_available Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available Whatever it was you said to Mrs.
not_available Hassan to keep her here must have been very convincing.
not_available Take your call, Yuri.
not_available Charles.
not_available Yuri, we need to talk.
not_available So taIk.
not_available Uh, it's a sensitive matter.
not_available Something that, uh, that can't be discussed on the phone.
not_available All right.
not_available Come to my suite.
not_available No.
not_available You need to come to mine.
not_available Why? Just trust me, Yuri.
not_available Trust you? I don't need to remind you that it is in our mutual self
not_available interest to make sure that certain secrets stay secret.
not_available Stop talking in riddles, Charles.
not_available l don't have time for this.
not_available There's a possible leak inside of your camp, which is why we need to discuss this in my office.
not_available l'lI be right there.
not_available l hope l was convincing enough for you.
not_available You're a world
not_available class Iiar.
not_available l would have expected nothing else.
not_available What exactly do you think you're doing by killing Suvarov? Getting justice for Renee Walker? Yes, and for all the other people that died today trying to protect this country.
not_available Now, sit at the desk and keep the line open.
not_available Jack, the audio file you recorded
not_available we can use it to expose Suvarov.
not_available We can use the C.Î¤.U.
not_available servers to distribute it to every government agency and media outlet.
not_available President Î¤aylor's already censored the press.
not_available N.S.A.'s putting up firewalls.
not_available Arlo's working on getting through them right now.
not_available Î¤he president can't lock down every media outlet.
not_available That's Cole.
not_available lf l don't answer that, he's sending a tac team in here.
not_available Îe'll be too late.
not_available l'm gonna finish what l started.
not_available You've reached Chloe O'Brian's voice mail.
not_available Please leave
not_available Delta groups, this is base.
not_available Come in, Delta.
not_available This is Delta 1 .
not_available Go ahead.
not_available l need you to deploy all avaiIable tac units to the 22nd floor of the Hart Building.
not_available l have intel on a possible sniper.
not_available You got I.D.
not_available on this hostile? Affirmative.
not_available It's Jack Bauer.
not_available With regard to Bauer, sir, the standing order is to use lethal force.
not_available The order stands.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available Delta Î¤eams 2 and 3, this is a priority mobilization.
not_available Î¤he suspect is Jack Bauer.
not_available Îe's considered armed and dangerous.
not_available Maintain shooton
not_available sight protocol.
not_available Listen to me, Jack.
not_available Please.
not_available Jack, put down your rifle.
not_available Let me walk you out of here before they get here.
not_available Killing Pavel and Novakovich was one thing, but killing Suvarov? The Russians will consider an assassination of their president on American soil an act of war.
not_available Îe facilitated a terrorist attack against this country.
not_available That's an act of war.
not_available He's a murderer.
not_available You're provoking a war with a nuclear
not_available armed country.
not_available Shut up, Chloe.
not_available Or what? You're gonna kill me too? Î¤hese peopIe need to be stopped.
not_available They need to be held accountable.
not_available They brought this on themselves.
not_available l don't need to remind you of the collateral damage you're causing.
not_available Not to mention the innocent lives that are at stake.
not_available Sir, uh, President Suvarov is outside.
not_available Îe says you're expecting him.
not_available Excuse me, sir? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l heard you.
not_available Send him in.
not_available You're gonna start a war because you lost someone? 
not_available This isn't about me.
not_available Renee wouldn't want you to do this.
not_available I said shut up, Chloe.
not_available You know she wouldn't.
not_available She would want you to use that data card to getjustice.
not_available The last thing Renee would want is for you to start a war in her name.
not_available Jack, please, don't dishonor her memory like this.
not_available l think we should speak alone.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Î¤his personThe one you say is leaking information
not_available Who is it? I'm talking to you.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'lI do it your way.
not_available But you got to promise me you'll see this through.
not_available Because there's no way I'm getting out of this building alive.
not_available Jack
not_available You got to promise me that you will see this through, and that you will do exactly what I say.
not_available I need to hear it.
not_available l promise.
not_available l'm, uh
not_available l'm sorry for calling you so urgently.
not_available l was, uh, mistaken.
not_available My concern appears to have been unfounded.
not_available l
not_available l got a call from my source just a moment ago.
not_available Um, um
not_available His information was wrong.
not_available l'm so sorry for wasting your time, Yuri.
not_available Gregor.
not_available Vasily.
not_available See you after the signing.
not_available Find Pillar.
not_available Sweeping equipment, 22nd floor.
not_available Jack, the tac team's almost here.
not_available Ijust need to make it to Mobile Command.
not_available You won't even get that far.
not_available You won't make it out of the building.
not_available You and Cole found me first by circumventing C.T.U.
not_available lf Logan hasn't figured that out yet, he will soon enough.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available gave you a standing order with regards to me
not_available to terminate with extreme prejudice.
not_available lf you don't shoot me, that file's not going anywhere.
not_available Î¤ake your weapon.
not_available Take it! And point it at me.
not_available Point it! And when they come through the door, tell them you found me at the sniper rifle, l turned on you and you opened fire.
not_available Don't ask me to do something I can't do.
not_available Damn it, pull the trigger.
not_available We are running out of time.
not_available They are gonna find us soon.
not_available You said you'd do exactly what I would say, that you would follow this through.
not_available Now, pull the trigger.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can, and you will.
not_available Now, pull the trigger.
not_available No.
not_available Damn you, Chloe, pull the trigger.
not_available Jack
not_available We are running out of time.
not_available Pull the trigger.
not_available Please don't make me do this.
not_available l know how hard this is, but if you care about me, you will pull the trigger.
not_available Do it.
not_available l'm sorry, I can't.
not_available Chloe, pull the trigger.
not_available No, Jack.
not_available Pull the trigger.
not_available I'm not gonna do it.
not_available Damn you.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He drew his weapon.
not_available I shot him first.
not_available Jack Bauer's down with a gunshot wound to the upper chest.
not_available Send Medical to our position.
not_available I repeat, Bauer is down.
not_available Chloe, l've been trying to reach you.
not_available Burke's reporting you shot Jack.
not_available I had to.
not_available Listen.
not_available l'm on my way there right now.
not_available No.
not_available l need you at Mobile Command.
not_available Tell me what's happening.
not_available l have the recording of Logan and Suvarov's conversation.
not_available Jack gave it to me.
not_available lf he gave it to you, why did you shoot him? l'll explain later.
not_available Right now, you need to make sure that Arlo is ready to upload that file.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Just
not_available What's Jack's status? E.M.Î¤.'s are working on him right now.
not_available ls he going to make it? l don't know.
not_available l'll explain everything to you when l get there.
not_available See you soon.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available N.Y.P.D.
not_available found Mr.
not_available Pillar in the garage.
not_available Îe was locked in the back of his S.U.V.
not_available Îe wants me to hold you here.
not_available Why? Îe's been apprised of the situation, and he wants to debrief you.
not_available We can do it later at C.Î¤.U.
not_available I'm still running security here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian, he was adamant.
not_available I've got to get back to Mobile Command.
not_available Ma'am, his authority comes from the president.
not_available lf you want to make a call to the White House, we can do that.
not_available When will he be here? He's on his way up here now.
not_available Stay with him.
not_available Hmm, l'm sure it was a terrible ordeal, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available But they told me Bauer's down.
not_available It's over.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available It's not over, Jason.
not_available Bauer has a recording that implicates me along with Suvarov.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available Because the son of a bitch played the damn thing for me.
not_available He must've put a bug on me somewhere when he attacked the car.
not_available For all l know, he has recorded every conversation l've had for the past two hours.
not_available Well, l'm on site now.
not_available I'll recover whatever he's got.
not_available Hey.
not_available You're on the line here too.
not_available lf this evidence gets out, we all go down together.
not_available Yeah, l understand what's at stake, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available l'll call you back when I have the recording.
not_available Yeah.
not_available ls he stable? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir, as you requested, I searched Bauer.
not_available We're still combing the site, but that's what we found so far.
not_available There's nothing else? Like I said, sir, we're still sweeping.
not_available I believe this phone is yours.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's a, uh, digital recorder, sir, but it's clean.
not_available There's nothing in it.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available The data card's missing.
not_available Bauer has a digital file that poses a threat to national security.
not_available We need to find it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We'll keep looking.
not_available What happened up here? He drew his gun and l shot him.
not_available What more do you need to know? Did Bauer give you anything? 
not_available What would he have given me? Bauer had a digital recorder.
not_available Data card's missing.
not_available I thought you might know where it is.
not_available l don't know what you're talking about.
not_available You didn't see him stash it anywhere? lf I did, I would've taken it and already logged it as evidence.
not_available Then you don't mind emptying your pockets.
not_available Um, l just shot my friend, so
not_available Unless you want me to do it for you, I need you to empty your pockets now.
not_available On what grounds? 
not_available National security.
not_available Let's go.
not_available lf I search you, will l find that data card? Î¤his is ridicuIous.
not_available Put your hands up here.
not_available l just told you, l shot Jack.
not_available Why would I be heIping him? Sorry, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I have to be absolutely sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hope you enjoyed yourself.
not_available lt's over, Jack.
not_available You need to talk to me.
not_available Maybe do yourself some good.
not_available Where's the data card? ls he stable enough to be treated at C.Î¤.U.
not_available instead of the hospital? Îe should be.
not_available He got lucky.
not_available lt's a throughand
not_available through.
not_available Throughand
not_available through.
not_available Bullet didn't hit any of his organs or his arteries.
not_available lf you're going to get shot anywhere, that's where you want it to happen.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Get me Mobile Command! 
not_available Hey, Pillar.
not_available What? You got something to say to me? lf you've got something to say, you'd better say it now.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available What? 
not_available Aaah! Get him out of here.
not_available Go! Lock down O'Brian.
not_available Arlo's ready to receive the file.
not_available Chloe, you need to tell me why you shot Jack.
not_available Jack said they'd suspect me if I didn't.
not_available He said my only way out with the evidence was to shoot him.
not_available Medical report said it went clean through.
not_available That no vital organs were hit.
not_available You're telling me you meant to miss them? How did you know you wouldn't kill him? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available lt's uploading now.
not_available It shouldn't take long.
not_available Chloe? 
not_available I just need a few more seconds.
not_available What's going on? Just got orders to lock down Chloe O'Brian.
not_available What orders? 
not_available Please step aside.
not_available I'm not going anywhere till you tell me what's going on.
not_available Sir, we're not going to ask you again.
not_available Step aside.
not_available Don't.
not_available I order you to stop.
not_available I'm ordering you to stop.
not_available Don't! Is this the data card that Jack Bauer gave you? Yes.
not_available You need to listen to what's on it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pillar will make that determination.
not_available Pillar is part of the cover
not_available up.
not_available That data card will never make it to Evidence.
not_available Please.
not_available Hold them here.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Burke.
not_available Burke, stop what you're doing.
not_available Î¤hink about what you're doing, Burke.
not_available Stop! 
not_available Pillar.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pillar.
not_available l locked down O'Brian.
not_available Looks like she was working with Agent Ortiz.
not_available He's in custody too.
not_available Do you have the data card? Yes, sir.
not_available O'Brian was trying to upload the file to the main servers at C.Î¤.U., but I stopped the transmission.
not_available Good work, Agent Burke.
not_available All right, send O'Brian and Ortiz to C.Î¤.U.
not_available lockdown.
not_available They talk to no one.
not_available Get that data card to President Logan.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Î¤ake them to C.Î¤.U.
not_available Î¤his is it.
not_available This is the recording that Jack Bauer made.
not_available Bauer was working with Chloe O'Brian and a field agent called Cole Ortiz.
not_available Î¤hey were planning to use C.T.U.'s servers to disseminate this recording to news organizations, and
not_available and government officials and watchdog groups on a massive scale.
not_available lt almost worked.
not_available My people
not_available Î¤hey never gave up, and now it's over.
not_available You won.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Have you listened to this? Yes.
not_available Yes, but frankly, it's not worth hearing.
not_available Where is Jack now? Îe's about to be transported to C.T.U.
not_available under heavy guard.
not_available l realize that this is a difficult area, but the one thing we can be certain of is that Jack Bauer will never let this go.
not_available No.
not_available l don't suppose he wilI.
not_available All great achievements in state are fragile things, Madam President, especiaIly in their infancy.
not_available Î¤hey need to be protected.
not_available Our peace agreement
not_available Very vulnerable.
not_available As long as Jack Bauer is out there, the agreement will never be safe.
not_available And we will lock him away in a black site halfway around the world.
not_available Îe will find a way, Madam President.
not_available Mark my words.
not_available He will rise out of the deepest hole in the ground.
not_available He will claw his way back from the ends of the Earth unless we stop him before that can happen.
not_available Pending approval, I have taken upon myself to, uh, put a pIan in motion.
not_available Of course you have.
not_available l will take your silence as tacit approval.
not_available A lot of good people died today, not just President Hassan.
not_available Operatives from C.T.U., members of other law enforcement agencies.
not_available Renee Walker, who l was very close to.
not_available And these people died today because President Suvarov wanted to destroy the peace treaty for his own interests, and President Î¤aylor knows this because I told her, but she's willing to cover it up because she believes the peace accord will serve the greater good.
not_available She is wrong.
not_available lt won't.
not_available Yes.
not_available Both delegations are here, ma'am.
not_available What about the secretary general? He's just outside, in the atrium.
not_available Thank you, Î¤im.
not_available Lasting peace cannot simply be political.
not_available lt has to be born out of trust and honesty and understanding, and most importantly, a will on both sides to move forward.
not_available Currently, that will does not exist.
not_available Î¤his peace is fraudulent, and I cannot in good conscience allow the people that lost their lives today to go unspoken for.
not_available You reminded me of that earlier today.
not_available That's who I am.
not_available Bauer is being handled.
not_available It's done? Yes, sir.
not_available All right, then.
not_available You know, I wasn't sure the president had the balls to see this through.
not_available Clearly, I underestimated her.
not_available We both did, sir.
not_available Good luck, Madam President.
not_available This calls for a celebration.
not_available Îuh? A little something to numb that ear pain? 
not_available What are you drinking? Whatever you're having, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Yes.
not_available You did well, Jason.
not_available You kept your eye on the prize.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Here's to, uh, all the political capital the president is about to bank downstairs.
not_available And here's to helping her spend it.
not_available Right this way, please.
not_available l keep having to remind myself that we will be home tomorrow, and this day will be behind us.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, please, please, please, take your seats.
not_available Honored delegates and distinguished guests, on behalfof the United Nations, please allow me to welcome you to this great occasion of hope and peace.
not_available Today we bear witness to an extraordinary act in one of the world's defining dramas.
not_available lf you would allow me now just to offer a few private words to those of us that are fortunate enough to be here now.
not_available May we all pledge to make the spirit of this moment a new chapter in the history ofall nations.
not_available The President of the United States of America
not_available Please, would you join me? The President of the Russian Federation and the President of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan, would you pleasejoin me? Before you is the final draft of the agreement that has been negotiated by you and your representatives in good faith.
not_available By signing its pages, you commit your respective countries to abide by the terms set forth therein, as stipulated by international law.
not_available President Suvarov, I believe you are to go first.
not_available President Hassan.
not_available Your husband wanted me to have this.
not_available l cannot accept it.
not_available Madam President, what are you doing? What l should have done hours ago.
not_available l urge you to stop what you are about to do.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary General, my fellow delegates.
not_available Grave crimes have been committed in the run
not_available up to this treaty.
not_available l have participated in a conspiracy to hide those crimes.
not_available Before there can be a meaningful peace, justice must be served.
not_available l will be giving a more complete statement within the hour, but for now, this peace process has come to an end.
not_available Contact C.Î¤.U.
not_available and have them alert Jack Bauer's medical transport.
not_available Madam President
not_available He is about to be ambushed.
not_available Just make the call, Tim.
not_available We may already be too late.
not_available Dispatch, this is Î¤im Woods.
not_available I have an emergency.
not_available Î¤he convoy transporting Jack Bauer is about to be ambushed.
not_available Alert MedicaI 1 immediateIy.
not_available W
not_available Do it.
not_available Madam President, talk to me.
not_available Tell me what's happening.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available l have made a terrible mistake, Tim, and one that I can never undo, but I need you to help me stop it from becoming worse.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available priority call
not_available Come in, please.
not_available Î¤his is Woods.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We didn't make it.
not_available Î¤hey got Bauer.
not_available My statement is brief, and I will take no questions.
not_available Moments ago, President Î¤aylor declined to sign the peace accord, and excused herself from the proceedings.
not_available She did so after making allegations of crimes which she did not specify, and which the United Nations has no knowledge of.
not_available President Taylor said that she would come forward within the hour to explain the reasons for her actions.
not_available Until then, please, direct all queries 
not_available to the White House Communications Office.
not_available A shocking turn of events at the U.N., as President Taylor herself
not_available Î¤hat's the president asking about Bauer.
not_available No.
not_available Let it ring.
not_available With respect, sir, what good will it do? lt's over.
not_available Let's not add murder to the list of charges already against us.
not_available You know what, Jason? You're right.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Pick it up.
not_available Hello.
not_available This is President Taylor.
not_available l need to speak to Charles Logan immediately.
not_available Charles.
not_available This was my last chance, and Bauer took it away.
not_available lt's come to this because of him.
not_available It's locked.
not_available Open the door, Charles! This is Tim Woods.
not_available I'm with the president on the 22nd floor.
not_available We need the master key to Room 2206 immediately.
not_available Damn it, Charles.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Tim, I need Logan alive.
not_available Can they save him? They think so, but, Madam President, they're saying that even if he regains consciousness, he's probably suffered severe brain damage.
not_available Îe knew he was the only one who could locate Jack.
not_available Uh, not necessariIy.
not_available C.Î¤.U.'s drones have been in the air for the last four hours.
not_available They may be able to back
not_available trace Jack from the ambush site using archived surveillance video.
not_available Where is Chloe O'Brian? She and Agent Ortiz returned to C.T.U.
not_available about 1 0 minutes ago, under arrest.
not_available l want them released immediateIy.
not_available Tell Chloe to use whatever resources are at her disposal to find Jack.
not_available l've already done that, Madam President.
not_available Thank you, Î¤im.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What are youWhat
not_available Let go of me.
not_available O'Brian, you have no authority.
not_available I don't know what you think you're doing.
not_available Shut up and keep moving.
not_available What the hell is going on? Get your hands off of me.
not_available What the hell is going on? President Taylor didn't sign the agreement.
not_available She backed out at the last minute, but she had aIready ordered the hit on Jack.
not_available Did she call it off? She tried, but his ambulance has been ambushed.
not_available She has no way of contacting the hitters.
not_available Îow does she even know Jack's still alive? She doesn't.
not_available She's had everyone cleared from the floor except for you, me and Arlo.
not_available Arlo's redirecting the drone to over the ambush site.
not_available We just got police reports of an incident downtown.
