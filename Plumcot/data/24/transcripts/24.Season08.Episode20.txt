not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, you are ordered to turn the aircraft around and return to C.T.U.
not_available Jack's descending.
not_available Air force choppers are in pursuit.
not_available We've lost him.
not_available lf Jack gets this evidence and exposes the Russians, the agreement is over.
not_available Î¤he peace agreement may not be the only casualty.
not_available You covered up the Russians' involvement.
not_available Î¤hat's grounds for impeachment.
not_available There is still a chance C.T.U.
not_available will find Jack.
not_available Even if they do, the evidence is still out there.
not_available Eventually, it will surface.
not_available You need to control the evidence by keeping Walsh off the grid.
not_available Classify her as an enemy combatant and incarcerate her in a private facility.
not_available l've authorized a private interrogation team to acquire the evidence.
not_available Once we have it, she'll be irrelevant.
not_available l can't be a part of this any longer.
not_available Cite my health as the reason for my resignation.
not_available Î¤he president's ordered your transfer to an off
not_available site facility.
not_available What do you mean, offsite facility? 
not_available It's a secure location.
not_available Just do what he says, Dana.
not_available Chloe, don't let them do this.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Please, they're gonna kill me.
not_available Chloe! Chloe, please! You told Bauer you have evidence.
not_available l have got nothing to tell you.
not_available There is no evidence.
not_available Î¤he sooner you tell me, the easier it'll go.
not_available Mobilizing a sting operation to be led by Agent Ortiz.
not_available Î¤he target is Jack Bauer.
not_available Put your weapons down! 
not_available I can't do that, Jack! Put your weapons down now! I need you to help me gain access to Dana Walsh.
not_available l am giving you an opportunity to make this right, to make the people that are responsible for everything that happened today accountable.
not_available Chloe said she's in a safe house a few miles from here.
not_available Right now it's imperative that they think I took you hostage.
not_available Get up! 
not_available The following takes place between 1 1 :00 a.m.
not_available and 1 2:00 p.m.
not_available And though fate has prevented my husband from being here today at the culmination of his life's work, l know that he is watching us now, looking down and guiding us as we take the last steps towards this historic agreement.
not_available Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to President Î¤aylor whose integrity and moral courage have been unshakable during the long course of these negotiations.
not_available She is someone on whom my husband built an absolute trust.
not_available And l want to make it clear that her efforts and the efforts of the United States government to rescue him were nothing short of heroic.
not_available My husband wasn't perfect.
not_available None of us is.
not_available But he carried a perfect idea in his heart: that peace is possible.
not_available On this, the last day of his life, may the world come together and prove that he was right.
not_available What a magnificent woman.
not_available Okay.
not_available Who was that on the phone? Bledsoe.
not_available It's not the best of news, sir.
not_available Dana Walsh isn't being as cooperative as he'd hoped.
not_available Well, what does he expect? She's a trained enemy agent.
not_available She's not gonna break at the drop of a hat.
not_available Look, l told President Taylor what might be necessary, and she signed off on it.
not_available Bledsoe's a professional, sir.
not_available I'm confident he'll come through for us.
not_available He better.
not_available Sir, there was one more thing.
not_available Bledsoe wanted confirmation.
not_available About what? How to deal with Ms.
not_available Walsh, post interrogation.
not_available l thought we settled that matter.
not_available We did.
not_available So why is he asking? Just to double check we're still committed to the same outcome.
not_available And what did you tell him? We're still committed to the same outcome.
not_available Not that l have any idea what you're talking about.
not_available You understand? Perfectly, sir.
not_available Let her up.
not_available l'll give you a little tip.
not_available Take short, shallow breaths.
not_available You'll recover faster.
not_available And then we won't have so much downtime between sessions.
not_available It's up to you, you know.
not_available You can stop this whenever you want.
not_available All you have to do is tell me what l wanna know.
not_available l told you that I was making it up.
not_available There is no evidence.
not_available You told Jack Bauer you had proof that elements in the Russian government were behind the assassination of President Hassan.
not_available I was bluffing, stalling for time.
not_available There isn't any proof.
not_available Don't lie to me.
not_available l'm not lying.
not_available We begin again in 1 0 seconds.
not_available Seven, six
not_available Bring it on, you son of a bitch.
not_available Put her down.
not_available Where's the evidence? 
not_available Go to hell.
not_available Gag her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Î¤hey got two sentries out in front in a black sedan, one lookout on the roof, most likely another across the street, but I couldn't see him.
not_available We can access the back of the building through that alley.
not_available So, once we get Dana, what then? As painful as it is, we got to cut a deal in exchange for the evidence.
not_available You mean let her go.
not_available Cole, we both lost friends today.
not_available And Dana had a hand in that, but only a hand.
not_available lf we can get the people in charge, the people that gave the orders, it'll be worth it.
not_available lt's Chloe.
not_available Answer it.
not_available Otherwise, she'll know something's wrong.
not_available If she doesn't already.
not_available Îello.
not_available Cole, what's your E.T.A.? Ten minutes.
not_available F.D.R.
not_available Drive was a mess.
not_available We're coming up First Ave instead.
not_available ls Jack with you? Yeah, l got him.
not_available He's locked down in the back.
not_available l'm glad we found him before he got hurt or worse.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've known Jack for a long time, and l've never seen him like this.
not_available He threatened me.
not_available He's never done that before.
not_available You did the right thing, Chloe.
not_available Î¤hanks for saying that.
not_available l'll talk to you when you get here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're good.
not_available She has no idea.
not_available Don't be too hard on her, Jack.
not_available She was only doing what she thought was best for you.
not_available l know.
not_available l almost forgot.
not_available You're gonna need these.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available I just couldn't take the chance.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Yeah, l know.
not_available You ready? Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Keep your head down.
not_available Go.
not_available That's right.
not_available Four hours prior to the signing ceremony, all available field units will be redeployed to the U.N.
not_available Mobile Î.Q.
not_available is being set up on the first floor, adjacent to the high commissioner's offices.
not_available Îold on a second.
not_available I got O'Brian on the other line.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Who's the psych officer on duty? That would be Melissa Anderson.
not_available She did all the grief counseling last night.
not_available Make sure she's the first person Jack sees when he gets here.
not_available l want a complete eval.
not_available You really think that's necessary? l wouldn't have ordered it if l didn't.
not_available I'll let her know.
not_available l got a visual.
not_available They got one man on the roof.
not_available Okay.
not_available Wait till l get into position, then you draw him out.
not_available All units, this is Command.
not_available Please report.
not_available Command, this is unit one.
not_available All clear.
not_available Unit two.
not_available Street's clear.
not_available Unit three.
not_available Back alley's clear.
not_available Command, this is unit four.
not_available Roof's clear.
not_available All units, copy that.
not_available Stay alert.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You make that cover.
not_available I'll draw 'em out.
not_available Command, l'm taking sniper fire on the roof from the building across the street.
not_available I need backup now.
not_available Unit four, stand by.
not_available I'm sending backup now.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Hurry.
not_available All units to the roof.
not_available Unit four is under sniper fire.
not_available Repeat: All units to the roof.
not_available Unit four is under sniper fire.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available Unit two, do not stop moving.
not_available Keep it tight.
not_available Command, we're on the roof.
not_available It's quiet.
not_available There's no sign of Mullins.
not_available Come again? All's quiet, but we can't locate unit four.
not_available Unit four, come in, please.
not_available Where's Dana Walsh? Where is she? 
not_available Command, Mullins is down, sir.
not_available Last chance.
not_available Repeat: Mullins is down.
not_available First room to the left.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Command, do you copy? Command, come in.
not_available We're clear.
not_available First room on the left.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Put your gun down now! 
not_available You drop your weapon or I'll put a bullet in her brain! l don't wanna kill you, but I will if l have to.
not_available Put your gun down! You won't take the shot.
not_available It's too risky.
not_available I'll kill her before
not_available Cole, untie her.
not_available Cole, now! Take her out the back.
not_available We're gonna get company soon.
not_available Hurry! Cole, have you got her? Almost! l got her! 
not_available Move! Move! Stay covered.
not_available Îere.
not_available Cole, take the stairs now! 
not_available Jack! Get going! I'll be right behind you! 
not_available Chloe.
not_available In a second.
not_available Just finishing rescanning the field report.
not_available You need to hear this, Chloe.
not_available Agent Beck just checked in from the laundry.
not_available Îe said he's been locked down for the past half hour and only just now managed to free himself.
not_available What? Apparently, Jack didn't fall for the trap.
not_available lnstead, he reversed the entire squad and took Cole hostage.
not_available I just talked to Cole.
not_available Beck says Jack had him at gunpoint.
not_available Devon, pull up the satellite on the Lower East Side.
not_available Address: 14633 1 2th Street.
not_available Why? lt's where the private contractors are holding Dana.
not_available lt's where Jack's on his way to now.
not_available What is going on, Chloe? Îe's been two steps ahead of me the whole time.
not_available Îe probably knew what l was gonna do before l did.
not_available Îello, everybody.
not_available Can l have your attention, please? Jack Bauer's no longer in custody of C.T.U.
not_available Agent Cole Ortiz is with him, most likely as a hostage.
not_available Our priority is to find them now.
not_available Satellite's on
not_available line, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Put it up.
not_available We're too late.
not_available Put the A.P.B.
not_available back out on Jack, all agencies.
not_available Get me the White House.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available You said you had a video file implicating people inside the Russian government who are responsible for Renee's murder.
not_available l want that file.
not_available And I said l'd give it to you in exchange for immunity.
not_available That deal's off the table.
not_available Î¤he president decided the peace agreement is more important than the truth.
not_available As far as she's concerned, that file can never see the light of day.
not_available But l still want it.
not_available What's the new deal? 
not_available You give us the file, we let you go.
not_available Go where, Rikers Island? Dana, you're a small fish in all of this.
not_available l'm going after the people who gave the orders.
not_available You give me the evidence, we'll let you go.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available Your word? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available l don't believe you, Jack.
not_available Fine.
not_available You think this is a joke? We'll do it another way.
not_available Get out.
not_available Get out! Jack! Jack! Cole! Oh! Tell me where that file is now! That file is the only thing keeping me alive! No.
not_available Right now l'm the only thing keeping you alive.
not_available l'm gonna count backwards from three, and then I'm gonna kill you.
not_available Three! You're really not gonna let him shoot me in cold blood, Cole? Two! Jack! Back off! One! In a safety deposit box! Where? First Unity Savings.
not_available Cole knows.
not_available We have a joint account there.
not_available But the box is in my name.
not_available l'm the only one who can access it.
not_available Where's the bank? 
not_available Lexington, off East 59th.
not_available l had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack.
not_available l didn't even know she was a target.
not_available Put her in the car.
not_available I was in a C.T.U.
not_available holding cell.
not_available Damn it! Put her back in the car! You understand what he's doing, don't you? He's using you.
not_available Using me? You used me.
not_available What do you think he's gonna do once I give him that file? He's gonna give the evidence to the press and expose everyone responsible.
not_available ls that what you think? 'Cause l doubt that's what Jack thinks.
not_available He's gonna assemble the evidence, make a list of the guilty, and then he's gonna execute them one by one, starting with me.
not_available Î¤his isn't about the truth, Cole.
not_available It's about revenge.
not_available Cole! Look, l can't do this! She's just trying to get inside your head.
not_available l know that, damn it! You got something you wanna say to me, you better say it now.
not_available Were you gonna pull that trigger? l needed her to think I would.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hassan, please allow me to offer my condolences for your loss.
not_available Your husband was a great man.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How has news of his death been received back in the Islamic Republic? And do people there generally support your decision to take his place as head of state? I'm confident that most of my country is behind me.
not_available Î¤hose who aren't probably never supported my husband's policies in the first place.
not_available And what are your plans after the treaty is signed? 
not_available Right now, l'm concentrating all my efforts on the pursuit of finishing what my husband started with this agreement.
not_available But I want to return to Kamistan.
not_available ls this true? l'm afraid so, ma'am.
not_available Î¤he details are sketchy, but as of 1 5 minutes ago, Jack Bauer stormed the safe house, overwhelmed security and took Dana Walsh.
not_available Do we have any idea where they are? A hard target search is under way.
not_available Your note also mentioned Charles Logan.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available He's been calling and demanding to speak with you.
not_available He insisted that I interrupt the press conference.
not_available All you'll have to do is hit "redial." Thank you, Tim.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available the body be ritually washed and draped
not_available Hello.
not_available How in God's name could this have happened? Madam President, the important thing is not to panic.
not_available You assured me that Dana Walsh would be more secure in the hands of your private contractors.
not_available We didn't move her out of C.Î¤.U.
not_available solely for security reasons, as I'm sure you'll remember.
not_available Do you have me on speaker, Charles? Pick up the damn phone.
not_available Forgive me.
not_available I wasn't thinking.
not_available Apparently, neither was l.
not_available lt's a little late for buyer's remorse, Madam President, especially because I was calling with a solution to our current problem.
not_available Bauer may have Walsh, but he can't have the evidence yet.
not_available We've still got a chance to stop him.
not_available How? By putting somebody inside C.T.U., someone whose loyalties aren't split, who won't hesitate to see the mission through no matter what the cost.
not_available l've already replaced one director.
not_available I can't replace another.
not_available No, not a new director, just someone to supervise the manhunt for Bauer.
not_available l'm recommending Jason Pillar.
not_available Your aide? He's Bureau
not_available trained, Madam President.
not_available Îe was second in command at D.l.A.
not_available during the Daniels administration, and he made a name for himself in Afghanistan chasing high
not_available value targets behind enemy lines.
not_available Of course if you have a better idea, l'll gladly take a step back.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Just a second.
not_available What is it, Susan? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hassan is finishing up.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Look, l'll tell Tim Woods that I support you making an operational change.
not_available But that's it, Charles.
not_available No more excuses.
not_available Thank you, Madam President, and allow me to say that
not_available No, I understand completely.
not_available And l appreciate your confidence in Jason.
not_available Îow soon can you leave for C.T.U.? lmmediately.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll handle the arrangements on this end.
not_available Speaking of her late husband, Omar Hassan, in an address to the press and members of an international delegation at the United Nations
not_available Congratulations, Charles.
not_available You have recast yourself as the great peacemaker.
not_available l appreciate your help in getting me this far, Mikhail.
not_available So tell me what l'm doing here.
not_available for which the signing ceremony will commence
not_available l had hoped to have this conversation in private.
not_available This is my attaché, Pavel Tokarev.
not_available You can speak freely.
not_available Îe is more than well acquainted with the situation.
not_available Well
not_available There's been an unforeseen problem.
not_available Apparently, l'm not the only one who can prove that elements in your government conspired to undermine the peace process.
not_available Meaning? Dana Walsh, the mole you installed inside C.T.U., claims to have evidence to that effect.
not_available Not possible.
not_available She was handled with complete deniability.
not_available So you say.
not_available But no one in this room can take the chance that she's bluffing.
not_available Now, I tried to contain this.
not_available l had Ms.
not_available Walsh detained and interrogated.
not_available The problem is Jack Bauer just broke her out.
not_available Apparently, he has a personal interest in exposing this evidence.
not_available Then you need to stop him.
not_available Surely President Î¤aylor is motivated to do the same.
not_available She is, to a point.
not_available But l know Bauer.
not_available And l can promise you he will never let this go.
not_available And l don't think the president is willing to do what is ultimately required.
not_available So you expect me to kill Bauer for you? We both know you have the covert assets here to do the job.
not_available Maybe I do.
not_available But l don't have the resources to find him, track him.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available does.
not_available And the man in charge of the search now reports to me.
not_available Îow would this work? Î¤his is a closed
not_available channel phone.
not_available lt's impossible to intercept.
not_available My man at C.T.U.
not_available will use this to feed your people real
not_available time information as to Bauer's whereabouts, and they can put an end to this problem once and for all.
not_available We have to assume that C.Î¤.U.'s been getting my face out there.
not_available You're gonna have to take her into the bank on your own.
not_available I'll stand sentry in the lobby.
not_available Îow well do you know the layout inside? Vaults are in the back.
not_available Tellers are on one side of the room.
not_available Loan officers on the other.
not_available One of them's an old buddy of mine from high school.
not_available Îe was helping us line up a mortgage.
not_available Okay.
not_available Keep her inside your strike zone.
not_available lf she sees an opportunity, she's gonna take it.
not_available You trust her for nothing.
not_available l'll be fine, Jack.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available l know you hate me right now, but l don't really believe you wanna see me executed.
not_available Save it.
not_available We both saw how close he came to pulling the trigger back there.
not_available lt's just what he wanted you to think.
not_available He's lying.
not_available Just like he's lying about what he's gonna do with that file.
not_available Jack wants to bring the people responsible for this to justice.
not_available Just like me.
not_available Who do you think these people are, Cole? They're Russian diplomats with full diplomatic immunity.
not_available They'll be indicted by the World Court and hauled up in front of The Hague.
not_available You really believe Jack Bauer wants to trust some toothless international tribunal to mete out the justice to the people who killed Renee? Come on.
not_available You're hurting me.
not_available You'll live.
not_available Confirm all traffic camera feeds are being ported through us.
not_available Upres and route everything through facial recognition, parameter
not_available matching on Jack, Cole or Dana.
not_available We don't have anywhere near the bandwidth to do that citywide.
not_available Î¤hen job the overflow to N.S.A.
not_available Where are we on setting up the search grid with N.Y.P.D.? ln process.
not_available Î¤hey're giving us all the personnel they can spare, but they're going on record that unless we narrow down the search area, it's "needle in a haystack" time.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Î¤here's a Jason Pillar on his way to see you.
not_available Pillar? Yeah.
not_available Tim Wood's office pre
not_available cleared him.
not_available Send him up.
not_available He's already on his way.
not_available He wouldn't wait.
not_available Never heard of this guy.
not_available Who is he? Îe was second in command at D.l.A.
not_available under Daniels's administration.
not_available Îe's been working in the private sector for years.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian, Jason Pillar.
not_available Î¤his is my associate, Eden Linley.
not_available Okay.
not_available So why are you here? Frankly, the White House is unhappy with the way the manhunt for Jack Bauer's been handled.
not_available President Î¤aylor's issued an executive order placing me in charge of the search from here on.
not_available What? You'll retain your position as acting director for the time being with authority over all other C.T.U.
not_available operations.
not_available Arlo, give us a minute? You got it.
not_available This doesn't make any sense.
not_available Excuse me? Why are you here? You have nothing to do with Homeland Security anymore.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian, all you need to know is that l'm here under the president's orders.
not_available Well, you're wasting your time.
not_available We've done everything possible to find Jack.
not_available lf that were true, then the trap you set for Bauer would have worked.
not_available lt's not that simple.
not_available You were more concerned with making sure he didn't get hurt.
not_available lt's all in the hourlies.
not_available Î¤he last operational command you sent to Agent Ortiz was, "Remember.
not_available Nonlethal force." Not exactly the appropriate sentiment when the president told you how important it was that Bauer be stopped.
not_available Î¤he president doesn't want Jack hurt.
not_available She knows what he's done for this country, and so do you.
not_available What Bauer's doing will destroy the peace agreement, and the president cannot let that happen.
not_available lt's time to take off the kid gloves.
not_available We need all protocols and encryption keys transferred to us immediately, as well as system overrides and administrative privileges.
not_available Understood? Ms.
not_available O'Brian? Yeah.
not_available Understood.
not_available Recode the all
not_available agency bulletin on Bauer to "armed and dangerous" level eight.
not_available And change the useof
not_available force guidelines to "unrestricted." Here you go.
not_available Just make yourselves comfortable.
not_available l'll be right back with your safety deposit box.
not_available Î¤hanks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Something funny? This.
not_available You and me.
not_available lt's not the way that it was supposed to turn out.
not_available l'm serious, Cole.
not_available Now that this is all over, you deserve to hear the truth.
not_available lt's a little late for the truth, if you're even capable of it.
not_available You don't have to believe me.
not_available I was a kid, a kid with five years of prison behind me and no future to speak of.
not_available A guy came to see me, a Russian.
not_available Said that he could give me a fresh start.
not_available l had absolutely no idea what l was getting myself into.
not_available You could have come clean anytime you wanted.
not_available And go back to jail.
not_available Not a chance.
not_available Look, I know that it's not an excuse.
not_available But ever since I met you, I have been trying to dig myself out of this mess that I'm in.
not_available You're right.
not_available l don't believe you.
not_available lt's why l made that video file, Cole.
not_available l was going to use it as leverage to get the Russians to leave us alone.
not_available Us? Yes.
not_available There is no "us," Dana.
not_available There never was.
not_available lt was a lie from the beginning.
not_available That is not true.
not_available Would you stop playing me? It's not gonna work.
not_available I am not playing you.
not_available l loved you.
not_available Îere we go.
not_available 14
not_available 05.
not_available l'll be outside.
not_available Thank you, Brian.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available No.
not_available You never give up, do you? 
not_available What? 
not_available You guys all right? 
not_available 91 
not_available Îi.
not_available l'm at First Unity Savings Bank on Lexington.
not_available Î¤here's a guy by the front door.
not_available I think I saw him on the news.
not_available l think he has a gun.
not_available Oh, my God! He's looking in my direction.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Great.
not_available As quickly as you can.
not_available The 91 1 comm center just confirmed the call.
not_available Bauer was supposedly I.D.'d by someone at the First Unity Savings branch on Lexington.
not_available Supposedly? What do you mean "supposedly"? It means all we have is the caller's word that she recognized Jack from the news coverage.
not_available We don't have secondary confirmation.
not_available Then get it for me.
not_available Request access to the bank's video surveillance system.
not_available l've already contacted them.
not_available I'm just trying to connect.
not_available Îaving trouble getting the C.T.U.
not_available comm protocols to work.
not_available You, what's your name? Devon Rosenthal.
not_available Îelp her.
not_available Don't look at O'Brian.
not_available I'm giving you the order.
not_available Just follow it.
not_available Let's see what's going on.
not_available This is the problem.
not_available We got to get out of this.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Got it? Here we go.
not_available Full access to the bank's video surveillance system.
not_available Perfect.
