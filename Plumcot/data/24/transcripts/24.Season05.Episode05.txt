
not_available Previously on 24: We have waited patiently for you to renounce this unholy pact with our oppressors, but we have heard nothing.
not_available This it the cost of that silence.
not_available If you choose to sign this corrupt document, understand that you will also be staining it with the blood of the remaining hostages.
not_available If CTU can't pull this off in time that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan, if someone altered the recording of your conversation with David Palmer, the president needs to know.
not_available Between the summit and the hostage situation, he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.
not_available Until the treaty's signed, I'm not letting this out of my sight.
not_available What did she tell you? She said it was a transcript of the call she had with David Palmer.
not_available I understand President Logan wants us to go into the terminal as soon as possible.
not_available Yes, before the treaty is signed.
not_available Curtis, what's your situation? My men are in place, and we're setting the entry charges.
not_available We should be able to make our entry on target.
not_available I assume Mr.
not_available Bauer's been taken into custody? Well, I plan to debrief him here.
not_available Bring him in now.
not_available Diane, what's going on? What's wrong? Derek is inside the terminal.
not_available I see him.
not_available He's with the other hostages but he's not hurt.
not_available Please don't let anything happen to him.
not_available This is not your fault.
not_available I'm the reason you went along with them.
not_available This is not over.
not_available Fire! We got a problem.
not_available One of the hostages is missing.
not_available He was working with the terrorists.
not_available Give me a description; I'll take care of it.
not_available I'll help you now
not_available let's go.
not_available Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody.
not_available I watched Beresch give this guy a key card.
not_available Something else is going down here.
not_available We've got to find this guy now.
not_available Sorry we have to bring you in like this, Jack.
not_available It's all right, Mara.
not_available I understand.
not_available A year and a half.
not_available How did you manage to stay invisible for so long? Apparently I wasn't as invisible as I should have been.
not_available Tyler.
not_available Mara, it's Curtis.
not_available Put Bauer on.
not_available It's Agent Manning.
not_available Yeah? Jack, you say the suspect was hiding among the hostages? Yeah, right up until the assault began, somewhere around 10:30.
not_available Then he must have broken for an exit.
not_available What exit was closest? Without an alarm? Between gates six and seven.
not_available Thanks, Jack.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pull up external video starting at 10:30.
not_available All cameras covering gates six and seven.
not_available We're away.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan? Mrs.
not_available Logan? Oh, my God.
not_available Help! Someone! Something's happened to the First Lady.
not_available Get a doctor, now.
not_available According to Jack, he should be between gates six and seven, just outside this view.
not_available I got this feed from ten minutes ago.
not_available Try camera seven.
not_available Camera four.
not_available All right, there he is.
not_available Tighten up.
not_available Yellow Tie.
not_available Got him.
not_available Now let's follow him.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What camera covers the adjacent sector? Pull it up, anyway.
not_available Match the time codes.
not_available Okay, here he is.
not_available This is two minutes, What hangar is that? Hangar Double
not_available B.
not_available Has it been searched yet? 
not_available No.
not_available It was outside the secured perimeter.
not_available All right, I'm going to take a field team, head over there.
not_available Send this info to Comm.
not_available Team A with me.
not_available Let's go! Hangar Double
not_available B.
not_available Let's go.
not_available CTU.
not_available Stiles.
not_available Edgar, Jack told us about a suspect hiding among the hostages.
not_available We just picked up surveillance on him.
not_available He entered Hangar Double
not_available B at roughly 10:57.
not_available Did you check it out yet? No, we're going in now.
not_available I'll need comm.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Chloe, what volume is airport facilities on? Hennessy Four.
not_available Team Two, cover the rear.
not_available Check it out.
not_available Everyone else, search the building, see what you can find.
not_available Craig, it's Curtis.
not_available Send a forensics team down here now.
not_available Tell them they'll need a full bio
not_available pack with spectrum analyzers.
not_available Any problems getting the canisters out? No.
not_available They were hidden exactly where you said they'd be.
not_available Everything on schedule with our transport? Customs documents are being finalized at the port.
not_available Good.
not_available The Russians will finally understand the consequences of occupying our homeland when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.
not_available When did this happen? A few minutes ago.
not_available I came back in, and I found her on the bed.
not_available What do you mean "came back in"? You mean you left her alone.
not_available What happened, Doctor? Is she all right? She seems to be now, but I'd have to do some tests to find out why she blacked out.
not_available I didn't black out.
not_available Someone did this to me.
not_available Someone attacked me, Charles.
not_available Shh, shh.
not_available Martha 
not_available You have to do something.
not_available You have to do something.
not_available They're trying to get me.
not_available No, no one's trying to get you.
not_available We just want you to be well.
not_available Honey, listen.
not_available Listen, listen.
not_available I had the proof, and now it's gone.
not_available What proof? What are you talking about? The proof that David Palmer called me to warn me about today.
not_available Are we still on this? We've never been off of it.
not_available You just wouldn't listen to me.
not_available Sir.
not_available Is everything okay? I think so.
not_available No.
not_available No, damn it, it's not okay! You people have got to listen to me.
not_available I had a document, from the archive room.
not_available Where was this document? I am trying to tell you.
not_available It was hidden in my blouse.
not_available It's gone.
not_available Someone stole it from me.
not_available Martha, you've been under a lot of stress.
not_available We all have.
not_available Let let No, let Dr.
not_available Hill Let Dr.
not_available Hill examine you and we can figure out how to get you better.
not_available You don't believe me.
not_available You don't believe your own wife.
not_available I have an important phone call from the Secretary of State that I have to get to.
not_available If there's any sudden changes, you get back to me as soon as possible.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Charles, don't leave.
not_available Honey, I'll be right down the hall.
not_available No, no, no, honey, honey, don't leave me.
not_available You need to get some rest.
not_available Please Close that door.
not_available What do I do about this, Walt? This is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont.
not_available Are you suggesting that I readmit her? You have to consider the option.
not_available For her sake.
not_available She said she'd rather die than go back in there.
not_available Sir, if she's going to persist with these conspiracy theories, it's only a matter of time before she talks to someone who believes her.
not_available Then we really will have a problem.
not_available I wish you were wrong, but I don't think you are.
not_available Do you want me to handle this, sir? Make the arrangements.
not_available But don't let Martha find out.
not_available Let me be the one to tell her.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you handled the problem there? Yes.
not_available Martha Logan won't be giving us any more trouble.
not_available Good.
not_available Erwich has just completed transferring the gas to the semi.
not_available He's on his way to the port.
not_available And the authorities don't know anything's been stolen? Not yet.
not_available Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available On his way to CTU.
not_available Mm.
not_available He's getting too close.
not_available He's already started putting the pieces together.
not_available I know.
not_available He needs to be taken out.
not_available I'm handling it myself.
not_available How? Once he gets to CTU, your hitter won't be able to get near him.
not_available I've have someone on the inside who can help us.
not_available Then use him.
not_available Done.
not_available You sure those readings are right? They're right.
not_available That can only be military grade.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available Where are you going? I need you to finish the shell script.
not_available Not now.
not_available Since when do you say "not now"? According to this, the hangar was leased to some offshore company, but it's been vacant for at least 18 months.
not_available Sir? I just heard from Curtis.
not_available He was right.
not_available There was nerve gas in hangar Double B.
not_available That's what killed the rats.
not_available There were trace amounts found in the animals' blood.
not_available But the concentrations were definitely mil spec
not_available weaponized.
not_available So this man in the yellow tie, the suspect that Bauer's telling us about that's what he was doing at the airport? Stealing canisters of nerve gas out of the hangar? Stealing from whom? Military destroyed its stockpiles years ago.
not_available Well, maybe this nerve gas wasn't produced by the military.
not_available Edgar, have forensics get a signature off the trace samples.
not_available See if they can figure out who manufactured it.
not_available Chloe, elevate our alert status.
not_available Activate all available personnel and get Curtis back here.
not_available We're gonna need everyone we have.
not_available I wouldn't issue a statement about the First Lady for another couple days.
not_available Let your successes today run front and center on all the networks.
not_available That sounds right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hill, please, come in.
not_available How's Martha doing? 
not_available Well, she's asleep now.
not_available Have you figured out what caused the blackout? I spoke with her psychiatrist, Dr.
not_available Carlstrom, and none of the medication she's been prescribing would have caused this kind of collapse.
not_available So we still don't know what it was.
not_available Not yet, no.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I need to speak to you and Walt alone.
not_available Thank you, Doctor.
not_available Keep a close eye on her.
not_available We'll talk soon.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available What's up, Mike? I'm afraid the situation at the airport has taken an unexpected turn.
not_available What's the problem? The hostages were saved, we've captured or killed all the terrorists.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available One of the terrorists was posing as a hostage.
not_available He used the hostage crisis to cover a theft.
not_available A theft? What was stolen? A cache of chemical weapons.
not_available What kind of chemical weapons? Nerve gas.
not_available Is it ours? No, sir.
not_available CTU is still trying to source it.
not_available But it was buried in a bunker at the airport.
not_available It seems this man had another crew waiting for him there.
not_available Do we have any idea what the terrorists are planning? Well, they haven't made any demands or issued any threats, yet.
not_available Well, what are we doing to stop them? CTU is running an interagency search effort.
not_available They're coordinating ground operations, filtering intelligence.
not_available Has the press found out about this, yet? No, sir.
not_available It's being kept internal.
not_available Whatever retaliation we were bracing for an hour ago is nothing compared to what these people are capable of doing now.
not_available Sir, I'll assemble the Homeland Security team to discuss evacuation scenarios.
not_available I sent everyone updates on the airport forensics.
not_available What did you want me on next? Check the task list.
not_available You don't need to ask me every time you need something new to do.
not_available I don't care if you are my boss or if you regret sleeping with me last night.
not_available No one talks to me like that.
not_available Really? I just did.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now, what's your problem? 
not_available I don't have a problem.
not_available Then what do you want? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Edgar.
not_available Look, I'm sorry that my private life hasn't remained private today.
not_available I'm thinking the opposite.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available You're too private.
not_available We've known each other for years.
not_available And today I find out you're keeping secrets from me? Haven't you ever taken a psychology class? People keep secrets.
not_available I don't.
not_available Not from my friends.
not_available Why didn't you tell me Jack was alive? Oh, come on.
not_available It's called national security.
not_available Yeah, well, what about Spenser? I didn't even know you two were going out.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available Okay, when we find the nerve gas and the alert level drops, we can have some chamomile tea and I'll tell you all my secrets, okay? You paged me.
not_available Has Bauer arrived at CTU? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available When he does, I need you to do something.
not_available We have our hands full searching for the nerve gas.
not_available Bauer is a priority.
not_available I need you to clear an entrance into CTU.
not_available I'm sending it now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Miss Raines.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Yes? I take it you're up to speed on the nerve gas stolen from the airport.
not_available I was just filling in DOD.
not_available Diane Huxley and her son were brought in to be debriefed.
not_available I'd like you to interview her.
not_available Interview her about what? Any information she has that could help us find the nerve gas.
not_available What could she possibly know about that? I've reviewed the evidence against Jack Bauer, and I'm inclined to agree with your assessment that he was framed for the assassination of David Palmer.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I also think that whoever framed Jack is also involved with the theft of this nerve gas.
not_available Which means that Diane Huxley could have had contact with that person without realizing it.
not_available I'm not a trained interrogator.
not_available But you know Jack Bauer better than anyone else in here.
not_available You have something in common with this woman.
not_available It might help her open up.
not_available I realize it's awkward, but I need you to do it.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll see what I can get from her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where is she? She and her son just cleared security.
not_available Miss Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available This is my son, Derek.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm gonna be asking you a few questions.
not_available And Derek, I want you to be checked out by a doctor while I speak with your mother.
not_available There's nothing wrong with me.
not_available It's just procedure.
not_available When you're done, you and I will speak.
not_available Can you take him to medical, please? It's okay, I'll see you in a bit.
not_available Don't worry, he'll be fine.
not_available Is Jack gonna be here soon? 
not_available He's on his way in.
not_available Come with me.
not_available I had no idea he worked in a place like this.
not_available It's just up these stairs.
not_available Did you know him before? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I knew him.
not_available A lot of people here thought you were dead until today.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Hi, Jack.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available We wouldn't have made it out of that airport without your help.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, Lynn McGill from Division.
not_available Mara, I'll assume custody at this point, thank you.
not_available You're no longer a suspect in President Palmer's murder, but while you're here, you will need this.
not_available It'll give you level two clearance.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Was Agent Manning able to apprehend the suspect? No.
not_available It seems the person you identified used the hostage situation as a cover to steal a cache of weaponized nerve gas from the airport.
not_available Nerve gas? How do you know that? Following your lead, Curtis found trace amounts in a hangar adjacent to the terminal.
not_available We don't know how much there is and where it came from, but it is a military grade chemical weapon.
not_available Do you have any leads? Not yet, but we're gonna run the search operation from here.
not_available You're not gonna be able to track these terrorists fast enough with a standard search operation.
not_available The only way you're gonna get that nerve gas in time is if you find out who ordered the hit on David Palmer.
not_available I agree.
not_available I think Palmer was about to expose this plot.
not_available I think that's why he was killed.
not_available I also think that if you can help us identify who framed you, we can intercept this nerve gas while there's still time.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available Hey, Bill.
not_available President's been informed of the nerve gas.
not_available He wants to ensure the media doesn't find out.
not_available Well, make sure Division restricts information flow.
not_available We'll continue this conversation when I'm done.
not_available Good to see you again, Jack.
not_available It's good to see you, too, Bill.
not_available I'm so sorry about Michelle.
not_available I never meant to put her in jeopardy.
not_available Of course, you didn't.
not_available How's Tony doing? He's still unconscious, but the doctor says he's going to pull through.
not_available Good.
not_available We're gonna need to speak to him as soon as possible.
not_available They know to call us.
not_available Jack Audrey has been working for us.
not_available She's here in the building now? She's debriefing Diane Huxley.
not_available Why is she talking to Diane? Lynn asked her to.
not_available I'm not used to calling him Jack.
not_available He said his name was Frank Flynn.
not_available I thought he worked for the oil company.
not_available You probably know more about him than I do.
not_available We all thought he was dead for the last year and a half.
not_available So what do you want to know? You said that Jack was living with you for the last six months, is that correct? He was renting a room.
not_available So, you don't have a personal relationship with him? I'm not sure that's anyof your business.
not_available I'm sorry, I just I need to know how close you and Jack were, whether he confided in you or not.
not_available Jack's a private person.
not_available I always knew he was keeping something from me.
not_available I just never pushed it.
not_available I accepted him for who he was.
not_available Ms.
not_available Raines whoever he was before it doesn't change the way I feel about him.
not_available He was good to me, he was good to my son.
not_available He meant a lot to us.
not_available He still does.
not_available I see.
not_available Did anyone ever come by and ask about Jack? What do you mean? Someone knew that Jack was alive.
not_available It's critical to our investigation that we find out who that was.
not_available No.
not_available No one asked about him.
not_available No one ever came to see him.
not_available Can you excuse me for a minute, please? Yeah.
not_available Jack.
not_available I don't even know where to begin.
not_available You have to believe me.
not_available I couldn't tell you I was still alive.
not_available Jack, you don't need to apologize.
not_available I did it for your own protection.
not_available It's been hard for me, thinking you died, believing that I was angry at you that I hated you.
not_available I wasn't able to forgive myself for that.
not_available You had every reason to hate me.
not_available I was responsible for Paul's death.
not_available I lied to you.
not_available Jack.
not_available You made a hard decision.
not_available I never imagined I'd get another chance to tell you this.
not_available But I want I want you to know that I don't blame you for what happened with Paul.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack There's so much that I want to say to you, I know it's Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan needs to see you.
not_available I'll be right down.
not_available I should go.
not_available Evelyn, is Mrs.
not_available Logan still asleep? Yes, she's finally getting some rest.
not_available Good.
not_available You should probably start gathering some of her things.
not_available I thought the president was staying through the weekend.
not_available He is but she'll be leaving today.
not_available Where's she going? Just make sure she has the essentials to make her trip comfortable.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Edgar said he saw you come in here.
not_available What are you doing? Setting up a new socket.
not_available We're overloaded from the NSA database.
not_available Why are you here? 
not_available Looking for you.
not_available What for? I need to get into your utilities volume.
not_available Why didn't you message me? Okay, I wanted to say something, too.
not_available Let's not make a big drama out of it.
not_available What? I was unfairly harsh to you a few minutes ago.
not_available I didn't mean anything.
not_available All right.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available It wasn't really an apology, it was more of an observation.
not_available I mean, the fact Spenser.
not_available Damn it, why do I do that? 
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available It's Chloe.
not_available What is it? I need to know Spenser's clearance level? Why are you asking? Spenser works for me, and I need to know his clearance level, so could you please open the header file and give it to me, Edgar? Fine.
not_available Level three.
not_available Chloe? Call Buchanan, tell him I need to talk to him now.
not_available It's important.
not_available Division sent me.
not_available One of your mainframe servers is cycling slow.
not_available You're not on the manifest.
not_available I was told it'd be taken care of.
not_available I'm going to have to clear this with the systems administrator.
not_available Are you Hank, from onsite support? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My fault.
not_available I was supposed to advance him an emergency clearance.
not_available All right.
not_available Place the bag on the conveyor belt, and walk right through, sir.
not_available All clear.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll show you the way.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cummings told me it would be best to keep you off the manifest.
not_available Classified material generally runs on servers nine and twelve.
not_available All the information you need on Bauer should be there.
not_available I don't know what files Mr.
not_available Cummings asked you to download, but you need to keep vector counts the same, or it'll get flagged.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need to get back to my station.
not_available Evelyn, what are you doing? Mrs.
not_available Logan, are you feeling better? Why are you packing my things? Walt Cummings asked me to.
not_available Why? Where are we going? I don't know if the president's going with you.
not_available Evelyn, stop.
not_available What's going on? They just asked me to get you ready to leave.
not_available They're sending me to Vermont, aren't they? Charles is having me committed.
not_available I'm sorry, Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available I honestly don't know anything else.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I'll get dressed.
not_available Edgar, my FGA is locked.
not_available Where's Chloe? How should I know? Can you unlock this? 
not_available No.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wolff? Please come with us.
not_available What do you want? Mr.
not_available Buchanan has ordered us to take you to him immediately.
not_available I'm in the middle of a critical task here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Stiles has been authorized to take over your work load.
not_available Did you know about this, Edgar? Yeah.
not_available I just got the bulletin.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wolff.
not_available Please.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available Chloe? Sir.
not_available What is going on here? Sit down, Spenser.
not_available You've been burrowing into classified CTU protocols without authorization.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Stop
not_available I know you were logged onto the security subsystem, where you had no right to be.
not_available We're going through your system so you might as well tell us now what you were doing.
not_available I told you I was opening 
not_available That's enough! You've accessed files outside your clearance level at least 18 times in the four months you've been here.
not_available Sir, whatever you think you've found, it's a mistake.
not_available I've done nothing wrong.
not_available Come on, Spenser, you obviously have your own agenda here.
not_available I don't have an "agenda." And while you're at it, why don't you explain why it was necessary to crawl into my bed.
not_available Which certainly wasn't what it appeared to be, just like your work here isn't what it appears to be! Chloe, Chloe.
not_available Chloe, let me handle this, please.
not_available Sir, obviously you can't take anything she says into consideration.
not_available I was careless.
not_available And, inadvertently, I caused her some emotional pain.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available And now she's trying to get back at me.
not_available I don't think so, Spenser.
not_available Sir, I'd like to talk to a lawyer.
not_available Forget about a lawyer! We're in the middle of a terrorist crisis There are lives on the line.
not_available You're going to tell us what you've been doing here, and you're going to tell us now.
not_available I hope this goes better than when I sent her up there the last time.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hill and his staff are on standby if she overreacts.
not_available I'm not looking forward to this.
not_available Evelyn? 
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Where is she? She's in the bathroom, sir.
not_available Martha? Marty? Are you sure she's in there? Yes, sir.
not_available She's getting dressed.
not_available Marty? Aaron? My wife is gone.
not_available This is Pierce.
not_available We have a priority alert.
not_available The First Lady has left her quarters and is unaccounted for.
not_available All agents in the main wing, move to points north and west.
not_available Anyone spotting her, check in immediately.
not_available So the only people who knew you were alive were David Palmer, Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler and Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Yeah, and at least one other person who killed David Palmer and tried to frame me for it.
not_available And you don't know who that other person might be? 
not_available No.
not_available Any theories? About a year and a half ago, David Palmer called me.
not_available Told me there's someone in Logan's administration was targeting me.
not_available Which is why you faked your own death and assumed a new identity? Yeah, except it didn't work.
not_available I believe that whoever tried to kill me 18 months ago somehow found out I was still alive, and waited until today to exploit that information.
not_available Someone inside President Logan's administration? That's what David Palmer told me a year and a half ago, and I believe him.
not_available Well, first of all, that would mean someone in this administration is also tied to the theft of the nerve gas.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're going to have to look into that.
not_available Even if you're right, there are hundreds of people in Logan's administration.
not_available It would take an investigation of that magnitude months to gain any traction
not_available and we don't have months to work with.
not_available Mr.
not_available McGill? I'm sorry to interrupt, but Dr.
