
not_available Jack, look out! Paul? Get me a medic.
not_available He's losing pressure.
not_available I need ten cc's of adrenaline.
not_available He was hit before I could do anything.
not_available How bad is it? We don't know.
not_available We just don't know.
not_available Please tell me he's not gonna die.
not_available Why should I help you? I'm offering you freedom.
not_available You and Behrooz will go into a witness protection programme.
not_available You'll be given new names, identities, everything.
not_available What do you need me to do? I need you to go to Fayed, and tell him that you need to speak to Marwan.
not_available He won't let me through his front door, let alone get near Marwan.
not_available He will when you tell him that you've got a hostage that can help him.
not_available Who? Me.
not_available What if Fayed doesn't believe us? 
not_available Then we're both dead.
not_available Close the door.
not_available Put your gun over there.
not_available Do it.
not_available What is it? A woman named Dina Araz came to me.
not_available What does she want? 
not_available She has a hostage.
not_available A CTU agent named Jack Bauer.
not_available You've caused me a lot of trouble.
not_available Kill him.
not_available Just what I thought.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Meet them at the hotel.
not_available I'll need his flight package, including clearance and identification codes.
not_available You'll have whatever you need.
not_available Get your things.
not_available We've got a plane to catch.
not_available Let me talk to my family.
not_available Your family is dead.
not_available And so are you.
not_available Edgar, have you found any way to locate Jack? We're trying.
not_available Marwan covered his tracks.
not_available Michelle.
not_available What do we have, Chloe? 
not_available The PD found the van Jack and Dina were in.
not_available Where? Abandoned at an industrial warehouse at the far end of San Fernando Road.
not_available Dina's body was in it.
not_available OK.
not_available Tell local police to look for witnesses.
not_available We need a licence plate, something to follow.
not_available Edgar.
not_available Pull up satellite from 8:45 to 9:00.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available All right, everyone, listen up.
not_available Jack Bauer is missing.
not_available There's a good chance he's being held by our primary target, Marwan.
not_available We believe Marwan is preparing for another domestic attack today.
not_available We need to pool all our resources to find him.
not_available All comm teams, coordinate with Edgar.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes.
not_available There's a problem.
not_available What? Got onto the base and through security using the pilot's ID.
not_available As I was about to do a pre
not_available flight check, they grounded the plane.
not_available Why? Checking a trouble sensor.
not_available They might have to swap out a defective part.
not_available How long will it take? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available Resolve this now.
not_available It's time to earn your money, Mr.
not_available Anderson.
not_available The window of opportunity on the target closes in an hour.
not_available I understand.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You working on the Phoenix? 
not_available Yes, Captain.
not_available Sent me down from Hawkins.
not_available You taking her up? 
not_available What's the ETA on getting me into the air? The sensor's correct.
not_available There was a hairline fracture on a strut pin.
not_available But, uh, a replacement won't be until morning.
not_available Is that the only problem? A strut pin? Yes, but it would be one hell of a problem when you try to land.
not_available Rear assembly would disintegrate on impact.
not_available Only way out would be to parachute out.
not_available Did you report to the chief officer? 
not_available I'm about to head over there now, Captain.
not_available Then I'm gonna head up to Ventura for a little R and R.
not_available Sounds great.
not_available Don't let me hold you up.
not_available All right, thanks, sir.
not_available Thanks.
not_available ME says Dina's been dead less than 30 minutes.
not_available We can only assume that that's when Marwan grabbed Jack.
not_available What's the search range on Marwan? 
not_available 1500 square miles and increasing.
not_available Chatter? I filtered through everything from Langley, NSA and Interpol.
not_available None of it's correlating.
not_available Volume? It's actually slowing down, which may mean we've incurred all the damage we will today.
not_available Or it could be the calm before the storm.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The one thing we know for sure is if Jack's alive, he'll find a way to contact us.
not_available We just have to wait until we pick up the thread on Marwan.
not_available Tony.
not_available Yep? So I heard Jack called you earlier today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And that you saved his life.
not_available Well, we both know I owed him one, right? Audrey's been waiting for her husband to get out of surgery.
not_available I think we should tell her about Jack.
not_available Why? 
not_available They're involved.
not_available She's married.
not_available Separated.
not_available Then I'd prefer not to tell her anything.
not_available Why? We may have to make a very tough call on Jack's capture.
not_available She's a professional.
not_available She knows it's a possibility.
not_available It'd be wrong to keep it from her.
not_available I don't want her interfering.
not_available I think she has a right to know.
not_available But, hey, you're the boss.
not_available It's your call.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available How's Paul doing? He's still in surgery.
not_available I won't know until he gets out.
not_available Have you heard anything from Jack? Jack is missing.
not_available Missing? We think he was taken by Habib Marwan.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What are we doing to get him back? 
not_available Everything we can.
not_available I thought we were tracking him.
not_available He's supposed to be protected.
not_available No one is fully protected in the field.
not_available Who was in charge of this operation? I was.
not_available Get him back, Michelle.
not_available I have a few questions.
not_available If you answer them, there's a chance you might survive today.
not_available Don't waste your time.
not_available You located me through a man named Fayed who, you might be interested to know, has since martyred himself.
not_available It would help me if I knew he was the only link you had to me.
not_available Whatever you've planned next is going to fail, just like everything else you've tried today.
not_available Fail? Almost 40 dead in the train crash, many more near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.
not_available That wasn't really your plan.
not_available We managed to stop the other 103 power plants from melting down.
not_available That's what America will remember, that we stopped you.
not_available No, they'll remember the image of Secretary of Defense Heller held hostage on your own soil, and it will burn in their psyches.
not_available This country will be afraid to let their leaders appear in public.
not_available For all the hatred that you have for this country, you don't understand it very well.
not_available Whatever you throw at us, I promise you, that'll never happen.
not_available Marwan, we have a problem.
not_available What is it? 
not_available The family of the pilot that we killed.
not_available What? We disposed of the bodies.
not_available Yes.
not_available A relative showed up at the house and became suspicious when no one was home.
not_available He called the police who are looking into it.
not_available Has it gotten to CTU? No, but he was a military pilot.
not_available It will be flagged by other agencies and will get to CTU within the hour.
not_available What do you think we should do? We have to make sure CTU is too busy to realize its significance.
not_available Distract them.
not_available How? Tell me about the boy.
not_available What boy? 
not_available Behrooz Araz.
not_available What do you care about him for? 
not_available Does CTU have him in custody? Yes, he's safe.
not_available You answered the question, but are you telling me the truth? Call CTU, ask them yourself.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available What's the password for the central server? 
not_available I'll get you on.
not_available Don't get me on, just give me the password.
not_available It's not your area any more.
not_available What? You work for me.
not_available No, I worked for you.
not_available Worked, with an "ed" at the end.
not_available Past tense.
not_available I've been reinstated.
not_available Quit being territorial and give me the password.
not_available No.
not_available Curtis, could you please explain to Edgar that I've been rehired as head of comm? Things have changed, Chloe.
not_available Edgar took over for you.
not_available You'll be working for him now.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Michelle called me in because things were falling apart here under Edgar.
not_available Now, give me my command or I walk.
not_available You have equal authority.
not_available On paper it has to look like you work for him.
not_available I won't do it as a matter of principle.
not_available You'll be bumped up to a term
not_available four analyst.
not_available That's a 35 per cent increase in salary, plus bonus.
not_available I should get that anyway.
not_available That's not my point.
not_available Edgar works for me.
not_available Not today, Chloe.
not_available Fine.
not_available What's the password to the central server? CIS15
not_available A Thanks.
not_available A man who says he's Habib Marwan is on line one.
not_available He wants to speak to the director of CTU.
not_available Put it through a high
not_available risk filter, activate all tracers and recorders.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Someone claiming to be Habib Marwan is on line.
not_available Are you prepped for the call? 
not_available Yeah, take it there.
not_available Put him through.
not_available This is Dessler, Director of CTU.
not_available To whom am I speaking? This is Habib Marwan.
not_available Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody.
not_available I'll need to speak to him.
not_available I will return him to you unharmed in exchange for Behrooz Araz.
not_available You have ten minutes to secure clearances with your people.
not_available I'd need more time to agree to that.
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available I will call you then with exact details on how the exchange is to proceed.
not_available Did you get a trace? OK, confirm Marwan's identity off voice.
not_available And we may need to move Behrooz Araz.
not_available Why is Behrooz Araz worth trading for Jack? I don't know.
not_available Have all tactical teams meet me in the situation room.
not_available Have the police sent the report about the pilot's missing family to CTU yet? I don't think so, but our contact at LAPD says the report has been flagged.
not_available It will go out to all the agencies within 15 minutes.
not_available If CTU gets a hold of it a minute too soon, they can stop us.
not_available Tell me the second that report gets released.
not_available Yes, Marwan.
not_available Marwan wants to exchange Jack Bauer for Behrooz Araz.
not_available The obvious question is why? 
not_available The way I see it, there are two possibilities.
not_available One, there's a personal connection.
not_available Two, Behrooz has information that can damage Marwan.
not_available I agree.
not_available Edgar, have your team sift through everything we have on Behrooz Araz.
not_available Go back as far as you can.
not_available See if there's a family link between them.
not_available Did the interrogation reveal that he knew anything that might make him valuable to Marwan? No, but the focus was on the mother.
not_available We really didn't push him very hard.
not_available Curtis, push harder.
not_available See what you can find, but do it now.
not_available My guess is Marwan will want to make this exchange within the hour.
not_available Tony, monitor him from the observation room.
not_available Chloe, what do we have on audio? 
not_available The voice print matched.
not_available It was Marwan.
not_available So, how are you gonna handle this? He thinks his mother made a deal to protect him.
not_available I'll tell him that deals off.
not_available The psychological approach is too slow.
not_available What do you suggest? He'll drag his feet unless we put some physical pressure on him.
not_available He's a kid.
not_available I'm pretty sure he's given us everything he knows.
not_available You're pretty sure? 
not_available I'll call Richards.
not_available Tony.
not_available Go ahead, I'll catch up.
not_available Have you heard anything on Jack? We got some information a couple minutes ago.
not_available Why didn't you let me know? 
not_available Things are going pretty fast here.
not_available Look, Jack's alive.
not_available He is being held by Marwan.
not_available How did you confirm that? 
not_available Marwan contacted us.
not_available He contacted you? Why would he do that? 
not_available He wants to make a trade.
not_available Jack for Behrooz.
not_available When is that gonna happen? 
not_available We don't know if it is gonna happen.
not_available What do you mean? If he wants to trade, it means Behrooz has tactical value.
not_available If that's the case, then we may have to hold on to him.
not_available There's a lot we have to go over before anything happens.
not_available I'll keep you posted, but right now I have to get in that room with Behrooz, all right? Thank you.
not_available All right, keep it at that level.
not_available Let me know if the readings fluctuate.
not_available He doesn't know his mother's dead.
not_available I know.
not_available Hello, Behrooz.
not_available How much longer do I have to stay here? 
not_available These things take time.
not_available Where is my mother? 
not_available She's still in the field.
not_available With Jack Bauer? Is she OK? Yeah, she's fine.
not_available Tell me about Habib Marwan.
not_available Why are you doing this? Your mother gave us a little information.
not_available She said you could give us some more.
not_available You promised not to hurt me! Get this guy away from me! Back over here.
not_available We're just gonna have a little talk.
not_available Marwan's the leader.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available I heard my parents talk about him, that's it.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available What are you gonna do? What is he gonna do to me? 
not_available We don't have a lot of time.
not_available No! No! No! Please don't do this! Please, no! This is Marwan.
not_available Get me Michelle Dessler.
not_available Ms Dessler, it's Marwan.
not_available Everyone on this! 
not_available This is Dessler.
not_available Union Conduit Dam, 30 minutes.
not_available I need to know Jack Bauer is still alive.
not_available Very well.
not_available Michelle Dessler wants to make sure you're alive.
not_available I'm being held in a warehouse somewhere downtown.
not_available Satisfied? 
not_available I can't make this happen in 30 minutes.
not_available You'll find a way.
not_available Wait, I Dammit.
not_available CTU will never go through with the exchange.
not_available I'm expendable.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available If Behrooz is of value to you, he's of value to them.
not_available They'll never let you have him back.
not_available Marwan.
not_available In the next few minutes CTU will be alerted that the pilot and his family are missing.
not_available All right.
not_available The LAPD hourlies are here.
not_available What do you do with them? I promote any flagged items to the analysts.
not_available I can't do that now.
not_available I have to get ready.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm tracking Behrooz.
not_available I'd get on those hourlies if I were you.
not_available I'll tell Meg to sift through it and deal with any flagged items after the exchange.
not_available OK, boss.
not_available This is Meg.
not_available Hourlies just came in.
not_available Chloe and I need you to sift through them.
not_available Do you know how backed up we are here? 
not_available It's worse up here.
not_available Just do it, OK? Fine.
not_available Send it to four.
not_available Phoenix is ready to go.
not_available I thought we were waiting on a part.
not_available It's a good thing they called me in.
not_available That strut's fine.
not_available It was just a faulty trouble sensor.
not_available You're sure? I triple
not_available checked it.
not_available It's just a false alarm.
not_available Here's my report.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll clear it for takeoff.
not_available Flight Ops.
not_available This is Hoader.
not_available Yeah, Phoenix is clear for takeoff.
not_available All right.
not_available Were you able to narrow it down? 
not_available So far, nothing.
not_available We need to get this out to all departments.
not_available Chloe, what's wrong? Nothing.
not_available There's no bad news about Jack, if that's what you're asking.
not_available Since Jack isn't here, you're the DOD representative.
not_available These are some standard nondisclosures.
not_available Read them whenever you get a chance.
not_available I've flagged where you need to sign.
not_available I'll do that now.
not_available I'm really sorry about your husband.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I can't imagine how I'd feel right now if I were you.
not_available I feel like someone afraid of losing her husband.
not_available No, I meant, you know, you and your husband are separated, and you fall in love with Jack, then your husband takes a bullet that saves Jack's life.
not_available What do you do with that? I can't think about that now.
not_available I just need Paul to pull through this.
not_available You just assume that the terrorists won't kill Jack? Chloe.
not_available I don't wanna talk about it.
not_available Here.
not_available I was inappropriately blunt, wasn't I? I do that a lot.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry, I'm gonna go.
not_available I have a field meeting anyway.
not_available When your father spoke to Marwan, was that on the phone or did he come to your house? Both.
not_available Did you ever speak to Marwan alone, away from your parents? No.
not_available When they made the preparations for today's attacks, were you in the room? I told you, they didn't want me in there.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, the briefing's about to start.
not_available All right, I'll be right there.
not_available If he produces something relevant, let me know.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available O'Brien.
not_available Is anything you're doing yielding a military connection? No, why? 
not_available It may be nothing, but there's an incident report that might be worth looking at.
not_available What is it? An Air Force pilot's wife and kids were reported missing as of two hours ago.
not_available How can someone be missing in two hours? I'm just telling you what it says.
not_available Should I run it? 
not_available No, we have to do it up here.
not_available Then why did you send it down here? 
not_available It was Edgar's decision.
not_available Should I give it to you? I'm the main tactical in the trade for Jack.
not_available Give it to Edgar.
not_available He said he's too busy.
not_available Just run it through county and get it to him.
not_available OK.
not_available Edgar.
not_available What? Meg found something in the hourlies I need you to look at.
not_available I'm preparing.
not_available Can't Meg do it? It's the job of the lead tactical.
not_available Isn't that what you think you are? 
not_available I don't need your sarcasm.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Fantastic.
not_available Hey.
not_available Is this briefing about Jack? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Marwan called us again.
not_available Has a decision been made? 
not_available It'll be decided in this meeting.
not_available By whom? Division.
not_available Look, they sent someone down to run point.
not_available Is Division thinking about not doing it? Honestly, it could go either way.
not_available But Jack would want us to do what's best for this country, not what's best for him.
not_available I know.
not_available I'II let you know as soon as I can.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks, Tony.
not_available Did you get anything out of Behrooz? I don't think he knows anything, but, uh, Curtis is still trying.
not_available OK.
not_available Bill.
not_available Are you up to speed? 
not_available I got briefed on the way.
not_available All right, everyone, listen up.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan from Division.
not_available He'll be overseeing the operation.
not_available Run everything through him.
not_available Bill? Habib Marwan wants to make an exchange at the Union Conduit Dam, Behrooz Araz for Jack Bauer.
not_available Now, before we decide whether or not to go forward, I need to know a few things.
not_available Why does Marwan want the boy? What's his value? We could not find evidence that Behrooz had any information.
not_available Did you push him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't think he knows anything.
not_available Who's doing backgrounds? 
not_available Me.
not_available Nothing ties these two people together.
not_available Could Behrooz have had something implanted in his body? He was scanned when he was brought in.
not_available Did you do an MRI? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't like giving him up unless I know his value.
not_available What happens if we don't agree to the exchange? 
not_available We don't get Bauer back.
not_available That can't be the deciding factor.
not_available If we don't go through with this, we may lose an opportunity to trap Marwan.
not_available Marwan has to know that's what we're thinking.
not_available The chances of him actually being present are small.
not_available But we could put a tracer on Behrooz.
not_available He might lead us to Marwan.
not_available We tried to trace Dina and Jack.
not_available He grabbed Jack and killed Dina.
not_available We'll take a different approach.
not_available Two tracers.
not_available One to be found, the other subcutaneous.
not_available There's no guarantee he won't find that one.
not_available There are no guarantees.
not_available But the fact is we have no viable leads on Marwan.
not_available We have to run with every chance we get.
not_available Have tactical finish up the profiles.
not_available Let's get field teams on their way to the dam now.
not_available How do you wanna approach the site? 
not_available We'll figure that out when Marwan calls.
not_available Go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's your status? 
not_available Airborne in 30 minutes.
not_available Very well.
not_available Get Bauer.
not_available We've got him.
not_available We have to have a satellite repositioned before the exchange takes place.
not_available Edgar, Chloe wants you to take a look at this when you have the time.
not_available Hang on, let me write that down.
not_available Just put it right there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available Got it.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Raines? The doctor says your husband should be out of surgery in the next hour.
not_available How is it going? 
not_available That's all he said.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Any word on Paul? 
not_available We still don't know yet.
not_available We've decided to go ahead with the exchange.
not_available We're getting Behrooz ready right now.
not_available It's not gonna be that simple.
not_available These things are never simple, but if Marwan really wants the kid, he's got no reason to hurt Jack.
not_available And if he doesn't and it's a trap? 
not_available We'll be prepared.
not_available Our field agents have the area fully covered.
not_available Will you be there? No, I'm gonna be running point from here.
not_available But Curtis will be on the ground.
not_available Is the operational objective to get Jack? No, it isn't.
not_available Audrey We have to consider Jack expendable.
not_available This thing's about creating an exposure point for Marwan.
not_available I know.
not_available Thank you for being straight with me, Tony.
not_available Look.
not_available Jack's about the only friend I have left, so I'm gonna do everything I can to keep him safe.
not_available All right? OK.
not_available What are you doing? Where are you taking me? Habib Marwan offered to exchange one of our operatives for you.
not_available We accepted that offer.
not_available What? What does he want with me? We don't know.
not_available We'll be behind you every step, and recover you as soon as possible.
not_available Does my mother know about this? Yes.
not_available You made a deal with her, to put us both in witness protection.
not_available We'll do everything to abide by that deal.
not_available Then don't do this! That's not an option.
not_available Now put this watch on.
not_available No.
not_available Get off me! 
not_available These devices will help us track you.
not_available And I give you my word, I'll do everything in my power for you.
not_available Hang on.
not_available This will sting.
not_available It's a microtracker, implanted under your skin.
not_available You don't care about me, or your word.
not_available You're just using me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I need you to sterilize a video feed to the van.
not_available I got teams that need tactical uploads.
not_available These hourlies need are 30 minutes past due.
not_available And now I gotta put video together? 
not_available Video's a priority.
not_available I'll see to the uploads.
not_available What about the hourlies? Get on it as soon as the link's in place.
not_available Is it working? 
not_available The red dot is the decoy.
not_available When they remove the watch, we can still trace the tracker in his neck.
not_available Edgar, make sure all cellular stations are put on autotrace.
not_available Got it.
not_available When our vehicles are two miles from the dam, have them hold.
not_available Nobody goes in until we hear from Marwan.
not_available Castle's team will be there as soon as possible.
not_available Behrooz is on his way.
not_available We don't have time to make sure it's not a trap.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available CTU, Edgar Stiles.
not_available This is Marwan.
not_available Get Dessler.
not_available Ms Dessler, it's Marwan.
not_available Dessler.
not_available I'll give you final instructions now.
not_available Make sure you follow them implicitly.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available How are you transporting Behrooz? 
not_available In one of our tactical vehicles.
not_available Good.
not_available Now, approach via the Frontage Road.
not_available Pull up at the back gate of the dam, and have Behrooz get out by himself and walk toward the gate.
not_available A van will be there to pick him up.
not_available What about Jack Bauer? He'll be in the van.
not_available That doesn't work for me.
not_available I wanna see Jack before I give up Behrooz.
not_available That's acceptable.
not_available And I want him unharmed.
not_available Your boy scout is just fine.
not_available OK.
not_available Remember, Behrooz gets out by himself.
not_available If any of your agents interfere, Bauer dies.
not_available Understood.
not_available Don't be late.
not_available Our vehicle's five minutes away.
not_available Then we'll see you in five minutes.
not_available That should keep them busy.
not_available What do you want to do about Bauer? As soon as we have Behrooz, we kill Bauer.
not_available Who's going to protect me? 
not_available We are.
not_available That's why we put trackers on you.
not_available You don't think Marwan will find them? He will.
not_available Hopefully it won't come to that, Behrooz.
not_available What does that mean? We're gonna have the area surrounded.
not_available We will protect you.
not_available Why would you protect me? I'm nothing to you people.
not_available You think I'm a terrorist.
not_available I don't believe you are.
not_available If Marwan is going to be there, why don't you grab him when we get there? He's probably not gonna be there.
not_available We need you to lead us to him.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available It's not.
not_available I'm in position.
not_available Does CTU have anyone there yet? Rasheed has spotted vehicles at the edge of the access road.
not_available We think it might be them.
not_available OK.
not_available Wait until the exchange, then I'll give you the word to take out Bauer.
not_available All right.
not_available Once the trade is made, how much longer do we need to keep CTU distracted? Ideally until we hit the target, but as long as possible.
not_available And what should my men do with Behrooz once we have him? I haven't decided yet.
not_available Yes.
not_available They are here.
not_available Good.
not_available Send in the van.
not_available I don't wanna do this.
not_available I'm afraid.
not_available We'll be behind you every step of the way.
not_available What good is that if he wants me dead? He's not going through all this just so he can kill you.
not_available All right? All right, the van's here.
not_available Come on, move it.
not_available I see Jack.
not_available We could converge on them now.
not_available Is there any indication that Marwan has other personnel in the area? No, just the van.
not_available Marwan's not gonna be there.
not_available If we close in now, they could take the van out themselves.
not_available We proceed.
not_available Curtis, it's a go.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm sending Behrooz.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Go.
not_available Is my mother in the van? She was working with you.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't wanna die.
not_available They have Behrooz.
not_available Bauer's in my sights.
not_available Take him out.
not_available No! Sniper's down! Move out! Take cover! Why'd you give 'em that kid? He's double
not_available tagged.
not_available We'll be tracking him.
not_available All right, you two, secure the area! Let's go.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available I've got Buchanan here.
not_available You're on speaker.
not_available OK.
not_available You OK? Fine.
not_available I need you to pick up a phone matrix within a 20
not_available mile radius of the dam.
not_available What are you thinking? I managed to short
not_available circuit some phone lines.
not_available If you can find two service obstructions at the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan.
not_available I'm opening up an interface now.
not_available We don't have a lot of time.
not_available Marwan's not gonna stay at the building for long.
not_available We have tactical teams ready.
not_available I'll reposition for assault.
not_available OK.
not_available I know the layout.
not_available I'll run point.
not_available Copy that.
not_available The van's heading west.
not_available Both trackers are registering.
not_available Good.
not_available Let me know if anything changes.
not_available OK, I will.
not_available Marwan, we have the boy.
not_available They will have placed tracking devices on him.
not_available Find them.
not_available We are looking for them now.
not_available When you destroy them, report back to me.
not_available Very well.
not_available Where is my mother? 
not_available Your mother is dead.
not_available No.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available What are you gonna do to me? No! Curtis.
not_available They found the decoy.
not_available How's the injected device looking? Still tracking.
not_available Wait.
not_available No, it's not! 
not_available They must have found it.
not_available Damn.
not_available Can you get me a visual on the van? Hold on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We need a satellite pumped into the servers.
not_available I got something you should see.
not_available Later.
not_available We need that satellite to find Behrooz Araz before they kill him.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available We have a location from the phone company 
not_available where Marwan was holding Jack.
not_available Edgar, download these coordinates to tactical right now.
not_available Our window's closing.
not_available We will only have this one opportunity.
not_available You've gotta get into the air now.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'm ready and on the move.
