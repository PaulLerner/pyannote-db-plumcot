
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available You know me well enough not to be surprised if there are repercussions.
not_available I hope you're not threatening me.
not_available I don't make threats, David.
not_available Just tell it like it is.
not_available What he's doing is showing you that not only did he have the power to help start your political career but he also has the power to put an end to it.
not_available There has to be a way to get to him.
not_available David? What What's wrong? I need your help.
not_available Hector and Ramon are trying to buy a virus to use as a weapon.
not_available Millions of people could die.
not_available I set up this deal so my government could take control of the virus and destroy it.
not_available You're still with CTU? Yes, I'm still with CTU.
not_available I cannot allow this virus to get into the wrong hands.
not_available I have a message from Jack.
not_available The virus that they are going to buy Jack is going to take it from them.
not_available Jack promised to get me and my family out of here if I help you.
not_available Hurry! Hurry! Bauer was with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
not_available His transponder signal stopped working.
not_available We're doing everything we can to re
not_available establish contact.
not_available Tell the delta units to hold their position till I get back to you.
not_available There's been a complication.
not_available Another buyer's interested in the virus.
not_available What are you talking about? We have a deal.
not_available We'll hold an auction and the virus will go to the highest bidder.
not_available We just found out there's another player in the deal.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Nina Meyers.
not_available Your bid is 225 million dollars.
not_available And hers is 240.
not_available You win.
not_available We can get the virus.
not_available How do you get the virus? I told you.
not_available I know her! I can get to her! The Salazars are willing to pay you at least 10 times more than what you're getting paid right now.
not_available Are you gonna be able to forgive me for killing your wife? If I wanted revenge, Nina, I would have killed you already.
not_available All I wanna do is finish this deal and disappear for good.
not_available Convince me.
not_available The following takes place between 11:00 pm and 12:00 am.
not_available Adam, is Amador moving yet? 
not_available No, he's still stopped at the location.
not_available What do we know about the area? 
not_available Hmm, it's mostly rural, there's very few structures.
not_available Do we have infrared on it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's not high res satellite but there appear to be a number of vehicles and bodies nearby but we have no idea what they are.
not_available All right.
not_available Give him space.
not_available We wanna make sure he feels safe enough to take delivery of the virus.
not_available Got it.
not_available What's the latest on Chase Edmunds? After he escaped from Hector he phoned his position in to delta teams and they're on their way to pick him up now.
not_available Edmunds, stop! Commander Reese.
not_available What's your condition? Shot in the hand but I'm fine.
not_available What about the others? I've got two people.
not_available They're coming with me.
not_available We've spotted a vehicle from the air, heading this way.
not_available It's the Salazars.
not_available They can't know that CTU is down here.
not_available We need to leave now! Then let's get them out of here.
not_available Sergio! Get on the chopper.
not_available We're going to a safe place, all right? We're going to go right now.
not_available I can't leave her like this.
not_available Hector's coming.
not_available You need to think about your son.
not_available We go.
not_available Follow us.
not_available We gotta go, now! Let's go, let's go! Move, move, move! Keep them low, keep them low! Get them in there, come on! Stay low, stay low! Yes? 
not_available Allan? It's Wayne Palmer.
not_available What do you want? You know, I always thought you had more balls than to trick me through my brother.
not_available What? You can't talk to me, man on man? I don't owe you an explanation.
not_available You slept with my wife! That's between you and me, Allan.
not_available Fine! Step down.
not_available And it all goes away.
not_available That's not your decision.
not_available We'll see.
not_available Wayne.
not_available Who are you talking to? Allan Milliken.
not_available What the hell do you think you're doing? 
not_available Cleaning up my own mess, David.
not_available Hello, Allan! 
not_available Mr President! That brother of yours is going to be your undoing.
not_available I'm not firing my brother.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available And I have no intention of losing my Health Care bill.
not_available I spent two years putting it together.
not_available Except you're three votes short, last I checked.
not_available You'd better brace yourself for some disappointment.
not_available I don't want to go to war with you, Allan.
not_available It's your choice, Mr President.
not_available The choice you're giving me is unacceptable.
not_available There has to be another way to work this out.
not_available On any other issue I'd bend over backwards to accomodate you.
not_available Not on this one.
not_available Then you'll have only yourself to blame for the consequences.
not_available And I promise you You won't like them.
not_available When is Sherry getting here? In five minutes.
not_available David, are you sure you want to bring her into this? We're gonna street fight, Wayne.
not_available That's what she does best.
not_available And we both have to focus on what's happening in Mexico.
not_available I know we're hoping for success but we have to anticipate failure.
not_available If Jack Bauer does not intercept the virus then we are dealing with an international crisis.
not_available This is Michael Amador.
not_available He's representing the Ukrainians in the sale of the virus.
not_available Now, we have a delta team tracking him on the ground, at a safe distance.
not_available Why don't they just get Amador now if they know where he is? Cause he may not be carrying the virus.
not_available And if he's not we'll have blown our chance at the interception.
not_available Once Jack confirms it is the virus then the delta teams will go in and secure it.
not_available Delta asked for a photo of the woman Jack's working with.
not_available So, I sent them this 
not_available Adam, wait.
not_available Nina Meyers is the broker? Didn't you read the ops brief? No.
not_available Kim, come with me.
not_available Can you finish the briefing, please 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was looking for the right time to tell you.
not_available I cannot believe Nina Meyers is involved in this.
not_available Your father needed her help to secure the virus.
not_available She killed my mother.
not_available My father couldn't even pretend to work with her.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available Sorry, Jack.
not_available I wanted to think you'd changed but I can feel it.
not_available You're lying.
not_available You haven't forgotten anything, have you? You despise me.
not_available And you'd do anything right now to get me to go along with your plan.
not_available It's not true.
not_available It is true.
not_available I know you're still with CTU.
not_available So, why would I let you set me up? Now.
not_available You can believe whatever you want.
not_available But I need this deal to happen.
not_available I'm a fugitive, I don't have a choice.
not_available I need the Salazars to pay me for the virus and right now, you're the only person Amador will deal with.
not_available Do you understand me? I'll honor your original deal.
not_available You'll get your 20 million dollars.
not_available And you get to keep breating.
not_available Until my client doesn't get what he paid for.
not_available Right now, your client should be the least of your worries.
not_available Hector! She's dead.
not_available Get out from that! Claudia! They can't be far away.
not_available Find them.
not_available Find them! Find them! I just spoke to the Mexican authorities and they're pissed off that we didn't notify them earlier.
not_available It's Hector.
not_available You set? Go! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's me.
not_available Edmunds escaped.
not_available He killed three of my men.
not_available Has he contacted CTU? Not yet.
not_available But he may not call.
not_available We found out Edmunds is a rogue.
not_available He's been acting on his own.
not_available Then CTU hasn't sent anyone out here to find him? They don't even know where he is.
not_available Ok, you call me the second you hear from him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Are you still with Bauer? I'm at the main road that leads into town, waiting for Bauer to bring the woman.
not_available Ramon, we have to call this off.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available The CTU agent, Edmunds.
not_available He escaped.
not_available How? I I don't know.
not_available Claudia was with him.
not_available Ramon.
not_available She's dead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But Hector, you still have business to do.
not_available Not with that much of a use.
not_available As soon as he gets to a phone he'll call CTU.
not_available Find him before that happens.
not_available I'm trying but it's too dark.
not_available He'll be impossible to track.
not_available What are you suggesting we do? Forget this whole thing, it's too dangerous! 
not_available It's always been dangerous.
not_available Not like this! Hey, listen to me.
not_available You are the one who made this deal.
not_available You promised our buyer something we can't deliver.
not_available If you don't keep your promise, my reputation and everything I worked for will be ruined.
not_available Do you understand? I understand.
not_available Keep some of your men looking for Edmunds and bring the rest of the men here so we can do the deal.
not_available Yes.
not_available Ramon, it's Jack.
not_available Everything clear outside? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Ok, I need you to come back to the building.
not_available Did the woman agree to work with us? I'll explain when you get here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Yes, Eric? Sherry Palmer's here.
not_available Show her in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello, Sherry.
not_available David.
not_available Thank you, Eric.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available No, thank you, I, er I'd rather stand.
not_available So How are things with Anne? 
not_available They're fine.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available You, er, you deserve a little bit of happiness.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're looking well.
not_available But somehow different.
not_available A little older? 
not_available No, it's not that.
not_available You look calm.
not_available Erm, tired maybe, but, er, I'm not sure exactly how calm.
not_available I know these last three years have been difficult.
not_available Well, erm, not as difficult as they could have been.
not_available And I have you to thank for that.
not_available Kept me out of prison, away from public humiliation.
not_available I, erm, I lost a lot.
not_available But most of it, I discovered, really wasn't that important to begin with.
not_available Which surprised me.
not_available Imagine that! What? What's What's funny? No, nothing really.
not_available It's just that, when I wanted you to fall back, and just let things be, you were a shark.
not_available Now that I've asked you back, and need you to be a shark I can still be whatever you need me to be.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So you say you're having some kind of trouble with Milliken? Yes.
not_available I am.
not_available Ok.
not_available Tell me all about it.
not_available Handcuffs? I thought you were going to gain her trust.
not_available I will.
not_available It's just going to take a little longer than I hoped.
not_available She agreed to do the exchange, that's what's important.
not_available When is it happening? 
not_available As soon as Amador calls.
not_available Amador had better call soon.
not_available We might not have much time.
not_available Your partner has escaped.
not_available You should have let me kill him when I had the chance.
not_available Yes, I should have.
not_available For some reason Claudia was with him.
not_available She ended up dead.
not_available What are you talking about? How? Hector didn't say.
not_available Tell Hector I'm sorry.
not_available Tell him yourself when he gets here.
not_available Nina, I need you to open up this transaction file.
not_available Amador is gonna want to verify your client's funds.
not_available Now! Bottom line is, Allan's determined to see Wayne removed.
not_available Even if it means destroying my presidency.
not_available And you've tried to work this out peacefully? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Allan wouldn't budge.
not_available In Allan's mind, it's a matter of pride.
not_available So, you want me to find something you can use against Allan? I've always known that you knew things about Allan that you didn't tell me because of my frienship with him.
not_available And I've always known you were too smart to ask.
not_available I guess we were both right.
not_available Allan does have skeletons in his closet that he would gard at any cost.
not_available One particular comes to mind.
not_available But I must warn you, David.
not_available It's a big one.
not_available What is it? 
not_available All you need to know is that if you play this card, you and Allan Milliken will be enemies for the rest of your life.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, our friendship ended when he tried to extort me.
not_available Then I can help you.
not_available Claudia is dead.
not_available Why did she die? So we could be safe.
not_available Your sister was very brave, Sergio.
not_available Now we don't have to worry about Hector no more.
not_available But I like Hector.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, sir, will do.
not_available Copy that.
not_available That's good enough, give it to me.
not_available But, I'm not finished.
not_available Reese, what's going on? Hector Salazar's looking for you.
not_available CT wants me to fall back my surveillance team.
not_available Wait a minute, we can't lose Amador! We won't.
not_available CT's tracking him through his cell phone.
not_available Well he can dump his cell phone.
not_available We need visual.
not_available Don't worry about that.
not_available It's not your problem anymore.
not_available Don't tell me it's not my problem! It's been my problem for the last year! Look, Edmunds.
not_available You need medical attention.
not_available We're evacuating you with the boy and his father now.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available Mr Chapelle! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm picking up on some heat signatures moving in on Amador's position.
not_available Ground vehicles? 
not_available From the speed, it looks like it.
not_available All right.
not_available This may be the virus.
not_available What protocoles do you want me on? You want me to contact the delta teams? Yeah.
not_available Put them on alert but make sure they don't approach until Amador meets bauer.
not_available We want a visual on the virus.
not_available Ok, got it.
not_available Sherry.
not_available Wayne! What are you doing in here? Oh, I'm just waiting for them to prepare an office for me.
not_available It's good to see you Sherry, but, to be blunt, I don't think your being here is such a good idea.
not_available Well, of course you don't, sweetie.
not_available That's because this whole thing is about your indiscretion with Julia.
not_available Oh, Sherry! 
not_available I say that with no judgement.
not_available Of course you do since you're the last person on earth who's in a position to pass judgement.
not_available Ok, Wayne, let's not play this.
not_available We're both too good at it.
not_available So, what do you want me to hear? Listen, I do appreciate you coming down here to help David Nononono
not_available no, skip that part.
not_available That's right, I forgot that about you.
not_available Listen, Sherry, do whatever it is that you do around here for a few hours.
not_available But then I want you to tell David that you were unable to find out anything that he could use on Allan Milliken.
not_available So, you know if I do that, the only way out of this is if you resign? Just what I wanna do.
not_available Well, David doesn't want that.
not_available And frankly, neither do I.
not_available Sherry, why do you care? Because David needs someone like me.
not_available Someone who sees things the way they really are.
not_available Who's not afraid to throw a punch every now and then.
not_available It's obvious, I can't play that role anymore but you can.
not_available Now, Wayne, I feel good knowing David's got you and I'm gonna make sure he keeps you.
not_available So save your breath, I'm gonna fix this and you are gonna make sure your brother gets re
not_available elected.
not_available Fine.
not_available But, Sherry, don't you forget how dangerous Allan Milliken can be.
not_available Oh, I won't forget.
not_available I'm afraid you're the one who forgot when you decided to get involved with his wife.
not_available No, we haven't heard directly from Jack in over an hour.
not_available But our delta teams are on stand by.
not_available I could.
not_available Do you have any more information on Nina Meyers? No, not yet.
not_available Look, Kim.
not_available I know it's hard but you're gonna have to try and put your feelings aside till all this is over.
not_available How can I put my feelings aside? How can my father put his feelings aside? I spent the last three years of my life knowing that the woman who killed my mother was pardoned by the president.
not_available And that she's out there living her life.
not_available And it's wrong.
not_available I know.
not_available She's violating her pardon, isn't she? She's buying and selling a virus.
not_available Kim.
not_available We cannot let her get away this time.
not_available Look, let's not get ahead of ourselves, here.
not_available Please, Tony.
not_available She has to pay for what she's done.
not_available Promise me when this is all over you'll at least help make that happen.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Tony, this is Chloe.
not_available Is Kim in there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need her.
not_available All right, she's on her way.
not_available Kim! I'll do what I can.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Shhh, it's ok.
not_available Good girl, nice and warm.
not_available Yes? Chloe, where are the index keys for Salazar? Who is this? 
not_available Patrick in COM 1.
not_available You guys aren't authorize to access those keys.
not_available I'll come down and do it for you.
not_available I'm just trying to save some time.
not_available I'll be down in a minute.
not_available Bye.
not_available Chloe.
not_available You wanted me? Michelle needs me to brief some people in division.
not_available Then I have to go to COM 1 give them index keys.
not_available I need you to watch some things up here for me.
not_available Can you do your work from my station? 
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available Good.
not_available This is Angela.
not_available She's just been fed so she'll sleep.
not_available And if she gets fussy, just put that in her mouth.
not_available But You can't have a baby in here! Chapelle thinks I had someone pick her up so, if he comes up, just keep her hidden.
not_available Yeah I But I can't I'll be back in 15 minutes.
not_available Ramon! Jack's not who you think he is.
not_available Is that right? He's working with CTU.
not_available He's setting you up.
not_available You think that my brother and I are that stupid? We made sure that he's acting alone.
not_available Don't you even think of undermining this deal.
not_available Hey, Jack! I think it's Amador.
not_available Put this phone on speaker, you say one wrong word, and he will kill you.
not_available You understand? Go.
not_available Hello.
not_available I've got the product.
not_available Are you ready to show me your account? Yes.
not_available We agreed you'd provide audit privileges.
not_available Yes.
not_available Tell me your routing number.
not_available Ok.
not_available The funds are in their account? Ready to be transferred? Yeah.
not_available There's an old mine east of Posta Mita.
not_available Meet me in the northern most building in an hour and ten minutes.
not_available I'll have one man with me for security.
not_available You may do the same.
not_available Good.
not_available We leave as soon as Hector arrives.
not_available Amador's on the move.
not_available What direction? 
not_available East.
not_available Likely destination? There's half a dozen villages along the vector.
not_available It could be anyone of them.
not_available With all due respect, Adam's right.
not_available We should have ordered delta team to move in now and arrest Amador.
not_available We've been over this Gael.
not_available If the virus isn't under Amador's control, we could lose it.
not_available We've gotta wait for Jack's confirmation.
not_available How will he let us know? The Salazars are watching and it's not like he can make a phone call.
not_available I don't know.
not_available He'll find a way.
not_available David, don't you think it's about time we informed the Mexican government exactly what it is we're doing on their soil? No.
not_available I don't want to risk compromising the operation.
not_available Then you should call the president yourself.
not_available Once he understands what kind of threat this virus poses he should ease off.
not_available Yes! Sir, Allan Milliken is holding for you on line five.
not_available Thank you, Eric.
not_available Yes, Allan.
not_available What the hell do you think you're doing? What are you talking about? Don't screw with me, David.
not_available Hey, I didn't pick this fight.
not_available You think you can enlist you psychopathic ex
not_available wife to manufacture lies about me in order to bring me down? It's not going to happen.
not_available You want it to stop? Keep your hands off my Health Care bill and stay away from my brother! You've got it backwards.
not_available Your brother should have stayed away from my wife.
not_available Come on, Allan, it's over.
not_available Really? I'm looking at photographs of her and Wayne together an hour ago.
not_available He was just trying to convince her to talk some sense into you.
not_available I'm warning you, David.
not_available Pull Sherry off this.
not_available Or the Health Care bill will be the least of your problems.
not_available Allan's scared.
not_available Allan is at his most dangerous when he's scared.
not_available Tell the Mexican ambassador that I'll be calling his president directly.
not_available She's out of town.
not_available I heard you the first time, sweetie, I'm not deaf.
not_available I understand that she's on vacation.
not_available I just wanna talk to her about Chagrin Falls.
not_available And give her this number, ok? 
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes, David? I just got off the phone with Allan Milliken.
not_available Well back up and quickly, huh? Hmmhmm 
not_available I guess he was pretty upset.
not_available What have you been up to? Exactly what you asked me to do.
not_available I'm fighting back.
not_available What's Chagrin Falls and what happened there? Well, it's something that Allan wants to keep buried.
not_available But, David, I'm gonna tell you everything but not just now.
not_available I've got a lot to get done in a very short period of time if I'm gonna pull this off with you.
not_available All right.
not_available Right here across from the opening of the mine.
not_available Looks like there's enough cover to hide your men.
not_available Right.
not_available Good.
not_available Did you find Edmunds? 
not_available No, I told you, it's too dark to find him.
not_available You don't need to look for Edmunds.
not_available Even if he contacted CTU they don't have enough time to get down here before the deal happens.
not_available What makes you so sure they're not already here? Didn't Gael tell you Edmunds came down alone? Why is she tied up? Bauer say he's going to buy her cooperation.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She'll do what she's told.
not_available Ramon, can I speak to you in private? What is it? This is not the plan.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available Hector, I know you're upset about Claudia.
not_available There's no reason to panick.
not_available I'm not panicking, I'm being sensible.
not_available This was your deal in the first place.
not_available And you were against it, remember? You was right and I was wrong.
not_available Edmund escapes, Claudia's dead and now this woman goes only along at gun point.
not_available It doesn't feel right.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available The buyers are waiting for this deal to happen because of you.
not_available Ramon, things are not going as planned.
not_available The plans have changed.
not_available CTU, Dessler.
not_available We're following what you have started.
not_available Hello? Ramon, sorry to interrupt.
not_available But if you want this deal to happen we've got to go now.
not_available Tony! Jack's on the line.
not_available He's using his cell as a one
not_available way.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available Amador's gonna be at the mine of Posta Mita in about an hour.
not_available Now, it's gonna take us that long to get there.
not_available And get your men into position.
not_available Bauer's right.
not_available Our men need to be in place before Amador gets there.
not_available I still haven't signed off on this.
not_available You do what I tell you to do! Now, call your men and tell them to be at the village, outside the mine.
not_available Dammit.
not_available No battery.
not_available Hey, Jack, where is the other phone? I've got it here.
not_available It's disconnected.
not_available All right, they told us what we need to know.
not_available Get the delta teams in position.
not_available Make sure they set up a quarantine zone in case the virus gets out there in the exchange.
not_available Bauer's been through.
not_available The deal is going down near a mine, just outside of Posta Mita in 55 minutes.
not_available How long until you're able to mobilize? We've got the coordinates.
not_available We're moving out now.
not_available Your men are mobilizing.
not_available They're bunking three kilometres from the strike zone.
not_available How did you find out where the exchange was gonna be done? Bauer got through to CTU.
not_available It's going down in 55 minutes.
not_available You're keeping your men three klicks away? That's not exactly a front row seat.
not_available I'm keeping them out of site.
not_available But how are you gonna confirm that the package contains the virus? I'm sending in a forward observer.
not_available Picked anyone yet? No, not yet.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available We've got people trained for that, Edmunds.
not_available I'm trained for it, too.
not_available Besides, I know the Salazars, remember? Your hand? This isn't combat.
not_available It's observation.
not_available All right.
not_available Trell! Get this man up with the surveillance package! Get over it, Hector.
not_available Not until you respect what I have to say.
not_available The Americans are behind it anyway.
not_available There's no more time to argue.
not_available Stop talking down to me.
not_available Did you already forget the only reason why you are here is because of me? 
not_available I got you out of prison.
not_available Bauer got me out, not you.
not_available And now that I'm out, you take orders from me just like you always have.
not_available Ramon 
not_available It's over, Hector! No more talking.
not_available We're gonna do the deal now.
not_available Bauer! Get her in the car.
not_available You can't control this, Jack.
not_available Just get in the car.
not_available All right, what's the matter? Please don't cry.
not_available It's ok.
not_available Shh.
not_available What did you do to her? 
not_available I didn't do anything to her.
not_available Well, you must have done something.
not_available Chloe, look, I promise you, I didn't do anything to her.
not_available Look, I'm gonna re
not_available direct all my files back down to my desk.
not_available Fine 
not_available I didn't even finish with this.
not_available Jack and Nina are meeting Amador in What about delta force? They've established a preliminary three kilometer zone.
not_available What the hell is that? 
not_available Dammit I told her.
not_available Michelle.
not_available You take care of this, please.
not_available That's it, Chloe.
not_available You're out of here.
not_available I told you I didn't have anyone to watch her.
not_available You'll watch her.
not_available I gave you a warning, now you're suspended.
not_available It was a verbal warning only.
not_available Ryan.
not_available What? Jack's meeting Amador in less than an hour but we have no visual satellite coverage of that area.
not_available What does that have to do with this baby? We're gonna have to use digitally enhanced audio coverage.
not_available Chloe is the best we have at that.
not_available So, you're telling me we have to let this woman raise her child in our office because we don't have anyone who can do her job? What I'm telling you is that maybe we should deal with Chloe's child care problems on another day.
not_available I have work to do.
not_available Who's gonna look after my child? 
not_available Give her to Kim.
not_available What? Based on what CTU got from Jack, the meeting will probably take place here.
not_available By an old mine at the northern end of town.
not_available My position is gonna be here.
not_available What I need from you is to put your men behind this ridge until we know that the virus is real.
not_available That's a good, natural cover.
not_available That'll work.
not_available How long will it take your men to get to the old mine? 
not_available 90 seconds.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Where are the rest of the men? 
not_available They were the only ones we could bring.
not_available It's not enough! It's all right.
not_available Amador is only bringing one man.
not_available Yeah, so he says.
not_available Can you stop bringing problems where there are none? I'm just trying to make sure we are covered.
not_available No, you're trying to stop this deal from happening because you lost your nerve.
not_available Ramon, things are moving too fast, we haven't had enough time to think them through.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available Just because you say we'll be fine doesn't mean we'll be fine.
not_available The situation is difficult enough, don't make it worse! All right? Or what? Ramon! If you want this deal to happen we have to leave now.
not_available We have to be at the mine 20 minutes before Amador gets there The deal is off! Hector, we're not done here.
not_available I've said what I need to say.
not_available Listen to me, Hector, listen to me carefully.
not_available If we don't give our buyers what we promised them we won't just lose money, we'll lose respect.
not_available And without that, we have nothing.
not_available We have our lives.
not_available We're leaving now.
not_available Pablo, Felipe, vamos! Now! Hector, don't do this.
not_available Hector.
not_available Hector! Hector!
