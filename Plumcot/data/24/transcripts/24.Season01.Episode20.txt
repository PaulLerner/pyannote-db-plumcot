
not_available Right now terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been targeted and people that I work with may be involved in both.
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer and today is the longest day of my life.
not_available You know, Jack, I take back what I said.
not_available It's getting dull.
not_available That helicopter made a fly
not_available by for a reason.
not_available Maybe, maybe not.
not_available Come here, help me with this.
not_available There's nothing here.
not_available We're wasting our time.
not_available Alexis tried to pay off a power company official to cut off the electricity at this location at 7:20 for a reason.
not_available They want something here, have gone to extremes to shut it down.
not_available Mason.
not_available Excellent news.
not_available Half an hour.
not_available Don't let anyone in or out until we get there.
not_available Alexis Drazen's out of surgery.
not_available We should be there when he wakes up.
not_available You go ahead.
not_available Jack, we were fed misinformation.
not_available The address in the file.
not_available The time Morgan gave you.
not_available The whole thing.
not_available Look around.
not_available There's nothing here.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But you're going to stick around anyway? It's 7:03, George.
not_available I want to be here at 7:20.
not_available You can send a car back for me, okay? I promise, I won't disappear on you.
not_available I don't have time to argue with you.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You sit right here.
not_available Stay right there.
not_available Who the hell was that guy? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Who the hell was that guy? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Teri, it's okay.
not_available I'm rIght here.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Take a breath.
not_available I can't.
not_available I saw the car explode.
not_available Teri.
not_available There was nothing left! Kim is alive.
not_available She got out before the explosion.
not_available I talked to her.
not_available All right? She was fine.
not_available She was worried about you.
not_available Now I need your help.
not_available I need to get you back to CTU.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I need your help, Teri.
not_available Come on.
not_available What did she say when you talked to her? Where is she? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available She wouldn't say.
not_available What? After the safe house, she didn't trust us.
not_available I don't blame her.
not_available Get in here.
not_available We have to find her
not_available Believe me, we're looking.
not_available Get in the car! Where's Jack? Does he know what's happening? He's out on assignment.
not_available I should hear from him soon, though.
not_available Myers.
not_available It's me.
not_available I found Teri at the Bauer house.
not_available Someone was trying to kill her, I took him down.
not_available Send a team over there in case he's got backup.
not_available Of course.
not_available is she all right? She will be.
not_available She's suffering from temporary memory loss.
not_available She's got a friend with her, too.
not_available A pretty good one, by the way he's acting.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Are you sure? Who is this guy? His name is Phil Parslow.
not_available She vouches for him.
not_available She's known him for a long time.
not_available He was hit, but not too badly.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Twenty, thirty minutes away.
not_available Take him to the clinic.
not_available I'll send someone to question him.
not_available I think you should bring Teri here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't I get a phone call? Let's go, lock them down.
not_available Come on.
not_available I need to talk to someone.
not_available Don't we all? Don't listen to the bitch.
not_available She lies.
not_available You'll get a chance for that after we put you through.
not_available Come on with me.
not_available You're mine.
not_available They're going to ask you about Frank and the deal.
not_available I don't know anything about it.
not_available Tell them that.
not_available You were just at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
not_available I should tell them about everything else, too.
not_available I mean, what happened today.
not_available After the safe house, I'm not sure if I can trust anybody.
not_available You trust me, right? 
not_available Yeah, and look where it got me.
not_available I trust you, I know you're trying to do the right thing.
not_available Okay, then listen to me.
not_available Tell them everything.
not_available What happened at the safe house has nothing to do with this.
not_available Whatever you tell them, I'll back it up.
not_available Including my part in it.
not_available You're going to get in trouble.
not_available Then I'll get in trouble.
not_available It's about time I faced up to what I did.
not_available All right.
not_available You're up.
not_available How are you feeling? I'm fine, Daddy.
not_available Relieved, actually.
not_available I think that maybe living with a secret is harder work than I thought.
not_available I'd be lying to you if I told you the hard work was over.
not_available You're going to be asked some questions we all are, that we'd rather not deal with.
not_available But if we stick together we'll get through it.
not_available Could you give your mother and me a few minutes? I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to interrupt your celebration.
not_available You could have joined it.
not_available I'm not in the mood to celebrate the end of your campaign, David.
not_available You just gave your concession speech.
not_available That remains to be seen.
not_available Do you really think people want a president who acts like some guest on a bad afternoon talk show confessing his sins publicly? It's always possible that they want someone honest.
not_available Mike seems to think I still have a shot.
not_available It's Mike's job to tell you what you want to hear.
not_available Mine is to tell you the truth.
not_available You're not qualified to tell me the truth.
not_available It took 13 minutes for you to tear apart everything that it took us Why don't you just let me mourn that loss, okay? Fair enough.
not_available I only hope your conscience comforts you when you finally realize this is all over.
not_available You mean the campaign or us? Confirm, Alpha 1.
not_available This is Alpha 1.
not_available Bauer's gone below.
not_available Positive it was Bauer? Yes.
not_available What's he doing here? He wasn't invited, that's for sure.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I work for CTU.
not_available I know who you are, Agent Bauer.
not_available I checked you out.
not_available My name is DeSalvo.
not_available D.<br>O.<br>D.
not_available Whatever this place is, it's obvious that no one's supposed to know it's here.
not_available You seem to have found it okay.
not_available This is a prison facility.
not_available Class 3 detention center.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? At 8:00 a.
not_available m.
not_available this morning there was an assassination attempt on Senator Palmer.
not_available I'm the lead investigator.
not_available I was following the thread.
not_available It led me here.
not_available I need more than that.
not_available The people that want Palmer dead bribed someone from the power company to shut down the electricity to the grid that you're hooked into.
not_available They were ordered to do this at 7:20.
not_available Something's going to happen here then, isn't it? Mr.
not_available DeSalvo, you better listen to me.
not_available The people behind this assassination attempt are ex
not_available military Serbs.
not_available Working for a family called Drazen.
not_available It's a vendetta.
not_available They've killed a lot of people and will kill more unless we do something.
not_available Please, sir, I'll ask one more time.
not_available What is happening here at 7:20? A prisoner's being delivered by chopper.
not_available Who? His identity is classified, even from me.
not_available They move him every few weeks randomly.
not_available What do these Drazens want with him, anyway? It's hard to tell unless I know who the prisoner is.
not_available They might want to kill him.
not_available They might want to set him free.
not_available Either way, you've got about five minutes.
not_available Call for backup.
not_available Backup can't get here in five minutes.
not_available Call anyway.
not_available If I'm wrong, you've gone through a little trouble.
not_available I'll take the heat for that.
not_available If I'm right, you've saved every life in this building.
not_available Please.
not_available Have Wycoff call me ASAP.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's your personnel here? Three guards plus a maintenance man, two technicians.
not_available Are they weaponstrained? 
not_available They've never fired a weapon in their lives.
not_available The Drazens don't know that.
not_available Issue them full service gear.
not_available Have them stand by.
not_available To do what exactly? To make this place look more secure than it is.
not_available At least until backup arrives.
not_available It's almost time.
not_available Three minutes.
not_available You still haven't heard from your brother? 
not_available No.
not_available He was to verify his meeting with the power company man.
not_available If there was a problem, he would have called.
not_available You seem anxious, Harris.
not_available I thought professionals didn't get anxious.
not_available Professionals get very anxious when a plan goes off the tracks.
not_available There's nothing wrong with the plan.
not_available Then what's Bauer doing here? Just get your men ready.
not_available It's time.
not_available Come here.
not_available No.
not_available Like this.
not_available All right, let's get moving.
not_available Keep the stock in tight, keep your weapon down.
not_available You're going to be all right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Any word on the backup? 
not_available They're looking into it.
not_available Weapon.
not_available We good? Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available All right.
not_available Put your men in front of the lights so they can be seen.
not_available Form a line right in front of the lights.
not_available Look like you're ready for something.
not_available You said there'd be a warden and three guards.
not_available I count eight, including Bauer.
not_available They're expecting us, Andre.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available The power's going down in 25 seconds.
not_available The sudden darkness will disorient them.
not_available What if there is no darkness? 
not_available There will be.
not_available Go! Eight more seconds.
not_available Five, four three, two, one.
not_available Perimeter lights are still on.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available All right.
not_available We're still going.
not_available No.
not_available Security's twice what we anticipated.
not_available The lights are on.
not_available We'll be cut to pieces.
not_available Get ready to move.
not_available We have to stand down.
not_available My money, my decision.
not_available My crew.
not_available They'll obey my orders.
not_available All right.
not_available Plans have changed.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available My father's Jack Bauer.
not_available Sit.
not_available He's the director of the Los Angeles Bureau of CTU.
not_available Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available Have you heard of it? I can't say that I have.
not_available Do you want the number? What I want is information on Frank Allard and his plans to buy and distribute I don't know him.
not_available I met him for the first time a couple hours ago.
not_available Do you know that someone tried to kill David Palmer this morning? Yes.
not_available Aren't you curious how I know about it? I don't know.
not_available Maybe because it's been on the news the last 12 hours.
not_available I didn't realize that.
not_available I was kidnapped by the same people who are trying to kill Senator Palmer.
not_available I know this sounds crazy.
not_available They kidnapped my mother, tried to get my father to help them but he rescued us.
not_available And then he dropped you off at Frankie's so you could what, earn spending money dealing drugs? No.
not_available They brought us to a safe house, but it was attacked.
not_available And I think they captured my mother again.
not_available Okay.
not_available She told me you had an active imagination.
not_available She wasn't kidding.
not_available Who? Your friend, the one we picked you up with.
not_available Melanie? No.
not_available She's not my friend.
not_available She thinks I'm after her boyfriend.
not_available You can't believe anything she says about me.
not_available I'm going to stick you back in the holding cell.
not_available Maybe that will convince you not to screw around.
not_available Call this number.
not_available Tell them I am Jack Bauer's daughter and that I'm here.
not_available Ask them if they think I'm screwing around.
not_available Come on.
not_available DeSalvo, wait.
not_available Just because they haven't attacked doesn't mean they won't.
not_available Maybe this is a crock and there's nobody there.
not_available Drazen's crew is out there.
not_available They didn't shut down the power.
not_available They're working on a contingency plan.
not_available Trust me, I know these people.
not_available I've requested backup.
not_available Not much else I can do.
not_available There is.
not_available Let me talk to that prisoner.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I can't give access.
not_available My orders are explicit.
not_available I can't even speak to him myself.
not_available Do you understand everything happening here is connected to the assassination attempt on Palmer? If you don't let me interrogate him, Palmer's life is in danger.
not_available Do you want that responsibility? You are welcome to go over my head if you want, but I can't help you.
not_available Now, I got to process this guy.
not_available Wait.
not_available You said you worked for the D.<br>O.<br>D.<br>, right? 
not_available And? Can I borrow your phone? Yes, I want to clear every interview that Nicole gives.
not_available Yes, personally.
not_available Whenever possible, I want to be there.
not_available Let me know.
not_available Is it as bad as Sherry said it would be? predIcted a sharp drop in Senator Palmer's numbers It's not turning out that way.
not_available Our instant polls indicate that the Senator's base of support Is holding steady in most areas of the country and in some cases, It's actually increasing.
not_available When asked if the Senator's disclosures made them more lIkely to vote for him in the general election less likely, or made no difference at all, 22 percent said "More LIkely " while only 18 percent said "Less LIkely.
not_available " Looks like you were right.
not_available over the coming months seems to indicate that voters approved of Senator Palmer's honesty before a national television audience of Senator Palmer's honesty before a national television audience a little more than a half hour ago.
not_available Senator.
not_available It's a Jack Bauer.
not_available He says it's urgent.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack, it's me.
not_available Did you get anything from Alexis? 
not_available No.
not_available He's out of surgery now but I followed a lead we got from his hotel room.
not_available I'm going to need your help.
not_available Go on.
not_available I'm at a Class 3 detention facility.
not_available It's a prison that doesn't exist.
not_available Neither does the prisoner they brought in.
not_available Who's the prisoner? 
not_available That's where I'll need your help.
not_available The Department of Defense runs this place.
not_available You want me to pull strings
not_available I need access to the prisoner as soon as you can make it happen.
not_available The facility's located in Saugus at the address you gave me.
not_available The warden's name is DeSalvo.
not_available He's reasonable, but his hands are tied.
not_available I'll do what I can.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Come on, you son of a bitch, turn around.
not_available Damn it, that prisoner's identity is classified! I told you I need to know who that prisoner is.
not_available No.
not_available It's impossible.
not_available You recognize him? That's Victor Drazen.
not_available Who is he? A man I killed two years ago.
not_available All right, listen.
not_available You're asking me to risk my job, maybe go to jail.
not_available I need some quid pro quo.
not_available What's your connection to this guy? What I'm about to tell you is secured information.
not_available Two years ago, a congressional subcommittee decided that Victor Drazen was the key threat to the peace in Bosnia.
not_available They authorized a mission to take him out.
not_available I led that mission.
not_available When we got there, things went wrong.
not_available Today, I found out that his wife and daughter were killed in the attack.
not_available I thought we'd killed Victor, but apparently, I was wrong.
not_available Now his sons want to break him out.
not_available More than that, they want to exact a revenge on me.
not_available Earlier today, his people kidnapped my wife and daughter.
not_available We got them back.
not_available They're safe for now.
not_available But if Victor Drazen escapes from here I lose any leverage I've got of keeping his people away from my family.
not_available I'll make another call.
not_available We don't have time for calls.
not_available We need to take this prisoner and move him ourselves now.
not_available I said I'll make a call.
not_available We still need to cut the power.
not_available But your brother hasn't contacted us yet.
not_available He would have called by now if he were alive.
not_available We should assume Alexis is dead.
not_available There may be another way, though.
not_available The substation for this sector is a half mile from here.
not_available A few ounces of C
not_available 5 should be sufficient.
not_available To save tIme, we'll go in through the front.
not_available The idea is not to attract attention.
not_available The idea is to get my father out of prison.
not_available This is the best chance we'll ever have.
not_available These don't match.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Where's Jack? I thought he was with you.
not_available He opted to stay in the field.
not_available In Saugus? 
not_available The address he got from the Drazen file.
not_available What's he doing? Why didn't he come back with you? I don't know.
not_available He's a stubborn guy.
not_available He insisted on staying.
not_available Meanwhile, Alexis Drazen came to at the hospital so I headed over there to interrogate him.
not_available He hasn't talked yet, but I cut off his morphine.
not_available He should be chatty in about an hour.
not_available You didn't tell Jack about his family? What are you doing, George? 
not_available What are you doing? Last time I checked, it wasn't a part of my job to have to explain myself to my subordinates.
not_available Unless they've called off the hit on Palmer's life you should be working on securing his day's agenda, right? Looks like he's going to be our next president.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Senator David Palmer has already carried New York and with the polls closing shortly here in California.
not_available Everyone's outside celebrating the latest poll.
not_available Come on out, sweetheart.
not_available What is it? What's wrong now? Before, when you said it was over and I asked you what you meant, the campaign or me? What I said came out of wanting to protect my family wanting to protect you.
not_available You can't hold that against me.
not_available You can't hold that against me.
not_available Sherry.
not_available You're an amazing woman.
not_available Smart, determined, sure of yourself.
not_available You always know what you want.
not_available But you don't want me, not really.
not_available I don't think you've wanted me for a very long time.
not_available That's nonsense.
not_available Is it? Maybe if everything with Nicole and Keith never happened but it did happen.
not_available And you kept the truth from me for all these years.
not_available I don't think you could have done that without pulling away.
not_available And now.
not_available Now I can't help thinking that I don't trust you anymore.
not_available And if I can't trust you how could I love you? Well, David you may not love me, but you will never leave me.
not_available You take all the time you need to get yourself together and then you come out and you greet all the people who have given up every day and every night of their lives for the last year to put us in office.
not_available Us? 
not_available Yes.
not_available That's right.
not_available Us.
not_available Because come January, when you're being sworn in make no mistake about it this woman here will be standing right next to you.
not_available Open up, two.
not_available Move away from the door.
not_available Now.
not_available Hey, Martinez, settle down over there.
not_available One thing I don't get.
not_available If Drazen was the target, what's he doing here? Someone thought he was more valuable alive than dead.
not_available By "someone," you mean one of our people? He's probably been feeding them intelligence.
not_available Why put you and your men through the charade of trying to kill him? Because they wanted the rest of the world to think he was dead.
not_available My mission was set up to fail from the start.
not_available I lost every man I went in there with.
not_available DeSalvo.
not_available Yeah, he's right here.
not_available I understand.
not_available We got permission to move Drazen? No.
not_available That request is still working its way up the chain of command.
not_available But D.<br>O.<br>D.
not_available says you can interrogate him.
not_available Good.
not_available Bauer? Five minutes.
not_available Fine.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available You'll have to pardon my surprise.
not_available I saw you die.
not_available I watched you enter a building.
not_available Nobody could have survived that explosion.
not_available Our intelligence told us the building was empty when you entered.
not_available Your fight is with me.
not_available Not my wife not my daughter, but with me.
not_available Please, leave my family alone.
not_available Mr.
not_available Drazen you have already lost your wife and your daughter.
not_available You don't need to lose your sons, too.
not_available My sons are soldiers.
not_available Then they will die for nothing.
not_available We know about the rescue plan.
not_available It was scheduled for 7:20.
not_available We stopped it.
not_available We've called in for backup.
not_available If they try again, sir, they will die.
not_available Then you have nothing to worry about.
not_available Call it off, Victor.
not_available How can I? The same way you've been communicating with them this entire time! Call it off or your sons will die! Call it off or your sons will die! All right.
not_available We'll move him.
not_available Is there another way out of here, not on the schematic? A fire or flood egress? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll get my men ready.
not_available Arm them like we did before.
not_available Get up.
not_available We're evacuating the prisoner.
not_available Grab your weapons, have personnel convene in Quarter C.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Stop.
not_available Move out.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get against the wall.
not_available The power's down in the west quadrant.
not_available Copy that.
not_available They are here.
