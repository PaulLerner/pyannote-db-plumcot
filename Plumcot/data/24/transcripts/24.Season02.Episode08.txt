
not_available Why are they asking Dad questions? 
not_available You started a witch hunt in our family.
not_available What did you accuse my father of? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available You're pointing at him to cover yourself! He says Bob Warner had dealings with Syed Ali.
not_available Bring them in.
not_available We'll separate them and turn up the heat.
not_available I need help.
not_available I have to get into my father's private records.
not_available Who is the man in Visalia?! The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen.
not_available He also thinks I'm in prison.
not_available You make him believe you got out.
not_available I need to see Mamud.
not_available Should we go? 
not_available Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen.
not_available That's it.
not_available Everybody go! 
not_available We have to talk about Ron Wieland.
not_available Does anyone know he's sequestered? No, but soon they'll figure out the last person they saw him with was you.
not_available I've invoked executive privilege and granted Sherry provisional security clearance.
not_available Seems every time I turn around, somebody advises me to send you away.
not_available Why don'tyou? You may be able to get information nobody else can.
not_available Dammit! Just play it cool.
not_available Cool? We're in a stolen car.
not_available Step out of the car, please.
not_available And open the trunk.
not_available Oh, my God! Carla! Oh, my God! He killed her! 
not_available Putyour hands behind your head.
not_available So whose car is it? 
not_available It's her father's.
not_available Did he give it to you? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available Then what, exactly? 
not_available We took it without permission.
not_available You stole this car? 
not_available I can't believe he killed her.
not_available Gary Matheson, the man Kim works for, beat his wife and was starting to hurt his daughter.
not_available Kim called me to help get Megan away from him.
not_available If that's true, why didn'tyou go to the police? Why do I find you 20 miles outside of LA? I thought so.
not_available You have the right to remain silent.
not_available Anything you say can and will be used againstyou in a court of law.
not_available You have the right to an attorney.
not_available If you can't afford one, one will be appointed for you.
not_available Do you understand these rights? Is it safe in here? Stay away from cordoned areas, you'll be all right.
not_available This building was bombed this morning.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available You got the rooms ready? Yeah.
not_available They're a little messed up, but good enough for interrogation.
not_available How we doing here? 
not_available Final tally 30 dead, 17 wounded.
not_available Davidorff and Lindauer are critical.
not_available What about Paula? Could you do me a favour and take them backto the rooms? Follow me, please.
not_available Listen, can I talkto you alone? Stay with them.
not_available I'll be there in a minute.
not_available Find anything new? 
not_available No, just what I told you on the phone.
not_available The two men are contradicting each other.
not_available There's definitely a tie to Syed Ali.
not_available Looks like Ali is at the centre of this.
not_available I hope it brings us closer to finding the nuke.
not_available Just tell me how hard I can push him.
not_available Hard as you have to.
not_available Stick bamboo shoots under their fingernails.
not_available Get what they got.
not_available Time's running out.
not_available Call Henderson at FBI.
not_available Set up a conference call with him and the Attorney General.
not_available Lynne.
not_available You have a sec? 
not_available Sure, Roger.
not_available I understand that Sherry Palmer has been given provisional security clearance.
not_available Yes, that's right.
not_available The president has invoked executive privilege.
not_available You OK with that? 
not_available It's different.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I've weighed in about it.
not_available If I feel that she's becoming a problem, I'll let the president know.
not_available She's his ex
not_available wife.
not_available That's a problem all by itself.
not_available No.
not_available Sandra, thank you.
not_available I'll get back with you.
not_available Tell me about Ron Wieland.
not_available What about him? I just got off the phone with Sandra lvany at the network.
not_available She said no one's heard from him since he met with you this morning.
not_available David? You didn't detain him, did you? You are here today to help me, not question my judgment.
not_available And I am trying to help.
not_available What's going on with Wieland? 
not_available He was gonna go public with a rumour.
not_available About the bomb? I cannot afford a panic.
not_available You can't keep him locked up indefinitely.
not_available People are already asking questions.
not_available We're holding him at the OC.
not_available When the crisis passes, I'll let him go.
not_available Well, meanwhile you've got a problem.
not_available His disappearance could raise questions you don't want to answer.
not_available I putArmus on it.
not_available Apparently it hasn't helped.
not_available The word is getting out.
not_available What do you suggest? Give him an on
not_available air exclusive when this is over.
not_available I offered that to him.
not_available He didn't want it.
not_available Then let me talkto him.
not_available David, one talentyou know I have is dealing with the media.
not_available And I know Ron.
not_available He likes me.
not_available No.
not_available You're here to gather information.
not_available And to help.
not_available You said so yourself.
not_available And today you can't afford to ignore that.
not_available Let me try talking to Ron.
not_available What would you say to him? I'll make it worth his while not to say anything.
not_available Kim, I'm scared! 
not_available It's OK, Megan.
not_available You're gonna be OK.
not_available It's gonna be fine.
not_available Where are you taking her? She can't go backto LA.
not_available Why not? 
not_available It's not safe.
not_available Why didn'tyou tell him? 
not_available My dad said not to tell anyone.
not_available He didn't know you'd be charged with murder.
not_available I'm gonna tell him.
not_available No.
not_available You can't.
not_available I'm telling you, Miguel, my dad said no one can know about this.
not_available I think you should tell him who your dad is.
not_available Let them call him.
not_available Letyour dad explain why we're trying to get out of town.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available My father works at CTU, the place that got bombed this morning.
not_available His name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Please call him.
not_available He'll explain why it's not safe to be in LA today.
not_available You can call your father after you've been processed.
not_available Faheen: "It's too late.
not_available Don't waste your time.
not_available The operation will be done.<br>" 
not_available This is not working.
not_available It will work.
not_available I just need a little more time.
not_available No, you're done.
not_available Jack, don't do this! 
not_available On your feet.
not_available We're going back.
not_available Did he talk? 
not_available No, he wouldn't talkto her.
not_available What do we do? Have Division set up a white room.
not_available We'll handle it in LA.
not_available Wrong move.
not_available The deeper you bring him in, the more he'll shut down.
not_available We'll see.
not_available Rick, give me more time with him! You've had enough.
not_available Make sure Faheen gets to the airport.
not_available And you? 
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available You see what he's doing? 
not_available Jack, you can't take her.
not_available I have a document signed by the president! He can't do this! 
not_available My orders are to stay with you and her.
not_available Forget that.
not_available All they need is Faheen.
not_available Don't push this.
not_available I can't leave you alone with her.
not_available It's got nothing to do with you.
not_available Back off.
not_available Step away from the car, Bauer.
not_available Paul Koplin.
not_available Nice to meetyou.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Come in.
not_available No problem.
not_available I spoke to Ralph, he told me what files we're going to have to get into.
not_available The ones that linked Reza to this terrorist? 
not_available Yes.
not_available That's Syed Ali.
not_available The company computer is networked into this house.
not_available I'll have to hack some passwords.
not_available I assume you're authorising me to do that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, of course.
not_available Is this it? I don't know why they dragged my family in for questioning on my sister's wedding day.
not_available I'm a little surprised about that, too, but it's a whole new world out there now.
not_available I'm sorry that happened, but as private investigators we're required by law to report any terrorist
not_available related information to Homeland Security right off.
not_available Here it is.
not_available I accessed the monthly statements but I couldn't get into any detailed records.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's see what we can do.
not_available Armus? Where are you going? I'm taking Mrs Palmer to one of the conference rooms.
not_available Does she have clearance? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Butyou don't need to speak about me as if I weren't here, Mr Stanton.
not_available I'm sorry, Mrs Palmer.
not_available Roger Stanton.
not_available I know who you are, Roger.
not_available It's just a highly restricted area.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available However, I have been granted access.
not_available Why do you need to be here? 
not_available Thatyou'll have to askthe president.
not_available Armus.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available My apologies, Mrs Palmer.
not_available It's just we're very careful about the flow of information today.
not_available There's no need to apologise.
not_available I would assume thatyou're careful about the flow of information every day.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sherry Palmer.
not_available Hello, Ron.
not_available Just when I thought this day couldn't get any stranger.
not_available I can imagine you're not happy about all of this.
not_available I'd like to know what "this" is.
not_available I don't exactly know myself.
not_available I don't believe you, Sherry.
not_available But unless they kill me I'm gonna have the story of the year.
not_available I was kidnapped by the leader of the free world.
not_available That's not necessarily true, Ron.
not_available There actually has been precedent for this kind of executive action.
not_available If you're here to shut me up, you're wasting your time.
not_available I sensed I was onto something.
not_available That they locked me in here only confirms it.
not_available I'm coming out of here with a story.
not_available Deal with it.
not_available Hm.
not_available Mind if I sit down? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available We'd like to release you, Ron.
not_available And we will.
not_available But we need assurances you won't go public with the rumour you threatened to broadcast.
not_available In return for what? I get an exclusive with the president on some watereddown story? Not a watered
not_available down story.
not_available Something else.
not_available You go out there, let everyone know thatyou are not missing.
not_available Don't say anything about this morning.
not_available The president will letyou inside of the OC to report first
not_available hand.
not_available No journalist has ever been inside there.
not_available Why did he send you down here to make this offer? In fact, what are you even doing back inside David Palmer's circle? Take the deal, Ron.
not_available In a couple of hours they'll brief you and then you'll know more than I do.
not_available Hey! Guys, you need some help? Yeah.
not_available "Think about it, Mamud.
not_available We're on our way to Los Angeles.<br>" Nina: "How big is the bomb?" "What time is it supposed to go off?" Faheen: "You betrayed me.
not_available You betrayed us all.
not_available Traitor.<br>" Bring her back here now.
not_available Come on.
not_available We are out of time.
not_available If you want to live through this, be straight with me.
not_available When was this planned? 
not_available Six months before I was arrested.
not_available And Faheen approached you? 
not_available Yes, but through an intermediary.
not_available He didn't tell you about the nuke? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't know what the endgame was.
not_available I just knew it was something big.
not_available Is there another way around Faheen? 
not_available No.
not_available Is he really willing to die? Yes.
not_available Jack, what are we gonna do? Take her back.
not_available Don't drive too long on that spare.
not_available There's not a lot of tread left.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you very much, sir.
not_available Why not follow me to Ventura Boulevard? 
not_available There's a tire store there.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available All right.
not_available You're all set.
not_available Here.
not_available Please.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available You know anybody who needs pool service, give 'em my card.
not_available OK? Of course, of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available See ya! The kid said it was dangerous and to stay out of Los Angeles.
not_available This one told me a similar story.
not_available No details, though.
not_available Do you think it's true? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available What, then? 
not_available They're telling stories.
not_available Want me to call it in? Wait until we get back, OK? 
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Your friend's got quite an imagination.
not_available What did he say? Thatyou were leaving town because some bomb's supposed to go off in LA today.
not_available That whatyou meant when you said it wasn't safe? Please, just call CTU and try and reach my dad.
not_available You need to get Megan, the girl that was with us.
not_available Keep her out of the city.
not_available LA Dispatch, this is 621.
not_available Put me through to Frank Reed over at FBI Local.
not_available I've been unable to reach anyone at the FBlfor 45 minutes.
not_available Unable to reach them? Why? 
not_available Lot of traffiic on their lines for some reason.
not_available Keep trying.
not_available Give me a call when you get through.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What the hell is going on? How did it go with Wieland? 
not_available He's not gonna play ball.
not_available He thinks he's got the upper hand.
not_available He knows we have to let him go eventually.
not_available Whether there's a legal precedent for this or not, he has a hell of a story.
not_available I'm so sorry, David.
not_available I thought I could charm him.
not_available OK, Sherry.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available David? Why are you treating me like this? It's not aboutyou.
not_available I just have more important things to deal with right now.
not_available You know, you've always been able to forgive.
not_available Always given everyone a second chance, but not me.
not_available I came here today to tell you thatyou were right.
not_available Right to kick me off the campaign, right to file for divorce.
not_available Where's all this coming from? A place of honesty, of realisation.
not_available I was too caught up in the power.
not_available And you're not now? 
not_available Of course.
not_available You know I love it.
not_available But now I am aware of what I can and can't handle.
not_available So what are you asking for? Let me help you.
not_available If what I bring to you can be useful, then you can consider it the start of a new confidence.
not_available All right.
not_available But I promise you absolutely nothing in return.
not_available OK.
not_available All right, there are the transaction records.
not_available On the week of the 23rd, Reza made four withdrawals from the company's discretionary account.
not_available $175,000, $150,000, $50,000, another $50,000 
not_available That's almost a half a million dollars.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What did he do with the money? 
not_available Let's see.
not_available He wrote a checkto Syed Ali for $475,000 in return for "consulting services.<br>" So what? Maybe they were doing business.
not_available Syed Ali's only business is bankrolling terrorists.
not_available What about my father? What's his connection to all this? Reza convinced CTU your father authorised these transactions, or maybe he just did them on his own.
not_available I'm speculating.
not_available My father is not involved in terrorism.
not_available The government made a mistake.
not_available We have to find it and clear him.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's try and get into his personal calendar.
not_available Let's see what he did the days the checks were written.
not_available Fine.
not_available OK.
not_available Here's your father's schedule for that week.
not_available Nothing here, either.
not_available Of course not.
not_available My father has nothing to do with any of this.
not_available I shouldn't have called you.
not_available This is a waste of time.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available What? There's a file in his personal directory that's accessed almost daily.
not_available It has a resource tab on it, which means it's a government file.
not_available My dad has government clients.
not_available Whoa! What? It's an auto
not_available delete program.
not_available Can'tyou do something? 
not_available Yeah, I'm trying.
not_available This can't be right.
not_available What? The data on this volume has a comsat grid.
not_available You see, these are addresses.
not_available CSG14877.
not_available That's an encoded coordinate.
not_available I don't know whatyou're getting at.
not_available The only people who have files like these have government security clearance.
not_available Why would my dad have that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Why have I been kept waiting here like this? 
not_available Sit down, please, Mr Warner.
not_available I have some information.
not_available Sit down! What information do you have? I'm not supposed to talkto anybody about this, but under the circumstances I am a consultant for the CIA.
not_available There's the contact code for my liaison.
not_available Call Langley, they'll verify.
not_available Why didn'tyou tell me this at the house? 
not_available Come on.
not_available You knowthe drill.
not_available I'm not supposed to talkto anyone about this without clearance.
not_available What's your l
not_available 3 protocol? I was approached about five years ago because of my international investment work.
not_available They asked me if I'd like to help my country and I said OK.
not_available What do you do? My corporation is used as a conduit to pass information back and forth.
not_available To whom? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available That is the truth.
not_available Now you listen to me, Mr Almeida.
not_available I am not an enemy of this country.
not_available I am a patriot.
not_available I love my country.
not_available I don't know any Syed Ali, nor why there is a record of me doing business with him.
not_available Well, if that's true then you have nothing to worry about, do you? But there is a connection between your company and Syed Ali.
not_available And I'm gonna find out what it is.
not_available So in the meantime, sit tight.
not_available I'm gonna checkthis out.
not_available Kimberly Bauer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We need to talk to Jack Bauer.
not_available He's not here.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available His daughter is in custody.
not_available It's important we speak to him immediately.
not_available Hold on.
not_available OK.
not_available Laurie, I need you to call downstairs George, Bob Warner just told me he does deliveries for the CIA.
not_available CIA? Did you check it out? No.
not_available I was about to call his liaison, but it looks like he's got a legitimate contact code.
not_available If that is the case, then Reza's lying to us.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I pushed Reza pretty hard.
not_available I think he's telling the truth.
not_available We have to push harder than usual today.
not_available So dig in and see whatyou can find out.
not_available Let me know.
not_available Mr Mason? It's the sheriff in Newhall.
not_available They're holding Kim Bauer.
not_available Why? 
not_available She's been charged with murder.
not_available Call Jack.
not_available This is George Mason.
not_available Who am I speaking to? 
not_available Bauer.
not_available It's Michelle.
not_available What? I don't know howto say this.
not_available We're on the line with the sheriff in Newhall.
not_available They're holding Kim.
not_available For what? 
not_available She's being held on some criminal charges.
not_available What are you talking about? She's on the line.
not_available Should I patch her through? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Get Mason on this.
not_available I'm on with the precinct.
not_available We're working on it.
not_available There's a mistake.
not_available I need you to straighten it out and get Kim out of LA.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Daddy? Kim, what happened? 
not_available I was leaving the city, like you said.
not_available I was with Megan and my boyfriend, Miguel.
not_available And the CHP pulled us over for speeding.
not_available They found a body in the trunk.
not_available Carla's body.
not_available Carla? The woman you work for? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We took her husband's car.
not_available He must've done it this morning and put the body in the trunk.
not_available Oh, my God, help me.
not_available Just relax, we're gonna straighten this out.
not_available He beat her up.
not_available That's why I needed to take Megan.
not_available He was hurting her, too.
not_available CTU will send someone.
not_available They'll getyou out of there now.
not_available I don't want them to send someone else.
not_available I wantyou to help me.
not_available Can'tyou do that? They think I killed Carla, Dad.
not_available Dad, I need you here now.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Michelle, are you there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is Faheen saying now? Nina told him that US forces have been sent to his village, that they're rounding up his family.
not_available Faheen called her a liar.
not_available Dad? 
not_available Kim, hold on.
not_available She just told Faheen that she has the power to save them.
not_available Dad? 
not_available Kim, hold on.
not_available What are they saying now? 
not_available We can't pick it up.
not_available The audio's too low.
not_available Are you there? Yeah.
not_available George, I need you to help Kim.
not_available If you have to supersede local authority, do it.
not_available Get her out of LA.
not_available Done.
not_available Nina, what did he tell you? Everything.
not_available No! She just slit his throat! 
not_available Can't stop this.
not_available Dad! You got him? 
not_available We're losing him.
not_available Son of a bitch! Jack 
not_available Secure her! I know where the bomb is.
not_available Take the plane to San Diego.
not_available I want civilian transport to Sao Paolo.
not_available I'll tell you everything when we're down.
not_available George, are you getting this? 
not_available Yeah, I am.
not_available He's gone! 
not_available This is your call.
not_available We're out of time.
not_available I don't like being dicked around.
not_available We can bring her into CTU and press her there.
not_available No.
not_available It'll take too long.
not_available Take her to San Diego.
not_available Fine.
not_available Tell the pilot to go to San Diego.
not_available You got it.
not_available This is how it works.
not_available We land, you tell me where the bomb is.
not_available We're gonna hold you until we get a result, you got that? Got it.
not_available Sir? I may have found something in the Faheen recordings.
not_available What'd it say? 
not_available A name.
not_available Marko Khatami.
not_available Listen.
not_available Marko Khatami.
not_available Did you try crossreferencing? 
not_available Yeah, he's connected to Syed Ali.
not_available Mr Naiyeer? What? Who's Marko Khatami?! I have no idea! Who is he?! Get off! 
not_available Somebody help me.
not_available You're crazy! You're mad! 
not_available Just cool it! Cool down! Let me go.
not_available Are we being released? 
not_available No.
not_available You're being transferred.
not_available To where? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Someone from CTU called.
not_available Said they were coming to pick you up and take over the case.
not_available What about Megan? You brought her back here, right? What's gonna happen to her? 
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available You can't take her backto LA! You listen to me.
not_available I checked you out.
not_available Your father works for CTU.
not_available You tell me, what did he tell you would happen today in LA? I can't say anything, butyou can't take Megan back.
not_available Just tell me what's going on.
not_available It's a nuclear bomb.
not_available They didn't say anything because they don't want to start a panic.
not_available OK.
not_available Did you get anything else off the recording? 
not_available It's 99%noise.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Just running on empty.
not_available Then why don'tyou get something to eat? 
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available Your neck's bleeding here.
not_available It's somebody else's blood.
not_available Michelle, why don'tyou take a few minutes, get cleaned up and changed.
not_available You'll feel better.
not_available Hey.
not_available We're gonna survive this day.
not_available All right? Come on, get changed.
not_available Come on.
not_available Mr President? These are the updated guidelines Stanton sent to local law enforcement and the FBI.
not_available I understand Sherry ran into Stanton.
not_available I didn't hear that.
not_available Has he said anything to you about her being here? 
not_available I don't think he's very happy about it.
not_available Do you have a problem with her? 
not_available I know you think she's useful to you.
not_available That's not what I asked.
not_available I welcome help wherever we can get it.
not_available If you feel she performs a function here 
not_available Sir, you better come out here.
not_available What is it, Mike? I've confirmed that there is an imminent threat to national security and public safety.
not_available While I cannot confirm the target or nature of the attack, it may come from Middle Eastern terrorists, but terrorists in the US may also be involved.
not_available How did he get out? What lfind troubling about this story is our president knows about this threat and isn't saying anything to the public.
not_available Who was controlling that room? 
not_available Armus.
not_available I want to see him now.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available If my father really does work for the government, which is impossible to believe, wouldn't he know if Reza did something illegal? I'd think so, especially if terrorism was involved.
not_available If he knew about Reza, what does that mean? My guess is your father was aware that Reza was involved in some kind of illegal activity.
