
not_available President Hassan's security forces they're still cracking down on the opposition and they're not showing any signs of letting up.
not_available The rumors have already started that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord.
not_available Assemble the representatives.
not_available I want to appeal to them myself to stay the course.
not_available One of the suspects has family connections to a member of our delegation here at the UN.
not_available Who? Jamot.
not_available Are you arresting me? I demand to speak with President Hassan.
not_available President Hassan is the one who gave this order.
not_available What's wrong? You sound upset.
not_available I need to speak with you about your father.
not_available I have to go to the embassy right now.
not_available I'll meet you in private when I get back.
not_available This has the address and schematic of the evidence lockup.
not_available This keycard will get you access.
not_available How do we find the money? The evidence bins are numbered.
not_available Do exactly what I tell you to do, and you'll be in and out.
not_available No one will know you're there.
not_available The authorities know about the nuclear material.
not_available Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.
not_available No doctors.
not_available The doctor said that Oleg could be treated.
not_available He showed me how.
not_available Who are you to question my judgment? Never disobey an order from your father.
not_available I'm sorry, my son.
not_available Tell me about this buyer.
not_available His name is Ernst Meier, German arms dealer.
not_available What's he looking to buy? Weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available I'm going to have to meet this Meier, and I need a good
not_available faith payment up front.
not_available I'm not going to tell you again.
not_available Leave me alone and let me get dressed.
not_available Damn it, come here or the deal's off.
not_available Meier? That's right.
not_available Where is the $5 million? The money is in your account.
not_available Drop the weapon.
not_available Now! Drop it! Meier.
not_available You really think you can roll me for $5 million? Let me talk to my man.
not_available Yes.
not_available Bring him back here.
not_available He wants to see you.
not_available Get up.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Well, that went well.
not_available Unanimous support for the treaty well, nearly unanimous, anyway.
not_available I have the distinct impression that I am running out of goodwill.
not_available Maybe, but you bought yourself some breathing room.
not_available These people are already up past their bedtimes.
not_available I don't think we'll be hearing any more grousing until tomorrow morning at the earliest.
not_available Congratulations, Madam President.
not_available Thank you, I appreciated your support.
not_available Good.
not_available Now I hope you'll explain to me what's really going on.
not_available I thought I did.
not_available You invoked national security, which, with respect, is not an explanation.
not_available It's saying "Don't ask." Madam President, our countries have a unique relationship based on a trust developed over nearly a century now.
not_available Anything you say to me is in the strictest confidence.
not_available You may tell your prime minister and no one else that President Hassan's crackdown isn't just a response to the attempt on his life.
not_available There are unsecured nuclear materials in play.
not_available Apparently a faction inside his country was so disturbed by the prospect of disarmament, they decided to take matters into their own hands.
not_available Where are the materials? Here on our soil.
not_available CTU is running an undercover operation to retrieve them as we speak.
not_available Who is that? My guess is, it is my backup.
not_available No calls till we get to Vladimir.
not_available Does this look like a situation where you get to make demands? It's Meier.
not_available I lost my sight line on you.
not_available I'm leaving the building.
not_available I understand.
not_available Everything okay? The money's been transferred to Vladimir's account.
not_available We're going to his office.
not_available We should be there in a few minutes.
not_available I'll follow with a backup team.
not_available That might not be necessary.
not_available After what they just pulled, you're sure you're comfortable without backup? There are other considerations.
not_available You mean they have Renee.
not_available That's right.
not_available Okay, we'll stay back.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available What was that? Let him know what? Shut up and drive.
not_available Okay, I got 'em on traffic cam.
not_available Is everything okay? Jack seems to be in control.
not_available Looks fine, all things considered.
not_available Driver looks a little worried.
not_available Who is this guy anyway? Should I pass him on to facial recognition? Dana? I've got to take this.
not_available Yeah, sure, no biggie.
not_available Just unsecured nuclear materials.
not_available Yes.
not_available We're there, outside the evidence building.
not_available You're in the side alley, right? No, we parked out front so everyone can see us.
not_available Come on, what do you think I am? Okay, look, I need to walk you through this step by step.
not_available I know, we're ready.
not_available Well, something just came up here and I need you to hang on for a few minutes.
not_available Here? We're kind of exposed, Jenny.
not_available You'll be fine if you just stay still.
not_available We have a 30
not_available minute window before the next security pass.
not_available I will be with you the second I can.
not_available Arlo, Hastings wants us in his office for a field update.
not_available Can I ask you a hypothetical question? If it's about Dana, it's not hypothetical.
not_available If your fiancÃ© was cheating on you, would you want to know? Hypothetically, who'd be asking some creepy stalker who's about to get fired? I'm serious.
not_available So am I.
not_available Just go upstairs.
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available Dana, Cole just called about Jack.
not_available He's almost to Laitanan.
not_available Hastings wants us in his office.
not_available Pass me back the keys.
not_available Slowly get out, put your hands on the roof.
not_available Let's go.
not_available So this is how you do business? I wire you the $5 million like we agreed, and then you try and take me out.
not_available I did not think you were for real.
not_available It was a misunderstanding, but it's past.
not_available We are here.
not_available As an act of good faith, Vladimir has already started calling his contacts, inquiring about the nuclear materials.
not_available I don't care what he's done.
not_available I want to talk to you.
not_available So talk.
not_available I want to talk to my partner alone, now.
not_available Look, he's upset, understandably.
not_available It will be fine.
not_available Yeah? This is our chance.
not_available We should take him out now.
not_available No, we need him to do this deal.
not_available Don't risk everything for a whore.
not_available You ever talk about her like that again, I'll kill you.
not_available You understand? What the hell are you doing? I have authorization to pull you out.
not_available No, that's not possible.
not_available Renee, you've taken us this far, I'm going to finish it.
not_available Jack, you can't.
not_available He doesn't trust you, first of all.
not_available The only reason he's agreeing to continue this is me.
not_available I'm fine, really.
not_available You want to make calls, let's go.
not_available You don't have a say in this.
not_available I am pulling you out.
not_available No, look, it's not a big deal.
not_available I know what he did to you six years ago, and it is a big deal.
not_available Jack, if we stop this now, then everything that I have done is for nothing.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're almost there, it'll be worth it.
not_available Kevin, are you there? Yeah.
not_available I thought you forgot about us.
not_available I wish I could.
not_available Come on, don't be like that.
not_available Are we good to go? Yes, move now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available There's a security panel next to the door.
not_available Use the keycard I gave you.
not_available The code is 1668.
not_available Keep moving, it will stop in a second.
not_available If you want the $120,000 you will be out of there in less than 20 minutes.
not_available Okay, which door is it? It's the last one on the left.
not_available The code is 4660.
not_available It's like Christmas with chain link.
not_available Okay, how do we find the money? It's in section 3101.
not_available 3101.
not_available It's down the aisle on your left.
not_available 3101.
not_available The code is 2824.
not_available The last one on the left.
not_available Yeah, right here.
not_available What the hell, man? Jen, what the hell is going on? What number is it? Is it 3101? Come on.
not_available What is wrong with you two? Hey, it's called a mistake, all right? Back off.
not_available So where is it? 
not_available Down here, down here.
not_available The code is 2824.
not_available Bin number's 4301.
not_available Oh, man, it's too many numbers.
not_available Boom! Got it! That's beautiful, man.
not_available That's beautiful.
not_available Just shut up and get out of there.
not_available The next patrol is in less than 15 minutes.
not_available You've got the money.
not_available Close the doors and leave.
not_available Call me when you're clear.
not_available I sure will, Jenny.
not_available Let's go! Not yet.
not_available Check out some of this stuff.
not_available Hey, seriously, come on, man.
not_available Patrol's on its way.
not_available Yeah, 15 minutes.
not_available Are you sure, then? You haven't heard of anyone dealing in these materials? All right.
not_available Well, thank you for your time.
not_available I'm sorry to trouble you.
not_available Nothing.
not_available They did not appreciate being called so late.
not_available Renee, cut me some bread.
not_available Here.
not_available You might want to ease up on the drinking.
not_available You've got some calls to make.
not_available I drink what I want.
not_available Renee, where's the bread? Coming.
not_available Drink.
not_available What is this? It is too thin.
not_available It should be thick.
not_available Nice and thick.
not_available There we are.
not_available She's changed, you know? Six years ago, she thought she was too good for me.
not_available Now, she is much more friendly.
not_available Maybe I should thank you all that time you were together in Mexico City.
not_available Come on.
not_available I see how you look at her.
not_available Don't tell me you didn't.
not_available You want to keep talking, do it on the phone.
not_available Otherwise, the nuclear materials will be gone, and this deal will be dead.
not_available Fine, but I don't like you breathing down my neck.
not_available Lugo, get him out of here.
not_available And I'm running out of my vodka.
not_available Go get me some more.
not_available Sit down.
not_available I won't be long.
not_available My younger son.
not_available I wanted to bury him, Father Gregor.
not_available Of course, but that will take a little time.
not_available The cemetery workers need to prepare the grave No.
not_available You will do it now out back.
not_available My men will dig his grave.
not_available Sergei Petrovich, this isn't right.
not_available Then make it right.
not_available Treat him like a soldier who died on the battlefield and must be buried there.
not_available Is that how he died? In battle? You just make it right.
not_available Say all the prayers.
not_available Where I end up, I don't care.
not_available But this boy is with the angels.
not_available My men will be with you soon.
not_available Leave us.
not_available Get up.
not_available Look at me, Josef.
not_available I want you to understand that everything I've done, I've done for you and for our family.
not_available You killed my brother.
not_available Because I loved him, because I couldn't bear to see him suffer, because there was no other way.
not_available There's always another way.
not_available Not when we are dealing with nuclear materials.
not_available We cannot risk the authorities finding out.
not_available You know that.
not_available You don't know why I'm doing this? Because when I die, I want to leave you and your family a worthy inheritance.
not_available Wealth, respect, consequence.
not_available Can you understand that? One day you will.
not_available As your son grows older, you will.
not_available And you will understand how much I love you.
not_available My only son.
not_available Father Gregor is here to bury Oleg.
not_available Will you help him? He's my brother.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Call when you are ready.
not_available What is it? Vladimir Laitanan.
not_available He says it's important.
not_available Vladimir, what do you want? Sergei Petrovich.
not_available I apologize for calling you out of the blue like this, sir.
not_available Uh, your family is well? I said, what do you want? I have a business proposition.
not_available Then call me in business time, not in the middle of the night.
not_available No, no, no, this can't wait.
not_available I hear there are materials for sale, expensive materials, dangerous ones.
not_available Talk straight.
not_available What materials? Nuclear rods.
not_available Highly enriched uranium.
not_available So, why are you calling me? If anyone has the organization to pull off such a deal, it's you.
not_available I'm flattered.
not_available I have a buyer here, a German.
not_available He's willing to pay a great deal of money for them.
not_available Double any offer you have.
not_available Then he is as stupid as you are.
not_available Are you out of your mind? Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available A misunderstanding.
not_available Don't call me again.
not_available He had no idea what I was talking about.
not_available All right, then we call the next person.
not_available You're not listening.
not_available He says nobody sells these things.
not_available Nobody.
not_available You're close to the biggest deal of your life, Vladimir.
not_available He's just jealous that he's not in on it.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Look, later.
not_available Later.
not_available Once you've made more calls.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.
not_available What are you going to do? Da.
not_available Anton? Yes? Mr.
not_available President, it's Allison Taylor.
not_available We were scheduled to resume our discussions.
not_available I'm late, I know.
not_available I apologize.
not_available The events of this evening The events of this evening make it more important than ever that we complete our work on this treaty.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I need to know your intentions.
not_available My intentions? The crackdown on your countrymen.
not_available I've been informed that you've even arrested one of your own delegation.
not_available That's an internal matter.
not_available No, sir, it is not.
not_available Less than an hour ago, I assured delegates from two dozen countries that you were still our best hope for peace.
not_available I personally guaranteed them you'd observe the letter and spirit of this agreement we're signing.
not_available And I will.
not_available Do I have your word on that? Madame President, within the next few hours, the arrests will stop.
not_available I'm taking measures to assure that.
not_available And the delegate you've taken into custody? Will be released or charged.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How do you think he sounded? Not like himself.
not_available Did he talk? No, sir.
not_available Jamot denies all knowledge of the plot against you.
not_available How forceful was the interrogation? Very.
not_available I did it myself.
not_available I don't believe he's involved with your brother in any way.
not_available You know Jamot has connections with the extremists.
not_available A cousin in the opposition party, sir.
not_available That's all.
not_available If he won't talk, we have to force the issue.
not_available He has a wife and children back home, is that correct? A boy, nine.
not_available A girl, seven.
not_available Have the Security Services arrest them.
not_available Apply whatever pressure's necessary to make Jamot talk.
not_available You have something to say? Yes, sir.
not_available I do.
not_available You rallied us around you on the promise that you would put an end to such tactics.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I will do everything humanly possible to find your brother but, please, do not ask me to violate the principles that you and I both stand for.
not_available Thank you, Tarin.
not_available With my wife gone, I have no one to speak the truth to me anymore.
not_available Check everyone's computer and phone records again.
not_available See to it that nothing was overlooked.
not_available Of course, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Nabeel can stay and pack up these files.
not_available Forget the files.
not_available Sir? Call the Security Services and have them round up Jamot's wife and children as I asked.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You just told Tarin that I gave you a direct order.
not_available You obey it or not? Yes, sir.
not_available I will call Security Services.
not_available Good.
not_available And find Tarin's records in that mess.
not_available He might have his own reasons for not wanting Jamot to talk.
not_available Nick.
not_available Nick, come on, we've got to move, man.
not_available There's going to be a patrol here any minute.
not_available Come on.
not_available Give me the money.
not_available What? The money, dumbass! We're going to split this.
not_available I ain't gonna ask you again.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available Bitch! Knock it off! Come on, man, let's go! Jackass! I told you we should've gone! Such an idiot.
not_available I just received a call from the hazmat lab at Fort Hamilton.
not_available They've analyzed the traces of uranium found on Hassan's assassin.
not_available Did they identify where it came from? 
not_available Sample's too small to be precise, but the uranium is of Soviet origin.
not_available They're recalibrating their tests now.
not_available Great.
not_available Keep me informed, Chloe.
not_available Kevin, are you out of there? No, not exactly.
not_available What are you talking about? You told me you left there 20 minutes ago.
not_available Okay, yeah, we didn't.
not_available Okay, now somebody's here.
not_available You idiot! Yeah, fine, all right, just hurry.
not_available Somebody's in the hallway.
not_available I can't believe you let this happen.
not_available If you get caught, I am dead.
not_available Hey, we all are.
not_available All right, so just find us a way out of here.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Stay calm.
not_available It's a cop.
not_available He's in the hallway right outside the room you're in.
not_available There's another exit.
not_available In the corner right behind you.
not_available Come on, come on! Come on.
not_available My God, wh..
not_available what have you done? Damn it! It's locked! He's coming inside right now.
not_available You're going to have to slip past him, go out the door you came in.
not_available Control, this is ten post 11.
not_available I'm at the warehouse Nick! What are you doing?! No! Kevin, stop him! Come on, come on, come on, come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey! Hey! Hey! He called it in.
not_available We gotta go! Come on! Kevin, stop him! 
not_available Come on.
not_available We'll call you when we're clear! Tarin, are you all right? When did you get back from the embassy? Just now.
not_available May I come in? What is it? It's only me here.
not_available It's safe.
not_available What's wrong? You know your father has had many people arrested, including Jamot.
not_available Now he's having Jamot's wife and two children detained back home, so they can be used to force him to talk.
not_available No.
not_available There must be some mistake.
not_available He gave the order himself.
not_available I thought I'd convinced him not to, but he was lying to me, he went behind my back.
not_available Kayla, your father is a great man.
not_available I respect him more than anyone I have ever known.
not_available But Farhad's betrayal has changed him.
not_available What can we do? Open up, please.
not_available What are they doing here? I don't know.
not_available Open up.
not_available Tarin, stay here.
not_available Yes, Nabeel? 
not_available Miss Kayla, we've been looking everywhere for Tarin.
not_available Have you seen him? No.
not_available Is there some problem? What do you think you're doing? We have orders, Miss Kayla.
not_available I said he wasn't here.
not_available I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.
not_available You can't just barge in here! I need to talk to my father! Nabeel.
not_available Why do you need armed guards to come looking for me? The president says you may be involved with his brother.
not_available Based on what? Nothing.
not_available Only that I would not allow an innocent family to be tortured.
not_available He's ordered me to detain you.
not_available I have no choice.
not_available You do have a choice, Nabeel.
not_available Tell my father he's made a mistake, that there's no one more loyal than Tarin.
not_available Nabeel, this is insane, and you know it.
not_available Don't make this worse, please.
not_available Don't you see? My hands are tied.
not_available Let me talk to my father.
not_available He's given orders not to be disturbed.
not_available Even by you.
not_available I'll talk to him! I'll get him to change his mind! No, I understand, Roman.
not_available We'll do business some other time, okay.
not_available That's it.
not_available Last one.
not_available He also knows nothing about nuclear rods.
not_available He also said it's suicide to deal in them.
not_available Meier has wasted our time.
not_available No, look, Meier's intel is good.
not_available So we need to think.
not_available Who else can we call? 
not_available No one.
not_available I've called everyone who could possibly deal in these things.
not_available Then somebody that you've already talked to has to know something.
not_available Renee, it's it's done.
not_available Look, maybe they don't want to admit it.
not_available Maybe they don't know how serious you are.
not_available You should call them back.
not_available I said no.
not_available Tell them that you have the buyer, tell them you have the money.
not_available Shut up! Just because I like your face doesn't mean I have to put up with your crap.
not_available We made $5 million.
not_available A good night's work.
not_available Why settle for five when we can have 50? When did you get so greedy? $5 million is plenty.
not_available Plus we have each other, that's not too bad, is it? Oh, it's not bad.
not_available But it could be better.
not_available Call them again.
not_available Do it for me.
not_available I said no.
not_available Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.
not_available Somebody knows something.
not_available What is your problem? Nobody knows.
not_available There's no one left to call.
not_available Now you go out there and you tell Meier to leave, okay.
not_available I'm not telling him anything! What? Not until you try again.
not_available Look, it's over! What is wrong with you?! 
not_available I need this deal.
not_available That is why you're here? The deal? Why else? Do you think that I'm here for you? Get up.
not_available Renee.
not_available Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh, God.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh, God! It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Laitanan contacted everyone he thought might have information on the nuclear materials.
not_available No one responded.
not_available That's when he said he was finished.
not_available Renee kept pushing him, and it got ugly.
not_available Laitanan's dead.
not_available He attacked her.
not_available And so, what, you took him out? No, she did.
not_available She did? Half an hour earlier, she was having sex with the guy.
not_available How does that even happen, Jack? What, she lose it? She was defending herself.
not_available Look, we knew this guy was violent before we even went in.
not_available He's violent? 
not_available He's dead on the floor.
not_available Yes, he is.
not_available And right, now, we still don't have the nuclear materials secured, so I suggest we move on.
not_available Move on? He was our only lead, Jack.
not_available Now, where do we move on to? We can start by working the phone calls that Laitanan made.
not_available There's also physical files here and a computer to go through.
not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available Cole, are you getting this? Yes, sir.
not_available We're en route from the staging area, five minutes out.
not_available We're gonna need forensics to rip this place apart.
not_available Yeah, I got Bennett with me.
not_available He can coordinate till the full team arrives.
not_available Just do what you can.
not_available And bring Laitanan's body back here for autopsy.
not_available I want to know what the hell happened.
not_available Any other good news? Jack? Cole? Dana? Excuse me? I said, anything else? No, sir.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available We'll see you when you get here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Our entire operation just went south.
not_available You think you could show a little interest? Pull it together! You didn't have to do that.
not_available Do what? Cover for me with Hastings.
not_available All I did was tell him the truth.
not_available When they see Vladimir, they'll know what happened.
not_available What do you think happened? It's like you said.
not_available I couldn't handle it.
not_available God, I'm sorry.
not_available It's all right.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I could have killed you.
not_available I've made such a mess of everything.
not_available I just thought that if if I did this, I could make it all right.
not_available I could have my life back.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey! You can have your life back any time you want.
not_available You just need to want it.
not_available How? I've tried, and I don't know how.
not_available I don't I don't have anything, anyone.
not_available You've got me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Okay? I didn't want it to end like this.
not_available I know.
not_available Look, we're a lot farther ahead than we were three hours ago.
not_available Every call Laitanan made is a solid lead that we can follow up, and that's because of you.
not_available You did your part.
not_available Now let CTU do their job.
not_available Please? Let me take you home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Damn it, they really must have been moving.
not_available CTU's here already.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available This is really important.
not_available Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself.
not_available That's what happened.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I do, and if anybody else wants to ask you questions about that, I'll be right there with you to answer them.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me go talk to them.
not_available They're Russian.
not_available Vladimir must have contacted whoever's got the rods.
not_available They just didn't want him to know.
