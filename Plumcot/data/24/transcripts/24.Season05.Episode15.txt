
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available I'm issuing an executive order, imposing a curfew on all civilians in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
not_available This curfew will be effective immediately and will be enforced by the military.
not_available They're talking about this like it's an illegal action.
not_available Don't worry, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I'm in control of the situation.
not_available Hasn't it ever occurred to you that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall? Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country.
not_available There's going to be a fallout.
not_available And you know it.
not_available You're here to shut this place down, aren't you? I told you before, the White House 
not_available I know what you told me before.
not_available Now tell me the truth.
not_available CTU is being absorbed by Homeland, which means from now on, every operational decision needs to go through me.
not_available There's something from my brother I need to give you personally.
not_available I should be there within the hour.
not_available You coming here? I know it sounds impulsive, Aaron, but I'd rather see you sooner than later.
not_available I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly.
not_available Does she have the schematics and the access codes? Yes.
not_available Everything we need.
not_available Release the Sentox here and 200,000 people die.
not_available The decryption key is CharlieAlpha39
not_available Alpha.
not_available It worked.
not_available This is what you wanted.
not_available Drop the gun! I'm with the German Federal Intelligence Service.
not_available I've been undercover for the last six months, gathering Intel on Collette's clientele.
not_available If we don't find Bierko, hundreds of thousands of innocent people will die here today.
not_available Let him go! He's given us what we want! Put your hands up! As for the data I sold to Bierko, it's something that I received from a contact from the Department of Defense.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Her name? Audrey Raines.
not_available You were lying to me.
not_available She sold me the information, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Apparently, she had a price.
not_available Chloe, I need you to do something for me right away.
not_available Check out Audrey Raines's activities in the last 18 months.
not_available Audrey? Why? 
not_available I'll explain later.
not_available I'm particularly interested in any unusual connection between her and Christopher Henderson or Walt Cummings.
not_available You think she has something to do with their conspiracy? I don't know what to think.
not_available Please do it quickly.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Yes, sir? I'm afraid I have to take you into custody.
not_available What? I don't understand.
not_available Am I being arrested? 
not_available Detained.
not_available On what grounds? Collette Stenger's been passing information to Bierko, information he apparently intends to use in his next attack.
not_available She claims she got the information from someone at D.O.D, and she named you as the source.
not_available She's lying.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available We already uncovered one mole in the White House today, Audrey.
not_available I have no choice.
not_available What kind of information did Stenger say I gave her? I've told you as much as I can at this point.
not_available Prep Ms.
not_available Raines for interrogation.
not_available Does Jack know that I'm being detained? Yes.
not_available He sanctioned it.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available Audrey Raines was my contact at the Department of Defense.
not_available You met with her faceto
not_available face? Yes.
not_available Good, then you'll be able to recognize her when you see her.
not_available Of course.
not_available She identified Ms.
not_available Raines from photographs on the way here.
not_available If you were lying to me, I'm gonna make this the worst day of your life.
not_available You understand? Put her in Holding.
not_available Burke's interrogation methods should only be used as a last resort.
not_available The situation warrants a more aggressive approach.
not_available Then do the same thing to Collette Stenger.
not_available Stenger is protected by an immunity agreement.
not_available We can't touch her unless the information she's provided turns out to be false; then we can nullify the agreement.
not_available So we can torture our own people, but we can't touch a criminal? I've known Audrey Raines for years.
not_available I trust her implicitly.
not_available So does everyone else.
not_available Maybe that's the problem.
not_available Bill, we don't have the luxury of time.
not_available Intel indicates that an attack is imminent within an hour.
not_available Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of Americans are at risk, and we just got information that Audrey Raines knows about it.
not_available Karen, the decision is yours.
not_available But any adverse consequences that result from insufficiently aggressive action taken now will come down hard on you.
not_available What is Agent Burke doing here? We're talking about authorizing the medical interrogation.
not_available On Audrey? 
not_available Yes.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available I'll handle the interrogation.
not_available I can't allow that.
not_available Karen, I brought this to you.
not_available I called it in.
not_available You can't pull me off of this now.
not_available Your emotional involvement with Ms.
not_available Raines is not exactly a secret, Jack.
not_available That has nothing to do with this.
not_available That's right.
not_available You always put the work first.
not_available You never let your feelings get involved.
not_available Is that what happened with Nina Myers? Nina Myers was a mistake I've never denied that but she was deep cover for years before I even met her.
not_available She fooled a lot of people for a long time, not just me.
not_available Well, maybe Audrey is fooling people, too.
not_available You might be right, Karen, but if I were you, I would think twice about who you're willing to invasively interrogate.
not_available Audrey Raines is the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense, James Heller, who happens to be her father! And if you were wrong, he's gonna eat you alive.
not_available At least let Jack talk to her for ten minutes first.
not_available She deserves that much.
not_available If she's guilty she doesn't deserve anything.
not_available That's the point.
not_available She hasn't been proven guilty.
not_available After she's been prepped, you can see her for ten minutes.
not_available But at the first sign you're less than objective, you're out.
not_available Understood.
not_available Thanks, Bill.
not_available I don't believe Audrey is guilty of anything, Jack.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available The one thing we do know is, Bierko is going to release the Sentox in the city sometime in the next hour.
not_available If Audrey knows anything that can help us find him, she needs to tell us now.
not_available Keep an eye on the traffic patrol.
not_available Bierko's gonna need to move those canisters.
not_available He's gonna need transportation.
not_available With the curfew in place, I might get lucky and pick up a trail.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, break it up! Break it up now! Gentlemen, I said, break it up! Take their uniforms and weapons.
not_available Now we have a police escort to the target, the curfew won't be a problem.
not_available Chloe, walk with me.
not_available You were doing background on Audrey? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What have you got? You're not going to like it.
not_available I found the connection between Walt Cummings and Audrey.
not_available What kind of a connection? They dealt with each other a few times the usual stuff between D.O.D.
not_available and the White House.
not_available But there is something else.
not_available What? Chloe, what? They both stayed at a place called the River Hotel in Pikesville, Maryland, last April.
not_available So? So, Pikesville isn't exactly a hot spot with top
not_available ranking federal officials.
not_available It wasn't a coincidence that they were there the same night.
not_available Chloe, what are you trying to say? They didn't just stay in the same hotel, but they stayed in the same room.
not_available How could you possibly know that? Because I e
not_available mailed photos of them to the manager.
not_available He recognized them both.
not_available He showed me phone bills, room service receipts.
not_available I can show you a few if you want.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I believe you.
not_available It doesn't mean she was part of their conspiracy, but it doesn't exactly look that good either.
not_available Make copies of everything you've got and put them in a folder for me.
not_available I will.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available My name is Shari Rothenberg.
not_available I work in Section Five downstairs.
not_available I know where Section Five is.
not_available Right.
not_available Uh, Mr.
not_available Buchanan told me to report to Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Is that you? You're gonna have to wait a second.
not_available Um, I'm here to replace Edgar.
not_available I understand he died in the attack.
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available Well, if he was a friend of yours, I'm sorry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He worked at Station Six.
not_available It's right there.
not_available Are you familiar with the Gavilan matrix analyzer? Yes, I am.
not_available Use it to make sure our databases are current.
not_available Some of them may have fallen behind in the past couple of hours.
not_available No problem.
not_available Jack.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Have you ever had contact with Collette Stenger? No.
not_available She says that you provided her with information from the D.O.D.
not_available I know.
not_available Bill told me.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available You know it.
not_available Jack, you're wasting time that we don't have.
not_available I had to ask CTU so that I could interrogate you.
not_available I have a job to do.
not_available If I don't do it, Burke will, and I promise you, you do not want to see him walk through that door.
not_available Fine.
not_available What kind of information did she say I gave her? She said you provided her with a structural schematic of Bierko's next target.
not_available What kind of structure? She didn't know.
not_available She just delivered the package.
not_available She claims that I gave her information, yet she can't tell you what that information is, and that's enough to make me a suspect?! Damn it, Audrey! You know what this nerve gas does? They are planning another attack.
not_available We will not ignore any leads.
not_available I have nothing to do with these terrorists.
not_available How did Collette Stenger get your name? I don't know.
not_available My father is the Secretary of Defense.
not_available I'm an easy target.
not_available Maybe she's trying to use him or embarrass him.
not_available Is he involved? Oh, Jack, you know him better than that.
not_available You worked with him.
not_available He would never do anything outside the law, and neither would I.
not_available The two men that we know are part of the conspiracy are Walt Cummings and Christopher Henderson.
not_available Have you had any contact with these men? Christopher Henderson.
not_available I have never heard I'd never heard of him before today and, um Walt Cummings I have met a couple of times, yes.
not_available Where? 
not_available Um, D.O.D.
not_available briefings.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yes, I'm sure.
not_available Open it.
not_available The River Hotel, Pikesville, last April.
not_available Yeah, I'm sorry.
not_available Um We happened to be there at the same time.
not_available We may have had a drink or two together.
not_available You weren't having drinks with him.
not_available You shared a room with him.
not_available You slept with him.
not_available Yes.
not_available I was still recovering from losing you, Jack.
not_available He, uh He had just separated from his wife, and I slept with him once and then I broke it off.
not_available Why'd you break it off? 
not_available Jack, please, it's complicated.
not_available Why did you break it off?! Because he wasn't you.
not_available Why did you lie to me when I asked you the first time? 'Cause I, I was I was afraid that you'd think less of me, that you wouldn't be able to forgive me.
not_available Because you slept with someone after you thought I was dead? Because I slept with someone who turned out to be a traitor, Jack.
not_available Is that the only time you spent with Cummings? Yes.
not_available Did he ever talk to you about a terrorist attack, nerve gas? No.
not_available He ever mention Christopher Henderson? No.
not_available Damn it, Audrey! Jack, I Jack! Tell me the truth! 
not_available I am telling you the t You've already lied to me once.
not_available You tell me what you know, or I promise you this will become very unpleasant.
not_available I'm telling you everything.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available Damn it, Audrey.
not_available Tell me the truth! Jack.
not_available I am telling you the truth, I swear.
not_available This is over! You understand? This is over! If you ask me, she broke him and not the other way around.
not_available Karen.
not_available He didn't push her hard enough, and you know it.
not_available He's protecting her.
not_available She's innocent.
not_available We have to be certain.
not_available I am certain.
not_available Jack is certain.
not_available Well, I'm not.
not_available Karen.
not_available Send Burke in.
not_available I have to do this, Bill.
not_available I can't waste any more time, and make sure that Jack doesn't interfere.
not_available Okay, I'll pass that on.
not_available Shari.
not_available That was the agent at Bierko's safe house.
not_available The place is empty.
not_available Forensics is still looking, but they don't expect to find much.
not_available Upload that information onto the subnets.
not_available Oh.
not_available Right.
not_available I checked your file.
not_available You're not qualified for Level Three work, and that is Level Three.
not_available I'm provisionally qualified.
not_available It's all in my supplemental file.
not_available Go ahead and check it if you want.
not_available All right, Shari.
not_available First mistake, I yank the provisional and you're out of here.
not_available What's with him? Two years ago we both worked in the San Francisco office.
not_available There was a sexual harassment thing.
not_available Miles? It was subtle at first, and then it got really bad.
not_available Finally filed a grievance.
not_available What happened? He got off with a warning.
not_available These things are really hard to prove.
not_available They said we didn't have enough evidence to go to trial.
not_available I can't get into any details.
not_available The file is sealed.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I don't need details.
not_available But I guess I'd better not make any mistakes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's going on? I'm sorry.
not_available This is out of my control.
not_available Karen wants to push Audrey a little harder.
not_available No, her interrogation is over.
not_available Jack, I'll try to stall her as long as I can.
not_available Jack, I have orders to take Miss Raines to Holding for further interrogation.
not_available I don't care about your orders.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Jack, stop it! Jack, don't make this any harder than it is.
not_available Bill, do something! Bill! Bill! 
not_available Hello.
not_available Mr.
not_available Henderson, it's Brennan.
not_available Is Wayne Palmer dead yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Explain.
not_available We rolled his car, but he survived and got away.
not_available It was sloppy work.
not_available We'll make it right.
not_available Well, you damn well better.
not_available You know what's at stake.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This is Wayne Palmer.
not_available At the tone, leave a message.
not_available Steve, has Wayne Palmer come through a checkpoint within the last half hour? Yeah, he was cleared through Checkpoint 6, 30 minutes ago.
not_available What, he's not here yet? No, he's not, and I can't reach him on his cell.
not_available If you're worried, I can send out an alert.
not_available No.
not_available Actually, he kind of wanted to keep his visit under the radar.
not_available I think I'm going to go out there and take a look myself, in case he had car trouble or something.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Keep this between us, would you? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You need to calm down, Jack, and remember who's in charge.
not_available Audrey Raines is innocent.
not_available She slept with a known conspirator and lied about it.
not_available That doesn't concern you? She slept with him once and lied about it because she was embarrassed.
not_available That hardly makes her part of this conspiracy.
not_available Why did Collette Stenger name her as the source? She must have gotten Audrey's name from Henderson.
not_available Why would Henderson want to implicate Audrey? Henderson doesn't want to implicate Audrey.
not_available He's coming after me.
not_available He's trying to make me lose focus.
not_available And he's trying to pull you off target.
not_available And he's done it.
not_available These plans must have been made some time ago, when Henderson had every reason to believe you were gonna be killed.
not_available Karen, listen to me.
not_available This is what I do for a living.
not_available And the first rule of engagement is that you have a contingency plan.
not_available And this is his, and it's working.
not_available You're getting ready to interrogate Audrey Raines when you should be interrogating Collette Stenger, because she still has information that we don't have! Stenger has immunity.
not_available She's being protected by a federal marshal.
not_available That's your doing, Jack.
not_available You made that deal! I know.
not_available But if I can prove that Collette Stenger is withholding information from us, that act alone negates her deal.
not_available I'll be able to start questioning her again.
not_available She will give me Henderson.
not_available And once I have Henderson, he will lead us to the nerve gas, and that's what we're supposed to be focused on! What are you suggesting we do, Jack? Let me and Chloe find proof that Collette Stenger is lying to us.
not_available If we don't, you lose nothing.
not_available But if we do, we can stop this thing from happening, I promise you.
not_available Karen, please.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available These matrix sweeps are partials only.
not_available Where's the rest of the data? I thought matrix data could be sent unfiltered.
not_available That's not protocol.
not_available I thought it was all right in house.
not_available Only if it's authorized.
not_available Who authorized it? I did.
not_available She did it under my authority.
not_available I take full responsibility.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Believe what you want.
not_available That would be sloppy, O'Brian.
not_available You don't work like that.
not_available She told you about my alleged sexual harassment, right? Well, she's lying.
not_available Listen No, you listen.
not_available There are 17 canisters of nerve gas about to be deployed somewhere in Los Angeles, and we're trying to find them.
not_available If you interrupt our work one more time, I'll file a complaint with Division.
not_available Then you'll see what protocol's all about.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Chloe, we need to help Audrey.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available How? We need to find the connection between Collette Stenger and Henderson.
not_available We found Collette's name on Henderson's computer.
not_available It's not enough.
not_available We need proof that they had direct contact, preferably more than once.
not_available You think Henderson gave Collette Audrey's name? I'm sure of it.
not_available I want you to use outside agencies, including foreign.
not_available Put it on a priority channel.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available We have an important delivery.
not_available There's no delivery scheduled.
not_available I'm gonna need to call this in.
not_available Stay out here and watch the perimeter.
not_available Who's in charge? I am.
not_available We need access to the control room.
not_available Can you take us there? What are you guys doing here? Can you take us to the control room? Yeah.
not_available It's that way.
not_available Good.
not_available Keep cooperating and no more of your friends will die.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Mikhail, take the canisters to the main distribution tank.
not_available Quickly! This is it.
not_available Sam, what's going on? 
not_available Ah, Sam I'm not an engineer, but I know enough, so you'd be wise not to try to deceive me.
not_available What we're doing here is very simple.
not_available We're going to release a certain substance so that it flows into your pipelines.
not_available What kind of substance? That's not your concern.
not_available But at the pressure which currently prevails in these pipes, the substance will react chemically with the gas and become inert.
not_available So I need the pressure reduced by about 50%.
not_available Sam, don't do it.
not_available Do you understand what I want? You want PSI cut by half.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And how long will it take? Could take an hour.
not_available You don't seem to care very much for your friends, do you, Sam? No, no, don't! I might be able to do it in 30 minutes.
not_available You have 15.
not_available Better get started.
not_available Don't move! Drop the gun.
not_available Now! Move away from it.
not_available Now get on your knees.
not_available Mr.
not_available Palmer.
not_available It's Aaron.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Aaron, what are you doing out here? I was looking for you, sir.
not_available So are some other people.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Ms.
not_available Raines, we know you conspired with Mr.
not_available Cummings.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Who else in the White House was involved? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You know, Ms.
not_available Raines.
not_available I don't have have any names.
not_available You're gonna give me a name I swear I don't know, I We don't have the time, Ms.
not_available Raines.
not_available Give me a name! I don't I swear.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Chloe, what have you got? I found some masked entries in Collette Stenger's cell phone.
not_available The decryption program 
not_available Come on, Chloe.
not_available Bottom line: Henderson placed eight cell phone calls to Collette Stenger within the past three months.
not_available Where's Collette Stenger now? 
not_available Holding Room 3.
not_available Bill, we have a connection between Henderson and Collette Stinger.
not_available She received eight calls from him that she didn't tell us about.
not_available That voids her agreement.
not_available It's off.
not_available That's for the president to decide.
not_available Call the president! You need a rescinding order to question her, Jack.
not_available Get him to back off of Audrey! Get me the president.
not_available What's your connection with Christopher Henderson? I have an immunity agreement signed by your president.
not_available She's right.
not_available She can't be questioned.
not_available We have proof that she withheld information.
not_available Her deal's been rescinded.
not_available The order's on its way.
not_available When it gets here, she's all yours.
not_available An innocent woman is being interrogated because of her.
not_available Look, I'm sorry, sir, but you have to go.
not_available We know you lied to us.
not_available We know that you did not get the schematics from Audrey Raines.
not_available Henderson told you to use her name in case you got in trouble, right? You do not want to try me.
not_available Yes.
not_available He tell you why? No.
not_available He's using you.
not_available He wanted you to get inside my head.
not_available It worked.
not_available Now I'm upset.
not_available You have three seconds to tell me where the target is, or I will kill you.
not_available Where's the target?! A natural gas distribution center.
not_available There are dozens of those in the city.
not_available Which one? I don't know.
not_available I swear.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't.
not_available Jack, what's going on? Bierko's targeting a natural gas distribution center, but we don't know which one.
not_available Natural gas? He can use it as a delivery system for the Sentox.
not_available He can get it into people's homes.
not_available I need you to get Chloe on it.
not_available We need to find out which one.
not_available Right.
not_available The rescinding order will be here in 15 minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available Give it to the marshal.
not_available He'll be looking for this, too.
not_available Please, no more.
not_available I'm begging you.
not_available Please.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available Please Please.
not_available I'm telling you the truth.
not_available You're bringing this on yourself.
not_available No! Stop it! Make him 
not_available This can end whenever Let her go! Shut it down now! Jack! You are finished in here.
not_available She is innocent.
not_available You can confirm it with Buchanan.
not_available I said you're finished.
not_available Get out! Audrey, are you all right? I don't know.
not_available It's over.
not_available I promise you, it's over for good.
not_available My God, what's happening to me? What's happening? Henderson set you up to get at me, to throw me off his trail.
not_available Come here.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Jack, the only thing that got me through this was knowing that you would come.
not_available I knew you would come.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available Chloe's got some information.
not_available Go.
not_available Jack? 
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Yep.
not_available Bill, I want you to send someone over from medical to Interrogation 1 to tend to Audrey Raines.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Okay.
not_available Our satellite covers only 60% of the distribution centers.
not_available If our target's not in that grouping, we're out of luck.
not_available Can we redirect any other satellite? I'm trying.
not_available Did you identify the distribution center that they're gonna hit? We're pulling in more satellites.
not_available Our analysts tell us once the Sentox hits the main tank, it goes right into the pipes, where it becomes impossible to stop.
not_available From there, it goes straight into people's homes.
not_available How many casualties are we talking about? The largest centers serve 90,000 people.
not_available We could have twice that many casualties.
not_available If our Intel is correct, we have 15 minutes.
not_available Okay, I'll prep a team with Curtis.
not_available We'll go airborne.
not_available We'll be ready as soon as you ID a target.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan? There may be a faster way.
not_available I was a chem.
not_available major at Cal Tech.
not_available Most toxins become inert under high pressure.
not_available The PSI would have to be lowered before the nerve gas was introduced.
not_available Chloe, can you monitor the pressure levels at the distribution centers? Yeah.
not_available I have citywide readings of them all.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Wilshire Gas Company.
not_available The PSI has dropped to 75% in the past ten minutes.
not_available We have to assume that's it.
not_available I'll tell Jack.
not_available Great work, Sherry.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Did you see the way his hand brushed across my shoulder as he walked by? What? That was wrong.
not_available He shouldn't have done that.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Get down! Get in the car! Chloe, what's the PSI level? PSI level is down to 57%.
not_available Another seven is all they need to deploy the Sentox.
not_available How long will that take? 
not_available Four, maybe five minutes.
not_available Jack, the PSI level can only be adjusted from the main control room.
not_available It's the large building in the center of the complex two floors down from the roof.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Okay, we'll insert here.
not_available We'll advance to the control room, locate and secure the canisters.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available The noise from the plant should cover our descent.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Good.
not_available Get back here.
not_available How much longer? A few more minutes.
not_available I can't lower the pressure any faster without risking a shutdown.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Do you have any heat signatures? Yes, but I can only scan from the exterior of the site.
not_available There are two guards patrolling the perimeter.
not_available I've given the pilot an approach vector to keep you from their line of sight.
not_available Maintain this position! Go! 
not_available CTU, the team's away.
not_available They're on the roof.
not_available The PSI level is down to 54%.
not_available CTU, we're inside.
not_available Jack, Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Silencers off.
not_available Bierko! He's moving! Cover me! Curtis, the Sentox is already in the system.
not_available Who's in charge here?! Listen to me.
not_available You have Sentox nerve gas running through your pipeline.
not_available Can you shut down the pumps? By the time we power down, gas will be in the main tanks, then it's out into the city.
not_available Where's the closest pipeline that feeds those tanks? Just out the door to your left.
not_available It'll have a red arrow on it.
not_available Give me the C4 and a timer, then get these people out of here.
not_available Jack, what are you doing? In order to deliver the Sentox, it had to mix with natural gas.
not_available If we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated.
not_available Bill, this is the last chance we've got to stop this threat.
not_available The Sentox has been in the system for one minute.
not_available You have 50 seconds before it gets out.
not_available Charge has been set.
not_available Curtis, are you clear? Just about.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Jack, are you clear? Jack? Jack, respond.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available Jack, you okay? Curtis, I got a visual on Bierko.
not_available Jack, you won't have time before the main tank explodes.
not_available Right now he's our only connection to Henderson.
not_available Jack! Bill, he's going in.
not_available Bierko! Jack, that's it.
not_available The main tanks are going.
not_available Get out!
