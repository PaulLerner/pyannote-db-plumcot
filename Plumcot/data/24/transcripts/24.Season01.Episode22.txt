
not_available Right now terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been targeted and people that I work with may be involved in both.
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer and today is the longest day of my life.
not_available No! No! And now, I'm proud to present the future President of the United States Senator David Palmer! Congratulations, David.
not_available Hey, we did it.
not_available You know, this is our victory.
not_available And when we started out they said the country wasn't ready.
not_available They said it couldn't be done.
not_available That it would never happen.
not_available Well, here we are.
not_available Still standing tall.
not_available And when we look back at this amazing time we can all say that we were a part of history.
not_available We can all say that we did our part to make this world a better place.
not_available And, God willing, our children and our children's children will reap the benefits of the seeds we sow right now.
not_available CTU.
not_available Myers.
not_available Nina, it's me.
not_available Jack, where are you? I'm with Andre and Victor Drazen.
not_available What do you mean? Where? Nina, just listen to me.
not_available I'm being held hostage.
not_available The reason I'm calling is Victor wants confirmation that his son Alexis is still alive.
not_available Well, he's in the hospital.
not_available I can try to get through to his room.
not_available Okay, do it.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Tony, get me the hospital.
not_available I need Alexis Drazen on line 2.
not_available Just spoke to the backup team.
not_available Drazen escaped.
not_available I want a net over that entire area.
not_available I want 1mile, 3
not_available mile and We know.
not_available We got Jack on the line.
not_available He's with Victor Drazen now.
not_available What? Nina, got Alexis Drazen.
not_available Transfer it.
not_available Who is this? Hold on.
not_available Alexie? Father.
not_available Where are you? Did you get out? Alexie, what happened? What have they done to you? You.
not_available You always said that I would get in trouble with women.
not_available You were right.
not_available Forgive me, Father I have failed you.
not_available You have not failed.
not_available You are alive, I am free.
not_available Free.
not_available Hold on, Alexie.
not_available We will be together soon.
not_available No, Papa, you go without me.
not_available I'm not going to make it.
not_available You will make it! Be strong! Tell me you could do this! Yeah, Papa.
not_available I have something to say to the rest of you.
not_available I am willing to trade the life of Jack Bauer for that of my son.
not_available Mr.
not_available Drazen, this is George Mason.
not_available I'm the acting head of the CTU but I don't have the authority to make that trade.
not_available If you do not have the authority, you are not the head of anything.
not_available Talk to your superiors.
not_available We will call back in 15 minutes.
not_available Be ready to respond without qualification.
not_available And let me remind you that when I was 10 points behind in the polls I told you I had a plan.
not_available That on this date we were going to celebrate, party nomination in hand.
not_available Well, promise delivered.
not_available This campaign has been an uphill battle.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm not going to be able to go to Dallas with David tomorrow.
not_available Why not? I committed to a National Youth Service Day event here in LA.
not_available That's okay, I can reschedule.
not_available No, Patty, I don't want you to reschedule.
not_available David and I could use a couple of days apart but I don't want him to feel alone, okay? Whatever you want.
not_available Because for us, doing the right thing is the only thing to do.
not_available You talked to Chappelle? Yeah.
not_available No trade.
not_available What? This whole Victor Drazen thing is a big embarrassment for them.
not_available If they do a trade, it's an admission he's alive.
not_available That the D.<br>O.<br>D.<br>'s been keeping him here secretly and on top of that, they let him escape.
not_available So they're just going to sacrifice Jack? He's like all the rest of us, expendable.
not_available Is that what you think? Doesn't matter what I think.
not_available I don't think he walks on water the way you do but I don't want to see him hung out to dry either.
not_available Nina, I tried.
not_available Without the trade, how are they going to locate Drazen? My guess is they won't even try.
not_available They'll let him out of the country and pick him up in Europe.
not_available If we do the trade, then we know where he is.
not_available You're preaching to the choir.
not_available That's what I just said to Chappelle.
not_available They don't want to draw attention to the situation.
not_available End of story.
not_available So, that's it? We just go back to work and let Jack die? What can I say? Nothing.
not_available Nina, shouldn't Kim be here by now? They just left the police station.
not_available I mean, she should be here soon.
not_available I never did hear what happened with her.
not_available She was arrested by mistake.
not_available Listen, Teri, Kim's fine.
not_available That's not the problem.
not_available What do you mean? What's going on? It's confirmed.
not_available Jack's been captured.
not_available He's being held hostage.
not_available We're doing everything we can to bring him back, but
not_available Wait.
not_available What do they want? It's hard to say.
not_available Well, tell me what you know.
not_available This guy Drazen wants to trade Jack for his son, Alexis, who we have.
not_available Then, he'll be okay, right? No.
not_available The government won't make the trade.
not_available What do you mean they won't trade? How are they going to get Jack back? They're not.
not_available Jack's on his own.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available There can be no flaws, and it must be done soon.
not_available I don't care how much it costs, how many men you need.
not_available We're out of here by midnight.
not_available Call me back.
not_available Let me know.
not_available There! My good, good friend.
not_available I never thought I would see you again.
not_available How is your family? Eager to see you.
not_available Soon.
not_available Is everything prepared? Yes.
not_available Please come in.
not_available Victor, I would like you to meet my daughter, Mila.
not_available Mila, right.
not_available Hello.
not_available How beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Just like your mother.
not_available Yeah, but she got my temper.
not_available No good.
not_available That is no good.
not_available We have some fresh clothes for you whenever you are ready.
not_available To you and your family.
not_available Would you like something to eat, Jack? No.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available How does letting a senior CTU agent die help keep Victor Drazen out of the news? I'm busy.
not_available Can Nina help you now? No.
not_available I'm talking to you right now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll call you right back, all right? You are not going to let my husband die.
not_available No one is going to let Jack die.
not_available We just can't go through with the trade right now.
not_available There's no difference.
not_available Without your help, he doesn't have a chance.
not_available With an ordinary agent, I'd agree with you.
not_available Jack has a Special Forces background.
not_available I've seen him do the impossible.
not_available Stop patronizing me.
not_available You've been doing it all night.
not_available Just tell me what you are prepared to do to help my husband.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll stop patronizing you.
not_available I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
not_available I'm going to call up Division and ask them to reconsider one more time.
not_available And they're going to say no.
not_available And that'll be the end of it.
not_available Anything else? Nina, I'm asking you, as someone who cares about Jack we cannot just stand by and watch him die.
not_available I know.
not_available I agree.
not_available I'm already doing something about it.
not_available What do you mean? What are you doing? I think there's someone who could help Jack.
not_available It's not exactly procedure, so I can't talk about it.
not_available You're just going to have to trust me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay? Patty.
not_available This is the lady you should be complimenting.
not_available We were just talking about you.
not_available Oh, really? Yes.
not_available They loved the speech tonight.
not_available Among other things, Patty's the brain trust behind most of my public addresses.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Nina Myers at CTU.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I have to take this.
not_available Sure.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available This is David Palmer.
not_available Senator, thank you for taking my call.
not_available What can I do for you, Ms.
not_available Myers? Jack's in trouble.
not_available He needs your help.
not_available What kind of trouble? There's no time to tell you everything.
not_available Let me just give you the headline.
not_available Victor Drazen is alive.
not_available What do you mean, he's alive? That's all we know.
not_available The U.<br>S.
not_available government held him prisoner until about an hour ago.
not_available Okay.
not_available What happened an hour ago? He escaped.
not_available He's taken Jack hostage.
not_available He's willing to trade Jack for his son Alexis.
not_available What's the DOD's response? They're refusing to get directly involved.
not_available Who knows you contacted me? No one.
not_available Who's actually talking to Drazen? George Mason.
not_available Tell me about him.
not_available Normally, he's by the book, but he's very ambitious and political.
not_available Okay.
not_available Look, I'm going to make a few calls first.
not_available Where can I reach Mason? Here at CTU.
not_available He's in Jack's office.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you, Senator.
not_available Are you sure? Okay.
not_available Tony.
not_available What's up? Kim's car was hit.
not_available Two cops are down.
not_available She was taken.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Was there any communication? Any witnesses? They're working it up now.
not_available All right, let me know what you find.
not_available Tony, I'm going to need to talk to you in a few minutes.
not_available Tony? 
not_available What? Are you all right? No.
not_available We've got a problem.
not_available Any word on Kim? 
not_available I was just about to check.
not_available She should be here any minute, right? Yeah.
not_available Teri, I'm sorry.
not_available Do you mind waiting in the conference room? Sure.
not_available What's going on? They grabbed Kim again.
not_available What? It must have been Drazen.
not_available The patrol car she was riding in was hit.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Are you going to tell her? Mason.
not_available I have Senator Palmer on the line for you.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Hello.
not_available Senator Palmer, this is George Mason.
not_available It's an honor to speak to you.
not_available I want you to reverse your orders on the Bauerfor
not_available Drazen trade.
not_available I'm not sure how much information you have about this but this is agency business.
not_available With all due respect, it doesn't fall under the Senate's purview.
not_available As you know, your entire agency falls under Presidential purview.
not_available And in nine months, I will be in that office.
not_available I'm not sure if that's meant to tempt or threaten me.
not_available It doesn't matter either way.
not_available I don't have the authority to pull the trigger on this one.
not_available From what I'm told, Mr.
not_available Mason that authority is something you'd like to have.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? Act on your own prerogative, go through with the trade.
not_available You'll be reprimanded, possibly even demoted.
not_available So far it sounds great.
not_available Within the first month of my term I will instate you in a high
not_available level position in Washington.
not_available You'll bypass five years of middle management.
not_available And if you don't get elected? That won't happen.
not_available Think about it, George.
not_available Transportation's been arranged.
not_available There were problems with last
not_available minute changes? It's going to cost more.
not_available It's going to cost more.
not_available How much? $200,000.
not_available You should try, Jack, the borek.
not_available It is wonderful.
not_available Do you need anything else? No.
not_available Everything is perfect.
not_available My father told me to take good care of you.
not_available The service was impeccable.
not_available And my compliments to the chef.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It was my mother's recipe.
not_available Drop the weapons! Drop the weapons! Put your weapons down! Put your weapons down, or I'll cut her throat! Drop the weapons! Put them down.
not_available You, too, Victor! Of course.
not_available Drop the weapon! You son of a bitch! One more death for you to atone for, Jack.
not_available How could you do this? What happened? Call CTU now.
not_available Tell them I want your brother Alexis here now! Cuff his hands behind his back.
not_available Keep her father away from here! You're supposed to be watching him! What am I paying you for? Where's Teri? She's in the conference room.
not_available Mason.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mason, what have you decided? Mr.
not_available Mason? We're going to do the swap on our terms.
not_available That's an interesting dream.
not_available The swap will take place exactly 30 minutes from now.
not_available The address is 2127 Grand Avenue.
not_available A green SUV will be waiting.
not_available Place my brother inside the vehicle.
not_available What about Jack? When my brother's in position, I'll direct you to Bauer.
not_available You have 29 minutes.
not_available I got it.
not_available 2127 Grand Avenue.
not_available It's a repair garage.
not_available Tell Chris Porterfield at LAPD we'll be taking over the streets in that area for the next two hours.
not_available Where are you going? To the hospital to get Alexis.
not_available He just got stabbed in the stomach today.
not_available They won't let him out.
not_available They're going to have to.
not_available No, don't worry.
not_available My name's not going to be even close to this.
not_available This conversation has to end right here between us.
not_available I agree.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Look, I've got to get back.
not_available We're clear? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available There you are.
not_available David, where have you been? I had to make some calls.
not_available Just in case you haven't noticed, everyone is here to see you.
not_available You need to make an impression, not phone calls.
not_available I know what I have to do.
not_available Do you really? Don't talk down to me, Sherry, I don't like it.
not_available I hope this weakness you've shown today is because you missed a night's sleep and you'll be back on your game tomorrow.
not_available Otherwise, we will be buried before this election even happens.
not_available Steven! No, stay.
not_available I'll be over.
not_available Get to work.
not_available Senator, the Wall Street Journal had a couple of questions for you.
not_available I put together some of your past quotes, to help you with it.
not_available I hope that's all right.
not_available Sure.
not_available Don't you look gorgeous tonight.
not_available You've seen this before.
not_available It's not just the dress.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Patty, I've been thinking.
not_available Since this incident with Keith is out in the open it's going to shift the focus of every interview, every press conference.
not_available I've already started a Qand
not_available A of all the questions to expect over the next few of days.
not_available Did you talk to Mike about this? Not yet.
not_available I need a little bit more time to prepare.
not_available I'd really like to see whatever you have so far.
not_available Sure.
not_available Whenever you want.
not_available How about now? Now? Yeah.
not_available Everybody seems to be having a good time.
not_available There's an open bar, and I doubt anyone will even notice that I'm gone.
not_available I doubt that that's true.
not_available In any event, I could use some quiet time.
not_available You stay here.
not_available Just tell me where your notes are.
not_available If you don't mind, I'd rather walk you through it.
not_available It would make more sense to you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why don't you meet me upstairs in, say, five minutes? Sure.
not_available My dear friend, it's not what you think.
not_available I have lost my wife and daughter.
not_available And you, both of your brothers and now Mila.
not_available This is what our enemies have done to us.
not_available He would have killed her, and not in a merciful way.
not_available How could you do this? Murderer.
not_available You killed my daughter.
not_available You killed my daughter! You murderer! We have to get out of here.
not_available Kim! Get him in the van.
not_available Get this place cleaned out! Nina, what's happening? Will they help Jack? Yes.
not_available They're going to make the trade.
not_available That's good, isn't it? Do you think he'll be safe? I think so.
not_available Victor wants his son back, so I don't think he'll pull anything.
not_available Thank God.
not_available And when's this going to happen? Mason's already left to pick up Alexis.
not_available That's so good.
not_available I can hardly wait for this to be over.
not_available I think when Jack and Kim arrive I'm just about to collapse in a big heap.
not_available Do you need anything else? Actually, there is one thing.
not_available I know Kim's on her way here but it would make me feel better to speak to her on the phone.
not_available Is there any way that you could patch me through to the police car? We were so busy tracking Jack, I didn't have a chance to check on them.
not_available Let me see if that's possible.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nina I know it's been a really long day for you, too and I guess I want you to know how much I appreciate your being up
not_available front with me about everything.
not_available Sure.
not_available I couldn't tell her.
not_available I just couldn't, after everything she's been through.
not_available I understand.
not_available You okay? I just feel like I'm not doing my job.
not_available There's nothing wrong with the way you're doing your job, okay? I mean, ultimately, we're here to try to help people, right? I don't know anybody who does that better than you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available You have to let my daughter go.
not_available She's got nothing to do with this.
not_available You want me to do something for you, I'll do it, but let my daughter go.
not_available I'm not
not_available After what you've done I should kill you both right now! Don't test me! You're not thinking this through, Andre.
not_available You have a chance to escape with your brother and your father alive.
not_available You start killing innocents, they'll never
not_available Enough! Your best tactic right now, Mr.
not_available Bauer, is to be quiet and let my father rest! Okay.
not_available All I care about with Ferragamo is that the public knows in no uncertain terms, that Carl and the Latham Group were acting outside of our influence.
not_available No.
not_available They will.
not_available Mike has already started setting up interviews with major papers.
not_available He's clearing up some points with your attorney and by the morning you should be able to speak freely.
not_available When did you have time to do all this? In the last couple of hours.
not_available You wrote two speeches for me today.
not_available If I don't help you get into the White House, I'm out of a job.
not_available Would you care for a glass of champagne? 
not_available Sure.
not_available When do you find time for a life? This is my life.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I mean a boyfriend.
not_available Friends.
not_available I know, I should get out more.
not_available Yeah, you should.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Cheers.
not_available What are we drinking to? To taking five minutes off, starting now.
not_available Hear, hear.
not_available Hear, hear.
not_available So, you and Sherry were childhood sweethearts? That's right.
not_available There's never been anyone else? I'm running for President, Patty.
not_available I can't answer that.
not_available Come on.
not_available Are you flirting with me? I don't know.
not_available I think I might be.
not_available This is good.
not_available Tell Mike I want to meet with him on this first thing in the morning.
not_available I want you there.
not_available Call Everly.
not_available Someone from legal should be there.
not_available Done.
not_available And, it wouldn't hurt to put in a little more face time downstairs.
not_available I think you might be right.
not_available Shall we? Yes.
not_available Wait here, Father.
not_available If your people deliver my brother as promised, you'll live.
not_available If not, then you'll die here.
not_available A sniper rifle is currently aiming at you.
not_available They await my instructions.
not_available What about my daughter? You'll hear from us when this is over, if you make it that far.
not_available And to dissuade you from wasting valuable time trying to trace I've prepared a scrambled phone.
not_available What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Not yet.
not_available What do you want me to do? Senator! 
not_available Hey, John, thanks for coming.
not_available Hey, Michael, thanks for coming.
not_available Look at you! Don't you look nice.
not_available Sir.
not_available Hey, how are you? There you are.
not_available I'd like for you to meet Doctors Bryan Chasin and Darrell Maines from UCLA.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available You're the gentlemen doing such wonderful work in AlDS research.
not_available Sweetheart, I need to look after something.
not_available That'll be fine.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available So, what isn't the government doing for you that we could fix next term? Patty? Hi.
not_available You were upstairs with David, weren't you? Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I did what you told me.
not_available And? I think it's working.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Palmer, I'm not sure where all this is going.
not_available All you need to know is that this is for his own good and for the good of his campaign.
not_available What's the problem, Patty? I thought you liked David.
not_available This shouldn't be a tough assignment.
not_available I do like him.
not_available It's just hard for me to deceive him like this.
not_available I understand your hesitation.
not_available But I know my husband better than anybody and he needs someone like you right now.
not_available But it's going to lead to other things, Mrs.
not_available Palmer.
not_available We'll just deal with that when the time comes.
not_available Cherries.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Everyone in position.
not_available Okay, we're here.
not_available Stay outside the perimeter.
not_available Let's just get in and get out.
not_available Here's Alexis.
not_available Where's Jack? What's wrong with him? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available Alexis, are you all right? Yes? 
not_available Alexis is hurt.
not_available How badly? 
not_available Worse than we thought.
not_available He's fine.
not_available He'll need a doctor.
not_available I'll have one there when you arrive.
not_available Go.
not_available What are we doing here? If you don't follow us, we'll give you Jack's location.
not_available That's unacceptable.
not_available We need to know where Jack is now.
not_available Hold it right there! Move to second position.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available Are you going to shoot me? Maybe you should have taken a few more English lessons.
not_available "Trade" means we get something, too.
not_available I want Jack now, or you're all coming back with us.
not_available We have Jack's daughter.
not_available You must know that by now.
not_available So, what are you saying? We get Jack and his daughter? My English is clear.
not_available You're going to get back Jack as discussed.
not_available What about the daughter? 
not_available It's not my concern.
not_available I need to talk to Drazen.
not_available If you keep holding me here, I can't return Alexis to his father.
not_available We're on a schedule, remember? All right, move back to the perimeter.
not_available We're going to have to let them go.
not_available We'll be waiting to hear from you.
not_available Nina, do you copy? Yeah.
not_available I have him.
not_available As soon as we get Jack, we'll take them down.
not_available Okay, we're standing by.
not_available Damn it! What's wrong? They found the tracker.
not_available We lost them.
not_available Yeah? Just south of the platform, there's a parked car.
not_available If you want to see Kim alive, talk to no one get into it and head towards Century City.
not_available Wait, wait!
