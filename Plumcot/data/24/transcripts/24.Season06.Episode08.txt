
not_available Call the cabinet in for a session.
not_available We are ramping up.
not_available Congratulations, Tom, it's an excellent plan.
not_available It's time someone stood up to these people.
not_available Thank you very much, Mr Vice President.
not_available The American Muslim community is our best line of defence against these terrorists.
not_available Your plan would only hinder the efforts of law enforcement to stop Fayed.
not_available I remain convinced that implementing this plan would be a terrible mistake.
not_available a conversation between McCarthy and Fayed.
not_available McCarthy's found another engineer to arm the four nukes.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It's Morris.
not_available Morris, it's a setup.
not_available The engineer McCarthy's looking for is you.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available We'll be waiting.
not_available With my money.
not_available You'll get paid when I have what I want.
not_available I'm just delivering him.
not_available You'll have to make him cooperate.
not_available How do I find McCarthy? 
not_available Four ccs.
not_available His vitals are spiking across the line.
not_available Four ccs! 
not_available Jack, don't! This has nothing to do with McCarthy.
not_available It has to do with Palmer.
not_available David Palmer? I gave the order for his assassination.
not_available He was responsible for Palmer's assassination.
not_available He directed the conspiracy.
not_available He was trying to protect my father's company.
not_available You told him about Palmer.
not_available I had to make him think I cracked.
not_available But I kept you out of it.
not_available Dad, stick to the plan.
not_available Sometimes you have to make adjustments.
not_available My son's had a seizure! If you people killed my son, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
not_available I'm en route to the ambush site.
not_available Which direction did they take Morris? I'm bringing it up.
not_available What are they gonna do to him? They have to keep him alive to make the bombs operational.
not_available That means we've got time.
not_available Remain calm and pull up the satellite now.
not_available The server's not responding.
not_available I know what I'm doing.
not_available You confirmed this with the field team? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Jack's on line one.
not_available It's Bill.
not_available We just got word from the field team at your brother's house.
not_available Graem's dead, Jack.
not_available What happened? 
not_available We'll know more after an autopsy.
not_available All signs point to cardiac arrest.
not_available Because of the interrogation? 
not_available The medic on site believes that was a factor.
not_available Does my father know? 
not_available Yes, he was there.
not_available Your sisterin
not_available law and nephew were en route to CTU when it happened.
not_available I'd appreciate it if you'd break the news to them.
not_available Of course.
not_available Sir? 
not_available Stand by.
not_available Chloe's starting to screw up.
not_available She's worried about Morris.
not_available I think she's losing it.
not_available Chloe, do we have access to the uplink yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available I know what you're feeling.
not_available If there's a problem Get away! The only problem is people bothering me when I'm trying to do my job.
not_available Give up the post to Milo.
not_available Leave me alone.
not_available I can do this.
not_available Now.
not_available Fine.
not_available Jack, I've relieved Chloe.
not_available She's too distraught.
not_available You're on with Milo.
not_available Jack, just give me a second.
not_available I got McCarthy on satellite 13 minutes ago abducting Morris in a silver Maserati at the corner of Central and 3rd.
not_available I'm tracking them.
not_available Right now McCarthy's at Adams and 13th heading west.
not_available We should have a visual in a few minutes.
not_available How long will it take the TAC teams to intercept McCarthy? I don't know.
not_available We'll get back to you.
not_available Where are we taking him? Fayed will call soon.
not_available Just relax and drive.
not_available I am relaxed.
not_available I just wanna get this over with.
not_available It will never be over.
not_available CTU knows who you are.
not_available They're looking for you.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Is that possible? He's bluffing.
not_available So you're not Darren McCarthy, arms dealer, subcontracted by BXJ Technologies? CTU intercepted a transmission about Fayed hiring you to do this.
not_available I said shut up! 
not_available Fine.
not_available We'll hand him over to Fayed as planned.
not_available If I'm already a marked man, 
not_available I might as well get paid for it.
not_available What about me? He didn't say they know about you.
not_available And anyway, I'll take care of you, like always.
not_available A chopper.
not_available That's a chopper.
not_available I got him.
not_available We got a visual.
not_available Turn left.
not_available Why? Just do what I say.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Swing back.
not_available They just took off.
not_available They must've spotted us.
not_available All right, I got them turning north onto Anders.
not_available Go around them.
not_available No! Go around them! I can't! Just do it! 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Go left.
not_available Are they still there? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Turn there.
not_available We got a problem.
not_available They're headed to the 110 interchange.
not_available We lost 'em.
not_available Does Caltrans have cameras covering that area? Nothing.
not_available The TAC team is still five minutes away.
not_available Captain, put me down now.
not_available Do you know what this is about? Fayed, who you're taking me to, is the terrorist who set off the bomb in Valencia.
not_available He has four more bombs, but he needs me to make them work so that he can kill tens of thousands of innocent people.
not_available And all you have to do to stop that from happening is to uncuff me.
not_available McCarthy's right.
not_available CTU doesn't know you exist.
not_available For the love of God, all of those people's lives are on you.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Move it, move it.
not_available This way.
not_available Can I get my luggage? Forget about the luggage! Come on.
not_available You did not tell me this was about nuclear bombs.
not_available What this is about is about seven million dollars.
not_available Now get in the truck! 
not_available Pressman.
not_available They must've switched vehicles.
not_available They could've merged onto any of six local roads or highways.
not_available We can't track them without knowing the car.
not_available Dammit, Milo! They could be anywhere.
not_available Just find them and get back to me.
not_available Head south.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hello? I have a new place to meet.
not_available Are you certain you're not being followed? Yeah.
not_available What's the address? You got my money? 
not_available Yes.
not_available OK, turn on the GPS.
not_available Apartment 621, all right? Don't forget it.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available OK, good.
not_available It's not too far.
not_available Yes, yes! Thank God.
not_available A bit excessive, but you did the right thing.
not_available I've got to contact CTU 
not_available Shut up! Shut up! Fayed wants you alive and whatever shape you're in beyond that is up to you.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I am making seven million dollars.
not_available And I can spend it without having to worry about CTU.
not_available Like you said, they don't know I exist.
not_available Listen, I know you think I'm wrong and that I blindsided you by not backing your proposals.
not_available Correct on both counts, sir.
not_available Tom, I have always valued your counsel.
not_available Ever since you showed up at my home and convinced me to run, spearheaded my campaign I mean, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here.
not_available But I hope I can still count on you to help me implement my policies.
not_available Excuse me, Mr President, the plane carrying Hamri Al
not_available Assad has landed at Andrews Air Force Base.
not_available He'll be here soon.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We'll talk later? Mr Lennox? Everything's OK.
not_available We're fine in here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What happened? The presidentjust rejected every one of my proposals right there in front of the cabinet.
not_available Not only has he changed his mind on the internment plan, he is rolling back on the detention facilities already in place.
not_available I thought he was on board.
not_available Well, so did I! Now he's putting forth his own agenda to appease the Muslim population.
not_available He's hoping they'll help find the nuclear weapons? That's it! That's it! And all he will succeed in doing is to prove to the terrorists that he does not have the stomach to do what is necessary and inevitable! OK, then you need to use your influence to change his mind.
not_available My My influence? You don't get it, do you, Reed? I have no influence! Not here.
not_available Not in this administration.
not_available No, I'm resigning.
not_available Sir, that would be a terrible mistake.
not_available My mistake was to believe that Wayne Palmer has the courage and the vision to fill this office.
not_available Clearly, I overestimated him.
not_available He is certainly not his brother.
not_available Which makes it all the more important that you stay.
not_available You have the support of many people here, the least of which is the vice president.
not_available Unfortunately, the vice president is not the one in power.
not_available And this country is being led to slaughter by the man who is.
not_available No.
not_available Unh
not_available unh.
not_available Unh
not_available unh.
not_available I cannot in good conscience be party to this.
not_available I can't.
not_available This is a terrible mistake.
not_available I can't talk about this any further.
not_available Go now and draft my letter of resignation and bring it back to me now for me to sign.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's Reed.
not_available Palmerjust shot down the Lennox plan in a cabinet meeting, rejecting every initiative.
not_available Did you hear what I said? 
not_available I heard.
not_available We have to move ahead with what we talked about.
not_available I realise it's extreme, but I don't see any alternative.
not_available Do you? No, but there's a problem.
not_available Tom Lennox is resigning.
not_available When? 
not_available As soon as I write his letter of resignation.
not_available Carson, if he goes, I lose my job and I lose my access.
not_available Our plan is contingent on your proximity to the president.
not_available We need you in place.
not_available I know.
not_available I am very well aware of that, but Tom Lennox is determined to quit.
not_available He might reconsider if he knew what was coming.
not_available I suppose I could feel him out.
not_available Then do it.
not_available Carefully.
not_available We have to protect ourselves.
not_available Anything come up on Caltrans? Without knowing what car he switched into, it'll take hours to go through the frame grabs.
not_available Stay on it.
not_available Right now it's all we've got.
not_available Mrs Bauer? 
not_available Yes? I'm Bill Buchanan, Director of Operations.
not_available You must be Josh.
not_available May I speak with you a moment, privately? 
not_available Um It's OK, Mom.
not_available OK.
not_available What is it? I'm very sorry to have to tell you this.
not_available Your husband is dead.
not_available How? 
not_available He appears to have suffered a heart attack.
not_available What did Jack do to him? 
not_available There'll be a thorough investigation.
not_available Your fatherin
not_available law is accompanying Graem's body for an autopsy.
not_available Unless you have an objection? 
not_available No.
not_available I have to tell my son.
not_available Of course.
not_available Josh.
not_available Your mother wants to speak with you.
not_available What? No.
not_available No.
not_available Pressman.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Let me speak to Buchanan.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Jack's on the line.
not_available Jack.
not_available We found McCarthy's body less than three blocks from the interchange.
not_available We intercepted a call from LAPD.
not_available The witness said the shooter was a female.
not_available Left with a male fitting Morris's description in a pickup.
not_available Did the witness get a license plate? 
not_available No.
not_available But McCarthy received a call just about five minutes ago.
not_available The caller ID is blocked.
not_available I need to trace the source of the call.
not_available You think it came from Fayed? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll give it to Milo when you upload the data.
not_available It's on its way.
not_available OK, knock.
not_available What do you want? I'm Darren McCarthy's associate.
not_available I have your package.
not_available Who are you? Where's McCarthy? He's waiting to hear from me.
not_available If he doesn't get the money, he gives you up.
not_available This is the engineer? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available I'm just a data analyst.
not_available You have the wrong man.
not_available Look.
not_available I brought you what you want.
not_available Just give me the money and I'll go.
not_available You'll get your money when this man completes his task.
not_available You work at CTU? So you know I have four nuclear suitcase bombs in my possession.
not_available These bombs need to be reprogrammed before I can use them.
not_available You are here to create a device that will allow me to do so.
not_available Not bloody likely, mate.
not_available You're going to modify this so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available What's happening with the phone trace? 
not_available Milo's working on it.
not_available Why is it taking so long? 
not_available Checking into it now.
not_available Milo, what's your status? 
not_available The call was from a land line.
not_available The number was routed through a dozen servers and they keep cycling back on it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Are you gonna be able to do this? Milo let me try.
not_available I know I screwed up earlier.
not_available I wasn't thinking clearly.
not_available But let me try this.
not_available I can do it.
not_available The number strains are caught in the loop matrix.
not_available Did you run a Satcom overlay filter? It only works on cellto
not_available cell communications.
not_available This was from a hard line.
not_available NSA recently started using satellite carrier systems as a backup for all phone traffic.
not_available I just have to reconfigure the embedded decryption program to Got it.
not_available That's it.
not_available The call was from an apartment building Copy, Jack? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do we know which apartment? No way to tell.
not_available They tapped into the building's trunk line.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Have Tactical meet us.
not_available Tell 'em to set up a perimeter.
not_available Stay out of sight.
not_available Understood.
not_available Good work, Milo.
not_available Sir, it wasn't me.
not_available If you think she's ready, bring her back in.
not_available Mr Al
not_available Assad, right this way.
not_available We've checked out your background and despite my understandable scepticism, I do believe you want negotiated peace.
not_available On my own terms, yes.
not_available Let's table your terms for the time being while we discuss mine.
not_available My country, sir, has suffered a nuclear attack by the same terrorists who used to follow you.
not_available Thousands of innocent Americans are dead or dying as we speak.
not_available I am aware of the tragedy in California, Mr President.
not_available I was there.
not_available Then you understand that if Fayed detonates any more nuclear weapons on US soil, there will be no chance whatsoever for a peace agreement.
not_available The American people are demanding that we strike back.
not_available And notjust at organisations such as yours, but at the governments that support them.
not_available Ifjust one more nuke goes off one more 
not_available we won't have a choice.
not_available You understand me? We're talking about war.
not_available You don't have to tell me what is at stake.
not_available But I still don't understand what you want from me.
not_available I'd like you to appear on television and make a public address to the world.
not_available Declare your intentions for peace and appeal to members of Islamic communities to come forward with any information regarding Fayed.
not_available You flatter me if you think I hold sway over all Islam.
not_available No, sir, not all.
not_available Just the extremists who share your hatred of the west.
not_available I certainly can't reach out to them for help.
not_available I know you can.
not_available But perception is everything, Mr President.
not_available So I must present my agenda to own my people in my own time, not by appearing on American TV from the White House! Fayed already called me a traitor.
not_available Many others will follow him if there is a suspicion I am an American puppet! Not a puppet, a partner.
not_available At least when it comes to finding these nuclear weapons.
not_available That is what we have to be for your peace initiative to have a chance to work, so get used to it.
not_available Between you and me, I don't give a damn how and when you wanted to present your agenda.
not_available The time is now.
not_available You wanna lead this peace initiative, then lead.
not_available Who's in command? 
not_available Agent Turner.
not_available What's the status of your perimeter? 
not_available It's in place.
not_available Plain
not_available clothes agents are covering the exits.
not_available Three TAC teams are ready to move in on your command.
not_available Is Fayed in the building? Morris O'Brian entered the building with a woman less than 20 minutes ago.
not_available We assume the woman is the one your witness saw shoot McCarthy.
not_available We don't know what apartment or floor they're on.
not_available CTU is patched in and awaiting your word.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bill, it's Jack.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available Yes, go ahead.
not_available I'm in the staging area.
not_available We have confirmation Morris is inside.
not_available We have no confirmation on Fayed.
not_available There are no cameras.
not_available Do you have infrared satellite? We can't get a live feed.
not_available We have a satellite uploading images at five
not_available minute intervals.
not_available Latest scan shows 215 people spread out over six floors and 112 apartments.
not_available It'll take too long to go room by room.
not_available We'll have to find another way to ID them.
not_available Is it on the city's emergency services grid? Yes, Jack.
not_available All buildings over ten units are required to.
not_available It's good to have you back.
not_available Get into their system and trigger a fire alarm.
not_available We have to get past their login screens.
not_available Tell me when you're ready.
not_available Agent.
not_available Please stop.
not_available Please, just stop.
not_available Indicate you will do what I've asked and it will stop.
not_available People are leaving the building.
not_available If there really is a fire, what do we do? There's no fire.
not_available CTU knows we're here.
not_available I really need to get out of here.
not_available Shut up! Up against the wall.
not_available Your time is up! I will use this all over your body until you die of shock or blood loss.
not_available Then I will just find someone else to do what I need.
not_available Do you understand? Look, please, I don't care about the money.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available Just let me get out of here, please.
not_available So, you'd give up the seven million, huh? 
not_available Yes.
not_available OK.
not_available Stop! Stop! I'll do it.
not_available Come in.
not_available This memo says Palmer's arranging for Assad to make a televised statement? I heard.
not_available Not only are we providing free air time to a mass murderer and enemy of democracy, we are proving terrorism works.
not_available Do you have my letter of resignation? 
not_available No, sir, I don't.
not_available Why not? You can't resign while this country is being brought to the brink of a nuclear holocaust by a weak, misguided president.
not_available Dammit, Reed, I explained.
not_available I cannot get the president to budge on policy.
not_available There's nothing I can do about this.
not_available What if I told you that the climate could change.
not_available What does that even mean, the climate? I'm just saying that there are people who believe, like you, more aggressive steps need to be taken to crack down on terrorism at home and abroad.
not_available And that a change in leadership is imperative to ensure this nation's security.
not_available Um Who? Excuse me, sir? Who are these like
not_available minded people we're talking about? Well, I'm just speaking abstractly.
not_available But you'd have to agree that your plan would have all the support it needed if the vice president were the man occupying the Oval Office.
not_available Wait.
not_available Now, I may dislike the president's current course of action.
not_available I hardly think it warrants his removal.
not_available I'm not talking about holding hearings.
not_available Something more immediate would have to happen.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You can't be intimating what I think you are.
not_available I'm not intimating anything.
not_available I'm just simply musing.
not_available Careful.
not_available That kind of musing can get you thrown into prison for treason.
not_available Well, I'm sorry, sir, that you've misunderstood me.
not_available Yeah, I certainly hope so, for your sake.
not_available All right, I think you have a letter to draft for me.
not_available You need to keep a safe distance away from the building.
not_available Move across the street for your own safety.
not_available Move away from the building.
not_available Anything from your men on the ground? They've looked at everyone who's exited.
not_available There's no sign of Fayed or O'Brian.
not_available If they were inside when the alarm went off, they still are.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We're mirroring the latest infrared to your screen.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I've got it.
not_available I'm looking at it now.
not_available Three people are left on the second, fourth and sixth floors.
not_available Chloe, who's renting those apartments? Cross
not_available referencing building schematics with phone company and police records now.
not_available A woman on the second floor is handicapped.
not_available She probably didn't leave cos she can't.
not_available The other two are occupied by single males.
not_available The man on the fourth has been arrested for distribution of narcotics.
not_available Fayed wouldn't use anyone with a record to set up a safe house.
not_available They're on the sixth floor.
not_available Get your men ready.
not_available Moving in.
not_available Let's go! How much longer? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available This is a few minutes' work for an advanced programmer.
not_available You're stalling.
not_available I am not.
not_available It'll be ready in a minute.
not_available Everybody seems to have evacuated.
not_available Which is how they intend to find us.
not_available At this point, it's only a question of time.
not_available Go.
not_available It's done? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Bring it.
not_available You have the bombs here? 
not_available Just one.
not_available Let's see if you did your work correctly.
not_available Arm it.
not_available Arm it! Very good.
not_available Kill him.
not_available Please, I did what you asked, didn't I? Get up! Put down your weapons! Stay covered.
not_available Stay covered.
not_available Now.
not_available All agents sound off! Clear! 
not_available Clear! We took a head count of the bodies.
not_available One hostile is missing.
not_available We haven't found Fayed.
not_available It's clear, sir.
not_available Have your men maintain the search for Fayed and ID every exit.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's his status? He's unconscious but alive.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Morris has been injured but he's alive.
not_available Mr Bauer, you need to see this.
not_available CTU, this is Bauer.
not_available We got a problem.
not_available Be careful.
not_available The bomb has a fail
not_available safe device preventing forced entry.
not_available I have two small metal plates slowly converging on each other.
not_available Those are triggers.
not_available If they touch, an electric charge will detonate.
not_available The nuke will explode.
not_available How far apart are they? 
not_available About three inches.
not_available OK, that gives us only about three minutes.
not_available There's a small metal box to the right of it.
not_available Carefully unscrew the top of it.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We know how Fayed got out.
not_available They opened a wall in a closet to get to the ventilation system.
not_available Fayed could get to the basement and the sewer tunnels.
not_available Did you set up a perimeter? 
not_available Yes, but we believe Fayed's already gone.
not_available Witnesses saw a helicopter take off a few minutes ago.
not_available It looked like a medical evac chopper so it got through our net.
not_available Dammit.
not_available The top's off.
not_available We are running out of time.
not_available Under the gears are four wires.
not_available Short
not_available circuit any two.
not_available It'll stop the left gear from rotating.
not_available Access the dipswitches underneath to open the case and manually stop the trigger.
not_available The left gear stopped.
not_available The dipswitches are in the "up" position.
not_available What's next? 
not_available Um Switch three and four to "down".
not_available The case didn't open.
not_available It didn't? That's what I said! 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Chloe, we are almost out of time.
not_available OK, I have an updated schematic.
not_available It wasn't switches three and four.
not_available Push four and five to "down" and the cover will open.
not_available Are you sure? I'm about as sure as I'm going to be before this bomb goes off.
not_available It's done.
not_available The bomb is disarmed.
not_available Tell your men the bomb's deactivated.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's not over.
not_available What are you talking about? The reprogramming device Fayed had me build for him 
not_available if it's not here, it means he took it with him.
not_available And with it, he can activate the other bombs he has any time he wants.
not_available You gave him something that worked?! 
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available CTU, did you copy that? 
not_available We got it.
not_available Alert the president immediately.
not_available Organise two teams to search the apartment and around the building.
not_available O'Brian will tell you what you're looking for.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, sir? You see this flash report in from CTU? 
not_available I'm reading it now.
not_available They let Fayed slip through their fingers again.
not_available Apparently he now has the capability to arm his remaining suitcase nukes.
not_available This situation is immeasurably worse.
not_available You know my letter of resignation? Have you got that? Yes, I just finished printing it.
not_available I can bring it over to you right now.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available No, just tear that up.
not_available What? Um That talk we were having in my office 
not_available I don't think I misunderstood you.
not_available And I would like to discuss this further.
not_available Not on this phone.
not_available I'll let you know when I have a secure location.
