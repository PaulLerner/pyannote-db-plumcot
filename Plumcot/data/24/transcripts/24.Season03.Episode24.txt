not_available Look, it took me a long time to understand that if you want to do this job well you have to stay detached If you can accept that, you will be fine Yeah Well, I have accepted it That's why I am thinking after today, I am done I don't want to be detached, Jack Not from Kim, not from my daughter I am going to request a transfer to the floor You sure about this? I'd still be serving my country, and take care of the people I care about I owe them that, Jack What did Kim say? I think she's willing to give it a try as long as I am not in Field Ops.

not_available We set up a roadblock and uplinked traffic cams and satellite sweeps But I need Tony to coordinate the data flow with tactical.
not_available There's no downside here, Brad You know he's not a flight risk and he'd be a major asset to the operation.
