
not_available Five power plants are ready to melt down.
not_available AII I care about is making sure that doesn't happen.
not_available Your name is on a lease on a building in Chatsworth that was used to plan the attack.
not_available That makes you a prime suspect.
not_available I don't know about that building.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Jack, please don't.
not_available I don't know the specific building you're talking about.
not_available I can find out.
not_available How? My corporate records are stored on my laptop.
not_available Here it is.
not_available It's Harris Barnes.
not_available Interpol traced the name and listed foreign nationals who have used it.
not_available Who used it most recently? 
not_available A man named Habib Marwan.
not_available We need to find him.
not_available I think we have.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I overheard a phone conversation.
not_available We have less than 15 minutes.
not_available Have your men secure the floor.
not_available Curtis and I are going after the override.
not_available Stay down! Stay down.
not_available Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.
not_available I repeat, the suspect is impersonating a CTU officer.
not_available Edgar! Line one.
not_available Curtis has the override.
not_available The override logged in? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Send it to channel 11.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available They're starting to respond.
not_available It's working, Edgar.
not_available Yes! Yes! The temperature is dropping in all remaining power plants.
not_available Congratulations, Edgar.
not_available Ms Driscoll? It's about Maya.
not_available You'd better go down to the clinic right away.
not_available Maya? Oh! Oh! Oh, baby! No! 
not_available I got new intel.
not_available What? The man you're looking for, Habib Marwan, works for McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available But they made the override.
not_available He's working under the alias Harris Barnes.
not_available They had no reason to suspect.
not_available He positioned himself inside the company so he could use their technology.
not_available Tell 'em to freeze Marwan's personal files.
not_available I did.
not_available You want me to send a comm team over? 
not_available No, we're closer.
not_available Jack or I'll go.
not_available Sure.
not_available Marwan was in the building within the last 15 minutes.
not_available I want perimeters here, roadblocks in every direction.
not_available Done.
not_available Jack.
not_available I just got off with CTU.
not_available Marwan worked for McLennan
not_available Forster under an alias, Harris Barnes.
not_available I told CTU we'd check it out.
not_available OK.
not_available Take Paul and Audrey back to CTU.
not_available I'll be on my cell.
not_available Castle'll stay in charge here.
not_available If he's in the area, our teams will pick him up.
not_available Curtis will take you back to CTU.
not_available What about you? I have to go to McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available Why there? Turns out the man we're looking for works there.
not_available Need to get into their computer system? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available Why? 
not_available My company sold them their IT system.
not_available I designed the database.
not_available It's encoded with military security.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster has personnel that can get into his files.
not_available Yeah, well, I can get you in back doors those people don't even know about.
not_available Fine.
not_available You go with me.
not_available Audrey, I want you to stay with Curtis.
not_available I'll be on my cell.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Stop.
not_available Goodbye, baby girl.
not_available OK.
not_available I'II let everyone here know.
not_available Yeah, thanks, Nat.
not_available Let everyone know what? Driscoll's daughter committed suicide in our clinic.
not_available How did she do that? 
not_available She slit her wrists.
not_available Doesn't make sense.
not_available She was watched.
not_available I don't know, Edgar.
not_available I wasn't there.
not_available I was just thinking out loud.
not_available You don't have to be so hostile.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available Secretary.
not_available Where's Driscoll? The president's about to come on.
not_available Something terrible just happened, sir.
not_available What's that? Ms Driscoll's daughter Maya committed suicide in our clinic 15 minutes ago.
not_available Apparently the doctor walked in and she Erin.
not_available Sarah just told me.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Go back to the floor, Sarah.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Erin, you do not need to be here.
not_available Where should I be, sir? We're still in crisis mode.
not_available Habib Marwan is still out there, and we've no idea how many other cells he might activate.
not_available For God's sake, Erin 
not_available Our systems are in a transition state that require my constant attention.
not_available I'm not in denial about my daughter's death, nor am I in shock.
not_available I can perform my duties until you find a suitable replacement for me.
not_available Ms Driscoll? The president's coming on now.
not_available Thank you, William.
not_available Jim? Erin? First, I want to express my deep gratitude for what you've accomplished so far today.
not_available Wresting back control of the override has saved thousands of American lives.
not_available And the latest NRC report is that the San Gabriel Island meltdown is under control.
not_available That's great news.
not_available But has your staff informed you that we still have a few problems to deal with? Yes, and that's why I'm calling you.
not_available The man responsible for today's attack is still at large.
not_available Yes, sir, he is.
not_available His name is Habib Marwan.
not_available He's been a long
not_available term employee of a major defense contractor.
not_available Yes, I heard.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available This Habib Marwan Do you believe melting down the reactors was his endgame, or something else? As long as he's out there, we have to assume it's not over.
not_available Erin, exactly where are we on apprehending this man? All our resources are being deployed to that end right now.
not_available I'll have more information&lt; once I've been briefed by my staff.
not_available But we know Marwan's in Los Angeles, and we will find him.
not_available As Harris Barnes, Marwan worked at McLennan
not_available Forster for two years as engineer.
not_available His most recent project was design and development of the override.
not_available Before that? 
not_available Here's the timeline we pieced together.
not_available He went to graduate school in England, worked for a company outside London.
not_available It's not clear whether he was radicalized there or before.
not_available The one thing we know is that from the day he arrived in the US, everything he did was about today.
not_available What were his other duties? We don't know yet.
not_available We're taking a first pass at his records.
not_available I'm looking into the possibility that he used McLennan
not_available Forster to recruit sleeper cells.
not_available That brings up another issue.
not_available We have over I'm just wondering if we shouldn't divert part of that to try to root out these other cells.
not_available Erin? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What was the question? Do you think we should reduce the field load on Marwan? How about we take some people off Marwan, but still keep a floor of 60% looking for him? Would that work? Yes.
not_available That would work.
not_available OK.
not_available I want you to relocate personnel.
not_available Based on what? People who've come in the last six hours work on Marwan.
not_available I want alert people on him.
not_available Are we gonna ignore what just happened? What do you mean? 
not_available Erin.
not_available She shouldn't be running this place.
not_available Her daughter died a few minutes ago.
not_available Give her time.
not_available Time? Edgar, since when did we have the luxury of time? 
not_available She knows what's at stake here.
not_available You're right.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available We have work to do.
not_available It does not include deciding Erin's fate.
not_available I think we have to tell Secretary Heller.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Let's get back on it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Curtis and I just arrived at CTU.
not_available Listen, get a security detail, go back to the hotel and get some rest.
not_available Jack, I can't leave.
not_available My father needs my help.
not_available Are you at McLennanForster yet? 
not_available Almost.
not_available Jack, can you make me a promise? What? 
not_available Take care of Paul.
not_available He's not like you.
not_available Please, Jack, promise me that you will look after him.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Look, uh I don't resent you.
not_available Well, I wouldn't blame you if you did.
not_available No, uh You didn't steal my wife.
not_available We were separated.
not_available That's fair.
not_available But I'm not gonna let you take her from me.
not_available I don't think that's really up to you.
not_available Or me.
not_available No, maybe it isn't.
not_available But she still has feelings for me, I can hear it in her voice.
not_available I'll fight to keep those feelings alive.
not_available Well, Paul, you're gonna have to do what you gotta do.
not_available None of our field agents at the Rockland building have picked up a thread on Marwan.
not_available It looks like he might have escaped.
not_available So I think we have to assume he's going to activate these sleeper cells.
not_available I agree.
not_available He'll most likely launch a strike right away, create fear that we're still vulnerable.
not_available You'll have to excuse me, I'm not feeling very well.
not_available Erin! Sit down.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Clinic.
not_available Get me medical.
not_available Erin needs assistance.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available I don't need anybody.
not_available I just got a little light
not_available headed for a second there.
not_available Ms Driscoll 
not_available I don't need you here.
not_available I was dizzy, but I feel better.
not_available Take a break.
not_available Get something to eat.
not_available Take Ms Driscoll and get her some food.
not_available I can handle the situation here while you rest.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right.
not_available It's probably a good idea.
not_available She's gonna need to be relieved of duty.
not_available Contact Division.
not_available Alert them to the situation and tell them to send someone.
not_available I ran this office for two years.
not_available I could take over for Erin on a provisional basis.
not_available Forget for the moment that you technically don't even work here.
not_available You've been away a while.
not_available You're not fluent with the new systems.
not_available With all due respect, sir, you don't need a programmer.
not_available You need a decision maker who can stack up protocols.
not_available And you can do that? Yes, sir.
not_available I can.
not_available Fine.
not_available Effective immediately, you're the interim director of CTU Los Angeles under my authority.
not_available I still want to contact District, have them send someone on a more permanent basis.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available Do you have the abstract on McLennan
not_available Forster? One second.
not_available I'm finishing it now.
not_available All right.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster was a principal contractor in the design of the override.
not_available And Marwan, under the alias of Harris Barnes, had full security access on that project.
not_available You ran FBI checks on the others involved? Yes.
not_available They came up clean.
not_available We're dealing with a terrorist who had inside access to a defense contractor.
not_available Actually, more than that.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster, in addition to weapons manufacture, trains their clients to use those weapons.
not_available International clients? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Several countries in the Balkans, Asia, and the Middle East.
not_available This is a messy situation.
not_available When Jack gets to McLennan
not_available Forster, he has to get into company records and find out who Marwan dealt with.
not_available It's not gonna be that easy.
not_available This reflects on them.
not_available They'll be reluctant to give incriminating information.
not_available Even if Marwan were the only guilty party.
not_available Mr.
not_available McLennan, we need to talk before CTU gets here.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available It was more than a coincidence that one of our products, the override, was stolen and used in today's terrorist attack.
not_available What do you mean, "more than a coincidence"? The entire operation, from Secretary Heller's kidnapping to the meltdown of San Gabriel Island, was organized by one of our own employees.
not_available What are you talking about? One of our engineers, who we now know is a terrorist named Habib Marwan, was running a covert organization 
not_available from within our company.
not_available When did you find this out? Couple of minutes ago they called.
not_available One of our employees, Harris Barnes, was actually Habib Marwan.
not_available Who else knows about this? 
not_available Just the two of us.
not_available And Conlon.
not_available Gentlemen.
not_available I'm David Conlon, VP of internal security.
not_available Jack Bauer, with CTU.
not_available This is Paul Raines.
not_available Jack, Paul.
not_available How can I help you? I need to speak with Gene McLennan.
not_available Gene's in a meeting right now, and he asked me to assist you.
not_available I have access to everything.
not_available My office didn't make itself clear.
not_available This is a matter of national security.
not_available I need to speak with Mr.
not_available McLennan now.
not_available I understand.
not_available Let me see what I can do.
not_available What's the matter? 
not_available Something's not right.
not_available John, I'm not gonna keep this a secret.
not_available We have to let the government know right away.
not_available Sir! if you do this, it will, with 100% certainty, be the end of this company.
not_available Now, you built McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available Everything you have is tied up in it.
not_available If this comes out, you'll be synonymous with what happened.
not_available Terrorism.
not_available Treason.
not_available What do you want me to do? Lie to the government? If I knew 24 hours ago what I know now, I'd have done whatever it took to stop the attack.
not_available But there's nothing we can do now.
not_available Except protect ourselves.
not_available And keep this company from going under, as it will if CTU find out the truth about Marwan.
not_available John, CTU will subpoena the file.
not_available They will find out the truth.
not_available No, they won't, Gene.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Conlon and I can deal with this.
not_available If you let us.
not_available I don't like the sound of this.
not_available Mr.
not_available McLennan, we implicitly violated national security procedure.
not_available This could mean prison time.
not_available We've got to protect ourselves.
not_available Did you get the latest casualty figures? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Which version of the Datalink security system are you running? Excuse me? My company produces firmware for Datalink.
not_available We installed your system.
not_available Are you at 3.4 or 3.5? Uh, 3.5.
not_available Does that work for you? Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dave.
not_available Come on in.
not_available John Reiss, chief technology officer.
not_available You helped us identify the override.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available It's good to meet you.
not_available I'm Gene McLennan.
not_available I'm, uh, sorry I was delayed.
not_available Well, thank you for your time, sir.
not_available So how can I help CTU? One of your employees, Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, a terrorist responsible for today's attack and theft of the override.
not_available We need you to take your IT systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
not_available We can do that.
not_available Can't we, John? Absolutely.
not_available Uh, follow me.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Certainly.
not_available Maybe you should go home.
not_available I'm afraid to.
not_available When my wife, Susan, died, I didn't deal with it at all.
not_available Actually, I went to work the next day.
not_available I remember thinking to myself, "That's life.
not_available " "Quit feeling sorry for yourself, get over it and get on with it.
not_available " A few weeks later I answered a call from an old friend of Susan's who did not know she had died.
not_available And when I heard myself saying: "Susan has passed away", when I actually said those words, it hit me.
not_available All the pain I was trying to shut out just overwhelmed me.
not_available Erin, you can't keep it inside.
not_available You cry, you blame God, you blame yourself, and then you cry some more.
not_available And all the while you let your friends help you.
not_available It's pretty simple.
not_available But very painful.
not_available And I am so, so sorry for you.
not_available Dad, I just wanted Oh.
not_available Um Uh, I'm sorry.
not_available I I just wanted to let you know that I was back.
not_available I will go home.
not_available You should go and make sure your daughter's OK.
not_available If you need me, I'll be on the floor.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Tony just told me you put him in charge of CTU? That's correct.
not_available That doesn't make sense.
not_available He just got reinstated, I'm second in command.
not_available Tony had Erin's job.
not_available He has experience running CTU.
not_available You don't.
not_available With all due respect Relax, Curtis.
not_available It's provisional, till District finds someone.
not_available For the record, I don't like it.
not_available What do you hear from Bauer? He just arrived at McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available He'll call if he picks up any threads.
not_available OK, that was Marwan's work station in the corner.
not_available His computer is tied into the engineering subnet.
not_available What about the rest of the network? Can we get into it from his account? Yeah, I think there's a way to do that.
not_available One window shows you his system files, the other gets you outside the subnet.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Let me know if you need anything.
not_available Thanks for your help.
not_available This guy looks like he knows his way around our system.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll be able to control things from here.
not_available He won't find a thing.
not_available Marwan purged a lot of files.
not_available When? 
not_available Deletion dates aren't coming up.
not_available That means they could have been deleted today.
not_available Marwan wasn't here today.
not_available He was at Rockland, with the override.
not_available Maybe someone else deleted the files.
not_available There.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me see what I can find.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I had to open up a socket for him.
not_available I can see it.
not_available Are they gonna be able to find anything? As long as I can stay ahead of him, I should be able to delete the incriminating files.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm coming up.
not_available What if you can't stay ahead of him? What happens then? 
not_available There are other options.
not_available What options? We'll set off an EMP.
not_available A pulse bomb? Are you out of your mind? It'll destroy every piece of hardware we have.
not_available It'll cripple us electronically.
not_available That's the point.
not_available This is the handover sequence for comm.
not_available I left the default password in place.
not_available You can reset it as soon as we're done here.
not_available All right.
not_available Here are all the access codes to CTU and Division.
not_available Thanks.
not_available If any of my personal stuff gets in your way, have someone box them and put them into storage.
not_available All right.
not_available If you need anything, ask Curtis.
not_available And if he can't help you, you can always call me at home.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Could I have everybody's attention, please? By now, you know that I've taken over Erin Driscoll's command, on a purely provisional basis.
not_available All protocols remain the same.
not_available But I want updates from all department heads every 15 minutes.
not_available Other than that, I'm just here to support you.
not_available So let's get back to work.
not_available Hear from Jack? 
not_available They're looking through Marwan's files.
not_available Any promising leads? 
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available Right.
not_available Look, Edgar, before Erin left she told me the one person I should rely on is you.
not_available She said that? 
not_available Yes, she did.
not_available So anything you think is important, I want you to bring it to me directly.
not_available Right? 
not_available You got it.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Have you scanned satellite imagery around the Rockland building? 
not_available Everything since the override takedown.
not_available All right.
not_available I want you to try different frequency channels.
not_available Manually? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Only way we can be sure to see it all.
not_available I'll have to talk to Tony.
not_available I'm supposed to be backing up Jack and Paul.
not_available Put somebody else on that.
not_available This is more important.
not_available What's more important? We've got 75% of our people on McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available I need Edgar to find a thread on Marwan.
not_available No, we don't have much chance by satellite.
not_available Our best chance is through those files.
not_available Stay on that.
not_available We can't afford one securitygrade analyst? 
not_available One, but not Edgar.
not_available Put somebody else on it.
not_available Tony.
not_available Are we trying to accomplish the same thing? Or is this you establishing position? I don't have to establish position.
not_available I've already got it.
not_available Now, what do you say we stop wasting time arm
not_available wrestling here? I respect your opinion.
not_available But we'll disagree, and when we do, we're gonna do it my way.
not_available Fine.
not_available But I suggest you put manpower into a data search for Marwan.
not_available All right.
not_available Grab a couple people from image processing.
not_available Work the satellites with them.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm gonna be out of here when this crisis is over.
not_available In the meantime, I want the same thing you do.
not_available I want to find Habib Marwan.
not_available All right? Is everything all right? I heard you had a problem.
not_available CTU got to the override before the other nuclear plants melted down.
not_available Well, at least you're safe.
not_available For now.
not_available But they know who I am.
not_available They'll be tracking me with everything they've got.
not_available How does that affect our scheduling? 
not_available It doesn't.
not_available Stay on task.
not_available Make sure everything at the Air Force base is ready.
not_available I checked in with everyone as of ten minutes ago.
not_available We're gonna make this thing happen, Habib.
not_available Now, remember.
not_available When you're done, get in touch with Prado.
not_available He'll get you out of the country.
not_available And you? Go.
not_available Good.
not_available What? I can rebuild the files from these empty directories.
not_available Dammit! 
not_available What's he doing? He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
not_available How can he do that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's not a documented function.
not_available Must be some hook left in by the designer.
not_available He's gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available The pulse bomb.
not_available We have to use it now.
not_available Research.
not_available Set it off.
not_available We weren't scheduled for a test.
not_available This isn't a test.
not_available Open up the safety chamber and set it off now.
not_available CTU will know we're trying to hide something.
not_available Marwan's the suspect.
not_available They'll assume he was behind it.
not_available And the damage to the infrastructure? 
not_available Better than destroying the company.
not_available It'll take some time, but we can rebuild.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available EMP's been activated.
not_available Shield's open.
not_available OK.
not_available Good.
not_available It's been activated.
not_available It'll take ten minutes to charge up before its release.
not_available Edgar? The phone taps you asked for at McLennan
not_available Forster aren't holding.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Connection keeps drifting.
not_available Is there a problem on our end? 
not_available Check power supply.
not_available Could be their PBX.
not_available My God, look at this thing.
not_available The amplitude is fluctuating like crazy.
not_available I thought you checked that before? 
not_available I did.
not_available It was fine then.
not_available Let me call Jack.
not_available The cellular customer is out of range.
not_available That's weird.
not_available Customer out of range? McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available I need Jack Bauer.
not_available He's a CTU agent in Harris Barnes' office.
not_available I'll transfer you Hello? Hello? What's going on? Cell and land lines around McLennan
not_available Forster are out.
not_available Can we use the network to message him? 
not_available Yeah, the computers haven't been affected.
not_available Open up a window for me, would you? What the hell's this? I don't know.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available I gotta respond.
not_available Can you pipe that window over to this computer? Yeah, just give me an Ethernet address.
not_available I've almost got these files rebuilt.
not_available Do we have any data points outside? 
not_available I'm online with the phone company.
not_available They're getting complaints as far as eight blocks away from the building.
not_available Have you still got a connection? 
not_available Yeah, I've got it.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
not_available That's it.
not_available Print it out, now.
not_available Now! 
not_available Dammit! They've got something.
not_available What? I can't read it.
not_available How long till it goes off? 
not_available Any second.
not_available We're fine.
not_available He's printing it.
not_available What are you going to do now? 
not_available Take care of it.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available We're dealing with an EMP.
not_available McLennan
not_available Forster were developing a nonlethal weapon for the military.
not_available What is it? 
not_available An electromagnetic pulse bomb.
not_available Once it goes off, everything within its radius that's electrical gets fried.
not_available Lights, cars, computers.
not_available Every piece of electronic data just vanishes forever.
not_available How long have we got? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Its capacitors are still charging.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right, the printer's warming up.
not_available Sarah, do we have any choppers in that area? Yeah, one.
not_available If it's in the air when the EMP goes off, that chopper's going down.
not_available Get 'em out of the area now.
not_available Edgar, where's this coming from? McLennan
not_available Forster.
