
not_available Previous on 24.
not_available What's going on with Jack Bauer? The operation wasn't completely successful.
not_available They do have Saunders' daughter, but they were unable to remain covert.
not_available So, Saunders knows we have her? No, not yet, but CTU is estimating he will find out within the hour.
not_available The deadline for his next demand is gonna be up here in about 15 minutes.
not_available Now, giving this guy a list of every foreign operative on our payroll is an act of treason.
not_available I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand.
not_available We have run out of time.
not_available We need you to call your father.
not_available And tell him what? Anything.
not_available We just want you to keep him on the line.
not_available Jane? 
not_available Hi, Dad.
not_available What's wrong? I told you only to use this number in an emergency.
not_available Someone is monitoring the call.
not_available They've got her.
not_available There's a man named Jack Bauer with you, isn't there? Hand the phone to him.
not_available You know how many vials I have, and what I am capable of.
not_available You know what I am capable of, too.
not_available Stephen Saunders This is Jack Bauer.
not_available You are completely surrounded.
not_available The President is refusing to capitulate to any further demands.
not_available The only way you are getting out of this thing alive is coming through the front door with your hands on your head.
not_available That's not exactly true, Jack.
not_available I'd like to offer you congratulations on your wife eluding infection from the virus.
not_available How do you know about my wife? I don't know exactly what they are doing to her, Tony.
not_available But I did instruct them to leave her barely functional so that we can return her to you.
not_available There are 5 agents watching the northeast exit of this building.
not_available Send them to the front entrance.
not_available Michelle will be dead if you don't do what I say.
not_available This is Tony Almeida.
not_available What are we doing? Move everyone to the front now.
not_available Get in your car, move to the front of the building Down, down The following takes place between 9:00 am and 10:00 am.
not_available Stephen Saunders, this is your final warning.
not_available Come out of the building now.
not_available Smoke him out Release the tear gas.
not_available Send them in Perimeter teams, move in.
not_available Move in All right, boys, let's go, let's go Move Baker Why aren't you covering the south perimeter? CTU moved us off our position They said you needed us out front.
not_available What are you talking about? Why would they do that? They said the SAT feed showed Saunders moving toward a blind spot in front of the building.
not_available All teams respond.
not_available I repeat, all teams respond.
not_available Any sign of Saunders? Jack, we are in.There's no sign of him yet.
not_available Who gave you that order? Tony Move your team back to their marks now.Move CTU, Almeida 
not_available Tony, it's Jack Baker just told me you pulled his team out of position.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was working off the information I had.
not_available It was bad information.
not_available You should have cleared it with me.
not_available Somebody in my team made a mistake.
not_available I am not going to get into it now.
not_available Tony, that's an unacceptable mistake.
not_available I have tactical command in the field.
not_available If you can't run CTU, you'd better replace yourself with someone who can.
not_available Chase, check in.
not_available Yeah, Jack We covered the entire building, he is not here.
not_available Dame it Saunders doesn't seem to be in the building.
not_available What do you mean, he's not in there? He's got to be in there.
not_available He's gone.
not_available What were you just telling Jack about someone in your group making a mistake? Never mind.
not_available Adam, are we sure we tracked Saunders to the right building? Of course we did, Tony He was in there when Jack made that phone call I am pulling up imagery now to see what went wrong I will take care of that.
not_available You stay with Chloe, cover the site teams Almeida.
not_available I hope you covered your tracks and purged the incriminating satellite frames.
not_available I did what you wanted me to.Now where's my wife? Not so fast.I like to do things in phases.
not_available You should know that by now.That was phase one.
not_available Next, we have to talk about my daughter.
not_available What about her? I want her back, of course.
not_available Yeah, well, I want my wife back.
not_available Then there should be no problem.
not_available Where's Jane now? She's on her way here.
not_available She should be here in about 5 minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available When she gets there, pick the men to guard her.
not_available Make sure they will follow your orders without question.
not_available If any harm comes to my daughter, your wife dies.
not_available If Jane is not released when I order it, your wife dies.
not_available That's all you need to know.
not_available Are we clear? Tony, are you in there? Tony, President Palmer is on the line for you.
not_available I will do my part.
not_available You do yours.
not_available That's the spirit.
not_available Tony, are you there? Adam, I am here Are you ok? 
not_available Yeah, I am fine.
not_available Put the President through.
not_available Ok,hang on.
not_available This is Tony Almeida.
not_available Please hold for the President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Almeida I just heard you lost Stephen Saunders.
not_available Is that true? Yes, sir.
not_available Unfortunately, it is.
not_available I thought CTU was certain of his location.
not_available What happened? We are looking into it now, sir.
not_available Does Saunders know we are holding his daughter? Yes, sir, he does.
not_available And she's obviously very important to him.
not_available Is Jane Saunders with you now? No.
not_available She's on her way here right now, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Almeida, I don't have to remind you how much security we are going to need around her today.
not_available She is the only thing that is standing between us and Stephen Saunders controlling the government.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We're aware of that.
not_available Good Keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Senator, Senator Keeler, do you feel this is going to do serious damage to your campaign? Oh, absolutely not.
not_available My record on labor speaks for itself Remeber I voted againt NAFTA And I favor tax incentives for domestic manufacturing.
not_available And what about the other endorsements you lost? Who did he lose? AFL CIO and a couple of veteran groups.
not_available Why? Apparently, they are not pleased with his negative spin on your withdrawal from the debate Now that the threat level has been raised to red, peoplerealize you aren't the one playing politics.
not_available He is.
not_available We can't waste time thinking about the election right now.
not_available The only thing that matters is stopping Stephen Saunders.
not_available Would you come with me, please.Excuse us, Jerry.
not_available No, Adam, he was in the building.We found the room he was using.I just want to know how he got out.
not_available We are working on it, Chase.
not_available I will call you if we get something.
not_available Good What did he say? I don't understand this, Jack We pinpointed Saunders' location.
not_available He disappears into the air.
not_available Now CTU says they are having problems with the satellite.
not_available We are looking into it.Baker, this is Jack.
not_available I want 2 teams on patrol, 2 more on standby.
not_available Copy? What about us? We will go over to CTU.
not_available I want to be with Saunders' daughter when he calls us back.
not_available All right.
not_available How did Saunders get past us? We had every exit covered.
not_available Did he have access to our tracking systems? CTU, O'Brian Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available What are you working on? We are all trying to pick up a thread on Saunders.
not_available I am analyzing his last phone call to you to see if there's any tell on the carrier.
not_available Is it possible that he wasn't even in the building? That he was just routing his calls through there? No.
not_available He did that earlier at the apartment.
not_available Now that I have his counterfeit signature, he wouldn't be able to do it without our knowing it.
not_available Ok.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you have got anything.
not_available Something is not right here This is CTU? 
not_available Yes Kim, your father wants you to know that he and Chase are on their way back.
not_available With Saunders? No Why not? He wasn't in the building They a re still trying to locate him They haven't captured my father? 
not_available No.
not_available But he knows you have me, right? Yes, he does.
not_available Agent Forrester, Tony Almeida We are going to be putting Miss Saunders in the holding room.
not_available I was told you were setting up a white room for her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's changed.
not_available If you walk her to the back, Security will take her from there.
not_available You will be fine, ok? How are you doing? I can't believe that Saunders escaped.
not_available I mean, how could this happen? I thought that he was surrounded.
not_available It happened.
not_available Look, Rae Plachecki's coming here to talk to you.
not_available You're going to have to answer some questions about the shooting at the library.
not_available Ok, look, I heard the news about Michelle.
not_available What news? 
not_available That she isn't infected.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I am really glad that she's ok.
not_available That's great.
not_available Yeah, thanks There is on way to be exactly sure.
not_available Some people don't show symptoms for 5 or 6 hours.
not_available Adam 
not_available Didn't they talk to you about your options? They said they could give me a pill Adam, I need to talk to you now Sarah, hold on.I am talking to my sister right now The one who got infected with the virus? I am not even going to answer that, Chloe.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available I'll just wait here until you are done.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Adam, I am sorry, this is really important.
not_available I just need you to finish up as quickly as you can.
not_available Sarah, I am going to have to call you back as soon as I can, ok? Ok I love you I love you What? 
not_available I checked with satellite navigation They said there are missing frames and they are certain it's on our end.
not_available What about the back up on the FGA volume? Gone.
not_available Not only that, they cover about 20 seconds.
not_available So if Saunders did escape the building it would be the exact interval So there was a glitch at exactly the wrong moment? Yeah.
not_available What are the chances of that? Not good So I am thinking Saunders has access to our system.
not_available Did you tell Tony yet? No.
not_available I want more information before I go to him.
not_available But I checked with Field Ops, and all their systems are accounted for.
not_available I need you to do the same in Comm.
not_available Do you really think there's someone inside CTU working for Saunders? That's the only thing that makes sense right now So if you could just do that, and then you could call your sister back.
not_available Hey, Pete, I need few minutes.
not_available Sure thing How you doing? Why am I being treated like I have done something wrong? I apologize for that.
not_available We are just trying to keep you safe.
not_available This is the one place I am not safe.
not_available I have been thinking about it.
not_available You need me to get to my father, so threatening to killme or harm me is the only tool you have to use against him Tell me I am wrong.
not_available You are right.
not_available We need your father to believe we will do anything to get him.
not_available But we are not going to hurt you.
not_available I give you my word Your word? 
not_available Yeah,my word I run this office and I will personally protect you.
not_available What about Kim's father? They told her that he is on his way back here.
not_available What about him? 
not_available He scares me.
not_available I got the feeling he's willing to hurt me.
not_available Nobody's going to hurt you.
not_available All right? I wish I could believe you.
not_available Almeida Has Jane arrived? Yeah Where is she? She is here 
not_available Put her on.
not_available No You have my wife, I want to talk to her first You don't give me orders.
not_available You are wrong I have your daughter which means I am in charge.
not_available Now if you so much as touch my wife, I will slit Jane's throat.
not_available Hold on Sorry for your discomfort Hopefully it's temporary.Uncuff her I am going to let you speak to your husband Tell him that you are ok and you are being treated well.
not_available Nothing else.Understood? Tony, it's me Michelle They won't let me say much Are you all right? I am fine.I am being treated well Don't let them do this, don't let¡­ 
not_available None of that.
not_available Michelle Let me speak with my daughter, Mr.
not_available Almeida It's your father.He wants to talk to you Dad? 
not_available Yes, Jane.
not_available It's me.
not_available They are saying horrible things about you.
not_available That's what they do.Don't believe any of it The virus in the hotel,it's killing all of those people, you didn't do that.
not_available Please tell me that you didn't do that.
not_available Listen to me, Jane.
not_available The US government distorts the truth and destroys lives.
not_available Don't listen to any of it.It's all lies.
not_available Then you didn't do it? I'd never do something without good cause.
not_available You know that.
not_available That's all.
not_available Let's do these.
not_available What will it take for you to get her out of the building? I have to fabricate some clearances.
not_available It's going to take me about 30 to 40 minutes Contact me as soon as you are clear of CTU.
not_available Take down this number.
not_available You were right.
not_available Someone from Tony's group purged the frames from the surveillance feed.
not_available Do you know who? It was a no name login.
not_available It could have been from here or Division.
not_available I'd better tell Tony so he can lock down the system.
not_available Ok CTU, O'Brian This is Sunny Macer from Health Services.
not_available Sunny, what can I do for you? Have you heard from Michelle Dessler in the last half hour? No, she was sent to your office for observation.
not_available Well, that's actually why I am calling.
not_available I got a message that she asked to be taken to County instead,but she's not at County and she's definitely not here.
not_available We can't get ahold of her.
not_available I will check on it and get back to you.
not_available All right, thanks Davis, get me Mike Redmond.
not_available He's with Michelle Dessler.
not_available All right.
not_available He's not answering What do you mean he's not answering? He's active.
not_available He has to answer.
not_available He's not answering.
not_available Ok, I heard you the first time.
not_available Are you sure about this? Yes, Tony, of course I am sure There's 79 users in your group, and one of them has been playing games with the uplink recording All right, well We are going to have to lock everything down then Well, obviously I agree.
not_available You want me to do it now? Yeah What is it? Something weird is happening with Michelle.
not_available What do you mean? No one can find her, and Redmond's not answering his pages.
not_available That's because I overrode NHS's order.
not_available I didn't want them to know about it.
not_available I am putting Michelle in quarantine in one of our substations so she can still do some work I need every warm body I can get.
not_available What am I going to tell Macer? I will call her.
not_available There's something else I want you to do.
not_available What is it? I am sending you the record of a phone call between Saunders and myself from a few minutes ago.
not_available You just spoke to him? Yeah.
not_available I want you to strip away the carrier signal, see if you can use it to find him.
not_available What about the voice track? No, he scrambled it.
not_available It's useless.
not_available Fine Chloe Do it in tech one, away from everybody.
not_available I didn't want Adam to know about it.
not_available Why not? Well, technically it's his job.
not_available But you are better at it.
not_available Why did you just say that? Because it's true.
not_available Damn it, Mark, you assured me that going on the offensive against Palmer was the right thing to do Now it's backfiring.
not_available Come on, John.That's not fair Palmer walks out of the debate moments after you brought up the charge against his girlfriend Everyone assumed that he whole national security excuse was just a cover Well, apparently it wasn't The alert level is at red and the airports are shut down 
not_available I know.
not_available All right Palmer still hasn't told the public any of the details about this threat.
not_available Call Alex in the Pentagon see what you can find out about it.
not_available Depending on what it turns out to be, I may need to be proactive and issue an apology.
not_available Yeah What's this about? All right, hold on.It's Sherry Palmer.
not_available She wants to come here in 5 minutes.
not_available Why? 
not_available She wouldn't say.
not_available Except that it's a high value proposition, and she wants to present it face to face.
not_available Set it up All right, the Senator will be here.
not_available This should be interesting I will off load the systems in Field Ops.
not_available I will be right up.
not_available Adam, where's Tony? 
not_available He's with Jane Saunders Kim's waiting to be debriefed on the shooting and I am working with NHS.
not_available NHS? Why aren't you tracking Saunders? I don't know.
not_available Tony put Chloe in charge of that.
not_available Where's Chloe? Tech one Why isn't she in Field Ops? You haven't talked to Tony yet? About what? Jack, it looks like someone from Tony's group intentionally wiped out those SAT frames from the Saunders' surveillance 
not_available That's how he was able to evade us.
not_available What? Adam, NHS wants those coordinates now, or they are going to have to widen the quarantine zone.
not_available Ok.
not_available That's all I know, Jack.
not_available I got to get back on this.
not_available Ok, fine We may be moving you in a few minutes.
not_available Where? 
not_available To Division.
not_available What's that? Yeah 
not_available Tony, it's Jack.I need to speak with you.
not_available Meet me outside the observation room.
not_available Yeah, all right.I will be right back.
not_available Jack,What the hell's going on? Adam just told me that you think you have got someone on the inside working with Saunders.
not_available Well, it hasn't been confirmed yet.
not_available Chloe's working on it.
not_available What's she doing? She's taking a look at status logs, to see if she can find anything out of the ordinary.
not_available Tony, if this is true, we have got to call Division, get Spec Ops down here immediately.
not_available I thought about that.
not_available But I don't want to raise any red flags.
not_available If someone in our group is working with Saunders, I don't want them to know that we are onto them.
not_available Ok, fine.You and I will work this up together.
not_available But I want division to come pick up Jane so they can continue questioning her.
not_available Good idea.
not_available I will call Brad Hammond, I will meet you in tech one, we'll go through everything with Chloe.
not_available No, wait, Jack Look, I have a 30 minute status call scheduled with Hammond, anyway Why don't you let me tell him and you can go up to Field Ops? Ok, fine Adam.Is Tony set up for 30 minute status calls with Brad Hammond? 
not_available If he is, it's not in the books.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you very much John, hello 
not_available Sherry How nice to see you.
not_available I don't believe you know Mark Kaner, my campaign manager.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Only by reputation.Pleased to meet you.
not_available How do you do? So what brings you here? Well, actually, it's a private mater, John.
not_available Let us have a minute, Mark No problem Please I heard about the endorsements you lost this morning.
not_available Daily fluctuation.
not_available It doesn't mean a thing.
not_available Doesn't mean a thing That's pretty optimistic, John.
not_available No, your campaign is imploding.
not_available By the time the press has a chance to analyze all the mistakes you made last night You will look like a desperate candidate gasping his last breath.
not_available Look, Sherry, if you just came here to insult me, I am rather busy No, no, no, John.
not_available On the contrary.
not_available Relax.
not_available I, I came here because I can guarantee you a win in November.
not_available John, what I am about to tell you, I will deny to my grave if you try to hold it against me.
not_available So that's clear, right? John, we are clear on that, right? Good David Palmer is an accessory to murder.
not_available Who's murder? 
not_available Alan Milliken Alan Milliken died of a heart attack.
not_available Yes, he did, but he didn't have to.
not_available His nitroglycerin was just an arm's length away.
not_available But he couldn't get to it because someone kept it from him.
not_available Now how could you possibly know that? Because that someone was me.
not_available Sherry, I think you had better leave right now.
not_available Really? So you can watch your entire career leave with me? If what you are saying is true, I don't want to have anything to do with you.
not_available Oh, come on, spare me, John.
not_available You haven't gotten this far without getting a little dirt under your fingernails.
not_available I don't know what you are talking about.
not_available No.
not_available Of course not.
not_available But for the sake of conversation, just allow me to paint you a picture.
not_available I¡­ Please, it won't take but a moment Just indulge me.
not_available Very well David lied to the Chief of Police last night in order to provide an alibi for me.
not_available And I can prove that he lied.
not_available No, you think about that.
not_available Proof that the President of the United States lied to cover a murder.
not_available What kind of proof? Besides my confession? I have the prescription bottle he was reaching for.
not_available I was holding it.
not_available And I have it in a very safe place.
not_available You are talking about incriminating yourself.
not_available You would go to prison.
not_available Yes, I know that.
not_available But so would David David lied to the police to save himself.
not_available It's quite simple, John All you have to do is go to David and tell him that you have this evidence This medicine bottle with my fingerprints on it And I guarantee you David will drop out of the race.
not_available The party will be thrown into turmoil and nobody, I mean nobody will be able to touch you come November.
not_available And for all of this? You will put me on the White House staff.
not_available Nothing so high that it will raise too many eyebrows.
not_available All of this for you to be a mid level staffer in my administration? You and I both know that it would be a little more than that.
not_available So you are saying the casualty estimates have been projected upward.
not_available Yes sir, I am afraid so By a factor of how many? Now that the virus is out of the hotel and not completely contained.
not_available It could be as high as times five All right, thanks, Dan.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's it? I just got off the phone with one of my sources over at Keeler's headquarters.
not_available Sherry was there meeting privately with Keeler.
not_available When? 
not_available Just now Meeting Keeler about what? He didn't know.
not_available David So I was hoping you'd have some idea.
not_available I don't know what she's doing.
not_available But we can't worry about that now.
not_available There are people dying here in Los Angeles.
not_available Yeah, well, I don't like it, David 
not_available So let me put someone on this.
not_available No.
not_available I brought Sherry in to fix a problem, and look what happened.
not_available Just let it be.
not_available We will hear soon enough.
not_available What do you see? They are trying to use the open phone switches to find us.
not_available The phone I called him with is shut off.
not_available They can't triangulate me, can they? Not quickly.
not_available But they can try a trial and error process and that could get them close.
not_available And that's what they are doing? Looks like it Then we will have to stop them Come with me Your office is using our last phone conversation to locate us.
not_available How are they doing it? I am committed to getting my daughter back.
not_available You kill me and that'll never happen.
not_available That's not the only option.
not_available You are an attractive woman.
not_available I am guessing your husband would prefer you returned without a disfigurement.
not_available I am not telling you anything.
not_available I have to talk to Almeida.
not_available Keep your conversation short.
not_available Almeida.Let me paint you a picture I have a sharp knife, the tip of which is drawing blood from your wife's face right now.
not_available If whatever you are doing to trace these phone calls doesn't stoop in 30 seconds, she'll be unrecognizable.
not_available O'Brian Shut down the trace.
not_available Shut it down?I am just starting to get something.
not_available Do it now, Chloe.
not_available fine.Let me at least see if I can unscramble the audio No, I need you to hold off for a few minutes.
not_available This doesn't make sense, Tony I thought you wanted me to find Saunders.
not_available I do.
not_available I will explain it to you later.
not_available What are you doing? I am trying to pick up a thread on Saunders.
not_available Somebody in my own group may be working against us, I have quarantine zones springing up all over the place I am treading water here, Jack Why are you lying to me? Lying? What are you talking about? I just got off the phone with Hammond.
not_available You didn't have a status call scheduled.
not_available I screwed up earlier.
not_available The SAT transmission on my system was forged by my own people.
not_available I should have noticed that it wasn't authentic before I ordered Baker off his post, I didn't By the time I realized my mistake, it was too late.
not_available Saunders was gone.
not_available What about the missing frames? They must have been deleted by the same person who forged the SAT transmission.
not_available Look, I know this is big, Jack, and I promise you I will offer my resignation when this day is over.
not_available Right now we got too much going on for me to step down.
not_available Making a mistake is one thing.
not_available Covering it up is another.
not_available I can't let you stay in place.
not_available I am taking over command of CTU now.
not_available I made a mistake, Jack No, Tony You made two Fine.
not_available I will make sure Adam sends over everything I have got to your group.
not_available Tony, I narrowed down the list.
not_available What list? The list of people on your team that can't account for their time when the SAT frames went missing Oh, yeah, right.
not_available Tony, it's very likely that someone on this list is working from within CTU to help Saunders.
not_available Look, Adam, I am not in charge of CTU anymore.
not_available What are you talking about? Jack and I have decided it'd be best if he took over.
not_available Why don't you send that list over to Hammond, all right? Yes I got a problem What problem? Jack Bauer just relieved me of my command Why did he do that? He found out I'd deleted those satellite frames.
not_available Does he know about our communication? No, not yet.
not_available He thinks I am just covering my mistake.
not_available But he's gonna find out soon.
not_available Then I suggest you get my daughter out of there before he does.
not_available Look, I might not be able to do this.
not_available I no longer have any authority at CTU.
not_available You don't' need authority, Tony.
not_available You just need to know that if you don't deliver Jane for whatever reason, your wife will die just like Ryan Chappelle died.
not_available Just like the people at the Chandler Plaza Hotel died.
not_available I am gonna try to get her out, but if I can't If you can't, Michelle dies.
not_available Don't call me again until you have Jane safely away Dad.
not_available Kim, I need you to help me with something You are gonna have to clear it with Tony He wants me to debrief with Rae Plachecki about what's going on with Jane Saunders.
not_available Tony just stepped down.
not_available I am acting director of CTU until further notice.
not_available What do you mean Tony stepped down? Tony's hiding something from me.
not_available I need you to help me find out what it is.
not_available Why me? Because right now I don't know who to trust.
not_available I need you to maintain a surveillance on every station here at CTU Anyone who checks in or out, and I also want you to track communications that flag higher than a code 2.
not_available Where do you want me to do that? Field Ops.
not_available Come on.
not_available Thanks Almeida Good news, Tony What is it? I found a way to pull the voice track on the phone call you had with Saunders.
