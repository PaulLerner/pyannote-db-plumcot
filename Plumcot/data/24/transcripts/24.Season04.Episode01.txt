
not_available I can't reach her! Please help me.
not_available I can't move.
not_available There's two more trapped inside that one.
not_available Help me.
not_available I I can't move.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Sarah, save what you're doing.
not_available I need you.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I just heard from one of our sources.
not_available There's a probability that someone from our FBI watch list was spotted in LA yesterday.
not_available Tomas Sherek.
not_available Who is he? 
not_available He's worked with terror cells near Istanbul.
not_available He's suspected of coordinating suicide bombings last summer.
not_available Istanbul? There was some chatter this morning about a possible attack by a group out of Turkey.
not_available Here it is.
not_available From Ankara.
not_available What was the target? 
not_available East Coast.
not_available New York or DC.
not_available But the time window passed.
not_available Passed? The targeted time is for 8am.
not_available It's already past ten on the East Coast.
not_available What if they got the target wrong and it's West Coast time? Then it's gonna go down within the hour.
not_available Tell Curtis.
not_available I'll take this to Driscoll.
not_available I can take it.
not_available Why? 
not_available I thought you wanted to keep working it up.
not_available You're really transparent.
not_available Stop trying to be Driscoll's pet.
not_available She doesn't like it.
not_available Any voice confirmation from anyone on the train? No.
not_available The signals just confirmed a bomb.
not_available We're trying to get in contact.
not_available It's in a remote area, but local police are heading there.
not_available All right.
not_available We have discretionary authority out of Point Mugu.
not_available Have them direct a patrol aircraft over the area.
not_available Put the pilot in contact with our people.
not_available Should we monitor emergency services? 
not_available No.
not_available County will cover that.
not_available A truck full of C
not_available 4 derailed a train in Santa Clarita.
not_available Free up some people.
not_available Division's gonna send data.
not_available That could be related to what we found.
not_available What did you find? Two things.
not_available First, intelligence indicated the possibility of an attack at eight this morning.
not_available Bombing was at seven.
not_available That's within an hour.
not_available What's the second thing? A Turkish national on the FBI watch list, Tomas Sherek, was last seen in the city.
not_available He could be related to the bombing.
not_available OK.
not_available Open up channels with Division.
not_available Start investigating this bombing.
not_available Work up what you have on Sherek.
not_available We'll brief in a few minutes.
not_available What about the Defense Department meeting? It's in a half hour.
not_available Who's Secretary Heller sending? Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack? Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available He hasn't been back well, since you fired him.
not_available Is it gonna be uncomfortable? 
not_available What? Going back to CTU.
not_available Seeing Driscoll again.
not_available I don't blame her for her decision.
not_available How can that be? She forced you out of CTU.
not_available She didn't want an ex
not_available junkie.
not_available That's not unreasonable.
not_available You weren't a junkie.
not_available You were doing your job.
not_available I was addicted to heroin.
not_available It didn't matter why.
not_available Do you miss your old job? I could have joined other agencies if I still wanted to do field work.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available I wanted something different from my life.
not_available It might not seem like a lot to you.
not_available But for me To be able to have this kind of a connection with someone I couldn't do that before.
not_available I'm glad you can now.
not_available We'd better go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Secretary Heller's gonna be in the lobby in five minutes.
not_available Secretary Heller? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I called him Dad once in a press conference so I decided then to use his title all the time.
not_available Audrey Your father's a very perceptive man.
not_available I would like to tell him about us before he finds out on his own.
not_available Look My dad is kind of old
not_available fashioned.
not_available Even though Paul and I are separated, he still considers us married.
not_available I understand that.
not_available And I don't want your father to draw the wrong conclusion and think that I had anything to do with the break
not_available up.
not_available Yeah, but you didn't.
not_available Please, Jack.
not_available Let's just give it a little more time.
not_available I'm gonna tell you something and I don't want you to panic.
not_available I'm falling in love with you.
not_available Look, I don't want you to say anything.
not_available And I don't need you to feel the same way.
not_available I just wanted you to know.
not_available I will see you downstairs.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available This is what we have.
not_available A known terrorist named Tomas Sherek managed to enter the country undetected.
not_available There's a likelihood Sherek helped organize the train attack.
not_available If he did, he's gonna get out of the country as fast as he can.
not_available Which means we have a small window of opportunity here.
not_available Who's covering airports and customs? I am.
not_available I've issued a mandate to LAX, Long Beach and Ontario.
not_available As usual, Edgar, we can't hear you.
not_available Where's your laptop if you need to pull data? Sorry, I'll speak up.
not_available And I don't need my laptop.
not_available I have everything memorized.
not_available What I was saying is that I've asked all the airports to add a layer of security.
not_available Any local contacts for Sherek? 
not_available I'm looking into those now.
not_available All right.
not_available Promote everything we receive up to Division.
not_available Let's find Sherek before he leaves the city.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you think it's a mistake to assume Sherek is on his way out of LA? 
not_available No.
not_available But the timing on the intel doesn't match.
not_available It said 8am and the train bombing happened around seven.
not_available Just focus on finding Sherek.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's Tomas.
not_available Did Dar get the briefcase? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's on his way to you now.
not_available Good.
not_available You did well, Tomas.
not_available What about Maurice? 
not_available He's waiting for you.
not_available He has everything you need.
not_available Behrooz, are you eating with us? 
not_available I'll be right down, Mom.
not_available I'm concerned about him.
not_available Concerned? Why? 
not_available I think he's still seeing this American girl.
not_available You said you'd talk to him.
not_available I did.
not_available I told him he was no longer allowed to have contact with her.
not_available And he agreed, right? Yes.
not_available But I think he's still seeing her behind our backs.
not_available I'll speak to him.
not_available No.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Behrooz, we're sitting down to eat.
not_available Behrooz.
not_available I'm on the phone.
not_available Get off and come down now.
not_available Who is he talking to? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Who were you on the phone with? 
not_available My friend Scott.
not_available You were talking to that American girl.
not_available No, I told you, I don't see her any more.
not_available Don't lie to me, Behrooz! I hear your phone calls at night.
not_available I read your emails.
not_available You read my emails? That's my business! 
not_available Don't you raise your voice to your father.
not_available While you live under my roof, there is no such thing as your business.
not_available No more communications with that girl.
not_available Do you understand me? Don't look at her.
not_available You're talking to me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available ..
not_available where a horrible tragedy struck a short time ago.
not_available An early morning commuter train collided with a truck that was apparently crossing the track.
not_available Reports are coming in that most of the passengers were severely injured.
not_available Casualty estimates as high as 30.
not_available NTSB agents have arrived on the scene and are investigating the cause.
not_available At this time, the authorities are not saying if this was an accident or a targeted attack, but, as you can see, there has been So far, everything is on schedule.
not_available Have you spoken to Tomas? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The briefcase is on its way to us now.
not_available When it gets here, you'll take it to the warehouse.
not_available Why doesn't Dar take it there directly? He doesn't need to know where our people are working.
not_available That's the safest way.
not_available Behrooz If your father seems severe, it's because our job here is a difficult one.
not_available If we are to succeed, it's important that we are of a single mind.
not_available I understand.
not_available What we will accomplish today will change the world.
not_available We're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this.
not_available We cannot fail.
not_available Yes, Father.
not_available Morning, Jennifer.
not_available What are you doing here so early? 
not_available I'm not here early.
not_available You've been here all night? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What are you working on? 
not_available Nothing right now.
not_available I'm just stealing some software from Adobe and Microsoft.
not_available You're gonna get caught one of these days.
not_available Hey, Melanie.
not_available Don't tell anybody or I'll have to kill you.
not_available What the hell is this? Whoa.
not_available Melanie, come look at this.
not_available Looks like someone's trying to corrupt the Internet.
not_available Yeah, but it hasn't started propagating yet.
not_available They're just placing the nodes.
not_available Look at this.
not_available This could tank every system in the world.
not_available You've gotta tell somebody.
not_available If I call the feds from here, they'll trace the call.
not_available They'll know I was stealing code.
not_available Then do it from a payphone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm up to speed on the train bombing.
not_available How many confirmed dead? 
not_available 32.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available Call Carl.
not_available I will.
not_available Thanks, Al.
not_available 32 dead.
not_available What's the initial assessment? An act of terrorism.
not_available When you get to CTU, I want you to find out all the details and call me.
not_available And listen I don't want anyone, except you two, to know about this meeting with Richard.
not_available Of course.
not_available I tried to get a hold of you last night.
not_available Where were you? 
not_available I had dinner with a friend.
not_available Anyone I know? No.
not_available Jack.
not_available Sir.
not_available I'll call you when I get to CTU.
not_available Yeah, I'll get her.
not_available Hold on.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Edgar Stiles.
not_available You don't need to use your last name.
not_available You've been here over a month.
not_available What is it? I got a friend of yours.
not_available He says he needs to talk to you.
not_available Who, Edgar? 
not_available His name is Andrew Paige.
not_available Fine.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Hello? 
not_available I can't take personal calls here.
not_available It's not personal.
not_available I found something on the Net I think you should know about.
not_available There's a fake NAT table and several large corporate routers.
not_available It was loaded this morning.
not_available How would you know? I was trying to download some software and I noticed it.
not_available By download, I assume you mean steal, or you wouldn't have seen a NAT table.
not_available OK, fine.
not_available But I hacked deeper and I found all kinds of stuff.
not_available What kind of stuff? I think someone's positioning code for a major Internet attack.
not_available The thing is, not all the code remarks are in English.
not_available What language were they in? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It looked Middle Eastern.
not_available Like Arabic or Turkish, maybe.
not_available You find something? 
not_available Sarah was working on Sherek's contacts.
not_available The system flagged Maurice Landstrass.
not_available He owns a dry
not_available cleaners in Studio City.
not_available We found his business is owned by a holding company based out of Ankara, Turkey.
not_available All right.
not_available Give this to Ronnie, tell him to get over there and see what he can find.
not_available Excuse me, Miss Driscoll.
not_available What is it, Chloe? I just got a call from an old classmate.
not_available He noticed some high
not_available profile Internet nodes have been compromised.
not_available This could be related to our present threat.
not_available Why? A computer network virus was launched this morning from a server in Turkey.
not_available That's where Sherek is from.
not_available Should I start working it up? No.
not_available The bombing and Sherek are all we should be dealing with now.
not_available But pass it to the FBI.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Yes, I have a meeting with Erin Driscoll.
not_available Jack.
not_available It's OK, Sarah.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Oh.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available Chloe, how have you been? Not perfect, but OK.
not_available How are Kim and Chase? Good.
not_available They just got a house in Valencia.
not_available Kim's taking care of Angela.
not_available Chase works for a private security company.
not_available That's interesting I mean, I'm interested, I just have to set up a protocol.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Is Erin ready for our meeting? Almost, but I should tell you, you'll probably get cut short.
not_available The train bombing in Santa Clarita.
not_available Among other things.
not_available What other things? 
not_available I won't bore you with it.
not_available We're out.
not_available OK, we'll have you on voice three, data four.
not_available Ronnie, Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack, Ronnie Lobell.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available Ronnie's got your old job, head of field ops.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available It's busy.
not_available It was nice meeting you.
not_available Would you rather reschedule this? That won't be necessary.
not_available Erin will be free soon.
not_available Tell you what, why don't you use this station to make any calls.
not_available It won't be long.
not_available OK, thank you.
not_available I don't know, Max.
not_available Let me find out.
not_available It's a Vandenberg representative.
not_available How long will they be pushed back? Don't change anything with Vandenberg.
not_available We'll stick to the original schedule.
not_available OK, Max.
not_available Yep.
not_available We'll see you then.
not_available Have you spoken with your brother? 
not_available No.
not_available I don't think he knows I'm coming with you.
not_available It's probably best that he doesn't.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll stay in the car.
not_available Dad, if Richard goes to this protest in Lockheed, it's not the end of the world.
not_available It's not a page
not_available one story.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available It's an embarrassment to me and to the president.
not_available What are you gonna say to him? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available What gets to me is he doesn't know the first thing about the politics of this.
not_available He's doing it to rebel against you.
not_available Since when am I the enemy? What did I do? Nothing.
not_available Richard's acting like a spoilt child.
not_available He's gonna have to grow up someday.
not_available Audrey Raines.
not_available It's the president calling.
not_available It's the president's office.
not_available Heller here.
not_available Please hold for the president.
not_available James.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I'm thinking of raising the terror alert level.
not_available Because of the train bombing? No, not just that.
not_available Langley's picked up some chatter.
not_available We have intel on watch
not_available listed individuals who've gotten into the country.
not_available My instinct is to wait until the NTSB weighs in on the bombing.
not_available In the meantime, we can increase our state of readiness.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll take that into consideration.
not_available I'm meeting with the secretary of state and Director Shaye in a few minutes.
not_available I'll see if they feel the same about it.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello, Erin.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available I'm sorry Secretary Heller couldn't be here.
not_available It's just as well.
not_available I'm sure you were told we have a protocol in progress.
not_available So why don't we just go down the items and get it over with? That's fine with me.
not_available I'll be direct with you, Jack.
not_available I didn't like the budget your boss proposed.
not_available What's the problem? Well, this Department of Defense is asking for 85 per cent of all interagency monies, which leaves very little for CTU.
not_available If you want a bigger piece, you're gonna have to justify it.
not_available I have a proposal for you.
not_available Satellite surveillance for harbor traffic? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Problem? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's insufficient.
not_available You need to maintain bodies on the ground.
not_available Too expensive.
not_available Not if you utilize intelligence from other agencies.
not_available I am not gonna have Secretary Heller sign off on a budget that doesn't make sense.
not_available I'll talk to Heller about it myself.
not_available No, you'll talk to me.
not_available We're not doing this twice.
not_available Erin, Ronnie's arrived at Landstrass'.
not_available Where's the feed? On channel one, as soon as he sets the hidden camera.
not_available Excuse me, Jack.
not_available OK, here we go.
not_available Stand down until I give the order.
not_available Aaron, go around the back.
not_available Sean, you're gonna take the side.
not_available Hello? Can I help you? 
not_available Are you Mr.
not_available Landstrass? Do I know you? 
not_available Ronnie Lobell.
not_available I'm with Los Angeles CTU.
not_available I need to ask you a few questions.
not_available What do you know about a man named Tomas Sherek? I don't know this name.
not_available We have records of you contacting him in the last two days.
not_available Wasn't me.
not_available I run a legitimate business here.
not_available I never said your business wasn't legitimate.
not_available Look, you just can't walk in here and harass me.
not_available He's hiding something.
not_available It's being handled, Jack.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available His store's open, but the blinds are closed.
not_available There are no other employees.
not_available This guy is way too nervous.
not_available Trust me, he's hiding something.
not_available Ronnie, turn your back on Landstrass for a moment, please.
not_available It says you open at 6am.
not_available Have you been here the entire time? Yes.
not_available What's this about? Right there.
not_available Do you see that? Tell him to look for something on his right.
not_available Ronnie, on Landstrass' right, see if there's any place Sherek can be hiding.
not_available Do you mind if I look behind that counter? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Look, this is my store and I want you to walk out now.
not_available I'm not walking out until I look around.
not_available Back door! 
not_available On the ground! He's headed back to you! It's Sherek.
not_available We've got him.
not_available Great job.
not_available Remember, Dad, we're on a tight schedule today.
not_available Richard.
not_available Dad.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Aren't you supposed to be with Driscoll? 
not_available Yeah, she had to step away.
not_available CTU has just picked up a prime suspect in the train bombing.
not_available They're bringing him in now.
not_available My father's still in with Richard.
not_available I'll brief him later.
not_available I wanted to let you know.
not_available All right.
not_available That's good news.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think so.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Look About earlier I don't want you to think that that made me uncomfortable.
not_available It's just, since Teri died, I never thought I'd 
not_available Jack, it's all right.
not_available I understand.
not_available No.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available I just want you to know that I'm falling in love with you, too.
not_available Wow.
not_available You caught me off guard.
not_available Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
not_available Driscoll's coming back.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Then go.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll talk to you when I get a break.
not_available All right.
not_available What's happening with the suspect? 
not_available Ronnie's bringing him in.
not_available Who is he? 
not_available Fortunately for you, Jack, it's our problem, not yours.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm going, Dad.
not_available And there's nothing you can do to stop me.
not_available How many cars do you need to get places? I didn't come here to argue about the environment.
not_available I didn't ask you to come at all.
not_available I do not want you to attend or to speak at that rally at Lockheed this afternoon.
not_available You don't have leverage over what I do.
not_available Not since I stopped taking your money.
not_available Can't you think of anything besides yourself? If you do this, it will humiliate the president, and it will be dangerous to national security.
not_available What could be more dangerous than 2500 missile delivery systems? Spare me your sixth
not_available grade Michael Moore logic.
not_available The world is a little bit more complicated than that, Richard.
not_available We do not live in a utopia.
not_available America has enemies.
not_available Enemies who were our friends a year ago, and in another year, it'll change again, unless people stop supporting your psychotic need to control the world.
not_available Psychotic need? We serve our country! We serve the cause of freedom.
not_available What do you do? Why don't you just go back to your little motorcade and drive somewhere where people actually buy the lies you're selling.
not_available OK, look.
not_available We don't have to do this, OK? We do not have to.
not_available Fine, Dad.
not_available What do you wanna do? Do not disrespect me.
not_available I am your father! Nothing.
not_available It was my friend, not me.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Andrew.
not_available Andrew what? 
not_available Andrew Paige.
not_available Who did you tell? 
not_available I swear, we didn't tell anyone.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Don't lie to me.
not_available He just stumbled on the site and logged out.
not_available Don't lie to me! Where is Andrew Paige now? I was just doing my work.
not_available I don't Use station five.
not_available Chloe's opened up a socket.
not_available You can access the records volumes 
not_available to look at those budget numbers.
not_available OK, fine.
not_available I know this guy.
not_available Sherek? When I was here, we knew him as Jann Bolek.
not_available We linked him to over a dozen bombings in Europe in the late '90s.
not_available We weren't able to stop him from today's attack, but we did catch him.
not_available Jack, I'm sorry I was abrupt before.
not_available You helped us with the takedown.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Erin, listen to me.
not_available This doesn't make sense.
not_available I know this guy's file, he's a major handler.
not_available He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the US for a train bombing.
not_available It's not big enough.
not_available We'll consider that when we interrogate him.
not_available Give my best to Secretary Heller.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What? The original data on Sherek 
not_available was there any indication of a secondary strike? No.
not_available Everything supports that he was here for the bombing.
not_available There was a time discrepancy.
not_available What? There was some high
not_available probability chatter indicating an attack at 8am.
not_available The bombing was at seven.
not_available They didn't give a window? It was for a specific time? Yeah, but the intel was off by an hour.
not_available Driscoll thought it was close enough.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available What's your logon for Interpol overnights? 
not_available I'm not comfortable doing this.
not_available Chloe, please.
not_available You're in.
not_available Is this the source? 
not_available Yes, that's the decipher.
not_available An 8am strike, unless target deviates.
not_available Trains don't deviate.
not_available They're on a fixed course.
not_available Sometimes when Interpols breaking codes in communiqués, it won't use the exact wording.
not_available What are you thinking, Jack? Sherek didn't come here for a train bombing.
not_available Something's gonna happen at eight o'clock.
not_available That's ten minutes from now.
not_available No, Paul.
not_available I don't wanna wait.
not_available I'm gonna call my lawyer when we get back to DC.
not_available We're gonna get this divorce moving.
not_available We said take a year and see what happens.
not_available Yeah, but it's almost been a year.
not_available I don't wanna wait any longer.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Look, I gotta take this call.
not_available All right? We'll talk when I get back to DC.
not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Jack.
not_available Hey.
not_available I need to speak with your father.
not_available He doesn't want to be interrupted.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available I need to get clearance so I can interrogate the suspect in the bombing.
not_available Driscoll won't let me near him.
not_available I believe he's got information on a secondary hit, a larger one.
not_available It's supposed to take place at 8am.
not_available It's almost eight now.
not_available I know.
not_available That's why I need to speak with him.
not_available All right.
not_available Hang on.
not_available I'm gonna speak at that rally this afternoon, Dad.
not_available And it's not because I hate you.
not_available It's cos it's something I believe in.
not_available Did it ever occur to you that these people are using you? Don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason and one reason only? Because you are my son! I wish I weren't.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available Excuse me, Richard.
not_available What could be more important than intimidating me? I didn't know you were hiding in the car.
not_available Richie, why are you doing this to Dad? Can't you back off? 
not_available I'm not doing anything to him.
not_available If you go to that protest, it's gonna hurt him.
not_available Whatever it takes to stop what he's doing.
not_available Jack, if I step on Driscoll's toes and it doesn't pay off, I'll have political fallout to deal with.
not_available I understand, but I wouldn't ask if I didn't believe there was a threat to national security.
not_available Share your concerns with Driscoll.
not_available Let CTU handle it.
not_available Sir, there isn't time.
not_available It's the president.
not_available Jack, it's the president.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available I'll see you at Vandenberg.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How long have you been in Los Angeles? Who are you working with? We don't have time for this.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Unless you start giving me answers, you're gonna end up in a hole for the next 30 years.
not_available Who are you working with? Why did you bomb that train? How far can I push this guy? 
not_available We have to find out who he's working with.
not_available We should go as far as we have to.
not_available Maybe we should bring Johnson in.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available This area's off limits.
not_available Oh, I'm looking for Erin Driscoll.
not_available Jack! Jack, what are you doing? Call security now.
not_available What is happening at eight? 
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available He's jammed the codes.
not_available I am not messing with you.
not_available You are gonna tell me.
not_available What is happening at eight o'clock? Holster your weapon! Jack! I said holster your weapon.
not_available Call medical.
not_available What is your primary objective? I'll order security to shoot you! 
not_available Get that door open! What is your primary objective? Secretary of Defense! Heller.
not_available Secretary Heller? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Secretary Heller's the target.
not_available Call Secret Service now.
not_available Call now! Get a team on the way.
not_available Secret Service now.
not_available Yeah, I'll hold.
not_available The president wants us back in DC tonight.
not_available What meetings can we eject? 
not_available Not Vandenberg.
not_available The media's expecting you.
not_available Maybe we could skip Paradigm and handle that with a teleconference next week.
not_available Come on, pick up the phone! Tell the president we'll rearrange and fly back this afternoon.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Audrey, it's Jack.
not_available Are you still at Richard's? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get your father out of there now! The bombing this morning was diversionary.
not_available Your father is the real target.
not_available Get out! Target? 
not_available Audrey! Oh, my God.
not_available Audrey? On your feet! On your feet! Jack! No! Jack! Audrey! 
not_available Jack! Jack! Let her go! Let me go.
not_available Jack! Help!
