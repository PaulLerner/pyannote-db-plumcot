
not_available Tony, got a second? 
not_available What is it? I think it's time I stepped down.
not_available Here you go.
not_available What's this? Access codes to CTU and Division.
not_available You're the new CTU director, Tony.
not_available Let me out of here right now.
not_available I knowthe bomb didn't go off.
not_available I just wanted some company.
not_available Then what are you doing out here? 
not_available This is where I belong.
not_available I don't.
not_available Here.
not_available Take it.
not_available There's cougars out there.
not_available If you see one, fire a shot in the air and it'll take off.
not_available Roger Stanton confesses that he's known about the bomb for weeks.
not_available You have to trust me, David.
not_available Your presidency is in jeopardy.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available No.
not_available You'll leave now.
not_available If you resist in any way, I'll have no choice but to place you under arrest.
not_available You gotta give me your badge, Kate.
not_available No.
not_available I don't believe you'd shoot me.
not_available Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb? You can go to hell, you bastard.
not_available I'm not telling you anything.
not_available Why do you want me and my team to leave here so fast? The bomb's still here, isn't it? Initiate a grid search on every outbuilding at the airport, starting at the north end, headed south.
not_available The bomb is on site.
not_available I repeat: the bomb is on site.
not_available It's armed.
not_available How much time have we got? I can't tell.
not_available It could be any second.
not_available Let everyone know we'll be working in hangar 12.
not_available We're on standby here.
not_available Anything you need, Agent Bauer.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Right here should be fine.
not_available I need a relay here.
not_available Let me get a look at the circuit panel.
not_available They redirected the circuit.
not_available Bypass ready.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available I got it, I got it.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Let's check out that timer switch.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Adjust the flash cap.
not_available It's a little tight.
not_available Almost there.
not_available Got it.
not_available How's that? 
not_available Wait.
not_available Cap it off.
not_available I need the bypass.
not_available It worked.
not_available We're in good shape.
not_available Good.
not_available George? What are you doing here? This is what killed me.
not_available I'd like to be here when they lay it to rest.
not_available Got it diffused yet? 
not_available Notyet.
not_available They're looking at ten minutes.
not_available Is there a timer? 
not_available They haven't been able to read it.
not_available It could detonate any minute? George, they've got it under control.
not_available There's gotta be somewhere else you'd rather be.
not_available I promised myself I would see this through to the end.
not_available That's what I'm gonna do.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll just take something.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Just give me a minute, OK? Is there a problem? The trigger's tamper
not_available proofed.
not_available I should've seen it, but it was disguised.
not_available If it's dismantled or disconnected from the main casing, it'll detonate.
not_available Are you telling me that there is no way to disarm this bomb? That's what I'm telling you.
not_available Goodrich.
not_available They can't diffuse it.
not_available We'll have to fly it out.
not_available This airport doesn't accommodate jets, so find me the fastest reliable plane you can.
not_available There's a Cessna Caravan in front of hangar three.
not_available She's rock solid, cruises at 210.
not_available Get it.
not_available Northwest Regional? This is Jack Bauer.
not_available I need to speak with the president.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Did you get a look at the timer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How much time have we got? 
not_available 55 minutes.
not_available Need a ride? Where are you going? Where are you trying to get to? 
not_available San Jose.
not_available No kidding.
not_available That's right where I'm headed.
not_available Santa Clara, actually.
not_available It's just a few minutes past San Jose.
not_available Know what? That's OK.
not_available I'm fine, thanks.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Then get in.
not_available No point wandering around in the night.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available One second you need a ride, nextyou don't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's nice thatyou pulled over.
not_available It's just that Get back in the car now.
not_available You don't know howto use that thing.
not_available Get back in the car and keep driving.
not_available Bitch! Sir, when will you have a decision? When will the plane be ready? 
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available I'll get backto you before then.
not_available In the meantime, prepare for the two possibilities we discussed.
not_available And coordinate with the FAA.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I want maps and charts for both scenarios.
not_available Pacific Ocean here, desert here.
not_available We're ready to assemble.
not_available I'll get backto you when we have a final decision.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I wish I had more faith in the reliability 
not_available Bestyou can, Mike.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll discuss consequences of detonation in the Pacific Ocean.
not_available Lynne will do the same for the Mojave Desert.
not_available In the time available, the plane can get roughly 80 miles offshore.
not_available If it splashes down just before detonation, the bomb will go off underwater.
not_available The ocean will absorb a large portion of the radiation.
not_available However, prevailing winds would blow a moderate level of fallout back over the city of Los Angeles.
not_available Over time, there would be a high incidence of cancer and other radiation
not_available related diseases.
not_available But there'll be no immediate casualty.
not_available We can't be certain.
not_available The shipping lanes into the port of Los Angeles are extremely busy.
not_available In the 80 square miles off the coast of LA, the Coast Guard counts two dozen freighters flying flags from around the world, plus an unknown number of unregistered fishing or pleasure vessels.
not_available It's likely that one or more of them would be sunk or capsized by the blast.
not_available What's the impact on the environment? The blast will wipe out a substantial pocket of biodiversity.
not_available Keystone species would be exterminated, the food chain would be contaminated, and the regional ecological infrastructure would collapse.
not_available Marine resources such as offshore drilling, commercial fishing, even recreational beach usage would become hazardous or impossible for many years.
not_available The ecological and economic effects, Mr President, would be devastating.
not_available What about the desert? 
not_available We can designate a ground zero.
not_available It's isolated, so inhabited areas won't be immediately affected.
not_available Towns could be evacuated within hours without any serious long
not_available term effects.
not_available We can't rule out the possibility of isolated campers and hikers, who would be killed or contaminated by the blast.
not_available If the wind shifts substantially during the next few hours, it could blowfallout over Las Vegas.
not_available The best meteorological projections indicate that that is a very, very slight possibility.
not_available Long
not_available term effects? An area of a few square miles around ground zero would be highly radioactive for decades, but the truth is we don't get food or any significant resources from the desert anyway.
not_available So the overall health risk is relatively small.
not_available Sounds like the desert's our best option.
not_available Yes, sir, we do agree with that.
not_available But there is one more thing.
not_available In the desert, ground zero has to be a precise location.
not_available A depression, below sea level and surrounded by mountains, so it could hopefully contain the fallout.
not_available Potential target sites are being researched as we speak.
not_available All right.
not_available Point is, the airplane isn't a military craft.
not_available It doesn't have any of the equipment needed to deliver a payload accurately.
not_available To ensure the necessary level of precision, a pilot will have to go down with the plane.
not_available It's a suicide mission.
not_available Why can't we push it out the side door? It's too imprecise, sir.
not_available If the pilot is flying low enough to ensure accuracy, he would be killed by the blast.
not_available One man dies, Mr President, to ensure the safety of millions.
not_available Jack? Mr President? 
not_available The desert.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Jack, my people tell me that the pilot has to die.
not_available CTU came to the same conclusion.
not_available The bomb has to be put down on specific coordinates.
not_available I'm sorry, but there isn't another way.
not_available Do we know who the pilot will be? We have a few volunteers, sir.
not_available All of them good men.
not_available Whoever it is, tell him he has the undying gratitude of every citizen of this country.
not_available And tell him we will take care of whatever family he leaves behind.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I will.
not_available I'll be standing by, Jack.
not_available Call me back when the plane's in the air.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Funny, I don't see any volunteers.
not_available When was the last time you flew a plane? I can get it in the air and put it down, George.
not_available So can I.
not_available I'm current, I'm instrument
not_available rated, and I'm gonna be dead by the end of the day.
not_available Problem is, you could be dead any minute.
not_available I can hang on for another half
not_available hour.
not_available If you blacked out and it went down before it got to the desert, a lot of people will die.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available I know whatyou're trying to do.
not_available But I gotta say no.
not_available Agent Goodrich, this is Bauer.
not_available They chose the desert.
not_available I wantyou to clear air space and start immediate evacuation now.
not_available Gentlemen! Load this bomb.
not_available We are a go! 
not_available It's not rated as a priority.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Just do it, all right? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right, Mr Auda.
not_available Wait here a second.
not_available We'll be right with you.
not_available Agent Graves.
not_available Tony Almeida.
not_available We've been expecting you.
not_available They told you what's in the case? 
not_available Personal effects from Ali's safe house? Who's he? His name is Yusuf Auda.
not_available His government assigned him as a liaison.
not_available They gave us information that got us in the safe house.
not_available We couldn't refuse to bring him.
not_available Do you trust him? 
not_available Right now? I don't trust anyone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take the case and bring it into that conference room around the corner.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tony Almeida, Director of CTU.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Must have had some trip.
not_available You were 10,000 miles away this morning.
not_available I'm ready to get backto work.
not_available I understand analysis needs to be done on things seized from Syed Ali's apartment.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Our lab needs to do some preliminary work first.
not_available I'll have somebody getyou coffee.
not_available I'll be with you in a moment, OK? Thank you.
not_available The lab is ready for decryption.
not_available Good.
not_available Look, I might need somebody to do a little handholding here.
not_available That man's name over there is Yusuf Auda.
not_available Officially, he's a visiting intelligence agent entitled to full cooperation.
not_available Unofficially, I don't want him to see anything he doesn't need to see.
not_available Make sure anybody you assign understands.
not_available Sure.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm gonna deal with this Mr Auda myself.
not_available If you need any help, call Jacobs.
not_available Tony told you to assign someone to Auda.
not_available I'm assigning myself.
not_available You're still not comfortable working with me, are you? Just do your job, Carrie.
not_available So, what have we got? 
not_available Most of it's innocuous.
not_available There is one thing.
not_available This was well
not_available concealed.
not_available Obviously it was of great importance to Ali.
not_available We tried to read it, but it's encrypted.
not_available We don't have that technology in the field.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll get our people on it right away, see what they can find.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sure.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, have you found Kim yet? 
not_available No.
not_available We're still working on it.
not_available I'm running out of time.
not_available I understand, but we got our hands full.
not_available If you could wait until the plane takes off 
not_available Tony, I'm flying it.
not_available What?! I'd like to speak with my daughter while I still got time.
not_available There's gotta be somebody else to fly it.
not_available Somebody that doesn't have a family or at least no kids.
not_available I didn't have time to take a census.
not_available I can't order anyone to do this.
not_available Please, Tony, you've gotta find her.
not_available I'll find her.
not_available Tony, one other thing.
not_available Yeah? In my apartment, there's a safe.
not_available Inside is my will and a letter I wrote to Kim in case something ever happened to me.
not_available I'll make sure she gets it, Jack.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available You all right, honey? 
not_available I could use a lift.
not_available What are you doing way out here? I was on a date and we parked.
not_available He got a little out of hand, so I got out.
not_available Hop in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I really appreciate this.
not_available Where would you like to go? I have an aunt in San Jose.
not_available You were on a date, it didn't work out, so you're going to your aunt's in San Jose.
not_available Honey, your business is your business, but I'm not an idiot, OK? I know.
not_available It's just been crazy, and it's a long story, and I'm kind of in a little bit of trouble.
not_available If you have a cellphone, I actually really need to make a call.
not_available To whom? 
not_available My father.
not_available We synchronised this with the timer on the bomb.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good luck.
not_available So the plane has some automatic pilot thing? Actually, no.
not_available It'll have to be flown out to a very precise location.
not_available So the pilot Oh, my God.
not_available Who's it gonna be? Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack! I'm sorry, Miss Warner, butyou're gonna have to stay here.
not_available Cessna 47 Fox requesting immediate takeoff.
not_available 47 Fox, you're clear on runway three.
not_available Roger that, tower.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Here's your preliminary draft for your statement tomorrow.
not_available Yes.
not_available Right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How's the plane doing, Mike? 
not_available It's at 3,000 feet and climbing.
not_available Out of the city yet? It's too soon for that, but they'll clear the main population centres in ten minutes.
not_available This is a good start, but I want to go over it again.
not_available Call Davis.
not_available I want him to get Air Force One ready as soon as possible.
not_available Sir? Do you mind if I ask where you're going? 
not_available Los Angeles.
not_available Mr President, if I may speak frankly, I'm not sure that's a good idea.
not_available It may be a little too "hands
not_available on", for lack of a better term.
not_available The people want to feel thatyou're managing events, not caught up in them.
not_available And, in any case, I doubt if the Secret Service will even hear of it.
not_available Secret Service works for me.
not_available I don't work for them.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Sir, I do agree with Mike.
not_available Once word gets out that this bomb has gone off, there's bound to be civil unrest.
not_available I don't think you should be associated with that.
not_available The whole country will be traumatised by this bomb, especially the people in Los Angeles.
not_available I'm gonna reassure them that everything is under control.
not_available Understood? Yes, sir.
not_available I'll call Davis immediately.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We'll leave for the airport now.
not_available Mike, who ended up flying the plane? Did you get a name? Yes, sir.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available I'd have told you sooner, but I figured you had enough on your mind already.
not_available Cessna 47 Fox, climb to 10,000 feet, 08
not_available niner.
not_available Roger.
not_available 08
not_available niner.
not_available 10,000 feet.
not_available Expect final vectors in five minutes.
not_available I copy.
not_available Agent Bauer, I've got Tony Almeida.
not_available I'm patching him through.
not_available Hold on one second.
not_available Jack, can you hear me? 
not_available Yeah, I can hear you.
not_available We found Kim.
not_available She's on the other line.
not_available Thank you, Tony.
not_available Good work.
not_available Have you told her anything? No.
not_available I didn't know if you'd want me to.
not_available OK.
not_available Put her through, will ya? 
not_available All right.
not_available Kim? 
not_available Dad! Finally.
not_available Oh, my God, are you OK? 
not_available I'm OK, sweetheart.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yes, I'm fine.
not_available Thank God.
not_available You've had a hell of a day, haven'tyou? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's that noise? Where are you? 
not_available I'm in a plane.
not_available A plane? Why? There's something I've gotta tell you.
not_available It'll be hard to hear, so I need you to stick with me.
not_available We found the bomb.
not_available It was wired in a way that made it impossible to diffuse it.
not_available We needed someone to fly it over the desert, so when it exploded nobody would get killed.
not_available That someone turned out to be me.
not_available How are you getting off the plane? I'm not, sweetheart.
not_available The bomb has to be dropped in a very specifiic area.
not_available There was no other choice.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But Dad? Dad, no! No, you can't do this to me! 
not_available Kim.
not_available There has to be somebody else! 
not_available I didn't have any other choice.
not_available Kim, I need you to listen to me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Sweetheart, what are you sorry for? 
not_available Oh, God, everything.
not_available I've been so mean and so bad to you.
not_available Honey, anything that ever happened between us it was never your fault.
not_available I love you just the way you are.
not_available I don't ever wantyou to change, you understand that? I love you more than anything in the world.
not_available Kim, can you still hear me? Yes.
not_available Honey, I wantyou to live your life.
not_available I wantyou to be happy.
not_available That's all I've ever wanted for you.
not_available I wantyou to try and grow up and be the kind of person that would have made your mom proud, OK? Oh, God.
not_available Promise me that.
not_available I promise.
not_available Honey, I've gotta start focusing on what I'm doing up here.
not_available I'm running out of time.
not_available I'm gonna have to say goodbye.
not_available I love you more than anything in the world and I will always be with you, OK? Remember that.
not_available I'm proud of you and I love you.
not_available I love you, too, sweetheart.
not_available No.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available I'm sorry, honey.
not_available What do you want to do? 
not_available I gotta get out of here.
not_available What do you mean? Why? I was supposed to get out of LA, but it doesn't matter any more.
not_available No, wait a minute.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available Wait.
not_available Just wait.
not_available Call someone else.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm OK.
not_available I need to be alone.
not_available You OK? We found Kim.
not_available Jack get a chance to say goodbye? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So what'd you find? We decrypted Ali's hard drive.
not_available It's a recording of conversation that took place four months ago.
not_available Conversation between who? Syed Ali and high
not_available ranking government officials from these three countries.
not_available What we're saying is that these three countries not only knew about the bomb, but they bought it and supplied it to Syed Ali? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's what it looks like.
not_available How sure are we about this translation? We were rushed, it needs to be refined, but the substance of it is accurate.
not_available We'll need voice authentication on all four of these men.
not_available I've already got people working on it.
not_available Get Division involved as well.
not_available Northwest Regional? 
not_available Tony Almeida at CTU.
not_available I need to speakto the president about today's terrorist attack.
not_available I'll transfer you.
not_available What is it, Mr Almeida? We have a recording of Syed Ali collaborating with high
not_available ranking officials from three Middle Eastern countries in preparation for today's attack.
not_available When did this come to our attention? 
not_available Just within the last few minutes.
not_available Who else knows? 
not_available Our Division headquarters, sir.
not_available They have ties to the other agencies, which means everybody knows.
not_available I tagged it with a section
not_available four security, sir.
not_available But I did think it was important to get going on the authentication process quickly.
not_available How long will that be? 
not_available We should have confirmation in an hour.
not_available Let me ask you another question, Mr Almeida.
not_available Why would Syed Ali record a conversation like this in the first place? Half the time these people don't trust each other any more than they trust us.
not_available My guess is Ali wanted some ammunition to protect himself, in case any of these three countries ever turned against him.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you, Mr Almeida.
not_available I'll letyou get backto work.
not_available Good job.
not_available Please pass on my appreciation to your staff.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Three governments in the Middle East may be behind this bomb.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I gathered that.
not_available We could be at war soon, Mike.
not_available And once it begins there's no guarantee it'll be limited to these three countries.
not_available I've been thinking all day about something Lincoln said during the Civil War.
not_available "I don't claim to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me." It's bad enough that someone tried to smuggle a nuclear weapon in here.
not_available Worse that they succeeded.
not_available But once this bomb actually goes off, my options will narrow very, very quickly.
not_available This is Cessna 47 Fox.
not_available I have just crossed over to the low desert.
not_available I'm on final line to target.
not_available Any change in my coordinates? 
not_available Negative.
not_available They're confirmed as given.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Confirming autopilot 08
not_available niner.
not_available Coordinates are now locked.
not_available Roger.
not_available Over.
not_available Don't move! 
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available The service is bad enough.
not_available You don't have to shoot me.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? 
not_available I felt like taking a ride.
not_available Howthe hell did you get on this plane? Wasn't that hard.
not_available To them, I'm still head of CTU.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Brought something for ya.
not_available It's a parachute.
not_available I can see what is it, George.
not_available I already told you, I'm taking this plane in.
not_available That might have made sense back on the ground, but let's face it, Jack, the hard part's over.
not_available You took off, cleared the city.
not_available What's left but flying straight and level and taking it into a dive? Am I right? Unless of course maybe you wanna die.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available You've had a death wish since Teri died.
not_available The way things have been going for you the pastyear, this probably doesn't look like such a bad idea.
not_available You get to go out in a blaze of glory, one of the greatest heroes of all time.
not_available Leave your troubles behind.
not_available This could be the easy way out, huh? You still got a life, Jack.
not_available You wanna be a real hero, here's whatyou do.
not_available You get back down there and you put the pieces together.
not_available Find a way to forgive yourself for what happened to your wife, you make things right with your daughter, and you go on serving your country.
not_available That'd take some real guts.
not_available Go on, Jack.
not_available You got 12 minutes.
not_available What's it gonna be? You wanna live or not? You really think you can do this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You are absolutely sure you can do this? Jack, I'm supposed to do this.
not_available You need to maintain this heading and this airspeed.
not_available The second the LAD reads a minute and a half, you initiate a dive at a 30
not_available degree angle.
not_available Won't that get me in early? 
not_available That's the point.
not_available You have to be certain that the bomb is already in the depression before it goes off.
not_available I got it.
not_available Thank you, George.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Getyour chute on and get the hell outta here.
not_available I'm staying with you as long as possible.
not_available I got it together.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available This is not negotiable.
not_available I'm bailing out four minutes before impact.
not_available That should get me far enough away.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Patch me through to CTU.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Right away.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, this is Jack.
not_available I need you to get a helicopter in the air immediately.
not_available We got a change of plans here.
not_available I'm bailing out.
not_available George is taking the plane down.
not_available What's George doing there? We need authentication from three sources for each voice.
not_available Division has public speeches from ministers.
not_available See if you can get his voice on phone taps.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Send a chopper to trail Jack's plane.
not_available Mason got on board.
not_available Don't ask how.
not_available He'll take the plane the rest of the way.
not_available We need that chopper to pick Jack up.
not_available I'll explain later.
not_available Mr Almeida, may I know whatyou found on the hard drive? 
not_available You don't have security clearance.
not_available Mr Almeida.
not_available I and my country have shown good faith in helping you to find Syed Ali's safe house.
not_available I'm asking you to do the same by giving me some idea of what's going on.
not_available I'm sorry, but I can't tell you at this time.
not_available You Americans.
not_available We Americans what? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Come.
not_available Sir, General Bowden's here to see you.
not_available Of course.
not_available Show him in.
not_available Mr President.
not_available General Bowden.
not_available I understand the bomb is over the Mojave.
not_available It may detonate without causing loss of life.
not_available That is our hope.
not_available That's wonderful news.
not_available Congratulations on your achievement.
not_available Thank you, General.
not_available Perhaps it's appropriate to begin discussing the matter of retaliation.
not_available Go on.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The Joint Chiefs have been assuming the bomb was the work of Second Wave.
not_available It appears they had the backing of three governments.
not_available That's not definite yet, General.
not_available No, sir.
not_available I understand that.
not_available But for planning purposes, we should proceed as if it is.
not_available I request authority to activate plans to invade the countries in question.
not_available Activate? There are plans already in existence? We have plans for every conceivable contingency, Mr President.
not_available I see.
not_available So what exactly do you mean by activate? Putting the relevant military units on alert, beginning logistical operations, coordinating sources regarding the probable level of resistance to an invasion by American forces.
not_available Talk of an invasion is premature.
not_available I agree, Mr President.
not_available This is in the planning stages only.
not_available Activate your plan.
not_available But take no steps to implement without my direct authorisation.
not_available Of course, Mr President.
not_available Lynne.
not_available We may be talking about World War III.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm set.
not_available George, is there anything you want me to take care of? Oddly enough, I think I got everything squared away.
not_available I even got to spend a little time with my son.
not_available I didn't even know you had one.
not_available I'm glad you got to see him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I don't think he was particularly, but Actually, I wouldn't mind if you checked in on him.
not_available Of course I will.
not_available It's time.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr President.
not_available At this altitude, the explosion should be visible on the eastern horizon.
not_available I don't know if you want to take a look.
not_available Three, two
