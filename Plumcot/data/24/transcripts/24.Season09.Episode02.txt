
not_available What's going on out there? Got a tip that a high
not_available value suspect is here in London.
not_available NAVARRO: Jack Bauer.
not_available ERIK: The target's on the run! KATE: Bauer stayed off the grid for the last four years.
not_available He didn't do that by being careless.
not_available He's up to something.
not_available So you're saying that Bauer wanted us to catch him? He wasn't trying to get away, he was trying to get caught.
not_available This isn't about Bauer, this is about Adam.
not_available Your husband betrayed his country and he betrayed you.
not_available Forget finishing out the week.
not_available I need you to find out if anyone in this building has a prior history with Jack Bauer.
not_available Okay, I'm running the cross
not_available check.
not_available Take me to her now.
not_available JORDAN: You were right about Bauer.
not_available He does have a connection with someone being held by Special Activities.
not_available Jack, what are you doing here? JORDAN: Chloe O'Brian.
not_available She's one of those free
not_available information hackers.
not_available She was responsible for releasing over 10,000 classified DOD files.
not_available Is charged with treason.
not_available He's here to break her out.
not_available Bauer! You're done.
not_available You're not getting out of here! Come on.
not_available Put your hands behind your head.
not_available Climb.
not_available Go! Put me back in the field.
not_available I'm your best shot at getting him back.
not_available You got a signal from the transmitter that we put in her phone? Yes.
not_available This is Mark Boudreau.
not_available MARK: You don't know what Bauer did to that family, what he did to Audrey.
not_available I stood by her for three years.
not_available And I brought her back.
not_available As long as she lives, she'll never hear the name Jack Bauer.
not_available The mistake that you made in the meeting.
not_available Mark said it was nothing.
not_available That I shouldn't worry.
not_available It's progressing a lot quicker than the doctors anticipated.
not_available It's terrifying, the thought of slowly losing yourself.
not_available Wait, what? What is this? Wait.
not_available My God.
not_available Major Shepherd.
not_available Sir, you need to get away from that vehicle! Somethings taken control of my drone! No! It's done.
not_available MAN: Agent Morgan.
not_available This is everything you got off Chloe O'Brian? MAN : Yeah, there wasn't much.
not_available Prepaid from a stolen shipment.
not_available Did you check the SIM card numbers from the rest of the shipment? O'Brian's group might be using other phones from the same batch.
not_available We can run a trace.
not_available Yeah, usually we get the local police to track it down.
not_available MAN 2: Their procedures can be a little slow.
not_available Right.
not_available Never mind.
not_available I've got my own procedures.
not_available Hello? It's me.
not_available Listen, I sent you the SIM number for a mobile phone from a stolen shipment.
not_available I need the numbers from every other phone in the same lot.
not_available No, I've told you before.
not_available I won't do this anymore.
not_available It's getting too risky.
not_available This is important, Ken.
not_available It's always important.
not_available What do you think your DCI is gonna think when I tell him that you've been on our payroll for the last three years? You'd be in just as much trouble as I would.
not_available You know, I seriously doubt that.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available But this is the very last time.
not_available You've got ERIK: What is she doing here? I reinstated her.
not_available Just until we get Bauer back.
not_available I'm putting her on this with you.
not_available Sir And she deserves ii.
not_available Shes the only one who knew that Bauer was up to something.
not_available Well, she wasn't that perceptive when it came to her husband.
not_available She might be trying to prove something.
not_available That's fine.
not_available But you don't really expect me to be working with her I expect you to do your job without questioning my orders.
not_available NAVARRO: That one.
not_available CHELL: Chloe! She's back! STOSH: My God, Chloe! Chloe? We thought you'd left us.
not_available CHELL: What happened to you? Um PETE: Chloe, you look terrible.
not_available You okay? ADRIAN: Three days? Where in God's name have you been? Locked in a CIA black site.
not_available What? Um They grabbed me.
not_available I was making a supply run on my own.
not_available I was careless.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available How badly were we compromised? I didn't say a word.
not_available So they just let you go? Uh A guy I used to work with broke me out.
not_available Told me to go somewhere safe.
not_available I know that sounds crazy.
not_available Yeah, I mean, he broke you out.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Not for him.
not_available He's a former head of CTU, Jack Bauer.
not_available on.
not_available Have to shut it down.
not_available We'll have to shut it down.
not_available ADRIAN: We're moving to another spot.
not_available CHLOE: No! He's my friend.
not_available He was trying to protect me.
not_available JACK: Nobody move! CHLOE: Jack? Put your hands where I can see them.
not_available Jack, what are you doing? So, you're Adrian Cross.
not_available What is this? What's going on? No need to introduce yourself.
not_available Certainly see enough of your name in the files we take.
not_available Which one of you is Derrick Yates? I said, "Which one of you is Derrick Yates?" Yates no longer works with us.
not_available We had a clash of styles.
not_available Then you're gonna help me find him.
not_available I'm afraid I can't do that.
not_available I'm afraid you don't have any choice.
not_available ADRIAN: We always have a choice, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available That's what this organization represents.
not_available Were I to help you, what would happen to my credibility? Your credibility? I am not gonna ask a third time.
not_available CHLOE: Stop! Stop! We will help you.
not_available I promise.
not_available I will help you.
not_available I need to know what he's doing, or else I can't begin to find him.
not_available Two weeks ago I intercepted intel framing an assassination attempt on President Heller.
not_available It's supposed to take place in London here today.
not_available The only hard name I could pick out was Derrick Yates.
not_available I tracked it to this organization.
not_available Your organization.
not_available You want that on your hands, Chloe? ADRIAN: Yates got greedy.
not_available Began selling data to the highest bidder like it was some sort of auction house or something.
not_available Also I caught him hacking into military weapon systems.
not_available Why? ADRIAN: I really don't know.
not_available I knew it was time for him to go.
not_available We don't do that sort of thing.
not_available Take direct action like that.
not_available We don't We just acquire information and disseminate it.
not_available Nothing more.
not_available You make it sound like what you do is benign.
not_available We both know it isn't.
not_available ADRIAN; Do we? Get started, Chloe.
not_available I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.
not_available Pete, make sure the others have access to the closed
not_available circuit surveillance system from the London transport.
not_available Uh, okay, which ones? All of them.
not_available We'll be doing lots of back
not_available tracing.
not_available We may need to piggyback servers.
not_available Chell, pull up your facial recognition program.
not_available We'll use it for the CCTV.
not_available We're gonna be scanning for any signs of Derrick Yates.
not_available You were my friend.
not_available If you wanted my help, you should've just asked.
not_available (HIP
not_available HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, Bash.
not_available MAN: How long's that junkie bastard Yates here for anyway? He's paying his way.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available MAN: How about her ladyship? Is he paying for her, too? I said, don't worry about it.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm working.
not_available You working too much.
not_available Do you want me to send you to the other room? No! Those men scare me.
not_available Why can't we go to nice hotel? Those scary men are protecting us, baby.
not_available Who from? Speak of the devil.
not_available Yeah? Yeah, hi.
not_available Did you get it? MARGOT: I'm watching it now.
not_available Very impressive.
not_available And the Americans had no idea that you were controlling the drone? YATES: No, no, no.
not_available None.
not_available I monitored their comm traffic for weeks to find the perfect patsy, plant the evidence.
not_available Aren't you clever? So we're still on schedule? Baby I didn't hear what you said.
not_available Yeah, we're on schedule.
not_available Even with the modifications I requested? Baby, I don't care to be ignored.
not_available What? Would you shut up? Yeah, uh, yeah, ifs almost done.
not_available Is there someone there with you? I asked you a question.
not_available No.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available It's just It's the TV.
not_available You haven't told anyone else about this? About your device? No.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be at the arranged place with your money.
not_available Don't keep me waiting.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Greg, this is crazy.
not_available They won't let me talk to my wife.
not_available Let's stick to ranks right now' Lieutenant.
not_available Sit down, please.
not_available You gotta know I didn't do this.
not_available Just tell me again what happened.
not_available I was piloting the MQ
not_available 1 Predator, doing recon and surveillance for a convoy outside Kandahar.
not_available Major Shepherd's convoy.
not_available Out of nowhere, the drone suddenly banked to the southwest.
not_available I assumed computer failure, tried to abort.
not_available Systems wouldn't respond.
not_available That's when the missiles armed themselves.
not_available Missiles don't arm themselves.
not_available That's how it seemed.
not_available It was like someone else had control.
not_available So "someone else" decided to target Shepherd's vehicle right after he revoked your weekend pass.
not_available The man about whom you wrote, "I'm gonna put Shepherd down like the bitch he is.
not_available "There's only so much a man can take.â I didn't write that We got it off a military posting site you frequent.
not_available Dated three weeks ago.
not_available You think I'd be stupid enough to write something like that down? People say and do a lot of things when they're angry.
not_available Oh, come on! You know that's not me! You really think I'm a murderer? I know four people are dead.
not_available Where's my flight key? MPs took it.
not_available Check the data on it.
not_available It'll have all my keystrokes logged, back up what I'm saying.
not_available It's been checked.
not_available And crosschecked with the on
not_available board flight recorder.
not_available Every command came directly from your console.
not_available You gotta come to grips with this, Chris.
not_available But I can't help you unless you own up to what you did.
not_available You can let the MPs know when you're ready to talk to me.
not_available Greg, the answer has to be on my flight key, okay? I've been setup.
not_available I swear to God! Check it again! Just, please.
not_available They're missing something, I know it.
not_available Something that'll clear me.
not_available Greg! HELLER: I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your support on this, Alastair.
not_available I know it hasn't been easy.
not_available Well, sitting down with opposition leaders rarely is.
not_available That's why I do it as little as possible.
not_available But your presence here I believe will go a long way towards securing the votes needed for an extension on the lease of your base.
not_available HELLER: Audrey! Mr.
not_available Prime Minister, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Audrey.
not_available Yes, we know each other, of course.
not_available Thank you so much for everything you've clone for the guest list for this reception.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I do have to give my staff all the credit.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mark needs to have a word with you when you have a moment.
not_available I'm sure the Prime Minister and I can find plenty of things to talk about until you return.
not_available Thank you, Alastair.
not_available Sir, we just received word, an American drone fired a missile at one of our own armored vehicles in Afghanistan.
not_available Four people were killed.
not_available It appears one of our own pilots is responsible.
not_available Two of the dead were British officers.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available By our hand? Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available This incident is gonna wipe out the support we needed to maintain our drone base in Diego Garcia.
not_available We have to discuss the implications.
not_available I know.
not_available I think it's important that the Prime Minister hear this news from me.
not_available RON: Hold on.
not_available Agent Navarro.
not_available What is it, Navarro? NAVARRO: I've been trying to reach you, sir.
not_available There's been a situation.
not_available Bauer escaped.
not_available What are you talking about? You just apprehended him! Yes, sir.
not_available Which may have been exactly what he wanted.
not_available What? He broke out another prisoner, an ex
not_available colleague of his.
not_available It appears that Bauer's purpose for being in London was to effect that rescue.
not_available So you're saying he has no designs on President Heller? From what we know, it appears unlikely.
not_available But you can't be sure.
not_available I mean, for all you know, he may need this colleague to carry out his attack on the President.
not_available I suppose it's possible.
not_available Should I alert the Brits? No.
not_available We have enough to contend with.
not_available It is on you to reacquire Bauer.
not_available And I'd do it quickly, or you can kiss your career goodbye.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available ADRIAN: Yeah.
not_available No, that's not why I'm calling.
not_available When was the last time you saw Yates? Your friend's tattoo.
not_available CHLOE: It's Serbian mob.
not_available One slash for each murder he's committed.
not_available What the hell have you been doing the past four years? What have you got on Yates? Nothing on the Underground.
not_available We're gonna start searching block by block.
not_available Work fast.
not_available Why are you doing this, Jack? Some fantasy that if you stop the attack, save Heller, all will be forgiven? You can return back to your daughter, her family? There's no going back for me.
not_available It's not about that.
not_available I told you this is bigger than Heller.
not_available CHLOE: No, you said that for Adrian's benefit.
not_available But I know you, Jack.
not_available For better or worse.
not_available You know Heller.
not_available You know he's a good man.
not_available No, I don't know that.
not_available And you didn't answer my question.
not_available Why you? I owe him.
not_available I owe his family.
not_available You mean Audrey.
not_available Audrey and her dad are part of the same system that screwed us both.
not_available At least I'm doing something to fight against it.
not_available How? By leaking classified information? Military secrets? People are out there dying in the field, Chloe.
not_available Intelligence agencies keep secrets because what they're doing is criminal.
not_available You're smarter than that.
not_available I can see you talking, but all I can hear is Adrian Cross.
not_available You don't get to judge me, Jack.
not_available Not after what I've been through.
not_available CHELL: Hey, Stash, look at this.
not_available It's raw footage from an embedded reporter.
not_available What's going on? Ifs a friendly fire incident in Afghanistan.
not_available There's a lot of chatter on the military channels.
not_available An American drone attacked an allied military vehicle.
not_available There's four people dead.
not_available Pilot's saying he didn't do it.
not_available Says someone or something took control of the drone.
not_available CHLOE: They honestly believe that? Where was this drone piloted from? CHELL: Here in the U.K.
not_available Lower Heyford Air Force Base.
not_available Tracked through Milstar satellite system? That's the same system Yates was hacking into.
not_available Maybe that's how they plan to attack Heller.
not_available There are easier ways to assassinate a President than hijack a drone.
not_available Not if they're trying to make a point.
not_available This attack was in Afghanistan.
not_available Maybe it was a dry run.
not_available I think you should talk to someone in the government.
not_available JACK: Who? No one would listen.
not_available They think I'm a terrorist.
not_available This is our only play.
not_available We need to find Yates.
not_available He's in West Ealing, hiding in a council estate.
not_available "Projects" as you would call it.
not_available You sure? ADRIAN: Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available Very good source on this one.
not_available Here's the rub.
not_available The bloke who runs the building is a heroin dealer named Aron Bashir.
not_available "Basher" as he's known to his no doubt lovely friends.
not_available Anyway, we know he's Yates' supplier and a bit of a nasty piece of work.
not_available The address.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You can thank me by leaving and never coming back.
not_available You can't go in there blind.
not_available I can track the tower block's CCTV system, but I need to be on site.
not_available I can't ask you to do that.
not_available You're not.
not_available You're gonna need comm support.
not_available Get what you need.
not_available Let me do this.
not_available I'll get him off our back.
not_available Find Yates, and this will be over.
not_available Pull up a satellite feed, cover us from there.
not_available And get the van ready.
not_available I'm gonna call the Prime Minister.
not_available Make a formal request to speak to Parliament in session.
not_available With all due respect, sir, I don't think that's a good idea.
not_available You'll be facing a hostile mob.
not_available Already the opposition is intimating that our government is whitewashing the investigation, that certain facts of the incident have been covered up by us.
not_available General.
not_available Who was the drone pilot responsible? Lieutenant Chris Tanner.
not_available HELLER: How long would it take to get him here? Sir? I want you to bring him here and allow the Royal Military Police to interrogate him under your supervision.
not_available Sir, handing over an American serviceman to foreign jurisdiction is a violation of the Status of Forces Agreement.
not_available Please, make the arrangements now.
not_available Your protest has been noted.
not_available Sir.
not_available This gesture of transparency is not gonna get you the votes you need.
not_available But it may force them to hear what I have to say.
not_available I'm not gonna prepare a speech.
not_available I'm going to apologize from the heart.
not_available Make them realize the threat to each and every one of us if we lose this island.
not_available Sir, they do things differently in Parliament They're gonna respond to honesty, Mark.
not_available Just like the voters during the election.
not_available We were five points down in Ohio when we did that town hall meeting.
not_available You're not addressing a bunch of undecided farmers.
not_available These are practiced legislators who want blood.
not_available They're gonna shout you down.
not_available They're gonna call you a liar, they're gonna call you a murderer.
not_available It's brutal.
not_available Especially for someone who Who Who what? Someone who what? Who isn't at the top of their game.
not_available You don't think that I'm up to this? No, sir, I don't.
not_available You didn't think I was up to Ohio, either.
not_available Thanks, Mark.
not_available Hey.
not_available I just passed General Coburn.
not_available He looks really upset.
not_available What is going on? Could we have the room, please? Your father wants to talk to Parliament.
not_available I told him he'd be walking into a massacre, but he won't believe me.
not_available You've got to talk him out of it.
not_available Well, if he believes that it will work, maybe we should let him try.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available They're gonna come at him from all sides.
not_available He will not be able to handle that.
not_available So when you told me not to worry about the slip that he made earlier, were you just I meant it.
not_available But you yourself said that pressure can accelerate his decline.
not_available You know how important this is to him.
not_available Well, we can prepare him.
not_available I'll help you.
not_available We'll do a debate prep session.
not_available Audrey Mark.
not_available All we have to do is get him through this trip.
not_available WOMAN: Official word is still stressing that the strike was a tragic example of friendly fire This was you, yes? Yep.
not_available You don't feel bad? Those people were already dead.
not_available They just didn't know it.
not_available After today, doomsday clock's set at one minute to.
not_available The whole world's going to hell.
not_available End of the world? The American President's gonna die on foreign soil.
not_available Ironically, some might say poetically, killed by American drones.
not_available That ain't gonna go unanswered.
not_available Dominos are gonna fall, and we're gonna sit it all out in Greenland.
not_available Greenland? Yeah.
not_available Beautiful.
not_available Gold, ruby mines.
not_available An economy that doesn't depend on the subjugation of smaller countries.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available And in about make the exchange, I'm gonna be able to afford much more comfortable surroundings than this.
not_available But from what I know about this bitch I'm selling to, God help me if I don't deliver on time, so just shut up and let me get on with it, okay? JORDAN: No sign of Bauer yet on our first pass of the search grid.
not_available They found the vehicle he escaped in empty and abandoned.
not_available My source at the Met came through.
not_available There are two phones in the stolen shipment that are activated and close to one another.
not_available You think it might be Bauer and O'Brian? It's possible.
not_available Where are these phones now? A housing project in West Ealing.
not_available Look, I can't promise you that Bauer's there, but right now it's as good a lead as we've got.
not_available All rig ht, take a team, check it out.
not_available Basher's building is in the middle.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jack, Yates isn't gonna be dangerous, but Basher and his men are.
not_available Got it, thanks.
not_available How long is it gonna take you to access their closed
not_available circuit television? A couple of minutes.
not_available I'll let you know as soon as I'm in.
not_available Okay, I want to test our comm units.
not_available Testing, one, two, three.
not_available Got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I assure you, the United States government will conduct a vigorous and transparent investigation of this incident.
not_available The Royal Military Police will be granted full access to Lieutenant Tanner, the individual we believe responsible.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Doesn't this incident call into question your screening procedures, and, in fact, the entire drone program itself? Well, every U.S.
not_available combat pilot undergoes a thorough psychological evaluation.
not_available And I am confident in that screening method.
not_available Are the families of the murdered soldiers supposed to take comfort in that? Of course not.
not_available What do you say to the children, one as young as five, whose fathers will never come home again? They deserve an answer to that question, sir.
not_available There's never a good answer for a senseless act.
not_available So you're saying, Mr.
not_available President But I would help them understand that their loved ones were heroes in the truest sense of the word.
not_available Heroes who died fighting to make this country safe.
not_available Heroes whose names will remain in my heart forever.
not_available And to the members of this body, I would say, if you withdraw from this fight, the deaths of these three men will serve as nothing more than a call to surrender.
not_available They deserve better.
not_available Three men, sir? You realize there were four men who died in the attack.
not_available Four.
not_available MARK: Who would you like to strike from the casualty list? None of the Americans, I suppose.
not_available What'd I say, three? MARK: How about Captain Olson? He only had one child, and it was just a daughter.
not_available Mark I'm curious, can you name the other British soldier killed in this attack? MARK: You have to consult your notes? He's not important enough to remember his name? This man who you will "hold in your heart forever"? And you can't remember his name? What's his name? Damn it, Mark.
not_available I think I have a little work to do.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Lieutenant Wilkins.
not_available Married father of three.
not_available God He needs to know what he'll be up against.
not_available Audrey Looks like Basher's got two in the front, one in the back.
not_available You see anything that could tell us which apartment Yates would be holed up in? CHLOE: There are He could be in any one of them.
not_available Basher would want to keep Yates close to him.
not_available You think you could cut off the feed to the camera in the rear? Yeah.
not_available Someone might notice.
not_available I'm counting on it.
not_available Mick.
not_available BASHER: Mick Yo.
not_available Camera's playing up.
not_available Bloody hell! Bash! BASHER: What are you all standing there for? Go downstairs and help! Move! Let me know what's going on.
not_available What's all the shouting? Just get back in there and lock yourself in.
not_available Move.
not_available Now.
not_available CHLOE: I got something.
not_available Jack, fourth floor.
not_available CHLOE: Two of them coming your way.
not_available Jack, it's the second door on the right.
not_available Everybody stay calm.
not_available I just want to talk.
not_available BASHER: Lei him go.
not_available I take it you're Basher.
not_available You're the one who came to talk.
not_available What do you want? You're protecting a man named Derrick Yates.
not_available Is there any chance he can hear me right now? BASHER: Why? 'Cause I want to make you a deal.
not_available What? For him? Sorry, not really worth it on my end.
not_available No offense, Mick.
not_available JACK: Not for his life.
not_available For yours.
not_available Look, I can tell you consider yourself a pretty intimidating group.
not_available You probably think I'm at a disadvantage.
not_available I promise you, I'm not.
not_available You give me Derrick Yates, and I give you the opportunity to walk out of here without being harmed.
not_available I suggest you take it.
not_available Really? We're getting out of here! Damn.
not_available They're close.
not_available Adrian? ADRIAN: Chloe, you're about to have some company.
not_available There's a convoy headed your way.
not_available Are you sure they're for us? Definitely tourists from Langley.
not_available Closing fast.
not_available They've been tracking us.
not_available Chloe, you've got to get out.
not_available There.
not_available Right there.
not_available You in the van, come out! ERIK: Last chance! Get out of the vehicle with your hands in the air now! KATE: They can't be far.
not_available Hey! Have you seen this man in the building? Yeah, yeah.
not_available He's crazy.
not_available He's upstairs.
not_available He's got a gun.
not_available Yates, freeze! Bauer, put it down and get on the ground! ERIK: Drop the weapon now, Bauer! Don't let them go! Put it on the ground! Drop it now! I'm putting the weapon down! Just stop that couple! Agent Morgan? Please, you got to trust me.
not_available Now, you need to tell your men He's heading down! ERIK: Kate! Lock down the area! We've got Bauer! Put the weapon down now.
not_available Slowly, slowly.
not_available All the way to the ground.
not_available Up against the car.
not_available You are chasing the wrong guy.
not_available Now you seem smarter than the rest of them, so I'm gonna tell you this once.
not_available I'm trying to prevent an attack on President Heller, and you are getting in my way.
not_available Now that was a mistake.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Morgan! Jack, get in! Move over! We got a man down! AGENT: Agent down! Where'd you get the car? CHLOE: I stole it.
not_available I hotwired it.
not_available Good job.
not_available You're bleeding.
not_available It just grazed me.
not_available I'm fine, but Yates got away.
not_available Here, I got this from his CPU.
not_available What is it? Design schematics, some kind of multi
not_available channel override system.
not_available There's 10 modules.
not_available It's drones.
not_available You were right, Jack.
not_available This system can commandeer up to 10 U.S.
not_available drones.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available They're planning a full
not_available scale attack.
not_available All the evidence is here to alert the authorities.
not_available They can decrypt the data.
not_available JACK: Okay, good.
not_available No! No, no, no! JACK: What's happening? Yates embedded a self
not_available destruct program.
not_available It's erasing itself.
not_available Can you save it? Chloe, save it! Couldn't do it.
not_available It was erasing my hard drive.
not_available All I have is the piece of the schematic.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Okay, Yates was carrying a hard
not_available shell case.
not_available The device must be in there.
not_available We need to pick up his trail now.
not_available Yeah, he could be anywhere.
not_available Start with the closed
not_available circuit TVs from the towers.
not_available He was headed south.
not_available Damn it! WOMAN: Are we okay? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Looks like it, yeah.
not_available Just want to hang here a little while longer.
not_available Just to be safe.
not_available What about your work? It's all done.
not_available Just got to find a new buyer.
not_available A new buyer? Why? Guy who chased us, who do you think sent him? Margot.
not_available How do you know? Well, why pay when you can kill me and get the device for free? Devious bitch.
not_available Yeah, but it's all right.
not_available We're still gonna clean up.
not_available Plenty of people want to pay for this little baby.

not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available I've got the device, but there was a problem.
not_available What? Someone came after us.
not_available An American.
not_available I don't know who he was.
not_available I've never seen him before.
not_available We barely got away.
not_available Are you sure you're not being followed? Yes.
not_available But Derrick thought you double
not_available crossed him.
not_available Started talking about finding another buyer.
not_available So You took care of it.
not_available Yes.
