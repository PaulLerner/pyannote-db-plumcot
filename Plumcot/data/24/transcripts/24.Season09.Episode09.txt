
not_available _ You said you were going to stop your analyst.
not_available If he sees those partitions, 
not_available _ he's going to know that you're the source of intel I've been selling to China.
not_available Is there someone you can send me? I'm just a middleman here.
not_available You've been well
not_available paid.
not_available Sort it out.
not_available Steve Navarro sent you to kill me.
not_available He's the only one 
not_available _ who knows where I am.
not_available We've lost contact with six Vanguard attack drones.
not_available Take them.
not_available We now believe that they're under the control of Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Surrender yourself to me on the terms I set out and you have my word, this will be over.
not_available If a price has to be paid, I'm the one who should pay it.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, there has to be another way.
not_available I've been diagnosed 
not_available _ with Alzheimer's.
not_available If you were standing right here, in these shoes, in my position you would do the exact same thing.
not_available This is the right way for me to go.
not_available Mark, you knew? Tell me that it's not too late.
not_available It is.
not_available I will never trust you again! 
not_available _ No, never! I don't trust Your father was the greatest man I ever knew! Today he asked for one last service.
not_available I hated doing it, but I'd do it again if he asked me to.
not_available Be at Wembley Stadium in the center of the pitch in one hour.
not_available My God.
not_available He really is there.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available _ _ _ _ _ Switch it off.
not_available Audrey Your father was a was a courageous man and a dear friend.
not_available To sacrifice himself in such a way it was an act of bravery that my nation will never forget.
not_available Thank you, Prime Minister.
not_available Well, let's just hope Al
not_available Harazi keeps her word.
not_available News is still coming in about an explosion at Wembley Stadium just moments ago.
not_available Eyewitnesses at the scene are reporting that they saw a missile hitting the stadium echoing events at St.
not_available Edward's Hospital earlier today.
not_available Why would Al
not_available Harazi fire a missile into an empty football stadium? Because it wasn't empty.
not_available Kate, what's wrong? President Heller was in the stadium.
not_available What? He agreed to Margot's demands, to turn himself over he was the target.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Secret Service would never allow that.
not_available Bauer broke him out of the presidential quarters and delivered him to Wembley.
not_available This is real.
not_available The president is dead.
not_available The British Navy have just reported an explosion off the waters of Dover.
not_available Suspected light aircraft.
not_available Make that two.
not_available Margot's statement said that she would destroy the drones if Heller turned himself in, so she must be keeping her end of the agreement.
not_available Just the MLX drone left.
not_available You're sure about this? Heller kept his word.
not_available So must we.
not_available Sending it into a dive.
not_available Mahmoud is looking down on you from above, Mother.
not_available He's looking down on us all.
not_available Family meant everything to your stepfather.
not_available When he came into our lives, he gave us a purpose.
not_available Something to believe in.
not_available Something to fight for.
not_available I only wish he was alive to see this day.
not_available Something's not right.
not_available That look he gives I'm going to enhance it.
not_available What?! What am I looking for?! He
not_available he looks to the right like he just spotted something, and then a few seconds later There.
not_available That's a repeat.
not_available They must have cloned the footage.
not_available They found a way into the feed.
not_available They've tricked us Heller's still alive! Well, get that last drone back! I'm trying! 
not_available Oh, for Hurry up! I'm heading out.
not_available Meet me at the helicopter.
not_available It's all clear, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We can go.
not_available So Margot thought I was in the field when the missile struck? That was the plan, sir.
not_available Why didn't you tell me what you were doing? Because you wouldn't risk it.
not_available Well, did it work? We'll know soon enough.
not_available If Margot destroys the drones.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available The feed on five of the drones showed them in a dive and then went dead.
not_available The last one's on course to join them.
not_available So it worked? 
not_available Looks that way.
not_available She bought it, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Chloe? 
not_available Wait.
not_available Chloe, what the hell is going on? They changed the vector on the last one.
not_available It was heading into a dive, now it's going back towards shore.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available What, Jack? 
not_available She's seen through it.
not_available Jack, I'm sorry.
not_available I told you I didn't know if it would work.
not_available Okay, I want you to send the feed over to the RAF.
not_available Maybe they can intercept the last drone.
not_available Doing it now.
not_available Have you got a location on her? 
not_available I've been trying to trace the signal being transmitted from the override device.
not_available The best I can come up with is somewhere in East London.
not_available I'll start heading in that direction.
not_available Get back to me when you find her.
not_available You should've let me take the hit, Jack.
not_available I was prepared to die back there.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, if there was a chance to save your life, I was gonna take it.
not_available Five drones are down.
not_available She has one left.
not_available Which is capable of killing thousands of people.
not_available Not if we get to her first.
not_available Sir, where we were an hour ago, I consider this a success.
not_available This your guy? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Hey, take me to the president's quarters.
not_available Sir, we can't do that.
not_available Margot Al
not_available Harazi knows you're alive.
not_available You need to stay dark.
not_available I listened to you before, Jack.
not_available I'm not listening to you again.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, please.
not_available Get in the car and let me do what I know how to do.
not_available No phones.
not_available She might be running a voice recognition scan.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as we're clear.
not_available Got it.
not_available Hand me your phone, I'll call the Secret Service.
not_available They'll come and pick me up.
not_available Jack said no phones.
not_available I am the president of the United States of America and I just gave you an order.
not_available I am not American citizen.
not_available This is not America.
not_available Morgan.
not_available Kate, this is Jack.
not_available I need you to patch me through to General Coburn in the president's quarters.
not_available I need the president's entire staff to be able to hear me.
not_available You got it.
not_available It's Bauer.
not_available He wants the president's staff in on this call.
not_available Despite the prime minister's advice to stay indoors, an unprecedented number of people are queuing for trains out of London.
not_available Well, nothing causes a panic like telling people to remain calm, does it? CIA is patching us into a call with Jack Bauer.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available You have everyone, Jack.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is Audrey there? Yes, Jack, I'm here.
not_available Audrey, your father's still alive.
not_available What? What are you saying? I was with him just a moment ago, he's fine, he's safe.
not_available We managed to get Margot Al
not_available Harazi to believe that the president was on the field when the missile struck.
not_available Her end of the deal was to ditch the drones into the sea.
not_available She took five of them down till she saw through it.
not_available She pulled the sixth one out of a dive, now it's headed back to London.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, this is the prime minister.
not_available Do we know Al
not_available Harazi's target? No, sir, I'm sorry.
not_available Can this last drone be stopped? Chloe O'Brian's sending the video feed from the drone over to you now.
not_available She's also sent it to the RAF.
not_available Hopefully they'll be able to intercept it before it gets back to the city.
not_available I'll liaise with our Chief of Defense staff.
not_available Jack, where's the president now? We can have Secret Service bring him in.
not_available No, that's not safe.
not_available She'll be monitoring Secret Service movement.
not_available The president's agreed to stay with one of my men until this is over.
not_available This is Navarro with CIA.
not_available We're getting the drone feed now.
not_available Yeah, we're seeing it, too.
not_available Jack, what do you need from us? Manpower.
not_available Look, if we can't intercept this drone, our only other play is to get to Al
not_available Harazi before she targets those missiles.
not_available Chloe O'Brian's narrowed down her location to somewhere in the East End.
not_available I'm on my way there now.
not_available All right, Kate and Erik will head out there and rendezvous with you.
not_available Anything else we can do from this end? Have your tech guys contact Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Give her whatever support she needs.
not_available She can't do this on her own.
not_available We're on it.
not_available Jack? I'm still here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Can you help Chloe trace the signal? I can try.
not_available I'm still getting up to speed with how Jordan set up his system.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is not like Jordan to leave in the middle of a crisis.
not_available Let me worry about Jordan.
not_available You and Erik get out to the East End, provide Bauer with backup.
not_available I'll have a tac team follow.
not_available Okay.
not_available Got him! Time codes confirm it.
not_available Heller's alive.
not_available Who's that with him? His name's Bauer, ex
not_available CTU.
not_available How long until the drone is back in range of London? Assuming they don't shoot it down first.
not_available What, is that likely?! They've hacked into our feed, Mother.
not_available They can see everything we can! If they're quick, they can even track our signal.
not_available We're expecting company.
not_available We'll be ready for them.
not_available I should've known I couldn't trust a liar like Heller.
not_available I can still track him from after he left the stadium.
not_available We can get him.
not_available No.
not_available I want him alive.
not_available I want him to see what happens next as a direct result of his cowardice.
not_available Set a course for Waterloo Station.
not_available Shall I lock in the targeting coordinates? Not yet.
not_available Not until it's too late to do anything about it.
not_available Every life lost will be on his conscience.
not_available _ Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available I'm circling over the East End.
not_available Have you got a fix on Al
not_available Harazi's position? The signal from the device is pinging off three different cell towers.
not_available The best I can do is measure the time lapse between each tower.
not_available That only gives me an approximate location somewhere in Hackney.
not_available Damn it, we need more than that! Jack, let me try something.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I was wondering if I'd ever hear from you again.
not_available Margot still has control of one of the drones.
not_available It's heading towards London.
not_available I need you to help me to stop it.
not_available Sorry, we've been over this.
not_available Even if I wanted to help your friend Jack, there's really nothing you or I can do.
not_available Actually there is.
not_available And you wouldn't be helping Jack.
not_available You'd be helping me.
not_available I think there's a way to locate the device.
not_available I'm monitoring the tracer's signal.
not_available I've narrowed down the location to somewhere in East London.
not_available But I can't pinpoint it exactly.
not_available Do you have a way to do that? Actually I have been trying out this new GPS spoofer.
not_available Hacks straight into the Navstar satellite.
not_available And there's no reason why I can't modify that to find the signal.
not_available I'll send you the data.
not_available I already have your laptop mirrored in the background.
not_available Got everything I need.
not_available It's working.
not_available Might send a few motorists the wrong way, but if you're sure it's for a good cause.
not_available Got it.
not_available Let me know what happens.
not_available Copy.
not_available Jack, we've narrowed down the signal to an office block in Dalston.
not_available "Tundel House." Kate, did you get that? Yeah, I know it.
not_available We're not far.
not_available What floor is she on? If you want a more exact location, you need to cut out the noise.
not_available What are you talking about "noise"? Phones, Wi
not_available Fi, satellite TV those all create interference.
not_available So if we cut off the electricity to the building, can you do it? Yeah, I guess, if she's running an uninterrupted power supply.
not_available There's got to be a dedicated electrical junction that serves the building.
not_available Find it.
not_available We're approaching the building now.
not_available Get ready.
not_available Margot may have set up a perimeter.
not_available Jack, we're taking fire! Half a dozen guards at the entrance! They're here.
not_available There's a gated
not_available off area at the south entrance.
not_available This might be what you need.
not_available Kate, I need you to take out that electrical junction box so Chloe can get an exact fix on Margot's location.
not_available Yeah, I see it! I'm gonna make my approach and land on the roof.
not_available The drone is closing in on London.
not_available Erik, I need a grenade.
not_available Got it.
not_available Can you get us closer? Go.
not_available Go, go, go, go! They're coming in.
not_available Do we still have control of the drone? The override device is running on backup power.
not_available We'll be within range of London in the next five minutes.
not_available Lock in the coordinates for Waterloo Station.
not_available Power just came on.
not_available Did you get it? Fifth floor, middle suite, Jack.
not_available Copy.
not_available Kate, are you inside the building yet? Negative.
not_available Jack, backup's just arrived.
not_available We got a fixed location.
not_available She's on the fifth floor.
not_available I'm taking heavy fire.
not_available I got to find a new way in.
not_available Jack, they've started the targeting protocol.
not_available You don't have long.
not_available They're locking in a target.
not_available Where is that? _ This is the prime minister.
not_available I need an immediate evacuation of Waterloo Station.
not_available Jack, the drone is set to hit Waterloo Station.
not_available It's three minutes outside of targeting range.
not_available Engage fire.
not_available Moving back upstairs.
not_available Cover me.
not_available Targeting complete.
not_available If we're going to go, it has to be now.
not_available We don't leave until it's done.
not_available The coordinates are locked in.
not_available I've programmed the missiles so they'll fire as soon as they're within range.
not_available We don't have to be here.
not_available Well, I want to be sure.
not_available Fine but you don't need me.
not_available Sit down, Ian! Your stepfather stood for a cause.
not_available He didn't back down, he didn't run away.
not_available He was prepared to die for what he believed in, and so should we.
not_available You're right.
not_available We succeed or die together.
not_available For Mahmoud.
not_available I love you no matter what happens.
not_available Remember that.
not_available No! How long do they have? About 30 seconds.
not_available They're not gonna make it out in time.
not_available I got Margot Al
not_available Harazi in custody and the override device.
not_available What now? 
not_available The missile's launched.
not_available What? You can divert it, Jack.
not_available It's laser
not_available guided.
not_available Look for a targeting inlay.
not_available You can use that to redirect the drone trajectory.
not_available _ He did it.
not_available Hundreds of people died today because of you and Heller.
not_available You think you've won, but this is all on your head.
not_available The only death tonight on my head is yours.
not_available So, what's your name? Belcheck.
not_available Belcheck what? Belcheck.
not_available Just one word, like Madonna.
not_available We have POTUS.
not_available Repeat, we have POTUS.
not_available Hands above your head! Now! Gentlemen show this man respect.
not_available He's with me.
not_available Let him go.
not_available I thought I'd lost you.
not_available I'm so sorry I put you through this.
not_available That was a damn foolish thing to do, Jim.
not_available But I understand your reasons.
not_available On behalf of a very grateful nation, I thank you.
not_available I'm sure if the circumstances were reversed, you would've done the same thing, Alastair.
not_available Mark.
not_available I put you in a bad spot.
not_available I'm sorry, my friend.
not_available Like everyone else, I'm just happy you're safe, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Have we heard from Jack yet? CIA has confirmed Ian and Margot Al
not_available Harazi are dead and Bauer is in possession of the override device.
not_available Get Jack on that phone for me.
not_available Straightaway, sir.
not_available I want every hard drive, I want every terminal.
not_available Everything goes with us.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's me.
not_available I'm safely in the office, and I have you to thank for it.
not_available I want to thank you for looking after me.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it was my honor.
not_available Sir, we're getting ready to head back with the override device.
not_available We need to get this thing analyzed, know what we're really dealing with.
not_available I'll send someone to meet you there.
not_available Thank you, General.
not_available You're with me.
not_available Good work.
not_available I'll see you back there.
not_available Agent Morgan.
not_available Hi, Kate, it's me.
not_available I've got something for you.
not_available Thought you were through supplying me with information.
not_available This is different.
not_available I'm at a motorcycle repair shop in Camden Lock.
not_available I'm stood next to two dead bodies, and I believe one of them to be yours.
not_available What do you mean? We found State Department credentials on him.
not_available Jordan Reed? What's wrong? You there, Kate? Uh, yeah, I'm
not_available I'm here.
not_available Do you know this guy? What happened? Looks like they were both shot.
not_available There's no ID on the second body.
not_available All right, I'll be there as soon as I can.
not_available Morgan, what's wrong? It's about Jordan.
not_available Someone finally hear from him? He's dead.
not_available What? How? I don't know the details.
not_available I have to go to Camden and find out what's going on.
not_available I'm coming with you.
not_available Navarro.
not_available I just got a call from one of my police contacts.
not_available They found Jordan, Steve.
not_available He's dead.
not_available What? Jordan's dead? K Kate, what happened? I don't know, but they found his body in Camden.
not_available Erik and I are gonna go over there and find out what's going on.
not_available What was he doing out there? I'm not sure, but they said that they found two bodies.
not_available Two bodies? What Who was he with? I don't know.
not_available I'm I'm gonna go find out.
not_available I'll call you when I have more information.
not_available Sir? What's this about Jordan? Not right now, Gavin.
not_available I was just phoning you.
not_available I have a problem.
not_available The police just found the body of the analyst that was digging around Adam Morgan's files.
not_available They found another body along with it.
not_available If it's the operative I sent to kill him, he can be traced back to me.
not_available I'm just the middleman in all of this, remember? As I said.
not_available You once told me, if I needed to get out of here, that you would help me.
not_available Well, I'm asking now.
not_available I need money, paperwork and safe transport.
not_available I'll need something in return.
not_available What is it? I understand the override device is on its way to you.
not_available What do you know about that? Just bring it to me.
not_available No, all of the drones have already been grounded.
not_available That device is completely useless.
not_available What do you want with it? Oh, again, best you don't know.
not_available Just bring it to me.
not_available And, um, I'll make sure you have everything you asked for.
not_available Look, that thing's gonna be on lockdown as soon as it arrives here.
not_available I can't just walk out with it.
not_available You're in charge, you'll find a way.
not_available Ring me when you have it.
not_available CIA One, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available We are less than five minutes out.
not_available Device is in hand.
not_available Lads, can we have a minute? This your guy? That's Jordan Reed.
not_available Morgan, you okay? What happened? Got bloodstains over here and here.
not_available Looks like that wrench was used as well.
not_available You can tell from the trauma wounds on the guy's skull.
not_available There's a blood trail outside, as well.
not_available I'd say Jordan was shot somewhere else, they both ended up in here, struggled, he somehow got the gun, but he died from the knife wound.
not_available They killed each other? 
not_available Well, both weapons are accounted for.
not_available I don't think we're looking for anyone else.
not_available So who is he? I don't know.
not_available There's, uh no ID on the body.
not_available There isn't even any labels on his clothes.
not_available Sorry, I've got to take this.
not_available Hello.
not_available What was Jordan into? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Nothing that I know about.
not_available Give me your phone.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm going to run his fingerprints through the database, see if I can find a match.
not_available I want to find out who this guy is and why he wanted to kill Jordan.
not_available Jack, where are you? Just getting back to the CIA station.
not_available I've got the override device.
not_available I want you to take a look at it.
not_available Chloe? Chloe, can you hear me? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I I heard you, Jack.
not_available I I'm not coming.
not_available Margot's dead, and it's not my problem anymore.
not_available Chloe, what's going on? Where are you? Jack it was good to see you today.
not_available Like old times.
not_available I hope you get back to see your family soon.
not_available Chloe? Chloe?! You all right? Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what? Another chance.
not_available Is that it? General Coburn's sending over a DOD tech to analyze it.
not_available He just got here.
not_available This needs to be locked down in a secure room.
not_available Any possible breach needs to be identified and addressed before a single drone is put back in service, understood? Mariana, take this gentleman to the tech room.
not_available Give him any assistance he may need.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When are you expecting Agent Morgan back? She's out in the field.
not_available One of our agents was killed.
not_available What? Jordan Reed, our comm chief.
not_available They found his body over in Camden.
not_available He'd been away from the station for a couple of hours.
not_available What were the circumstances? We're trying to establish the details.
not_available He didn't tell anyone where he was going.
not_available Do you think this is connected to Al
not_available Harazi and the device? I don't know.
not_available Until we get an update from Kate and Erik, we just don't know.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Morgan.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available What the hell happened? We're still trying to put the pieces together, but the guy that Jordan shot didn't have any ID on him, so Erik's running a fingerprint scan right now.
not_available You didn't tell me there was another body.
not_available We're getting the news same time as you, Jack.
not_available Scan threw back an O Code.
not_available Classified.
not_available Jack, did you get that? Yeah.
not_available An O Code means that he was a covert operative.
not_available His identity is protected.
not_available Kate, your man was taken out by a professional.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available Jordan was a techie.
not_available He didn't have anything to do with this kind of stuff.
not_available Can you find out who this operative was, Jack? Send me over the fingerprint scan, I'll see what I can do.
not_available Okay, I'm on it.
not_available What are you doing? I'm gonna send the scan over to an old CIA contact I had at Langley.
not_available If anyone can break the O Code, he can.
not_available We can take care of that here.
not_available Good.
not_available You have your man do it, I'll have mine.
not_available We'll see who gets it done first.
not_available Come on.
not_available How long do you think that'll take? If he agrees to do it, not long.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey, it's Jack.
not_available Did you manage to get anything off that print? No, it's still running.
not_available Didn't get anything from the main database, but if he's covert ops, like you suspect, then that's not surprising.
not_available I'm in the secure database now, so let's see if we can get a match.
not_available I'll get back to you when I get a hit.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What can you tell us? All military defense systems use a common architecture.
not_available They basically work off a 2048
not_available bit encryption.
not_available What we're dealing with here This looks like it was designed to break through the firewall.
not_available To do what? Worst case scenario? Anything you want.
not_available Unlimited access to any defense system out there.
not_available This isn't just about drones.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to take this.
not_available Audrey? I
not_available I wanted to call and and thank you.
not_available Personally.
not_available Audrey, a lot of people are involved in stopping those drones.
not_available That's
not_available that's not what I'm talking about.
not_available I I
not_available I know that he was willing to sacrifice himself, and I know that you would never let that happen.
not_available And that means a lot to me.
not_available I'm not ready to lose him.
not_available Hold on one second.
not_available Audrey, I got to take this call.
not_available Oh.
not_available Right.
not_available I'll find you as soon as I can, okay? Of course.
not_available Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available We have a hit.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I want to log on.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available Who is he? James Harman.
not_available That mean anything to you? No, nothing.
not_available Oh, covert ops.
not_available Top level assassin.
not_available Deep in the program until a failed mission in Cairo a few years ago.
not_available Who was he associated with? Find me his handlers.
not_available Uh, four reporting seniors.
not_available Russell Whittaker, Floyd Birmann, Roland Spaeth, Steve Navarro.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Got a report of a possible security breach.
not_available I need you to lock this area down.
not_available No one comes through here, you understand? Yes, sir.
not_available Shut it.
not_available Make a sound, and I will kill you.
not_available Be right back.
