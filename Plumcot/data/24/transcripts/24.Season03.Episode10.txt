
not_available Julia.not_available Mr President.not_available David is wonderingnot_available why I want him to fire Wayne.not_available Wayne and I became involved.not_available They had an affair.not_available I think you'll agree, David,not_available you wouldn't be where you arenot_available without my support over the years.not_available I've never asked you for anything in return,not_available but I'm asking you now.not_available Fire Wayne.not_available I'm sorry, Alan, I can't do that.not_available You know me well enoughnot_available not to be surprised by repercussions.not_available Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.not_available His transponder signal stopped working.not_available We're doing all we can to reestablish contact.not_available Tell the Delta units to hold their position.not_available Do you know how to do a frequency scan?not_available 
not_available Yeah.not_available We want to pick upnot_available your father's transponder signal.not_available Michelle's begun it.
not_available Coordinate with her.not_available I have a message from Jack.not_available The virus they're going to buy,not_available Jack is going to take it from them.not_available Jack promised to get me and my familynot_available out of here if I help you.not_available Then help me.not_available There's been a complication.not_available Another buyer's interested in the virus.not_available We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder.not_available Your bid is 225 million dollars.not_available Hers is 240.
not_available Nina, you win.not_available You're of no use to us any more! You failed!not_available Ramón, don't do this.not_available Five hours ago you were in prison.not_available Now you're free because I broke you out!not_available We can get the virus.not_available How do you get the virus?not_available 
not_available The woman, Nina.not_available If I fail, you get to kill me.
not_available Fine.not_available But if I succeed, the deal will go forward.not_available We'll be back on track.
not_available We'll all get paid!not_available How many more are coming, huh?not_available Are they Americanos or federales or both?not_available So where are we on this?not_available Jack's last known position is here.not_available NSA says they can reposition a satellite.not_available But it'll take two orbits to get over the area.not_available That'll be too late.not_available Sporadic satellite coverage is probablynot_available why they chose that place to meet.not_available It's Hector.not_available Thread it through our system.not_available Trace this on all the networks.not_available You'll need an explanation.not_available They haven't heard from younot_available in over two hours.not_available We're set.not_available Ortega.not_available What's going on?not_available I've been trying to reach you.not_available Nobody suspects you?not_available If they did, we wouldn't benot_available having this conversation.not_available All right, listen, we have a problem.not_available The seller double
not_available crossed us.not_available He brought in a second bidder.not_available Some woman name Nina Myers.not_available Amador held an auction.
not_available We lost.not_available So you don't have the virus?not_available No.not_available What do you want me to do?not_available 
not_available Bauer knows this woman, Nina.not_available We're going to try tonot_available get it through her.
not_available Hold on.not_available Gael, it's Jack.not_available Jack.not_available I'll give you a cellphone number thatnot_available Amador's been using for the last few hours.not_available Ping it until you get his location.not_available The number's 011525532240135.not_available 
not_available Got it.
not_available Hey, are you all right?not_available Yeah.not_available Get back to me on this numbernot_available when you've got his location.not_available One more thing.not_available Bauer's partner showed up.not_available You have him?not_available Yes, we have him.not_available Alive?not_available 
not_available Yes, for now.not_available Is he working alone, or does he have backup?not_available Edmunds is in Field Ops.not_available I don't have access to their mandate.not_available You get access, OK?not_available What are we paying you for?not_available If I try, it might blow my cover.not_available Best to keep Edmunds alive until we find out.not_available All right.
not_available Track Amador.not_available Do you have a location on Jack?not_available 
not_available Here.not_available Four miles from our last contact point.not_available Tell the Delta units to adjust their positionsnot_available and wait for orders.not_available Run a passive triangulationnot_available on Amador's phone.not_available Kim.
not_available We found your father.not_available He's undercover with the Salazars.
not_available He's fine.not_available Thank God.not_available What about Chase?not_available He's been captured.not_available Captured? Is he OK?not_available 
not_available He's alive.
not_available They're holding him.not_available What do you mean, holding him?not_available My guess is they're interrogating him.not_available Once we get the virus, we'll go in for Chase.not_available Thanks for not keeping this from me.not_available Sure.not_available Do you need anything else?not_available 
not_available No.
not_available Just making sure you're OK.not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.not_available Did you tell her?not_available About Chase.not_available But not about Nina?not_available No.not_available She doesn't need to know about that now.not_available Jack, how long will it takenot_available to trace Amador's phone?not_available If everything goes right, ten minutes.not_available I'll call our clients, tell them there's a delay.not_available I'll see if they're gettingnot_available anywhere with his partner.not_available Let's go.not_available Hector!not_available 
not_available Sergio, what are you doing here?not_available My sister says we're going.
not_available She's takingnot_available me and my father away from here.not_available Did she say when?not_available Soon.not_available But I don't wanna leave you, Hector.not_available I would never let that happen.not_available OK now, you go back to bed, but don'tnot_available tell your sister anything about this, OK?not_available And I'll make sure everything works out.not_available You'll talk to her?not_available 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll talk to her, OK? Come on.not_available How is Chase?not_available Holding on.not_available I'm going with Ramón to pick up the virus.not_available If you get a chance to get out of here, take it.not_available Get Chase, tell him to call CTU.not_available They can get in touch with the rescue units.not_available He'll get you and your family out of here.not_available Planning on going somewhere?not_available What do you mean?not_available Don't play games with me.not_available Don't play games with me.not_available What are you talking about?not_available Sergio was packing a bag to go away.not_available What's so funny?not_available 
not_available He was being bad.not_available Something he picked up from you.not_available I told him I was taking him away from here.not_available I was trying to keep him in line.not_available That's all? Just trying to keep him in line?not_available He said he wanted a gun like yours.not_available I said no.
not_available He got nasty,not_available so I scared some sense into him.not_available He's a good boy.not_available Don't scare him like that.not_available Don't encourage him to play with guns.not_available Jack.not_available Yeah.not_available Let's go.not_available Adam says we're back in touch with Jack.not_available We just heard from him.not_available How close are we to the virus?not_available We have the phone numbernot_available of the seller, a Michael Amador.not_available We're running a passive triangulation.not_available Then what?not_available We pass the location of Amador onto Jacknot_available and let Jack call the shots.not_available I'll bring Division up to speed.not_available Ryan, there's one more thing.not_available We found out there'snot_available another player in the deal.not_available Who is it?not_available 
not_available Nina Myers.not_available I thought we had her restricted to North Africanot_available after the president gave her exiled immunity.not_available We did.
not_available Apparently she slipped out.not_available Jack's trying to get her to help him.not_available Help him?not_available She killed his wife, that's a hard sell.not_available I don't know the details.not_available Does Kim know about it?not_available 
not_available No.
not_available I'd like to keep it that way for now.not_available All right, keep me updated.not_available I owe you an apology.not_available You don't.not_available If you thought I wasn't fit to do my job,not_available then you had a duty to report it.not_available But I wouldn't risk the effectivenessnot_available of this unit to prove how tough I am.not_available 
not_available I know that.
not_available I just feltnot_available I know what you felt!not_available You made that perfectly clear.not_available Yeah.not_available

not_available Highway 14.
not_available We can't let him get too far.not_available 
not_available OK.
not_available Get everyone ready.not_available No.
not_available You can't ambush Amadornot_available unless you're certain he's got the virus.not_available What are you saying we do?not_available 
not_available Let him lead us to Nina.not_available When we're surenot_available they have the virus, we go in.not_available But not with an army of men.not_available You have to let me go alone.not_available You're not going anywhere alone.not_available I'm not letting you out of my sight.not_available We go together.not_available Hector, you're better off here.not_available And make sure that everyone's ready,not_available just in case.

not_available Sure.not_available Julia.
not_available It's been a long time.not_available Hi.not_available Thanks for meeting me.not_available My husband's tryingnot_available to force the president to fire you.not_available There's much more at stake herenot_available than just my job, you know.not_available It's about my brother being able to runnot_available his administration the way that he sees fit.not_available It's not fair to the people of this countrynot_available for the president to be extorted.not_available I do love it when you get all noble.not_available Julianot_available What am I supposed to do?not_available All of this is out of my control.not_available No, it's not.not_available It's not, and I think you know that.not_available Everybody thinks Alan dominates you.not_available The truth is, he needs you.not_available You know that.not_available Say you'll leave him if he doesn't back off.not_available He'd never believe me.not_available Make him believe you.not_available I miss you.not_available Do you miss me?not_available Oh, what difference would it make?not_available 
not_available It could make a lot of difference.not_available Julia, stop it.
not_available We can't.not_available Do you think of me?not_available 
not_available Don't do this.not_available It's a simple question.not_available Do you think about me?not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I think about you.not_available But it doesn't mean anything.not_available I think about you.not_available And it does mean something.not_available 
not_available I didn't come here for this.not_available You came here becausenot_available you wanted something.not_available I want something, too.not_available I like being Mrs Alan Milliken.not_available But that does not have to havenot_available anything to do with you and me.not_available Come back to me.not_available That's what I want in return.not_available It worked once, it can work again.not_available It never worked.
not_available Not for me.not_available Then I'm afraid I can't help you.not_available Talk to me, you bastard!not_available No! not_available What you don't understandnot_available What you don't understand is if you don't talk,not_available Hector will take it out on me.not_available Talk to me!not_available Eduardo, back off!not_available Hector thinks he might talk to me.not_available Tell these men what they want to knownot_available and your suffering will end.not_available You won't be killed, I swear.not_available Why should I believe you?not_available Because if you don't, they'll burn you alive.not_available He's a stubborn one, isn't he?not_available We can handle him.not_available Check his pockets.not_available He's got a phone.not_available There's a gun on the table.not_available What are you doing?not_available I've got to stop the bleeding or I could die.not_available Come on, we have to go.not_available Give me the gun.not_available Stay down, Sergio.not_available

not_available Thank you.not_available Chloe.not_available Are Delta teams in position yet?not_available Yes, they're in the area.not_available Soon as we say, they'll pick up Chase.not_available Make sure everyone knows this isnot_available subordinate to obtaining the virus.not_available It's in the brief.not_available Once we have Chase,not_available link in Division, Districtnot_available and the Attorney General's office.not_available A lot of people want answers from him.not_available What was that?not_available Nothing.not_available Is this your child?not_available Yes.not_available She hasn't been interfering with work.not_available Technically there's no rulenot_available There's no rule because it's common sense.not_available Now get rid of it.not_available If I could, I would.not_available My baby
not_available sitter hit me with somenot_available very unprofessional behavior.not_available I want the baby out of here, Chloe.
not_available Now.not_available Or find someone else to do your job.not_available Parents are a protected group,not_available Mr Chappelle.
not_available This is not fair.not_available Amador's stopped about 200 yards upnot_available a dirt road that intersects with Highway 14not_available about two miles west of Rancho Guadalupe.not_available OK, good work.
not_available We'll find it.not_available Amador stopped half a mile up the road.not_available 
not_available What do we do?not_available Nina is either with him now, or she will benot_available any minute.
not_available We need to isolate her.not_available Let me see the night scope.not_available One two three.not_available OK, I'm ready to go in.not_available I told you.not_available I'm not letting you out of my sight.not_available Ramón, I am trained to do this.not_available If I go in myself, I might succeed.not_available If we go in together, both of us will get killed.not_available How long?not_available As long as it takes.not_available You'll have to trust me.not_available I want this money as bad as you.not_available I'll trust you when we have the virus.not_available 
not_available I promise, I can make her work with us.not_available Use the night scope.
not_available As soon as I've enterednot_available the building safely, go back to the main road.not_available If Amador mobilizes his resources outsidenot_available this perimeter, we've got to be ready.not_available OK?not_available All right, go.not_available The funds are ready to transfer.not_available When do I get the virus?not_available I'll call you with the location in half an hour.not_available You'll transfernot_available 50% of the funds then, as agreed.not_available I don't like jumping through all these hoops.not_available The hoops are here to protect us, Nina.not_available Just wait here for my call.not_available Freeze.not_available Just take it easy.not_available Take it easy, I'm unarmed.not_available The Salazars wanted me to set upnot_available a meeting with your employer.not_available Nina!not_available Nina, don't move.not_available Drop the gun.not_available Get back in the church.not_available Take a seat.not_available Don't worry, if I wanted to kill you,not_available you'd be dead by now.not_available Put the briefcase down.not_available 
not_available Tony, it's Chase.
not_available He just called in.not_available All right, source the call.not_available Where are you?not_available 
not_available Our truck broke down.not_available We're 15 miles east of the Salazars' camp.not_available You should be able to lock onto this cell.not_available We've got Delta teams in the area.not_available We'll send a chopper.

not_available Claudia.
not_available Hector's girlfriend.not_available I've got her father and her brother.not_available A Delta team is ten minutes away.not_available Can you hang tight for ten?not_available I don't know, just get 'em here.not_available Sit tight, they're on their way.not_available Can you tell Kim thatnot_available Tell her I'll call her when I'm safe.not_available Yeah, you got it.not_available Claudia.not_available Jack, if you didn't come here to kill me,not_available why are you here?not_available I need to talk to you alone.not_available That's not gonna happen.not_available How much is your buyer paying you?not_available Two million, once I deliver the virus.not_available The Salazars will pay you a lot more.not_available How much more?not_available What is this?not_available Shut up.not_available This guy shouldn't be breathing.not_available I'm handling it.not_available How much more, Jack?not_available At least ten times more thannot_available what you're getting paid now.not_available Really?not_available That's a pretty great deal.not_available What if my buyer doesn't get his virus?not_available He's gonna hunt me down and kill me.not_available With that kind of money you couldnot_available disappear and never be found.not_available Yeah, and what about you?not_available The Salazars are paying me enough moneynot_available to do what I want for the rest of my life.not_available I don't believe you, Jack.not_available I think you're still working for CTU.not_available Well, you're wrong.not_available You're not the type of guy to sell out.not_available You'd do anything for your country.not_available 
not_available There was a time when that was true.not_available But what did it ever get me?not_available I lost everything.not_available When I went undercover with the Salazars,not_available I had to give them my soul.not_available When I brought Ramón Salazar in,not_available what was waiting for me? No one, nothing!not_available What about Kim?not_available She never forgave me fornot_available what happened to her mother.not_available I want to give her most of the money,not_available help get through what's happened.not_available OK, so say you are working alone.not_available I killed your wife.
not_available What's gonna keep younot_available from killing me the first chance you get?not_available I don't have a choice.not_available I broke Ramón Salazar out of an Americannot_available prison.
not_available I can never go back there again.not_available This is my one shot at a big score.not_available After that, I swear to you,not_available I just wanna disappear.not_available We've wasted enough time, Nina.not_available You kill him, or I'm calling in.not_available Fair enough.not_available What are you up to, Jack?not_available I went to see Julia.not_available What?not_available To see if she would help us with Alan.not_available And?not_available She said no.not_available Listen, I've been thinking, and younot_available don't have an alternative here, David.not_available This is my mess, I'll take the heat.not_available Let me resign.not_available I may ask you to when this is over.not_available But it won't be becausenot_available Milliken is forcing my hand.not_available Wayne, I've been doing some thinking too.not_available And there is an alternative.not_available If Milliken wants to play dirty,not_available we'll have to lower ourselves to his level.not_available By doing what?not_available Give me a moment.not_available Hello?not_available Sherry?not_available David.not_available David, what's wrong?not_available I need your help.not_available All right, I'm listening.not_available I'm downtown.not_available I need to see you tonight.not_available Tell me more.not_available I can't say much over the phone.not_available It's about Alan Milliken.not_available Fine.not_available 
not_available I'll send a car.not_available You really did break Salazar out of prison.not_available I'm not the man you knew before.not_available Well, I don't know about that.not_available But 20 million dollarsnot_available I'm gonna keep me an open mind.not_available So, Jack, if we're gonna go forwardnot_available with this, I have to know one thing.not_available Are you gonna be ablenot_available to forgive me for killing Teri?not_available If I wanted revenge, Nina, I would havenot_available killed you already.
not_available You know that.not_available It's like I said, all I wanna do is finishnot_available this deal and disappear for good.not_available Convince me.
