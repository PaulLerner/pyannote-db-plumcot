
not_available San Gabriel Island reactor's just gone critical.
not_available Core material is now airborne.
not_available I thought we had more time.
not_available At this REM rate the radiation will get stronger and will spill into the atmosphere until the core is exhausted.
not_available Son, you've done everything you can, now get out of there.
not_available Evacuating won't make any difference, sir.
not_available We've already been exposed.
not_available Jack has got to find the override before the rest of these reactors go critical.
not_available I know about you and him, and I am not OK with it.
not_available You and I aren't together.
not_available We were trying to work things out.
not_available Yeah, I tried.
not_available But you kept putting it off.
not_available What did you say to Paul? 
not_available That I'm filing for divorce.
not_available Somebody set me up.
not_available Thousands of lives are at stake.
not_available Where are the people who control the override? 
not_available Talk to me, Sarah.
not_available I'm not a spy.
not_available Erin, Powell's dead.
not_available He was hit by a sniper when we arrested him.
not_available Get anything from him before he was killed? 
not_available No.
not_available But I got his last ten cell phone calls.
not_available He called two numbers repeatedly.
not_available We traced one of them to Marianne Taylor.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Drop the weapon! Listen carefully, Behrooz.
not_available Government agents found me.
not_available I made a deal.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You're going to be OK.
not_available I'm going to help them stop your father.
not_available You broke my heart.
not_available If you kill me, Mother will tell them everything.
not_available If you don't believe me look outside.
not_available They're coming to pick me up.
not_available Drop the gun! 
not_available You'll hit the boy.
not_available Behrooz! 
not_available Mom! That stairwell leads to the basement.
not_available He's got to go down.
not_available Set up a link with CTU now! If you can't save my son, I am happy to see the reactors melt down.
not_available Did you get that? 
not_available Driscoll.
not_available Erin, it's Jack.
not_available Araz is on the move.
not_available We're ready to move in now.
not_available Dad, you're choking me.
not_available Jack, it's Jim.
not_available Bring us up to speed.
not_available We've a hostage situation involving one of the men involved in the attacks.
not_available We're pulling up his ID now.
not_available His name is Navi Araz.
not_available He was granted American citizenship five years ago.
not_available Who's the hostage? His 17year
not_available old son, Behrooz.
not_available He broke ranks.
not_available Father sees him as a liability.
not_available Araz knows we have his wife.
not_available He's worried that if he kills the boy, she'll cooperate with us.
not_available What does she say? 
not_available She'll help us find the override and stop the nuclear meltdowns if we rescue her son.
not_available So the father'll stall and keep the kid alive until the reactors blow.
not_available That's right.
not_available We already lost one in California.
not_available Can we trust this woman to help us? She'll do everything she can to protect her son.
not_available OK.
not_available Whatever you need, you got.
not_available Just get that kid.
not_available Erin, I need a thermal satellite scan of the building.
not_available We're looking for two heat sources in remote areas of the basement.
not_available I'll call you as soon as we have something.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're running out of time.
not_available Save my son.
not_available Bring her with us.
not_available We're gonna need her.
not_available I said get on the floor.
not_available You're not my son.
not_available Why? Because I don't want to kill innocent people? Because you're weak, and you stand for nothing! I always saw you as something more.
not_available And now I don't even recognize you.
not_available Will that make it easier for you to kill me? 
not_available Yes, it's me.
not_available Did you find your son? Yes.
not_available Is he dead? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Is there a problem, Navi? Government agents arrested Dina and surrounded the building.
not_available I need the boy for leverage, but I'm not sure I can hold them off.
not_available Has Dina told them anything? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available And she won't, as long as I don't kill the boy.
not_available How much more time do you need to melt down the plants? 
not_available One hour, maybe two.
not_available Why? Why so long? They have programmers trying to prevent meltdown.
not_available We have to manipulate each plant individually, and that takes time.
not_available I'll hold them off as long as I can.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available We've found Araz and his son.
not_available We have two readings in the north wing of the basement.
not_available What's there? 
not_available Laundry room.
not_available How many ways in? 
not_available One, but there's a laundry chute.
not_available Is it accessible? 
not_available From the third floor.
not_available OK.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available We got him.
not_available He's in the laundry room.
not_available I need two teams to the north wing.
not_available Set up a hard perimeter.
not_available I need a fast line and a rappelling harness.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Lee, get me Dina Araz.
not_available We're putting her into play.
not_available Got it.
not_available Where are the latest timing estimates? Right here.
not_available These are from 40 minutes ago.
not_available They update every 15.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm upset about my mother.
not_available You have to put your emotions on hold.
not_available We're in a crisis.
not_available My mother just died.
not_available I can't put that on hold.
not_available I'm sorry, that was callous of me.
not_available But I'm really depending on you now, Edgar.
not_available Please come through for me.
not_available I'll get those figures as soon as we're done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bring me up to speed.
not_available We're trying to hold off the meltdowns.
not_available How's that going? Our programmers can slow it down, but they won't be able to stop it.
not_available We still have to find the override.
not_available Jack has a suspect cornered in a medical facility, and we're fairly certain that this man is a key architect in today's events.
not_available Can we take him alive? 
not_available Unknown.
not_available Marianne Taylor? 
not_available Curtis is interrogating her.
not_available I want to call my lawyer.
not_available Really? 
not_available I do have rights.
not_available Yeah? Henry Powell had rights too.
not_available I don't know any Henry Powell.
not_available The one who helped the terrorists obtain the override.
not_available He's right here.
not_available Want to say hello? Bring him in.
not_available God, you're sick.
not_available Sick bastard.
not_available CTU didn't kill him.
not_available Well, then, who did? The people who planted the bomb under your car.
not_available They've caught up with you.
not_available Even if we let you go, you'd be dead in 15 minutes.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available Your only chance to survive is to tell us what you know.
not_available I want a deal.
not_available You get to live.
not_available That's your deal.
not_available All right.
not_available Who did you and Powell work for? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I only dealt with him.
not_available Why'd he send you into CTU? To cover his tracks if it became necessary.
not_available And after Audrey Raines saw him at the warehouse it became necessary? Yes.
not_available Did he work directly for the terrorists? Or someone associated? 
not_available I told you, I don't know.
not_available I need names who can get us to the override.
not_available I don't have any names.
not_available But I can get 'em for you.
not_available How? Powell kept a file on his computer in his office downtown.
not_available It was a An insurance policy, in case either of us ever needed a bargaining chip.
not_available Give me the code.
not_available It can't be accessed externally.
not_available It requires a thumbprint identification, either his or mine.
not_available Since he's dead, it'll have to be mine.
not_available All right, you set? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We've found them.
not_available Where? Laundry room.
not_available Our satellite picked up two thermal images.
not_available Then Behrooz is still alive? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I need you to distract your husband.
not_available I'll take you to the basement.
not_available You'll call your husband, 
not_available keep him on the line as long as possible.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available OK.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Ready.
not_available OK.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Six feet.
not_available Four feet.
not_available Three feet Stop.
not_available All right, come here.
not_available OK.
not_available Make the call.
not_available And remember, keep him on as long as you can.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's Dina.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available In the hospital.
not_available What have you told them? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available And I'll keep my mouth shut if you release our son.
not_available You know I can't do that.
not_available At least promise me you won't kill him.
not_available Navi, please.
not_available He's our son.
not_available You turned him against me.
not_available Our sacrifice is nothing compared to the martyrs who have given all for our cause.
not_available No.
not_available He can still be of service.
not_available Is he still alive? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And he will remain alive as long as you remain silent.
not_available How am I to trust you now? We planned this mission together.
not_available We thought it out with one mind.
not_available But you betrayed me.
not_available Don't tell me that! I have visual on the suspect.
not_available The boy is still alive.
not_available I'm ready to proceed.
not_available Go.
not_available Your conspiracy with him is over.
not_available I won't allow you to continue it in front of me.
not_available The boy is all I have, the only thing that keeps them from storming through that door.
not_available Of course it's true.
not_available But in the end, he'll wind up a martyr just the same Slowly retract the rig.
not_available I'm in position.
not_available ..
not_available you'll suffer even worse.
not_available You'll have to live knowing that everything you loved is dead.
not_available Your son, your brother Yes.
not_available Your brother too Don't move.
not_available Get up slowly.
not_available Put your hands on your head.
not_available Stay with her.
not_available Put your hands on your Hostiles engaged! I repeat, hostiles engaged! I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.
not_available Now get up, slowly.
not_available Interlock your fingers.
not_available It's OK, son.
not_available Just put the gun down.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over.
not_available Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Please, son, put the gun down.
not_available Hands on your head.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Yeah, copy that.
not_available Move in now.
not_available Behrooz, are you all right? I killed him.
not_available I did it, I killed Father.
not_available Your son is safe.
not_available He's alive.
not_available We did what you asked.
not_available Now where is the override? 
not_available I don't know that.
not_available I have an address where work behind the attacks was done.
not_available That's not the deal we made.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available I can only tell you what I know.
not_available What's the address? 
not_available 24878 Alvert Street.
not_available What's there? It was a drop
not_available off, the place we got our final assignments.
not_available It was the last place I saw the men who took possession of the override.
not_available When was that? 
not_available Yesterday.
not_available Send in a team.
not_available Tell them to set up a perimeter.
not_available No one goes in.
not_available You got it.
not_available These two? Until we know she's not lying, they come with us.
not_available So this Marianne Taylor claims she has to access the file personally? 
not_available Yes, she does.
not_available And do you believe her? I'm not sure.
not_available The polygraph indicates that she's telling the truth.
not_available But in my opinion, she may be a sociopath.
not_available Are you a psychologist? 
not_available No.
not_available But I have had dealings with her before.
not_available Dealings that might affect your judgment? 
not_available No.
not_available We have to check it out.
not_available Question is, how? I can spare an operative from the cyber unit, and a security team.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Curtis should go.
not_available I need Curtis here.
not_available The computer file may be important.
not_available Someone with experience needs to examine it firsthand.
not_available I agree.
not_available Send Curtis with a security team.
not_available You'll have to figure out how to do without him till he gets back.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I don't like this.
not_available Neither do I, but those are our orders.
not_available Get it done and get back quick as you can.
not_available OK.
not_available You OK? Anything you need? I'm fine.
not_available You understand, Sarah, I had no choice.
not_available You were identified as a threat to security and I acted accordingly.
not_available I would've hoped you had more faith in me.
not_available Personally, I do.
not_available But the evidence was brought to me by the secretary of defense, I couldn't ignore it.
not_available So what happens now? 
not_available You can go home and rest.
not_available No one would blame you if you did.
not_available But if you're up to it, I could use you on the floor.
not_available The San Gabriel Island reactor went into meltdown less than an hour ago.
not_available The five remaining plants are critical.
not_available I need my best people in play.
not_available I'll go back to work.
not_available Thank you, Sarah.
not_available It shouldn't be too complicated.
not_available Security is light.
not_available I have a key card for Powell's office.
not_available How long will it take? Five minutes to download the data.
not_available We're looking at a 15minute operation? 
not_available Approximately.
not_available If I think you're stalling, taking longer than you should, I will take action.
not_available You got that? Raise your leg.
not_available Don't make me do it for you.
not_available Curtis, I'm not gonna run.
not_available Then you won't mind wearing it.
not_available Can I put my foot down now? Yes.
not_available Look, I realize that after today you have a hard time trusting me, but to pull this off you have to 
not_available I don't have to do anything.
not_available Except retrieve the data your boyfriend hid, and put you in jail for treason.
not_available Is that what you really want? 
not_available Without a doubt.
not_available Curtis Get your hand off me.
not_available I spoke with Mike at the DOD office.
not_available Who do you want to bring in to help with their load? Things are too unstable for me to leave here.
not_available I checked with their logs and they're gonna need someone soon.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available I can handle it, if that's what you mean.
not_available Dad, it'll be fine.
not_available Why don't you head over there then? 
not_available OK.
not_available I'll call you from there.
not_available Sarah, you're back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I heard some rumors about what 
not_available I'll be all right.
not_available Just bring me up to speed.
not_available Sure.
not_available We're still trying to find the override.
not_available It's the only way to stop the meltdowns.
not_available What have you got out of Marianne? She has access to a computer with data about the override.
not_available Which computer? 
not_available She's taking Curtis to it.
not_available They let her out? 
not_available He's got a security team with him.
not_available And we trust her? 
not_available She's trying to cut a deal.
not_available Curtis can take care of her.
not_available We need to support Jack.
not_available Agent Bauer? Agent Solarz.
not_available Agent Almeida.
not_available Set your perimeter? 
not_available Nothing is going anywhere.
not_available Any activity? 
not_available No.
not_available OK.
not_available I want to keep this surgical.
not_available We'll be the insertion team.
not_available Your men maintain backup.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go.
not_available We're clear! 
not_available Dina must have lied.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available She wants to save her son.
not_available Then they've cleared this place out.
not_available Bring in a forensics team now.
not_available I want fingerprints.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Tony? What is it? Go.
not_available It's clear.
not_available That's the train they attacked this morning.
not_available So that's how the terrorists got a hold of the override.
not_available Jack? They planned the kidnapping here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The location Jack is searching isn't on any agency watch list.
not_available Well, I'm having a hell of a time.
not_available Why? The building's owned by a company owned by another company that's owned by an LLC.
not_available Wait, hold on.
not_available Galaxy Financial? I've heard that name before.
not_available No.
not_available I want that in a separate file.
not_available We'll handle the kidnap another day.
not_available I only want things pertinent to the override.
not_available OK, I'll have it up on the system.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available I need to talk to you I'm sorry.
not_available Just give me a minute.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack, this is Sarah from CTU.
not_available I got something on that address you gave to Edgar.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Ownership of the building is complicated, but I recognize one of the corporations.
not_available Which one? 
not_available Galaxy Financial.
not_available Never heard of it.
not_available Neither did I until this afternoon.
not_available When Paul Raines came in I ran his clearance.
not_available What does he have to do with the company? 
not_available He's a general partner.
not_available Audrey's husband owns the building used to plan this morning's attacks? 
not_available According to this, yes.
not_available Where's Audrey now? 
not_available She's on her way over to DOD.
not_available Patch her through to me.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available This is Sarah from CTU.
not_available I've got Jack.
not_available Hold, please.
not_available All right.
not_available You're on.
not_available Audrey, it's me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you find anything? 
not_available The building was used to plan the attacks.
not_available That's a great find.
not_available There's something else.
not_available What? The company that owns the building Galaxy Financial.
not_available Ever heard of them? 
not_available No.
not_available Should I have? 
not_available Your husband's the chief financial officer.
not_available What? 
not_available I need to find Paul now.
not_available Paul had nothing to do with the kidnapping.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available But his name's all over the paperwork, and because of his relationship to your father he has to explain.
not_available I don't know where he is.
not_available He left CTU without saying anything.
not_available Can you reach him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have his cell phone number.
not_available Call him, keep it personal.
not_available Don't tell him what I know.
not_available I just want you to tell me where he is.
not_available Five power plants could still melt down.
not_available If Paul has any information, we have to follow through with it.
not_available You know that.
not_available All right.
not_available Please get back to me as soon as you can.
not_available OK, I will.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Paul, it's Audrey.
not_available Wasn't expecting to hear from you.
not_available I know.
not_available I just Look, I didn't like the way we left things between us.
not_available I didn't care for it much either.
not_available Look, uh I'm glad you called, but I'm about to check out.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available What difference does it make? Look, I was thinking about what you said, how we've got so much going on for us.
not_available I thought you wanted a divorce.
not_available Yeah, I thought so too, but I just You know, Paul, today was the first time that we've seen each other in months, and I don't know, maybe it took a while for it to sink in.
not_available Maybe you're right.
not_available Maybe there is something there.
not_available You know this is what I want, more than anything.
not_available Then let me come over.
not_available I don't want to have the most important conversation of my life over the phone.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm at the Westmore Hotel, room 408.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll wait for you.
not_available No one goes down there till the forensic team get here.
not_available When they do, I want fingerprints, trace DNA, fiber samples, everything.
not_available I understand.
not_available OK.
not_available Hey.
not_available I need to follow up a lead on my own.
not_available I need a favor.
not_available I need you to take Dina and her son back to CTU and head the interrogation.
not_available They'd never let me set foot in CTU, even if I wanted to.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You're the only one I can trust.
not_available Last two hours, I've watched my friend come back to life.
not_available It's not that simple, Jack.
not_available I can get you reinstated.
not_available But I need to know now, is that what you want? I don't know.
not_available Maybe I was wrong.
not_available You saved the daughter of the secretary of defense, my boss.
not_available You do know that, right? Jack.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Lee.
not_available Agent Almeida will be driving your car.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack, I spoke with Paul.
not_available He's at the Westmore downtown, room 408.
not_available I'm heading over there now.
not_available Let us handle this.
not_available We don't know Pauls connection yet.
not_available He could be dangerous.
not_available He was on his way out the door.
not_available I had to make something up to keep him there.
not_available Fine.
not_available I can get there instead.
not_available I'm only minutes away, and he knows that.
not_available He's not gonna stick around if I don't show.
not_available Audrey, I don't feel comfortable with you going in alone.
not_available Jack, he won't suspect.
not_available He wants to talk about the marriage.
not_available Look, I'll keep him there until you get there.
not_available No.
not_available It's not an option.
not_available Jack, just get there as soon as you can.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Audrey! I just got off the phone with Jack.
not_available He wants Almeida reinstated.
not_available Do you have a problem with that? Considering what he's done today, I have no problem with that.
not_available Good.
not_available Sir, you said you spoke with Jack? How long ago was that? 
not_available 10, 15 minutes ago.
not_available Why? We have some new information I'd like to share with you.
not_available We found a connection to the terrorists.
not_available What kind of connection? 
not_available Paul Raines.
not_available My daughter's husband? One of his companies owns the building Jack just searched.
not_available The building they planned the attack from? 
not_available That's the one.
not_available Has anybody gone to pick him up? 
not_available We have teams on the way to his hotel, but he was about to leave.
not_available We kept him there under a false pretence.
not_available False pretence? What's that mean? Jack told us that Audrey's meeting Paul in his room.
not_available Jack's on his way over.
not_available What? 
not_available She'll keep him there till backup takes over.
not_available Unacceptable! How could you let this happen? This was her choice.
not_available Jack did everything he could to stop her.
not_available When did you find out about this? 
not_available Five minutes ago.
not_available That's when you should have told me.
not_available Want me to look into it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Find out.
not_available Tell me what you know about Paul Raines.
not_available Why? What's his connection to all this? 
not_available How should I know? Look, Curtis, I wish I knew something that you could use.
not_available Believe me, I'm quite clear it's my only way out of this.
not_available But I don't know any more about Paul Raines than you do.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available We're about five minutes out.
not_available Raines' part in all this is being investigated as we speak.
not_available If your name turns up linked to the kidnap 
not_available It won't.
not_available I'll do everything I can to find something on Powell's computer to help you.
not_available Maybe something about Paul Raines will be on there.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available You're seeing Paul by yourself?.
not_available It's the only way to keep him here.
not_available If Paul was involved 
not_available Look, Paul would never hurt me.
not_available Strong evidence suggests he was involved, which means he is dangerous.
not_available Look, I don't believe he is.
not_available You don't know what he is, Audrey.
not_available I lived with him for eight years.
not_available I know him.
not_available Yeah, I thought I knew him too.
not_available Audrey, I forbid you to do this.
not_available Dad, I'm sorry, I'm already here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Almeida.
not_available That's right.
not_available Erin Driscoll, director of CTU.
not_available How are you? This is Mrs.
not_available Araz, and her son Behrooz.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Araz needs medical attention.
not_available Take care of it, then interrogate them.
not_available We've told you everything.
not_available We'll see.
not_available You're going to need these.
not_available I'm sure you're aware of my history here.
not_available Not an issue.
not_available Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller both vouch for you.
not_available That's enough for me.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack thought it'd be a good idea if I headed up the interrogation.
not_available That makes sense.
not_available You've had the chance to observe them firsthand.
not_available If there's anything you need, let me know.
not_available That man I was just talking to is Tony Almeida.
not_available Keep an eye on him, let me know if he goes off protocol.
not_available I'm particularly interested In communication between him and Jack or Secretary Heller.
not_available That's right.
not_available I'm seeing how things work around here.
not_available How do things work around here? You can care less about me being falsely accused and tortured.
not_available You feel squeezed out, and you need allies.
not_available That's why you were so nice to me.
not_available We're facing a crisis today, Sarah.
not_available And our first priority is to deal with it successfully.
not_available Is that a problem for you? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available But after what I went through today, if you want help, I need something too.
not_available And what's that? 
not_available I want my arrest expunged.
not_available Not explained by an official letter in my file, expunged.
not_available And I want a promotion.
not_available Two pay grades.
not_available Done.
not_available Come on in.
not_available I'm glad you came.
not_available Can I get you something? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I had them send up your favorite champagne.
not_available Tell you the truth, I wasn't sure you'd really come.
not_available Why wouldn't I? 
not_available You were so adamant about ending things.
not_available Your turnaround was just a little surprising, that's all.
not_available How about you? I hardly hear from you for about six months, then you see me with another man and you're pouring Dom Perignon? Shows what a fool I am for not realizing what I had.
not_available It also shows that I still have feelings for you.
not_available And you must have some for me, too.
not_available Otherwise you wouldn't be here, right? I would hate to think that you were playing some kind of game with me.
not_available I don't play games, Paul.
not_available Good.
not_available To new beginnings.
not_available New beginnings.
not_available Miss Driscoll? It's Jack on line three.
not_available Jack? Backup teams at the Westmore yet? 
not_available No, they're in traffic.
not_available I'm still a couple miles out.
not_available If your teams get there first, tell them not to waste time.
not_available I want them in that room.
not_available Why not put some fiber optics in, get a better position? If Pauls involved, he'll be nervous.
not_available I don't want anything to tip him off.
not_available I don't want Audrey in any more danger.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll pass that along to Tactical.
not_available Has Curtis questioned Marianne about Paul? 
not_available She says she doesn't know anything.
not_available But they're about to get into the computer files.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks, Erin.
not_available It's right down this hall and to the left.
not_available Stay alert.
not_available This place may not be as empty as it seems.
not_available What? You think this is some kind of trap? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I do.
not_available Like you said, Curtis, this is my only chance to stay alive.
not_available I'm not gonna blow it.
not_available So relax.
not_available It's all clear.
not_available This'll only take one minute.
not_available Here it is.
not_available AII I have to do is reformat and then we can download the data and get out of here.
not_available Oh.
not_available What? 
not_available The file has a second password.
not_available Do you know it? I think so.
not_available But it's strange.
not_available Get your hand away from the gun.
not_available Take it away.
not_available The files are still secure.
not_available I
not_available I didn't give them anything.
not_available I Now put the gun down.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Your name is Curtis Manning.
not_available You work for CTU.
not_available Tell me how far along you are in your investigation.
not_available What investigation? 
not_available Of the override.
not_available Have they discovered where it is yet? You're an American, and you're working with the terrorists? Who are you? I'm gonna ask you one more time.
not_available What does CTU know about the override? Fine.
not_available Or I could move to Washington.
not_available I could turn West Coast operations over to Ben Simon.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Yes, I heard you.
not_available Turn West Coast operations over to Ben Simon.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You'd have to decide whether or not he was Not Ben Simon.
not_available What do you think of me moving back east? Oh, um Well, I, um I don't know.
not_available I feel like I'm doing all the work here.
not_available You said you wanted to talk.
not_available You're not talking.
not_available These things take time, Paul.
not_available Well, maybe talking isn't what we should be doing.
not_available Why are you looking at me like that? 
not_available You're my wife, for God's sake.
not_available You can't believe I came to sleep with you.
not_available OK, you didn't come here to sleep with me or to talk with me.
not_available Why did you come? I just I thought that maybe we could spend a little time together.
not_available It'd be nice.
not_available On a day like this? All hell's breaking loose and you thought it'd be nice? I really wasn't thinking when you called, was I? What's really going on? What? Are you spying on me? Are you doing something to spy on? What is that supposed to mean? 
not_available I just I think I should go.
not_available I think you should stay.
not_available Please just let me go, please, let me 
not_available No.
not_available No! Take your hands off of her! You set me up! Audrey, get behind me.
not_available Put your hands on your head now.
not_available Now! What do you want? 
not_available I want answers.
not_available Well, I'm not talking to you.
