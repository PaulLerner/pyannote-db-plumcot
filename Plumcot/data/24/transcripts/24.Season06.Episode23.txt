
not_available Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody and he let him go.
not_available Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland.
not_available Someone will have to go down.
not_available The farther from the president, the better.
not_available Are you asking me to resign? 
not_available I have to fire you.
not_available We're talking about the end of my career.
not_available An FBsub
not_available circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government.
not_available If the Chinese agent in possession of the sub
not_available circuit board transfers it to his government, the entire Russian defence system will be compromised.
not_available I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter.
not_available You are talking about attacking one of our military bases.
not_available You have two hours.
not_available Everyone on the floor! My men have your grandson.
not_available Have you repaired the sub
not_available circuit board? I'll return it when you bring my grandson.
not_available Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.
not_available Hello, Josh.
not_available Your grandfather wants to speak with you.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born.
not_available I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country.
not_available Cheng, it's over! Tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you.
not_available Help! Josh! 
not_available I lost the boy.
not_available Who has him? 
not_available CTU and your son.
not_available This is totally unacceptable.
not_available The boy was my price for repairing the circuit board.
not_available Our arrangement is over.
not_available I've got Phillip Bauer calling for you on a scrambled line.
not_available I want my grandson.
not_available And I want clear passage to the country of my choice.
not_available If you give me that, then I'll give you the FBsub
not_available circuit board.
not_available You're working with the Chinese.
not_available I was.
not_available Is Phillip Bauer someone we can trust? 
not_available We have no choice.
not_available Get me CTU.
not_available You need to come with me.
not_available What do you mean? Come now! Agent Doyle! Orders, Jack! The boy stays with me! Uncle Jack! Josh! Where are you taking me? 
not_available I'm sorry, Josh.
not_available You're sorry for what? What's going on? This has to do with my grandpa.
not_available Josh, he's got something we need, something that will stop a war, so we have to go through the motions of handing you over to him.
not_available What, you mean you're not actually gonna do it? As soon as we get what we need from him, we're gonna recover you.
not_available We have two TAC teams and LAPD at the rendezvous site.
not_available This is a locating device, Josh.
not_available We're gonna be able to track you until we get the green light on your recovery operation.
not_available Look, I understand you're scared I would be too 
not_available but I will get you back, Josh.
not_available This may sting a little.
not_available Argh! Look, we're making a mistake.
not_available You can't let them do this.
not_available You can talk to Doyle.
not_available You can't let them hand Josh over.
not_available Those orders come from the White House.
not_available Get in.
not_available Are you arresting me, charging me? 
not_available No.
not_available We have orders to place you in custody to protect our operation.
not_available Don't make this harder than it is.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Jack, Nadia said you were in custody.
not_available Why is CTU handing Josh to my father? It's a trade
not_available off.
not_available The order came from the vice president.
not_available Your father got ahold of the FBsub
not_available circuit board.
not_available He's offering it in exchange for Josh and a safe passage.
not_available Whatever he said, he has no intention of giving up that board.
not_available The White House feels they have no alternative.
not_available Doyle has a plan to get Josh back.
not_available My father will have a better plan.
not_available Dammit, Chloe, we need to stop this.
not_available Put me through to Karen Hayes.
not_available Hold on.
not_available My earlier deception was a desperate move on my part, Mr President.
not_available It was a mistake which I'm sure compromised your trust in me, and for that I'm deeply sorry.
not_available But you are not calling simply to offer your apology.
not_available Sir, I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response, but an opportunity has presented itself that may allow us both to avoid a war that neither of us wants.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available The man with the component no longer works with the Chinese.
not_available He's offered to trade it back to us and I've authorised the exchange.
not_available For the sake of both our countries, I hope it happens soon, because until you have the component I have no choice but to continue on our present path.
not_available The chatter we are picking up from Chinese intelligence is not encouraging, and they are far from incompetent.
not_available I cannot extend or rescind this deadline for anything other than concrete results.
not_available I understand your position.
not_available The purpose of this call is to keep you current on our efforts to try to avoid a conflict.
not_available Karen Hayes.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Do you know of the plan to hand my nephew to my father? 
not_available I do.
not_available Karen, you cannot let this happen.
not_available It is a mistake to trust him.
not_available You will get nothing back.
not_available He's gonna keep Josh and the board.
not_available Why would he need the board? Because it's his leverage with the Chinese.
not_available He's useless to them without it.
not_available Whatever you offered, the Chinese are offering more.
not_available Karen, my father is smart enough to manipulate this exchange.
not_available I don't think we should go through with this, but the vice president feels it's the only way to avoid war.
not_available He's given his order.
not_available I don't have the authority to do anything.
not_available You're gonna have to take care of this.
not_available I can't.
not_available CTU has put me in temporary custody to stop me from interfering with their operation.
not_available Karen, he is an innocent boy.
not_available You need to stop this and you need to stop it now.
not_available Well, that did not go well 
not_available not that I expected much goodwill from Suvarov.
not_available I just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
not_available I thought he was under arrest.
not_available He is, but he called me.
not_available OK, he called you.
not_available Yes, and he's convinced that his father will try to get the boy and the circuit board.
not_available How? We can verify the authenticity of the board before we hand over Josh.
not_available Do you think Jack's concerns are warranted? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available He's Phillip Bauer's son.
not_available He's been more right than we have.
not_available Well, point taken there.
not_available All right, let's say we refuse to give up Josh, which is the only thing Phillip Bauer seems to want, how do we get the board? Well, if you don't have any ideas, I think I might.
not_available If it involves keeping Daniels in the dark Tom, he won't listen to me, but if you My relationship with the vice president is complicated at best.
not_available I can't be seen making an end run around him.
not_available But I promise I won't be looking your way if you do.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available That's personal.
not_available Nothing you need in there.
not_available Mr Buchanan, our subpoena covers everything.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's a family album, for crying out loud.
not_available You haven't been charged with any crimes yet, but that could change.
not_available Buchanan residence.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available Bill, I know you're there.
not_available Please pick up.
not_available Look, I know you don't wanna talk to me, but I really need your help.
not_available I don't know where else to turn.
not_available What do you mean? Are you OK? No, I'm fine.
not_available I just I really need your help.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I know that you're angry with me.
not_available What do you need from me, Karen? I just got off the phone with Jack.
not_available He's being held in custody by CTU.
not_available Why? Because they don't want him to interfere with an operation.
not_available What operation? 
not_available Phillip Bauer has the component.
not_available What? He claims he'll trade the sub
not_available circuit board for his grandson, but Jack thinks it's a setup, that Phillip will get the boy, keep the component, and make a deal with the Chinese.
not_available And I completely agree.
not_available Have you spoken to Nadia Yassir? Oh, she won't budge on this thing.
not_available She's under direct orders from the vice president.
not_available What are you asking me to do, Karen? Whatever it takes to stop the exchange.
not_available Nadia, we just touched down at the meeting point.
not_available I'm not seeing any activity.
not_available Surveillance confirms that.
not_available How's the signal on Josh's tracker? 
not_available Coming in clear.
not_available The tracker signal's strong.
not_available You wait here.
not_available I'm gonna check it out.
not_available Come on.
not_available CTU, I've got a call coming in.
not_available It could be him.
not_available Can you trace the call? 
not_available We're patched into Doyle's phone, so we'll be able to listen to the conversation.
not_available All right, Mike, go ahead, answer it.
not_available This is Doyle.
not_available Before we do anything, I want CTU to turn off the satellite feed.
not_available What are you talking about? I have an uplink.
not_available I know when they're watching, and I know when they're off line.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Nadia, can we tell if he's bluffing? He's not bluffing.
not_available He's absolutely in our system.
not_available How? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Mike, Phillip Bauer has tapped into our satellite surveillance.
not_available Can he see Josh's tracker signal? 
not_available No, that's on an internal network.
not_available All right, go off line.
not_available Tell the LAPD and the TAC teams to keep a wide perimeter outside the satellite area.
not_available We can't afford to spook him.
not_available Morris, shut down the satellite.
not_available Marcy, let LAPD and our teams know.
not_available It's done.
not_available Mike, satellite is off line.
not_available Mr Bauer, CTU satellite is off line.
not_available I can see that.
not_available Now get rid of the chopper.
not_available Aerial One, return to base.
not_available That's an order.
not_available Now how do you wanna work the exchange? 
not_available Wait there.
not_available Someone will come.
not_available When? 
not_available Whenever I'm damn well ready.
not_available Put my grandson on the phone.
not_available Your grandfather wants to speak with you.
not_available But don't fight him, Josh.
not_available OK? The easier he thinks this is gonna go, the less on guard he's gonna be.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hello, Joshua.
not_available Have you thought about what we talked about? Yes, and I don't wanna go anywhere with you.
not_available I hate you.
not_available Joshua, listen to me.
not_available I understand you're frightened and angry, but your father's involvement in what happened today will be public knowledge.
not_available Staying in this country is not an option.
not_available There's nothing here.
not_available My mom's here.
not_available Your mother can join you at any time, but she is incapable of giving you what you need.
not_available Where we're going, I will have the means and the power to help you become the kind of man your father should have been.
not_available Now you think about that.
not_available The boy's in position.
not_available You can go get him now.
not_available No sign of anyone so far.
not_available We're trying to get coverage without Phillip Bauer knowing, but he's covered all bases.
not_available Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.
not_available How do I know the component's real once they hand it over? Chloe? The component has an R
not_available 72 socket on its underside.
not_available When you plug your PDA into that, I'll be able to verify the circuitry from here.
not_available Good.
not_available Once I know the component's real, if I see a chance to get the kid back, I'll take it.
not_available No.
not_available I wanna see Josh safe too, but we're under strict orders from the White House.
not_available We're not authorised to retrieve him until the board is at CTU.
not_available I'm not talking about authorisation.
not_available Well, I am.
not_available Mike, there's too much at stake.
not_available You're not going off book on this, understood? Mike, do you confirm? 
not_available Nadia, I have Karen Hayes on two.
not_available Put it through to my cellphone.
not_available Mike, you're on comm with Chloe and Morris.
not_available Yeah, I'll keep 'em posted.
not_available Yes.
not_available The vice president would like to check on the status of the trade with Phillip Bauer.
not_available The agent is in position with the boy.
not_available He's waiting to be contacted.
not_available I did tell the White House that I would report in.
not_available Yes, I know, but I just wanted to make sure that everyone's on board 
not_available that no one has any doubts that this is the right course of action.
not_available The order is not being questioned.
not_available What's the status of Jack Bauer? He's being transferred to Detention at District.
not_available Good, I need to be able to view the operation on your internal deployment grid.
not_available Do you mind me asking why? 
not_available Yes, actually, I do.
not_available The vice president wants me to keep track of Jack Bauer, so I need the security code.
not_available Right away.
not_available Log onto the grid on nine
not_available four.
not_available Security code AlphaCharlie
not_available November.
not_available Got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I got a call from security.
not_available Head over to the lounge.
not_available Why? What's the problem? 
not_available Marilyn Bauer.
not_available I'm not a prisoner, so stop treating me like one.
not_available I wanna see my son.
not_available I wanna see him now! And if you can't tell me where he is, I will find somebody who can! Get out of my way.
not_available Get out of my way! Listen, Mrs Bauer, if you'd calm down, we can talk Did something happen? Did he get hurt? 
not_available No.
not_available Josh is fine.
not_available They wanna debrief him while events are still fresh in his mind.
not_available You have no right to talk to my son.
not_available He needs to have a parent present.
not_available I wanna be with my son.
not_available I understand No! You have no idea what I'm going through.
not_available And if you don't get me to him now, I'm gonna get our lawyers and I will take this whole place down, including you! Ma'am.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I need you to send additional security to the lounge area to escort Mrs Bauer to Holding.
not_available I want my son! You can't keep me here! They're on their way.
not_available Can I have two additional security to the lounge to escort Marilyn Bauer to Holding? Thank you.
not_available What? It doesn't bother you? What if we don't get Josh back? Phillip Bauer is a murderer.
not_available I don't like it, I hate it, but we have our orders.
not_available Since when do you care about orders? 
not_available We're trying to avoid starting a war.
not_available Speaking as someone that placed a lot of people's lives at risk, I can see why it's necessary, yes.
not_available Jack thinks his father has no intention of giving us the component.
not_available I don't think we can count on Jack being objective about his father right now.
not_available Who cares, if he's right? Are you angry at me as if I'm the one that made the decision to go through with this? No, I It's just that Josh didn't do anything.
not_available He's innocent.
not_available Chloe, keep a close eye on Josh's tracker.
not_available If that signal weakens, I wanna know.
not_available I will.
not_available CTU, this is Doyle.
not_available You're on with O'Brian.
not_available Helicopter approaching out of the north.
not_available It's too far to read its markings.
not_available Do you think it might be Bauer? 
not_available I don't know, that's why I'm asking you.
not_available All right, no need to get testy.
not_available Pulling up the FAA database now.
not_available The coastguard has a patrol west of your position.
not_available It's not Bauer.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available Doyle? Yeah? 
not_available A lot of people disagree with this operation.
not_available I just want you to know that what you're doing, I think, is absolutely necessary.
not_available Morris, the next time I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available What's this lunatic doing? What the hell? Don't move.
not_available Get your handcuffs out.
not_available Do it.
not_available Mr Buchanan? What are you doing? 
not_available Do you have Jack Bauer? We have orders to transport him to Detention.
not_available I need you to release him.
not_available You've been relieved of duty.
not_available I'm no threat to anyone.
not_available I'm not even armed.
not_available Stay where you are.
not_available You won't shoot me.
not_available Stop coming.
not_available You know what I'll have to do.
not_available You don't have to do anything.
not_available You're a good man.
not_available I trained you.
not_available I know you can't possibly believe what's happening here is right.
not_available You're following orders, but your oath of allegiance is not to one single person.
not_available You swore to uphold the Constitution.
not_available The orders you're following are illegal.
not_available You have an opportunity here, Turner.
not_available Don't blow it.
not_available Agent Turner, put the weapon down.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Did they hand Josh over to my father? 
not_available Doyle's in position, awaiting instructions.
not_available OK.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Did Karen explain everything to you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you for doing this.
not_available You don't have to thank me.
not_available You put yourself on the line.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available Let's just hope you're right about your father.
not_available Unfortunately, I am.
not_available Sir, if you'll just wait here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, Stuart.
not_available Morris, find out who that is.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I don't believe we've met.
not_available Morris O'Brian.
not_available This is Stuart, Milo's brother.
not_available Oh, I'm so very sorry, very sorry.
not_available I have to sign a release for his body.
not_available I'll help you with the paperwork.
not_available Come on.
not_available Thanks, Chloe.
not_available He was a good man.
not_available It was Milo's brother, Stuart.
not_available Hi, Karen.
not_available Hi.
not_available I've got Jack.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available I just I wanted to thank you.
not_available You didn't have to do this.
not_available You made a big sacrifice.
not_available I'm not the only one.
not_available It won't be long before they figure out how I located Jack.
not_available Yeah, well, they already have.
not_available I've just been denied access.
not_available They're probably on their way to arrest me.
not_available I don't when they'll let us speak to each other again, so I just want you to know that I'm so sorry, and I love you very much.
not_available Me too.
not_available Ms Hayes? 
not_available They're here.
not_available Good luck.
not_available They're about to arrest Karen.
not_available Hi.
not_available Stuart? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU.
not_available I don't have much time.
not_available I just wanted to meet you and tell you how sorry I am.
not_available I know your name.
not_available My brother talked about you.
not_available I'd like to know how he died.
not_available Your brother died saving my life.
not_available He saw that I was in danger, and he stood up and sacrificed himself.
not_available He was very brave.
not_available No, he wasn't, not really.
not_available It's more that he was really in love with you.
not_available Excuse me, I'll be right back.
not_available Chloe, go ahead.
not_available Local police found Agents Ryan and Turner handcuffed to their vehicle.
not_available Jack escaped? How? 
not_available They were intercepted by Bill Buchanan.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Positive.
not_available Why would Bill do something like that? He probably agrees with Jack that we shouldn't be trusting his father, regardless of what the orders are.
not_available Have TAC teams in the area move to intercept them.
not_available They're already doing that.
not_available I'm sorry, I had to, uh Mr Doyle? Yeah? Listen, please don't do this.
not_available OK? My grandpa's crazy.
not_available Can't you please just let me go? Josh your country needs you to do this.
not_available I'll get you back, Josh.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available Doyle, this is Nadia.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available Go ahead, Nadia.
not_available Any sign of Phillip Bauer yet? 
not_available None yet.
not_available Jack escaped.
not_available We have to assume he's on his way to you to try and stop the exchange.
not_available How the hell does he know where we are? Karen told him, and gave him your location.
not_available Bill Buchanan helped him escape.
not_available Dammit! 
not_available I've got TAC teams ready to move in.
not_available We can't bring more men in.
not_available Phillip Bauer will spot them and pull out.
not_available Then you'll have to face him alone.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Is my uncle coming? Yeah.
not_available Excuse us, please.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You know why I ordered your detention.
not_available I do.
not_available Then you admit to using information you got from CTU to assist Bill Buchanan in breaking Jack Bauer out of custody? Yes, I do, sir.
not_available Karen, you and I have had our differences, but I thought that we'd worked past them, that you and I had finally reached an understanding.
not_available Clearly, I was mistaken.
not_available What in the hell were you thinking? I learned a hard lesson today, sir, when I trusted Fayed.
not_available What lesson was that? 
not_available Never negotiate with a sociopath.
not_available Phillip Bauer is a sociopath.
not_available We can't trust he'll give us the component, whether we give him the boy or not.
not_available Dammit, Karen, that is not your call to make! I understand.
not_available I wouldn't have done what I did if I wasn't willing to accept the consequences.
not_available Oh, believe me, there will be consequences.
not_available I will make sure that you and your husband go down hard for this.
not_available Tom Lennox said your different point of view would be an asset to my team, and I believed him.
not_available Was he in on this with you? No, sir.
not_available He didn't know anything about this.
not_available Karen if Jack Bauer prevents this exchange from happening, the Russians will attack our forces in central Asia.
not_available Any blood that is spilt will be on you.
not_available CTU, I've got an incoming call.
not_available We're monitoring.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Take Josh and walk toward the water.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available Nadia, did you get that? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Agent Doyle, be careful.
not_available We need to go, Josh.
not_available Come on.
not_available The tracker shows them moving towards the water.
not_available Chloe? Chloe.
not_available Are you all right? You look a little pale.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm just tired.
not_available You hear that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mike, what do you have? 
not_available Two men in a watercraft coming ashore.
not_available We're taking cover.
not_available Stay here.
not_available Do you understand? Don't move.
not_available Stop right there! 
not_available Send the kid down now.
not_available Show the sub
not_available circuit board first.
not_available I need to verify it.
not_available Walk forward.
not_available Place it down.
not_available Back up.
not_available Mike! Mike, report in! Come on! There they are.
not_available They've got Josh.
not_available I don't have a clear shot without putting Josh at risk! Get down! 
not_available Doyle, we're gonna get you help.
not_available The component was a fake.
not_available It blew! 
not_available It's OK, Agent Doyle, help's on the way.
not_available Everything's gonna be OK.
not_available Mr Bauer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got the boy.
not_available Be sure to scan him.
not_available I don't trust CTU.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available They tagged him.
not_available Short it out.
not_available It's done.
not_available We lost the tracker.
not_available Try the backup.
not_available I did.
not_available It's gone.
not_available Get that satellite back up.
not_available I'm doing it.
not_available CTU.
not_available Reynolds.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Patch me through to Nadia.
not_available I've got Jack Bauer on the line.
not_available Put it on speakerphone.
not_available Jack, this is Nadia.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'm at the beach.
not_available The component was a copy.
not_available The case was loaded with explosives.
not_available They detonated it.
not_available Doyle is badly injured.
not_available We need a trauma team.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Aerial One, return to the drop
not_available off point.
not_available Two of my father's men and Josh headed out to sea in a small boat.
not_available They just disabled Josh's tracker.
not_available We shut down the satellite, so it's gonna take us a few minutes to get it back up.
not_available How long will it take for reinforcements? 
not_available TAC teams are five minutes out.
not_available Jack how bad is Agent Doyle? Bad.
not_available We need that trauma team.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Sir, Melinda said you read the flash regarding CTU's attempt to make the exchange.
not_available They're trying to track the watercraft Phillip Bauer's men used.
not_available They've had no success yet.
not_available Suvarov is expecting my call to confirm that we have retrieved the component.
not_available Well, my advice is give CTU a few more minutes before we call the Russians.
not_available We could still get lucky on this.
not_available Karen was right.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available She certainly was.
not_available And I was wrong.
not_available Notjust about Karen, but about Wayne Palmer.
not_available I judged his performance as president unfairly.
not_available What he faced these past weeks was an impossible situation.
not_available Maybe he was right to reach out to Assad.
not_available I don't know any more.
not_available You know, Tom, it's easy to think you've got all the answers, when none of the ultimate responsibility lies with you, but sitting in this chair Until you sit in this chair, you don't know anything.
not_available You can't know.
not_available Sir in lieu of the fact that Karen was right, you might wanna reconsider your punitive stance towards her.
not_available My decision was wrong, but I can't condone insubordination.
not_available Sir, you do not want the facts of your disagreement with Karen made public, and that's exactly what will happen if you prosecute her.
not_available And after this crisis has passed, Karen Hayes and Bill Buchanan can retire quietly to their country home in Vermont.
not_available You will be honouring her service.
not_available It's just a better outcome all around.
not_available I'll consider your advice, but right now I need a real
not_available time update on CTU's progress.
not_available All right, sir.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available The trauma team say his injuries aren't life
not_available threatening, but he's gonna be blind in one, if not both, eyes.
