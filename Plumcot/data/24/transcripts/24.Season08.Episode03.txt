
not_available Tell me what you know.
not_available The hitter has someone on the inside.
not_available Victor Aruz told me right before he died that the assassin's working with someone very close to President Hassan.
not_available Someone hacked into the U.N.
not_available database.
not_available They downloaded the security protocols, the schematics to the U.N.
not_available and Hassan's personal itinerary.
not_available HASTINGS: Did you get a name? The computer's owner is listed as Meredith Michelle Reed.
not_available She's a reporter.
not_available Applied for security clearance at the U.N.
not_available We got a match.
not_available Everybody move back! Move back! Mr.
not_available President, you need to come with us.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I can't believe she's part of this.
not_available If this affair becomes public, it will destroy your credibility and everything that you've worked for.
not_available I just spoke to my brother.
not_available I told him to deny the affair.
not_available The reporter's claims need to be discredited.
not_available CTU needs to continue to think she's my contact on the inside.
not_available We might have the wrong person.
not_available We've been scanning through the traffic cam footage from outside Meredith Reed's apartment building.
not_available This man was going into the service entrance.
not_available What if he went through her apartment and used her laptop to break into the servers? He hailed a cab when he left.
not_available JACK: See the medallion? Phone the cab company.
not_available Find out where it went.
not_available Hands in the air now! Against the wall! Chloe tracked the man in the surveillance photo to a second location.
not_available We didn't think you'd follow through with an investigation.
not_available So you had no choice except to steal weapons from the armory.
not_available Would you follow through with an investigation if I'd asked? I'm not debating this anymore.
not_available You want to waste your time chasing ghosts, knock yourself out.
not_available Hello? "Dana Walsh." I like that.
not_available I told you to stop calling me.
not_available Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny.
not_available You must be mistaking me for someone else.
not_available That's funny 'cause you sound a lot like this girl I used to know from Rock Springs named Jenny Scott.
not_available Hey, Mike, what's going on? Mind if I come in? Oh, Mikey.
not_available Call Captain Ravello.
not_available Tell him you're sick, and I'm filling in for you.
not_available Now listen, you son of a bitch, there's no way What's the matter with you?! Next time I won't miss the bone.
not_available Make the call.
not_available This is Hastings.
not_available WEISS: Tell me you've gotten something out of that reporter you arrested.
not_available No, sir.
not_available I'm continuing to press her, but she's maintaining her innocence.
not_available She's a co
not_available conspirator in an assassination plot.
not_available Of course she's gonna deny it.
not_available Listen, I need to be able to tell the president we're making progress toward averting this threat.
not_available Sir, right now our only course is to go after Meredith Reed with the evidence we have in hand.
not_available Our top analyst is decrypting a file we obtained from her laptop.
not_available We're hoping it provides the intel we need about the assassin she's working with.
not_available Well, it'd better provide something because if your people fail, and President Hassan is killed, this peace process dies with him.
not_available Do you understand me? I understand your concern, Mr.
not_available Weiss, but I assure you we're on top of the situation.
not_available I've dispatched tactical personnel to liaise with U.N.
not_available security forces and stepped up the alert with NYPD at the perimeter.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll have that to tell her at least.
not_available Let me know when that file is decrypted.
not_available Dana, you got a minute? I thought you were on your way to the U.N.
not_available I am.
not_available What's the status on that file decryption? We I.D.'d the cipher.
not_available It's a standard Issacs
not_available Adler algorithm.
not_available Requires a 12
not_available character decryption key to unlock the data.
not_available The search cycle has identified two characters already.
not_available Should have the rest in about 30 or 40 minutes.
not_available Why do you ask? Jack Bauer just caused a big scene with Hastings.
not_available He thinks Meredith Reed may have been framed.
not_available He must have gotten that from Chloe.
not_available I thought that she'd dropped it.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available She has surveillance of someone exiting Reed's apartment building.
not_available Jack thinks this same person may have planted the encrypted file on Reed's computer.
not_available You believe that? I'm not sure.
not_available If that evidence was planted, the file you're decrypting is irrelevant at best; at worst a misdirection.
not_available Cole, I traced the U.N.
not_available breach to Reed myself.
not_available The biometric scans of her interrogation all indicate that she's withholding.
not_available I just don't see a frame here.
not_available I hope you're right because Jack's going after this guy on his own.
not_available Hastings sanctioned that? Not exactly.
not_available Agent Ortiz? We need to move out, sir.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available JACK: Okay, I'm at the corner of Broadway and West 23rd in Queens.
not_available Any location on the suspect? Negative.
not_available I talked to the cab driver directly.
not_available All he remembers is dropping the fare at the corner.
not_available Nothing shows up in the aerial archives.
not_available Chloe, I need something to go on.
not_available I know.
not_available I've been searching for private security cameras in the area.
not_available Not all of them are registered.
not_available Without the serial numbers, I don't have access to them.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna get out and look around on foot.
not_available Maybe we'll get lucky.
not_available Stay on the line.
not_available It's all right, Mags.
not_available It's gonna be okay, right? Keep your hand on the table where I can see it.
not_available You're not a cop.
not_available you?ou? How did you manage to fool everybody, Mikey, or whatever the hell your name is? Talk to me, you son of a bitch! Shhshh
not_available shh.
not_available Look, I don't want to hurt you, Jim, or Maggie.
not_available I am just doing my job.
not_available This is the captain calling back.
not_available Just say what I told you to say.
not_available Please don't make me do anhing I don't want to do.
not_available Okay? Yeah.
not_available Hello.
not_available Koernig, Captain Ravello.
not_available What's up? Uh, yeah, Captain, sorry to drop this on you last
not_available minute.
not_available I just came down with some kind of bug.
not_available I got to take a sick leave.
not_available You could have told me earlier, Jim.
not_available You're due at the U.N.
not_available in 20.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I asked Mike Farmer to cover my shift for me.
not_available Farmer's already on in the morning.
not_available He said he doesn't mind working a double.
not_available I guess he could use the timeanda
not_available half.
not_available Anyway, I already told him he could use the bike that I pulled from the motor pool.
not_available All right, Sergeant.
not_available I'll take care of the paperwork.
not_available Look, you tell Mike to get his butt to Midtown.
not_available You got that? Get better, will ya? Yeah.
not_available You did well.
not_available I did what you wanted me to do, all right, so Do what you got to do and leave us alone.
not_available We're not gonna make any trouble for you.
not_available You still there? CHLOE: Jack, go ahead.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Okay, I got two security cameras overlooking the park, one pointing straight at the corner.
not_available I'm gonna get you the serial numbers.
not_available Hey, man, what you doing? Chloe, I got to get back to you.
not_available What's up? You lost, man? Actually, I am.
not_available I'm looking for a friend of mine.
not_available Well, unless you a cop, I suggest look somewhere else, 'cause this is our court.
not_available We don't like strangers on it.
not_available I ain't a cop, and I'm not looking for a problem.
not_available My friend was let off on that corner by a cab 20, 25 minutes ago.
not_available I guess you didn't hear what I'm saying, did you? I've got a hundred bucks; anybody can tell me if they've seen this guy.
not_available Anybody? I seen him.
not_available Yo, shut up, Jay! What was he wearing? That: green coat, black shirt.
not_available Where'd he go? That light blue house over there across the street.
not_available I seen him go up the steps to the stoop.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available Yo, man, what you doing, Jay?! You don't even know what's going down.
not_available Man, I don't know about you, but I got a hundred dollars.
not_available It's your play.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Man, I'm about to take that hundred dollars.
not_available Give me the ball, man.
not_available MAN: All right.
not_available Jim! Hello.
not_available Jack? Got a call from one of your neighbors.
not_available Jim? Hello, Jack? CHLOE (over phone): Jack, what's happening? Are you there? Put the weapon down now.
not_available Do it.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm working on behalf of CTU.
not_available I'm investigating a threat to the peace conference at the U.N.
not_available If that's true, drop your weapon.
not_available I can't.
not_available The man I'm pursuing killed two people in this house.
not_available If I lower this weapon, I'll be sidelined.
not_available That can't happen.
not_available What are you doing? He's down.
not_available Son of a bitch is a cop killer.
not_available John, stop! We got to call this in.
not_available Not yet we don't.
not_available Help me get him in.
not_available Come on! Help me get him in! So where are we? As of right now, we've got half the decryption key.
not_available That's all? Can't we accelerate the program? It's already running at capacity, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Sir, we just found this among Meredith Reed's personal effects.
not_available It's a dedicated key card, United Nations issue.
not_available Issued to who? President Hassan and his family.
not_available It accesses their private residence.
not_available We got her.
not_available Dana Walsh.
not_available Ms.
not_available Walsh, this is security at Perimeter Gate 9.
not_available You have a visitor.
not_available A visitor? A Mr.
not_available Kevin Wade.
not_available Says he's a friend of yours.
not_available SECURITY: Ms.
not_available Walsh? Tell him I'll be right there.
not_available So this, uh this CTU
not_available some kind of government deal, huh? Law enforcement? Ms.
not_available Walsh is on her way.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Dana.
not_available Look at you, all pressed and pretty.
not_available I think I like you as a blonde.
not_available What are you doing here? I thought I told you to leave me alone.
not_available And I told you not to hang up on me, Jenny.
not_available Don't.
not_available Don't call me that.
not_available Oh, you
not_available you you want me to play along? Okay, I'll play along.
not_available But I'm not going to let you pretend that you don't know me.
not_available Fine.
not_available You found me, so now what? You think we're just going to pick up where we left off? Why not? We had a good thing going.
not_available No.
not_available No, we didn't.
not_available I was naive, and I let myself be taken in by you.
not_available I am not that person anymore.
not_available Yeah? CTU.
not_available Senior Data Analyst.
not_available Well, sounds like an important job.
not_available I'm thinking you always were the smart one.
not_available How the hell did you pull this off? What, you steal a dead girl's birth certificate or something? Look, I have money.
not_available Not a lot, but some.
not_available If that's what it'll take.
not_available If you really still care about me, you'll leave me alone.
not_available Say my name.
not_available What? If you're gonna beg, I want to hear you say my name.
not_available Just like you used to.
not_available Kevin.
not_available Say, "Please, Kevin." Please Kevin.
not_available There's my bad girl.
not_available Damn it! What do you want from me?! A place to crash for starters.
not_available I'm getting a little tired of living out of the van.
not_available No, that is not gonna happen.
not_available Yeah? Well, now you don't want me to tell everyone you work with your little secret now, do you? You see, I don't want to do that.
not_available Come on.
not_available It'll be fun having me around.
not_available It'll be just like old times.
not_available You'll come home and we'll catch up.
not_available Fine, fine.
not_available You can stay the night.
not_available I want you out tomorrow.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available Do you want my address? I already got it.
not_available HASTINGS: I'm going to ask you again, Ms.
not_available Reed, and this time I want an answer.
not_available Now we know that this key card was issued to President Hassan and his family at the U.N.
not_available I want to know where you got it.
not_available I'm not saying another word until my attorney gets here.
not_available You're already looking at a life sentence in a federal penitentiary.
not_available So if this plot succeeds and Hassan dies, I promise you the death penalty.
not_available If you give me the name of the assassin, maybe we can cut a deal.
not_available I told you I don't know anything.
not_available You know who you stole his key card from.
not_available I didn't steal it.
not_available Then you manufactured it, cloned it somehow! No.
not_available And used it to gain access to the U.N.
not_available security data.
not_available I, I Where did you get it?! Tell me! He gave it to me.
not_available Who? Who?! Omar.
not_available Omar gave it to me.
not_available President Hassan? Why would he do that? So I could have access to his private residence when he wanted to be alone with me.
not_available You really expect me to believe that you're involved with him? Believe what you want.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available This is Hastings.
not_available Put me through to Rob Weiss at the U.N.
not_available What are you doing? I need to speak with President Taylor to get permission to talk with Omar Hassan.
not_available Now if there's something you want to say to me, Ms.
not_available Reed, now is the time to say it.
not_available WOMAN (over phone): I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Mr.
not_available Weiss is in a closed session, but they're expecting to break shortly.
not_available All right, just relay the message to have him call me back as soon as he can.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Looks like you have a bit more time to reconsider your story.
not_available You let me know when you're ready to change it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, I need your help.
not_available I've lost contact with Jack.
not_available He called me 15 minutes ago.
not_available We got cut off.
not_available I haven't been able to reach him since.
not_available This is your operation, Chloe
not_available yours and Bauer's.
not_available I don't see why this should be my concern.
not_available He could be in some kind of trouble.
not_available You need to send for backup.
not_available Even if I wanted to, we don't have the manpower.
not_available I dispatched all field personnel to the U.N.
not_available for Hassan's protection.
not_available I watched the interrogation.
not_available I heard what Reed said about her affair with Hassan.
not_available If that's true, it supports our idea that she was framed.
not_available And how do you figure that? Because it explains why the biometrics registered her deception, and why the real insider within Hassan's camp chose her to divert our investigation.
not_available Reed is lying.
not_available There is no affair.
not_available But what if there is? If President Hassan corroborates Reed's claim, will you consider sending units to find Jack? All right, fine.
not_available Just so you can hear for yourself, I'll have someone alert you when Hassan calls me back.
not_available Is that good enough? No, but it's better than nothing.
not_available That couple you murdered upstairs were friends of mine, dirtbag.
not_available Good people.
not_available Mazoni, you can't do this.
not_available No, what I can't do is watch another creep like this walk on a technicality, or because some lawyer didn't file the right papers to the right clerk.
not_available John! I've seen it happen more times than I can count.
not_available You're new here, Phil.
not_available You don't know.
not_available Wait till you spend grinding your teeth in this job.
not_available You talk to me then.
not_available What about that thing he said? About him working with CTU? Did we find credentials on him? No.
not_available That's because he is a lying piece of garbage.
not_available This was a home invasion robbery.
not_available Where nothing was taken.
not_available Because we showed up! Look, you got a problem with what I'm doing here, Phil? Then go upstairs and wait till I'm finished.
not_available Go.
not_available Now! And remember, you don't call this in until I say so.
not_available You stick to the story.
not_available He was resisting arrest.
not_available You got that? You got that? Just, uh don't kill him.
not_available I'll do my best.
not_available RABINOWITZ: Hey, Farmer, what are you doing here? Koernig called in sick.
not_available Stomach thing.
not_available No kidding? I talked to him this morning.
not_available He was feeling fine.
not_available Probably a few too many at lunch.
not_available COLE: continue to receive real
not_available time updates at the U.N.
not_available CTU is confirming the link between the Stinger missile attack and the assassination plot against President Hassan.
not_available In response, we're gonna push the traffic perimeter out another six blocks and close the Queensboro Bridge in both directions until noon tomorrow.
not_available Now, roadblock assignments are on pages two and three of your briefing packets.
not_available Go ahead and double
not_available check those now.
not_available CTU has also arrested an individual inside the U.N.
not_available who we believe is a part of the plot.
not_available Hopefully, this will yield some information about the assassin himself.
not_available Until then, we have to assume that he could strike at any time and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective.
not_available He's already killed five people that we know of, including two CTU agents.
not_available Whoever he is, he's a professional, which means everyone is to be on high alert at all times.
not_available History is happening upstairs, people, and it's on our watch.
not_available Our position remains unchanged, Madam President.
not_available We will not allow NATO to transit supplies to Afghanistan through our territory.
not_available What about non
not_available military supplies? HASSAN: It is our belief that any NATO deployment in theegion, military or otherwise, will lead to more extremism, not less.
not_available Mr.
not_available President uh, my director of Counterterrorism here in New York is requesting to speak to you on the phone.
not_available Now? It's an urgent matter.
not_available It's relating to the reporter who was arrested earlier.
not_available Mr.
not_available Weiss will escort you to the conference room.
not_available That is, unless you have any objections.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available This way, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Do I have to remind you of our conversation? Omar, you must deny your involvement with this woman.
not_available She has a name, Farhad.
not_available And I still can't believe that she can be part of this plan.
not_available That should not be your chief concern right now.
not_available If word of this affair gets out, not only is your political career over, but so is the peace process itself.
not_available You know what you have to do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Hello? Mr.
not_available President, this is Brian Hastings at CTU.
not_available I appreciate you getting back to me.
not_available What can I do for you, Mr.
not_available Hastings? Well, sir, I have a matter of some delicacy to discuss with you.
not_available Go on.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I know that your time is valuable, so, I'll come right to the point.
not_available I understand Meredith Reed is writing an article on you for the Sunday Magazine.
not_available Yes, that's correct.
not_available Do you know of any reason she would be in possession of a key card to your residence at the U.N.? y card? Yes, sir.
not_available She claims that she got it from you.
not_available And that your relationship with her is perhaps more than professional.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? Is there anyone listening to our conversation, Mr.
not_available Hastings? Are we being recorded? No, sir.
not_available I'm speaking to you on a secure line.
not_available Then I will tell you what Ms.
not_available Reed said is true.
not_available Omar! What are you doing?! Sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed? Mr.
not_available Hastings, I trust your complete discretion in this matter.
not_available And I'm sure you understand the ramification if what I'm telling you becomes public knowledge.
not_available Yes, sir, I understand.
not_available I gave Ms.
not_available Reed this key card for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.
not_available I'm telling you all this in the interests of justice because I'm convinced that Ms.
not_available Reed is not part of this conspiracy.
not_available Excuse me for asking, sir, but are you basing that certainty on anything other than your personal feelings? No, I suppose not.
not_available I see.
not_available Well, thank you for your candor, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I assure you that nothing we discussed will be disclosed from this office.
not_available I appreciate that, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Good
not_available bye, then.
not_available HASTINGS: Good
not_available bye.
not_available Have you any idea what you've done? The honorable thing.
not_available You said you'd send backup to Jack's location.
not_available I said I'd consider it, and I have.
not_available Confirmation of the affair does not prove Reed's innocence.
not_available For all we know, it's a ploy she used to gain access to the U.N.
not_available security files, Hassan's itinerary.
not_available In the meantime, Jack's still missing.
not_available He's not missing.
not_available You lost contact.
not_available His phone battery may have died.
not_available Or more likely, he's in an area with bad cell reception.
not_available There's pockets of them all over the five boroughs, which you would have known if you were from around here.
not_available Fine, if you're not sending someone, I'll go myself.
not_available No, you won't! Your concern for your friend is admirable, but that file we got off Reed's laptop
not_available it's almost decrypted, and depending what we find, I'm going to need you here.
not_available Is that clear? Yeah.
not_available Now, earlier today, you suggested that I speak to you more clearly and directly.
not_available You leave the building, you're fired.
not_available Is that clear and direct enough for you? Hello? We have a problem.
not_available My brother confessed to the affair.
not_available I don't know if the frame's going to hold.
not_available That's unfortunate.
not_available Don't you understand?! CTU won't believe the file you uploaded to Reed's computer is genuine.
not_available I agree it isn't ideal, but they will still have to act on what they find in any event.
not_available There's no reason to diverge from the plan.
not_available But you need to remain calm and play your part.
not_available How much longer? I promise you.
not_available Your brother will be dead before the hour is out.
not_available PHIL: Don't move! Drop that! Now! Officer, everything I told you before is true.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm a former federal agent.
not_available JOHN: He's lying, Phil! Shoot the son of a bitch! He broke my damn rib! Contact Chloe O'Brian at CTU.
not_available She'll verify my identity and the threat to the peace conference.
not_available What are you waiting for? Shoot him already! Sit back down, John.
not_available You want to be pointing that gun someplace else.
not_available I said don't move, either of you! What the hell? I'm your partner! No, this has gone far enough.
not_available I'm calling it in.
not_available JOHN: You don't want to do that.
not_available Come on, Phil.
not_available Put the phone down.
not_available Let's talk about this.
not_available Shut up! This is Patrolman Phillip Lu.
not_available I need to talk to Lieutenant Sell.
not_available The officer upstairs has to be connected to the assassination plot.
not_available JOHN: Oh, you happy now?! You hearing what he's saying about Koernig? All I'm saying is that there's a connection.
not_available We need to find out what it is.
not_available Both of you, shut the hell up! Lieutenant, sir.
not_available I'm at the scene of a double homicide.
not_available One of the victims is a cop, a James Koernig out of Midtown Center.
not_available No, it's definitely murder.
not_available Him and his wife.
not_available We got a suspect in custody.
not_available Cross street is Astoria.
not_available Ask him what Officer Koernig's assignment was today.
not_available Please, innocent lives are at stake.
not_available What have you got to lose? And, sir? I need a lookup on Koernig's duty assignment.
not_available Yeah, transfer me over.
not_available ARLO: You screwed up.
not_available What? Yeah, surprised me, too.
not_available You forgot to upload a Rijndael filter to my system.
not_available Without it, I can't break the last encryption layer on the file remnant you gave me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I will upload it to a disk for you now.
not_available Or I can just do it at your station.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Everything okay? What do you mean? I don't know.
not_available It's not like you to make mistakes.
not_available You seem a little distracted.
not_available Wedding jitters, maybe? No.
not_available Just asking.
not_available And Cole's a nice enough guy.
not_available But I could see how you could start having second thoughts.
not_available I've always been curious to know what you two find to talk about.
not_available Drop this, Arlo.
not_available I am not in the mood.
not_available Hey, I don't mean anything by it.
not_available All I'm saying is that you and the Boy Scout aren't exactly intellectual equals.
not_available Or is that what makes him your type? See now, you and me, for instance, we have a lot in common.
not_available We speak the same language.
not_available Mostly techno
not_available jargon granted, but hey, it can always lead to something much deeper.
not_available Damn it, Arlo! That's it.
not_available We've got it.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Is that what I think it is? Yes.
not_available Finish decrypting your fragment and put it up on the screen.
not_available I've got to go tell Hastings.
not_available HASTINGS: I don't care what he's demanding.
not_available Tell Ms.
not_available Reed's lawyer he's going to have to wait.
not_available We can hold his client for up to 18 hours before formatly charging her.
not_available Sir? I have to go.
not_available We've broken the encryption code on Reed's file.
not_available The primary file component's up on screen.
not_available Arlo's waiting for a second piece to finish rendering.
not_available So, what am I looking at? Construction plans for work carried out at the United Nations eight months ago.
not_available The U.N.? Are you sure? Positive.
not_available Two I
not_available beams were retrofitted to provide structural support for additional interpreters' booths.
not_available There and there.
not_available That looks like the Council Chamber.
not_available It's directly below it.
not_available ARLO: The decryption's just about complete.
not_available It's loading to the main screen now.
not_available It looks like a schematic for an incendiary.
not_available A bomb.
not_available Pulsedetonated, modified to fit between the I
