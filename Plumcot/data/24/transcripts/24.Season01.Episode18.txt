
not_available Right now My wife and daughter have been targeted and people that I work with may be involved in both.
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer and today is the longest day of my life.
not_available Listen up, people.
not_available Listen up.
not_available Alexis Drazen was leaving here for a meeting.
not_available At this meeting, he was going to make a payoff.
not_available Somewhere in this room, there is money.
not_available I want it found.
not_available I want it found now.
not_available Elizabeth cannot be held responsible for this.
not_available Senator, I don't disagree with you.
not_available But we have a video of her stabbing a man with a letter opener.
not_available You got her into this.
not_available No, sir, I did not.
not_available I did not ask her to stab Alexis Drazen.
not_available I misjudged her ability to handle this operation and, as I said before, I will do everything I can to help her.
not_available I know you're just trying to protect me.
not_available Senator, I understand the situation that you're in but I do not need to remind you there are at least 2 suspects at large.
not_available Sir, please, I implore you have as much security around you as you can tolerate and let us do our job.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I promise I will.
not_available Bingo.
not_available Found it! What? Bearer bonds.
not_available As good as cash and easier to move.
not_available You got the address of the restaurant yet? California Plaza.
not_available It's about 20 minutes from here.
not_available Good.
not_available How are you going to pull this off, pretending to be Alexis? I don't know yet.
not_available Hey, Jay.
not_available Jay, come here.
not_available Give me your shirt.
not_available I'll go with you, coordinate your backup.
not_available Fine.
not_available What's the update on Bauer's family? Still missing.
not_available Anything back from forensics yet? Well, based on preliminary reports the agents were killed protecting the women.
not_available We have to find the wife and daughter.
not_available I alerted the task force at District.
not_available Why don't you call and see if they need anything from us? All right.
not_available Tony, still no word to Jack on any of this, understand? What do you want me to tell him if he calls and asks? You're working on something else and put him through to me, okay? What are you guys looking for? Whoever Dan worked for might have Information about my mom.
not_available The guy who was in charge, Gaines I never met him before.
not_available Dan knew him.
not_available Maybe his number is here.
not_available What are you going to do, call him and ask for your mom back? Any information I find, I'm going to give it to the police.
not_available You hear that, Rick? She's going to call the police.
not_available That's okay with you? You said you didn't trust the police.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'll give it to my dad.
not_available Dan'll go ballistic when he finds out you've been going through his stuff.
not_available You didn't tell her Dan is dead? Not yet.
not_available I didn't want to freak her out.
not_available Dan's brother Frank is on his way here and I don't want him to know.
not_available Don't say anything, okay? Okay.
not_available This is such a waste of time.
not_available We're never going to find anything.
not_available I don't even know why I came.
not_available You're married and you have a daughter named Kimberly.
not_available I have a daughter? 
not_available Yes.
not_available A teenage daughter.
not_available You and Jack, you were separated about six months ago and that's when we met.
not_available Who are you? I'm a friend.
not_available A very good friend who wanted to be a lot more.
not_available But.
not_available You were afraid to start a relationship, so we didn't.
not_available Then you decided to go back with your husband.
not_available Maybe it was because of Kimberly.
not_available I don't know.
not_available But you asked me not to call, and I haven't.
not_available But I don't remember any of this.
not_available We need to get you to a hospital, have you looked at.
not_available Why do we have to go? You said you were a doctor.
not_available I'm a surgeon.
not_available You need to see a neurologist.
not_available You've suffered a trauma.
not_available I don't want to go to a hospital.
not_available Why not? I don't know, I just don't want to.
not_available What if I examined you here? Okay.
not_available There is some physical evidence in George Ferragamo's office that leads directly to you.
not_available Subtle enough so the fire marshals didn't find it the first time around.
not_available But with a little help, they'll find it.
not_available So I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder? Like I said, whatever it takes.
not_available I don't know what you think you've got here.
not_available What we've got is a tape of Carl Webb admitting that he set my son up for murder.
not_available It's been a while since I've practiced law but I know that unless Keith was sanctioned by a court order and prepped by an authority, this is not evidence.
not_available I've been in politics long enough to know that if the media gets a hold of this tape the truth will come out.
not_available No.
not_available Today can't be about two things.
not_available It's either about winning the primary, securing the party nomination.
not_available Or it's about a political scandal, but it can't be about both.
not_available Destroy the tape.
not_available What? If you don't, not only will you bring down yourself but you'll bring the party down with you.
not_available How do I do that? Because you'll win today.
not_available You'll have enough delegates by 8:00.
not_available You are the Democratic Party's candidate for president whether you like it or not and if you decide to self
not_available destruct it will take years for the party's platform to recover.
not_available Why don't we let the electorate decide on that.
not_available I don't consider telling the truth self
not_available destructive.
not_available And how bad will it be for the Democrats if somebody else comes out with this first and I have to go on the defensive? What do you think, Mike? I've seen much uglier stories kept under wraps.
not_available The only people who know about this tape are the people in this room and Keith.
not_available This wouldn't be a difficult item to shelve.
not_available And besides, this is currency.
not_available Once you're in the White House, this could protect you.
not_available How? 
not_available Think about it.
not_available You'll have evidence against some of the most powerful men in the country.
not_available They won't be able to control you.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available How's everything going there? Fine.
not_available I need to speak to Mason.
not_available He's not in his office.
not_available He's down on the floor.
not_available Let me transfer you.
not_available Okay, wait, before you do.
not_available Have you spoken to Teri yet? No, I haven't.
not_available Give me the number of the safe house.
not_available I'll call there.
not_available Look, let me see if I can get that for you.
not_available Hang on a second.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Jack's on the phone for you.
not_available Okay.
not_available He wants the number of the safe house.
not_available Of course he does.
not_available Why don't you just tell him what happened? Why is this so hard for you to comprehend? The man is neck
not_available deep in an investigation.
not_available He has a job to do.
not_available Let's let him do it.
not_available When he's back in a controlled environment, we'll tell him.
not_available Meanwhile, we have a job to do.
not_available I got to say, I just think it's wrong.
not_available It's not about right and wrong.
not_available It's about the fact that we have to protect Palmer.
not_available He's on Line 2.
not_available Jack, it's me.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available We're going to a meet.
not_available What kind of meet? Alexis was supposed to make a payoff.
not_available Payoff to who? 
not_available I'm not sure yet.
not_available So what are you going to do? Pretend to be Alexis.
not_available You're never going to pull that off.
not_available Alexis was supposed to pay this guy $50,000 in bearer bonds.
not_available You have to work with me on this.
not_available I need backup.
not_available Milo's got the address.
not_available We should be there in about 15 minutes.
not_available You keep this guy in play, we got a chance of bringing these guys down.
not_available Or you can wait for Alexis to come to if he does.
not_available By then, this thing could be over.
not_available All right, I'll go along.
not_available I'll send you a team.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Can you pass me back to Tony? He was going to give me the number for the safe house.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just spoke to Paulson over there.
not_available He said the girls are sleeping.
not_available Okay, get them to call me back at my cell when they wake up.
not_available Definitely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mason's on board.
not_available That's good.
not_available So what else did Teri say? She didn't say much.
not_available When she guessed you'd been seeing me, she didn't want to talk to me.
not_available Not that I blame her.
not_available I couldn't finish the debrief, so I left and let Paulson do it.
not_available Maybe that was a mistake.
not_available No, you did the right thing.
not_available This is my fault, I should've told her.
not_available Seems she didn't want to talk.
not_available Doesn't matter, I should've told her.
not_available Jack, from what I could see she really loves you and wants to work it out.
not_available Maybe you want to call her and see how she is.
not_available I tried, Mason said they were sleeping.
not_available Why don't you call Paulson, see if they're up yet? It's not going through.
not_available Might be the area.
not_available Try again when we get to the plaza.
not_available I'm really sorry about all this.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available Hanlin.
not_available Come on, guys, do what you can.
not_available At least try to find somebody else.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need some extra bodies to help track Teri and Kim Bauer.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't see anyone doing crossword puzzles down there.
not_available My hands are a little tied without Nina here.
not_available Because Nina's with Jack, right? Yeah.
not_available She says it's over between them.
not_available What do you think? What? I'm just asking.
not_available I mean, you got to be wondering yourself, right? Hey, Almeida, I'm on your side.
not_available Nina ought to be here now.
not_available Why does Jack need her? You're busting your ass because she took a ride with him.
not_available If that works for you, great.
not_available You know what works for me? You keeping out of my personal life.
not_available There's entirely too much personal business going on around here.
not_available I want to get this place back on track.
not_available It seems to me Nina Myers is a big part of the problem.
not_available How do you figure that? She covers for everyone that doesn't follow code.
not_available Everyone who doesn't follow code covers for her.
not_available She's with Jack, she's with you.
not_available You don't think that's relevant? You don't think that's a distraction? No, I don't.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available Patty said you want to talk to me.
not_available Yeah, sit down.
not_available Close the door.
not_available What's up? Before I make my decision about giving this tape to the DA I wanted to talk to you.
not_available Okay.
not_available I wanted you to understand what you're up against.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'm ready to go.
not_available No.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available We're going to the press with a story about some bad men committing murder and trying to frame you.
not_available But these men are going to shift the attention to you and your involvement with Lyle Gibson's death.
not_available Ultimately, they're going to make this about you.
not_available On television, in the press, everywhere you go you're going to be accused of a crime you did not commit.
not_available Can you live through that? 
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available Don't just say it.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Dad what do you think I've been living through? Not just today, but for years.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I was wrong to go to Mom and Carl.
not_available I should've come forward right away taken my hits right then and there.
not_available But I was scared.
not_available Well, that's what you learn.
not_available It's okay to be scared.
not_available What I said last night about you not being there it's not true.
not_available It's what I told myself so I can blame you for my screw
not_available up.
not_available Doesn't matter why you said it.
not_available Fact is, there's some truth to it.
not_available I haven't always been there.
not_available But I'm here now.
not_available Jovan.
not_available Yes, Andre? I can't find Alexis.
not_available Have you heard from him? No.
not_available He's meeting Morgan in 20 minutes.
not_available We must talk.
not_available I don't know, Andre I've got my own situation to deal with.
not_available Still no sign of the women? 
not_available I'll find them.
not_available You checked the hospitals? I checked everywhere.
not_available I don't need you looking over my shoulder.
not_available I'll find them and kill them.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Calm down, Jovan.
not_available And don't tell me not to worry.
not_available Just tell me how you plan to find them.
not_available I'm going to the Bauer house.
not_available Eventually someone will show.
not_available My aunt isn't there.
not_available Is there anyone else? I've tried everyone I can think of.
not_available No one's heard from my mom.
not_available Rick, we got things to do.
not_available She's got to go.
not_available What kind of things? You'll find out when Frank gets here.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? Kim's in trouble.
not_available I got to help her.
not_available Yeah, and we'll be in trouble, too.
not_available Look, she has to leave.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Kim, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available I just need to talk to her and then she'll go.
not_available Where will you go? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available A park my parents said to go in case of an emergency.
not_available Maybe she's there.
not_available Why don't you go home? No.
not_available The people that are after us probably know where I live.
not_available If she's safe, she's won't go there.
not_available How are you going to get there? I don't know.
not_available Can I borrow your car? It's not mine, it's Melanie's.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Here.
not_available Take this.
not_available You can get a cab a couple blocks down the street.
not_available Are you sure you can't come with me? After last night, I got to lay low.
not_available They'll be looking for me.
not_available I still think you should turn yourself in.
not_available It's not that bad.
not_available You helped us escape.
not_available I'm on probation.
not_available They catch me, I'm going to prison.
not_available It doesn't matter what you or your folks say.
not_available I wish we would've met before this.
not_available So do I.
not_available Are you going to be okay? Yeah.
not_available I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.
not_available You wouldn't be in trouble if it wasn't for me.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Dan would've found someone else.
not_available Hey, Rick.
not_available Hey.
not_available How did it go last night? Went fine.
not_available Yeah? Doesn't look fine.
not_available What happened to you? Nothing, I'm okay.
not_available Hey, Dan! Dan! Go, just leave.
not_available Grab a cab on 4th.
not_available I know.
not_available Where's my brother? 
not_available He's out.
not_available Out where? 
not_available We got separated.
not_available Where's the money? 
not_available He's got it.
not_available I should get going.
not_available Where are you going? What do you mean? 
not_available I don't know you.
not_available My name's Kim.
not_available Hi, how do you know Rick? She's a friend from San Diego.
not_available She's got to get back home.
not_available She's not going.
not_available What's that mean? My brother and my money aren't here and I don't know her.
not_available She's a friend
not_available I understand but I got business here in half an hour.
not_available Until Dan gets back with the money, nobody leaves.
not_available The teams will be in hidden positions here, here, here and here.
not_available And communications? 
not_available I'll be on the same channel.
not_available Exits? They'll be covered, but I'll double up with one here 
not_available at the widest exit.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, you all set up? Yeah.
not_available Are the teams in place? That's what I wanted to call you about.
not_available Hanlin's running backup.
not_available What? 
not_available Hang on.
not_available I'm sure it will be fine.
not_available Just avoid a confrontation.
not_available Damn it, how could you let this happen? Look, Jack, I'm sorry.
not_available I just found out.
not_available Division made the assignment.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available I'll deal with it.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available What? Teddy Hanlin's in charge of backup.
not_available Seth Campbell's old partner? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Great.
not_available Who are you calling? The safe house.
not_available I want to be sure Teri and Kim are all right.
not_available No one's picking up.
not_available You sure this is the number? It's the number Paulson gave me.
not_available Why can't I get through? Jack.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available I haven't seen you since you put my partner away.
not_available Teddy, don't start.
not_available Teddy, is your team in place? Yeah, we're not up here shopping for Dockers.
not_available I heard you screwed up today.
not_available I guess some people have connections and don't get spanked when they break the law.
not_available The guy we're looking for is wearing a red cap.
not_available That's all we know about him.
not_available I'm going to stay visible, hopefully draw him to me.
not_available No one makes a move until I give the word, is that clear? Yeah.
not_available It's your show.
not_available Just make sure you stay put when you do.
not_available I always get a bit nervous about target confusion, and I'd hate to see one of the good guys go down by mistake.
not_available Teddy, let's get started, okay? Hey.
not_available I don't want a problem on this.
not_available Hey, I got a call from the Rampart Division.
not_available They got a report that a woman matching Teri's description was seen in Griffith Park.
not_available It's not far from the safe house.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available She disappeared.
not_available I'll get on the satellite uplink.
not_available Get someone posted at the Bauer house.
not_available Williams should be there in minutes.
not_available Good work.
not_available I don't like what I'm seeing.
not_available Looks like you've been roughed up by someone.
not_available Do you think maybe that I hit my head? That that's why I can't remember? That's just it.
not_available There's no evidence of a head injury.
not_available Except for your memory loss, you're coherent.
not_available Beside the bruises, do you have any other pain? Yeah.
not_available Something's been bothering me, sort of here.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What do you think happened to me? I don't know.
not_available But I think you have a condition.
not_available It's called disassociative amnesia, and it can happen to someone when they suffer an intense emotional trauma.
not_available Now, we need to get you to a hospital so they can figure out what's going on.
not_available No, I don't want to do that.
not_available I can't explain it, but for some reason I just.
not_available I don't want to go to a hospital.
not_available I have this gut feeling that it would be dangerous
not_available How could it be dangerous? How could it be dangerous? I'd be by your side the entire time.
not_available Come on, it'll be fine.
not_available No, I don't want to go.
not_available We can't stay here.
not_available You need to get checked out.
not_available Neural damage could become permanent if it's not treated right away.
not_available No, I don't want to go.
not_available I don't want to go.
not_available I don't want to go to the hospital.
not_available Please don't make me go.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
not_available I don't want to go to the hospital.
not_available Okay.
not_available I can't go.
not_available Please, Phil, just take me home.
not_available Okay, it's okay.
not_available Right.
not_available I heard.
not_available No, we did much better in New York than we thought.
not_available Oh, yeah, definitely.
not_available Oh, yeah, that'll make him very happy.
not_available Oh, I think so, too.
not_available The DNC, they'll really milk it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, I.
not_available I'm not sure, but.
not_available Well, that's good, though.
not_available No, I spoke to Chris.
not_available I told him we'd be in Baltimore If we won New York.
not_available Right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jerry? Jerry, listen.
not_available I got to run.
not_available We'll touch base in a couple of hours, okay? Well, how are Beth and the girls? That's terrific.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Patty.
not_available Do you know where David went? Just down to the conference room.
not_available He and Mike are meeting with the publicist.
not_available Did he say how long he'd be? He didn't say.
not_available It shouldn't be more than 15 to 20 minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you hear about New York? Yeah.
not_available Isn't it great? There you are.
not_available Jerry's on the line.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available He said he just wanted to
not_available Well, I'm busy, Patty.
not_available Tell him I'll call him back.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, Dan.
not_available Where's Keith? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I heard you two had a talk.
not_available Yes, we did.
not_available You should talk to him, too.
not_available Really? Well, about what? We're putting him in a tough place.
not_available He's going to need our support.
not_available No, David.
not_available You're the one who's put him in a tough place.
not_available As for needing us our baby left the nest a long time ago.
not_available I don't think he cares to hear what I have to say.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available Speak to him, Sherry.
not_available I destroyed it.
not_available You destroyed the tape? And I know you're going to be angry but it had to be done.
not_available You have blinders on.
not_available You're not seeing this thing very clearly.
not_available It's for the best.
not_available It breaks my heart that I was right.
not_available Right about what, David? That wasn't the real tape, Sherry.
not_available I've learned that I don't know you as well as I thought I did.
not_available I had to see just how far you were willing to go.
not_available I will do anything to protect my family, David.
not_available Anything.
not_available Does that make me a bad person? I want you to set up a press conference.
not_available When? 
not_available Now.
not_available We've got one coming up in less than three hours.
not_available I want this one within the hour.
not_available Where? 
not_available Downstairs.
not_available I don't want anything to interfere with what I have to say.
not_available I'm on Channel 1.
not_available Do you copy? I hear you, Jack.
not_available The signal's good.
not_available Where are you posted? Just under the east entrance, right under the bridge.
not_available Good.
not_available How about you, Teddy? My teams are in position.
not_available Okay, I got you.
not_available You're blocking my view.
not_available Take a couple of steps back.
not_available How's that? There you go.
not_available Perfect shot.
not_available Okay.
not_available There you go, ma'am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're a very sensitive guy, Jack.
not_available I've never seen that side of you.
not_available Drop it, Teddy.
not_available We're working.
not_available Jack can walk and chew gum at the same time.
not_available Can't you, Jack? What do you want? Nothing.
not_available It's just that we're both so busy we never really get a chance to talk.
not_available Did you hear about Seth Campbell's wife, Judy? No.
not_available What about her? She hung herself.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Happened a couple of weeks ago.
not_available I guess you didn't get the memo? It was a real tragedy.
not_available She didn't even leave a note.
not_available I guess she thought it was kind of obvious trying to raise four kids with a husband in prison and no pension.
not_available Because why, Jack? You busted him for lining his pocket with a few extra dollars? Look, I am sorry about Judy and I'm sorry about his kids, but this is not the time.
not_available That's right, you're busy.
not_available Can this wait, Teddy? Of course.
not_available I just thought it would be nice to, you know, catch up while we're hanging.
not_available Teddy, I understand why you're upset.
not_available If you want, when this is over, I'll be happy to talk with you and tell you my side of the story.
not_available I'd really like to hear your side of the story, Jack.
not_available Why don't we go to a Starbucks get a couple of cappuccinos and we can have a little chin
not_available wag? CTU.
not_available Mason.
not_available George, we have a problem.
not_available What's that? Teddy's on the open channel hassling Jack.
not_available He's got a rifle and this place is crawling with people.
not_available It's too late to swap him out.
not_available This is going down soon.
not_available We have to do something.
not_available What channel are you on? 
not_available Channel 1.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Want to conference me in on Channel 1? Sure.
not_available Hanlin, it's Mason.
not_available What's the matter with you? You got a problem with Jack, bury it.
not_available You realize how many agents we've lost today? You're in an uncontained area.
not_available We don't know what we've got.
not_available So let's get on the same page now.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Jack, you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available Hello? Yeah, man, it's cool.
not_available He'll be here.
not_available CTU, this is Williams.
not_available I've arrived at the Bauer house.
not_available Checking perimeter.
not_available Is this my neighborhood? Not quite.
not_available We'll be there soon.
not_available Rick says he and Dan got separated.
not_available No, he'll be here soon.
not_available He knows we need the cash by 7:00.
not_available What happens when Dan doesn't show up? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm not going to tell him his brother's dead.
not_available Why not? You didn't do it.
not_available He's going to find out.
not_available Not from me.
not_available What? I don't understand.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Doing this deal is suicide.
not_available I'm not talking about the deal.
not_available I'm talking about you.
not_available What do you mean? You have so much going for you.
not_available You're smart, you're good
not_available looking, you're funny.
not_available How did you end up like this? 
not_available I'm doing all right.
not_available All right? You're wanted by the police.
not_available You got shot in the arm.
not_available Your friends you hang out with are criminals.
not_available Do you really want to end up here? I do the best I can.
not_available I didn't grow up like you did.
not_available That's just an excuse.
not_available I have a friend named Todd.
not_available He went through two foster homes.
not_available He got a scholarship to Stanford now.
not_available Good for Todd.
not_available Why didn't you go to his house? He can't help me find my mom.
not_available Neither can I.
not_available Look, I know you're right.
not_available If I get the chance, I'll turn myself around.
not_available But this thing is what it is.
not_available We have to find a way to get through it.
not_available Get through it? This is crazy.
not_available You can't let Frank make a drug deal without any money.
not_available We're not going to get through this.
not_available We'll get stuck in the middle of it.
not_available You've got to talk to him.
not_available Hey, stud.
not_available Think fast.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, what deal? We're going to take the $20,000 you made last night and buy some ecstasy.
not_available Dan didn't tell you? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll flip it to these guys from Redondo.
not_available They'll pay $50,000 for it.
not_available What happens if Dan doesn't show up? Hey.
not_available If Dan says he'll be here, he'll be here.
not_available Someone get these kids out of here.
not_available Station 1, that's you.
not_available Roger.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Hold up.
not_available I think I got him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Alexis? Yeah.
not_available I told you, inside the restaurant.
not_available We're doing it out here.
not_available Why? There's a cop inside the restaurant.
not_available Come on, let's get this over with.
not_available Fine.
not_available Where's the money? First, let's go over it again.
not_available Over what? What you're supposed to do for me.
not_available At 7:20 tonight, I'm going to shut down the power on Grid 26, GG.
not_available Five minutes later, it comes back up.
not_available What else? What do you mean, "what else"? What happened to your accent? You're not Alexis.
not_available He's moving! Station 2, what do you see? I got him.
not_available I can take him.
not_available No.
not_available He's not a threat.
not_available I can get him.
not_available All teams, hold your fire.
not_available He's going over the east bridge.
not_available Cover the exits.
not_available I'll slow him down for you.
not_available Don't shoot! I'm going to put him down.
not_available I repeat, do not shoot.
not_available Nobody shoot! Relax, Jack.
not_available I'll just wing him.
not_available Do not shoot! Teddy, stand down! No! Stay back! Get me a medic down here now! Hanlin, you son of a bitch, I said, don't shoot! Take care of this.
not_available Stay back! Suspect's down.
not_available I repeat, suspect is down.
not_available We need EMTs at the east end of the plaza.
not_available This is your house.
