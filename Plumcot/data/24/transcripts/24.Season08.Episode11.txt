
not_available Cole, he's dead.
not_available Just go.
not_available Nobody knows you had anything to do with this.
not_available I don't want you involved.
not_available I'm already involved.
not_available We're cleaning this up, and no one's never gonna know what happened.
not_available They're scum, Dana, and no one's gonna miss 'em.
not_available Kayla may be in danger.
not_available She's run away.
not_available With Tarin.
not_available She's somewhere in the city with no idea that a nuclear threat exists.
not_available And, Omar, what about you? Don't worry about me.
not_available Just help me find our daughter.
not_available Come inside.
not_available They have the rods you are looking for.
not_available I thought you had the rods.
not_available They turned against me.
not_available I can help you find them.
not_available Just get me out of here.
not_available You find Farhad? Still looking.
not_available He won't get far.
not_available Medic! Come on! Medic! I need you to identify the men who stole the nuclear rods from you.
not_available Can you do that for us? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Blood pressure's dropping.
not_available We got a rapid heartbeat.
not_available We lost him.
not_available Farhad's dead.
not_available Damn it! Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed.
not_available I'm saying that we use Farhad as dead bait.
not_available Leak it to the press that we've got him in custody, and he survived, and they'll have to make a move on him.
not_available Tell the support teams it is imperative that we take these terrorists alive.
not_available Go! Go! It's all right.
not_available We just want to talk to you.
not_available No.
not_available No! He's still moving.
not_available Notify the perimeter.
not_available It was a trap.
not_available Farhad was already dead.
not_available I locked myself in some kind of oxygen chamber.
not_available They can't get in here.
not_available You know what you must do.
not_available I can't.
not_available They scrambled the arming code.
not_available You need to set it off manually.
not_available You cannot let them take you alive.
not_available Can you hear me? What's the status? The hyperbaric chamber is one
not_available inch steel all around.
not_available Hermetically sealed, air and power systems are internal.
not_available Also, its atmosphere is most likely oxygen
not_available enriched.
not_available Anything we use to blow the door could ignite a fire inside.
not_available How long will it take to cut in? We need to use a low
not_available speed drill to avoid sparks.
not_available How long? Best estimate: 40 minutes, unless you want us to push the risk.
not_available I can't take the chance.
not_available We need him alive.
not_available Agent Bauer, the techs have got the internal cameras online.
not_available We have eyes on him.
not_available What about the intercom? The intercom's still down from when he shorted out the locking mechanism.
not_available And the bomb techs say we have a bigger problem.
not_available What? They assumed that once we jammed the signal to the detonator, it'd be impossible for the suspect to explode the vest.
not_available Turns out that may not be the case.
not_available He's reconfiguring the circuits.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The detonator's German military, so our guys are familiar with it.
not_available The end
not_available around he's sketched out here will work.
not_available What's the timeframe? Well, it depends on how fast he works.
not_available He needs to reset four circuits.
not_available That LED light indicates he's already completed one.
not_available When he wires the other three, he'll be able to explode the device at will.
not_available The only upside is the chamber will contain the blast.
not_available No one else will be hurt.
not_available He's not trying to hurt anybody.
not_available He's trying to make sure we don't take him alive.
not_available Get that intercom up and running.
not_available I need to talk to him as soon as possible.
not_available Sir.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Let me speak to Hastings.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, Jack Bauer on the line.
not_available So, what have you got, Jack? It looks like our suspect might be able to get the detonator working before we can get to him.
not_available Owen will fill you in on the details.
not_available Right now, I need to know everything you've got on him.
not_available I'm just pulling up the information now, Jack.
not_available It took a while to get it from Hassan's intelligence people.
not_available Just give me the overview.
not_available Okay, Marcos Al
not_available Zacar was born here, raised in East Harlem.
not_available Mother's American, father was from the IRK.
not_available That's where Al
not_available Zacar got his politics from.
not_available His father was a professor known to be highly critical of American foreign policies, suspected of connections with extremists.
not_available He was imprisoned by Wayne Palmer's administration for four months.
not_available Although the charges were eventually dropped, he was unhireable after that.
not_available Almost a year later, he committed suicide.
not_available That must have been what triggered Al
not_available Zacar.
not_available He started spying on America for the IRK two months after that.
not_available What about the mother? Checking current records.
not_available According to motor vehicle and utility records she's still in East Harlem.
not_available Find her and get her here as soon as possible.
not_available We're on it, Jack.
not_available Keep us posted.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We have to assume the people building this dirty bomb want to hit a high
not_available value target here in Manhattan.
not_available But first, they've got to get it on the island.
not_available We should shut down the city? 
not_available No.
not_available We want them to make the attempt to move the radiological materials.
not_available It's our best chance of catching them.
not_available First, we have to make sure that all of our radiation sensors are strictly monitored at all crossings.
not_available Arlo, that goes for the drone sensors, too.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available That's all.
not_available Cole? We went over this.
not_available All we have to do is act natural.
not_available Keep our heads.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available I am not worried about me.
not_available You can't really be this calm after what just happened.
not_available You've never broken a law in your life.
not_available Cole.
not_available What do you want me to say? I don't know! Anything.
not_available Tell me you hate me.
not_available Tell me that you'll never forgive me for lying to you.
not_available We're not doing this now.
not_available I told you to walk away 
not_available Not now! We're in the middle of a radiological threat.
not_available We got jobs to do.
not_available When it's over, then we'll talk.
not_available Look, I can't promise things are going back to the way they were.
not_available But I wouldn't have done what I did if I didn't still love you.
not_available You two have holy hell to answer for.
not_available Sir, I'm sorry.
not_available I can explain 
not_available Save it.
not_available If you were following up a lead, you should have been updating me every 20 minutes.
not_available You broke protocol.
not_available The lead didn't pan out.
not_available Witness proved to be unreliable.
not_available But you're right, sir, there's no excuse.
not_available I should have called in.
not_available And you were supposed to be servicing a faulty relay station.
not_available Yet I see you found time to change your clothes.
not_available Look.
not_available I don't know what's going on with you two and, frankly, I don't care.
not_available If we weren't at high alert, and you weren't the best at what you do, you'd both be out on your asses for this.
not_available I'm going to ask you once.
not_available Whatever it is, are you finished? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Walsh, until further notice, you will answer to Chloe O'Brian.
not_available She will fill you in on what she needs from you.
not_available Bauer has a situation at St.
not_available Julian's Hospital.
not_available I need you to assemble a team, pick up an Elaine Al
not_available Zacar from East 117th and take her to him.
not_available Is she a hostile? 
not_available Unclear.
not_available Arlo will fill you in on the details.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How you perform from this point will determine whether or not you salvage your careers.
not_available Now, get to work.
not_available Yes? I'm in place.
not_available I've managed to tap into the hospital's security cameras.
not_available But we can only pick up audio in the hallway outside the room.
not_available CTU has set up a command center there.
not_available Can you see Marcos? Yes.
not_available He's still working on the detonator.
not_available Are you able to gauge his progress? He already has one of the four circuits reconfigured.
not_available We're arriving at the landing now.
not_available Soon we'll be able to transport the rods into Manhattan.
not_available Are CTU's radiation sensors down? Not yet.
not_available But we'll be ready.
not_available Call me when Marcos is dead.
not_available Port Authority's reporting no hits on the radiation sensors at the Holland, Midtown and Lincoln Tunnels.
not_available I don't see any stream updates for the GW, Brooklyn or Queens crossings.
not_available What the problem? MTA's providing that feed on a dedicated sublink to prevent a server overload.
not_available You can access it yourself on the system's Ethernet port.
not_available So there's really no problem.
not_available There's no way I could have known that since you didn't put that in your hourlies.
not_available Right.
not_available I will do that next time.
not_available I know this must be hard for you, having to report to me since you've been demoted.
not_available It's okay, Chloe, I deserved it.
not_available Yeah, you did.
not_available I just want you to know I'm actually glad you didn't get fired or anything and Hang in there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Where are we on aerial detection? I've got drones covering every inch of the waterfront with their radiation detectors cranked up.
not_available If they try to bring the fuel rods into the city by boat, we'll spot them.
not_available Easily.
not_available Look, I know you probably hate my guts right now, but I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry.
not_available For telling Cole about you and that other guy.
not_available I mean, you were definitely messing up, and with the threat of those rods out there Don't worry about it, Arlo.
not_available So is he gone? Who? You know.
not_available The other guy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, he's gone.
not_available So, you and the Boy Scout are okay? We'll get through it.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available But if for some reason that changes 
not_available I know.
not_available Meaning, if you ever decide you want to trade up I got it.
not_available Sir, we got the intercom to the chamber working.
not_available You should be able to talk to the suspect.
not_available Good.
not_available Tell CTU I'll keep my comm up so they can monitor.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Marcos, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm working with CTU.
not_available I know the original plan was to smuggle the fuel rods back to the IRK to reconstitute their nuclear program.
not_available So I'm just guessing that helping to deliver a dirty bomb to New York City which will cost the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people isn't exactly what you signed on for.
not_available But the truth is if you do this, you'll be killing the IRK.
not_available By bombing New York City, you're going to force President Taylor to retaliate, and she will, hard.
not_available You can't possibly want that.
not_available It doesn't matter what I want.
not_available This so
not_available called peace agreement, it's just Hassan signing away my country's ability to defend itself, its independence.
not_available He's surrendering without a fight.
not_available But there are a lot of people in his own government who are not willing to do that.
not_available Marcos, you can't win this fight.
not_available The IRK will sustain massive casualties because of this.
not_available Because of you.
not_available Not because of me.
not_available America will be the one dropping all the bombs.
not_available No, son.
not_available The eyes of the world will hold you responsible for the innocent lives taken in New York City.
not_available No, don't think you can take the moral high ground with me.
not_available The arrogance of this country.
not_available That it feels it can dictate to the rest of the world who gets who gets to have nuclear weapons, while it insists on keeping my people in the Dark Ages.
not_available You keep saying "your people, your country." Marcos, I read your file.
not_available You were born here.
not_available You're an American citizen.
not_available Your father is from the IRK.
not_available You leave my father out of this! What happened to your father was unfair and tragic, but this is no way to honor his memory.
not_available Please, you can still do the right thing here.
not_available You can help me stop this from happening.
not_available All you have to do is open the door.
not_available Please, I'm begging you.
not_available You're not going to get me to change my mind.
not_available I came here prepared to die.
not_available And that's what's going to happen.
not_available Marcos.
not_available Marcos.
not_available Please, just talk to me.
not_available Marcos! Marcos! Yes, of course.
not_available I understand.
not_available We'll see you soon.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Your friend at the State Department, you trust he can do what he says, give us asylum? Yes.
not_available He says with what your father has been doing, ordering unlawful arrest and torture U.S.
not_available law will consider us political refugees.
not_available But you have to understand, asylum will not be granted overnight.
not_available Well, how long are we talking about? A year, maybe 18 months.
not_available But as soon as we file the application, we are protected by the law.
not_available Your father cannot touch us.
not_available You know that I will not be able to work here legally until asylum has been granted.
not_available I have some savings.
not_available But I will not be able to give you the life that you have been used to.
not_available Oh, you know I don't care about any of that.
not_available One minute.
not_available Oh my mother again.
not_available I really should answer it.
not_available Kayla.
not_available No, she deserves to know I'm all right.
not_available Give that back to me! 
not_available Please.
not_available You know what? You can call her when the lawyer has filed the application.
not_available We must wait until then.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Kayla, it's me again.
not_available Darling, I need to talk to you.
not_available Your father told me something terrible may be happening here in New York.
not_available Please, call me back as soon as you get this message.
not_available I still can't reach her.
not_available Thank you for coming back.
not_available Our daughter is missing.
not_available I'm not leaving until I know she's all right.
not_available We'll find her, Dalia.
not_available Nabeel told me you had Tarin arrested.
not_available I didn't know who I could trust.
not_available So you started arresting people from inside your own delegation? What possible evidence could you have gathered so quickly? 
not_available I had to do something.
not_available But Tarin? He's one of your most loyal men.
not_available So was my brother.
not_available Or so I thought.
not_available Until he tried to have me killed and destroy my government.
not_available If you continue to act the way you have been, you will have done the job for him.
not_available Have you told the police? I've been trying to deal with it on my own.
not_available But it's time to get them involved.
not_available Dalia, I'm sorry.
not_available As you should be! This city is under attack! Our daughter is god knows where! You drove her away with your suspicion and your paranoia! How could you, Omar? How could you have lost your way? Dalia.
not_available You're right.
not_available I have.
not_available I have.
not_available I see that now.
not_available And I'll make changes.
not_available I'll do everything in my power to find her.
not_available And get her safe.
not_available You have my word.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available Dalia, I'm sorry.
not_available Who is it? Elaine Al
not_available Zacar? What do you want? My name is Cole Ortiz.
not_available I'm an agent with CTU.
not_available I need you to open that door, ma'am.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What's this about? Your son, Marcos.
not_available Marcos? Ma'am, you're either going to open that door or I'm gonna break it down.
not_available Now! Go, go! Put your hands up! Mrs.
not_available AlZacar, are you aware of where your son is right now? 
not_available Not at the moment.
not_available How much do you know about his activities on behalf of the IRK? 
not_available Uh I know that he communicates with family there, if that's what you mean.
not_available You going somewhere? I was just about to leave to my sister's house.
not_available You do that a lot, take trips to visit relatives at No, I don't.
not_available I can explain.
not_available Marcos called me about an hour ago.
not_available He told me to leave the city.
not_available He said he needed me to meet him at my sister's house in Pennsylvania.
not_available He didn't tell you anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available I swear.
not_available Ma'am, right now your son's barricaded himself at St.
not_available Julian's Hospital, trying to blow himself up with a suicide vest.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available No! I need you to come with me to St.
not_available Julian's, ma'am.
not_available We don't know how much longer we have till your son can activate the explosives, we have to go.
not_available Yes? Sir, Cole just checked in.
not_available He's got AlZacar's mother and he's en route 
not_available to St.
not_available Julian's now.
not_available What's his ETA? Less than ten minutes.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sir, I would like to apologize again for leaving my post.
not_available I know that I let you down.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available I brought you in and gave you this promotion because I saw something in you, not just your skill, which is considerable.
not_available But an ability to adapt to any situation, drive to be better, attributes that make you a good leader.
not_available Or did I misread that? No, sir.
not_available So we can chalk up the last several hours to a serious lapse in judgment? What I was 
not_available Look.
not_available I don't want to lose you or Cole.
not_available You're both valuable, but everyone is replaceable.
not_available I screwed up and I'm willing to accept the consequences.
not_available I know that Cole feels the same way.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Hello? Can I ask who I'm speaking with? Excuse me? Would you mind telling me your name, please? This is Dana Walsh.
not_available Who is this? Forgive me, Miss Walsh, for calling at this ungodly hour.
not_available I actually expected to leave a message.
not_available I'm sorry if I woke you.
not_available No, no, that's okay.
not_available I'm actually at work.
not_available What is this regarding? Well, my name's Prady.
not_available I'm with the Department of Corrections down in Little Rock.
not_available I'm trying to locate an individual by the name of Kevin Wade.
not_available I I'm sorry.
not_available Who did you say that you were again? Bill Prady.
not_available I'm a probation officer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wade is one of my charges.
not_available Do you know him? No, no.
not_available I don't think that I do.
not_available Well, that's peculiar since he dialed this number a few days ago from a motel room in Queens.
not_available Probably just a misdial.
not_available No.
not_available Dialed this number more than once, and some of the calls lasted more than a couple of minutes.
not_available Look, Mr.
not_available Prady, I am really busy right now.
not_available I work for CTU and we are in the middle of a crisis.
not_available Well, I completely understand.
not_available I've heard the news.
not_available But since we're both awake, I wonder if I could meet with you in person.
not_available You mean now? Well, I got an early flight to Little Rock in the morning, so, yeah, it'd pretty much have to be now, ma'am.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I I don't really understand why this is so pressing.
not_available Well, Miss Walsh, I've grown kind of fond of young Kevin, and the longer it takes me to find him, the harder it'll be for me to keep him from going back into prison.
not_available I don't really see how I can be of any help.
not_available Yeah, well, maybe not.
not_available But we can determine that when we speak.
not_available Like I said, it won't take long.
not_available Look, if it'll smooth things over, I could call your supervisor.
not_available No, no.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available I'm sure that I could spare a few minutes for you.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available That would be super.
not_available Tell you what.
not_available Let me just pull over, and I'll get your address.
not_available All right? Of course.
not_available Sir, according to the bomb techs, he's close.
not_available Getting that third circuit active was the toughest part.
not_available The fourth is only a matter of rerouting the firing circuits.
not_available What's the time frame? Ten minutes, maybe less.
not_available How much longer is it going to take them to drill through? Too long.
not_available They're not going to make it.
not_available Get her some water.
not_available Take care of that.
not_available Did she resist? Not once I told her her boy had explosives strapped to him and was going to blow himself up.
not_available She had a packed suitcase, Jack.
not_available So he cares enough about her to make sure she got out of town.
not_available What else does she know? Nothing, as far as I can tell.
not_available And I didn't tell her anything more.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Al
not_available Zacar, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm in charge of field operations here.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available I'm going to take you to him.
not_available I want to see him.
not_available I'm going to take you to him.
not_available Please sit down.
not_available I need you to fully understand the situation.
not_available Please.
not_available This is Ortiz.
not_available Cole, it's me.
not_available Kevin's probation officer just called me.
not_available He's in New York, trying to track down Kevin.
not_available I can't talk to you about this now.
not_available We're in the middle here.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I told him I didn't know who Kevin was, but he caught me in the lie.
not_available He has records that show him calling my cell several times.
not_available Cole, this probation officer is on his way here.
not_available Look, you're going to have to figure out a reason why he had your number.
not_available I don't know if I can do this.
not_available What, lie? Come on, we both know you're good at it.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Look, you just have to handle this.
not_available Okay? All right? Yeah.
not_available Let me know what happens.
not_available I got to go.
not_available I can't believe this is happening.
not_available You need to believe it.
not_available The men your son is working with intend on detonating a radiological bomb somewhere in Manhattan.
not_available That's why your son tried to get you out of the city.
not_available Marcos has been an agent for the IRK, spying on this country since your husband died.
not_available We have proof of that.
not_available And now he's going to kill himself in order to protect this plot unless you can convince him otherwise.
not_available What do what do I say to him? Whatever you have to, to get him to stop rearming that vest, and open the door.
not_available We need him to open the door.
not_available Do you understand? If he does that, then what happens to him? He'll be alive.
not_available If he cooperates with us, I promise you, I will do everything I can to help him.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we need to do this now.
not_available We need the room.
not_available Now.
not_available It's definitely her.
not_available Marcos's mother.
not_available You recruited him, Ali.
not_available You know him better than anyone.
not_available Will she be able to talk him down? He's loyal to our country.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Marcos? Marcos, it's me.
not_available Mom, what are you doing here? Marcos, you have to stop this.
not_available This is crazy.
not_available You son of a bitch! Leave us alone! You leave us alone! Marcos, talk to me.
not_available Oh, my God, Mom.
not_available I told you to get out of the city.
not_available I told you to go to Aunt Shelley's.
not_available Why didn't you listen to me? I'm listening now.
not_available You told me that you were going to meet me there.
not_available I believed you.
not_available I was trying to protect you.
not_available From a terrorist attack? That's what they say that you're involved in here.
not_available Something that's going to kill many, many people.
not_available Marcos, tell me that's not true! Tell me! Marcos, why? You ask me that? After what this country did to Dad? Marcos, I loved your father.
not_available You know I did.
not_available But he was a complicated man, and especially when it came to his politics.
not_available But he never condoned violence of any kind, Marcos.
not_available Never.
not_available He would agree with what we're doing.
not_available You really think that? He hated America.
not_available And yet he came to America.
not_available He married an American.
not_available He had an American son.
not_available Honey, nothing is as simple as you're making it out to be.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available I've registered a 12% degradation in the hospital's security feed.
not_available Can you boost the signal? You're missing the point.
not_available The indications are someone's tapped into the feed.
not_available They can see everything we can.
not_available I'll see if I can trace it.
not_available I wish I'd done more.
not_available I wish I'd helped you deal with your grief and with your anger.
not_available No, don't put this on yourself.
not_available You couldn't have done any more or been a better mother.
not_available She's almost got him.
not_available Jack, do you copy? Yeah, Chloe.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available The video feed has been compromised.
not_available You're being surveilled.
not_available I couldn't trace the source.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'll take care of it from here.
not_available Owen, how long will it take to disconnect the video system? 
not_available Get on it.
not_available What's going on, Jack? Someone else is watching.
not_available Mom I know what they want you to do.
not_available But it's too late for that.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available You can still turn yourself in.
not_available We'll hire the best lawyers, whatever it takes.
not_available I'll be with you every step of the way.
not_available I promise that.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Marcos, I'm I'm begging you.
not_available Mom, listen to me.
not_available You got to be strong now.
not_available Damn it, no.
not_available Marcos.
not_available Marcos.
not_available Please.
not_available You're all I have.
not_available Please don't do this.
not_available I love you so much.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's over.
not_available Get her out of there.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Now! Move! Marcos, No! No! No! Marcos, no! No! No! Samir, I just lost picture.
not_available Is his mother still in the room? No, but he's still in there with one of the agents.
not_available You detonate that vest, your mother dies, too.
not_available What did you say? You heard me.
not_available I'm going to make sure your mother's in Manhattan when that dirty bomb goes off.
not_available You don't even know what the target is.
not_available I'm not talking about her dying during the explosion.
not_available I'm going to personally escort her to the blast site, so she's exposed to the radiation.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available You wouldn't do that.
not_available You're a federal agent.
not_available Truth is, I'm not, really.
not_available Well, not anymore.
not_available I'm more of a specialist that they brought in for today.
not_available If you knew who I was, and things I've done before in my life, you would know that I'm not bluffing.
not_available So, go ahead.
not_available Blow yourself up into a million pieces.
not_available First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make your mother come in here and clean it up.
not_available And then I'm going to take her to the blast site.
not_available Do you know how long it takes a human body to absorb a lethal dose of cesium 137? Five seconds.
not_available Followed by 12 days of pain that's so agonizing, morphine can't even touch it.
not_available You got a decision to make.
not_available Make it carefully.
not_available You're not gonna hurt my mother.
not_available I am done playing with you.
not_available You look into my eyes.
not_available Look in my eyes! You think I'm joking.
not_available What happens to your mother is because of you.
not_available Only you.
not_available If I open the door and I come out, you promise you won't hurt her? You promise you'll leave her alone? I give you my word.
not_available Cole, I've got some action on the door.
not_available Put your hands up now! Walk towards me! Move! Down on your knees! Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers! Don't you move! Cole, I got four lights on.
not_available Damn it! Cole, I got four lights on! We need bomb techs now.
not_available The suspect's come out of the chamber, but he's managed to arm the vest.
not_available I repeat: he has armed the vest.
not_available We need bomb techs here to disable it now! Samir, Marcos is out of the chamber.
not_available What?! 
not_available They must have talked him out it, but he's rearmed the vest.
not_available You're sure? He's still wearing it? Yes, I think so.
not_available Hang up right now and transmit the fail
not_available safe.
not_available Let's move! Keep you men back! I know the circuit pattern! I'm looking for four common leads before I can disarm it.
not_available What's happening?! What is that?! Cole, they must have triggerd a fail
not_available safe.
not_available Get you men back now.
not_available Move! Move! Move! Get this off of me! I'm gonna try! Just stay calm! Mom! Get her out of here now! Marcos, I might not be able to do this in time.
not_available I need to know what the target is.
not_available I don't know.
not_available How are they gonna smuggle the fuel rods into the city past the radiological detectors? I don't know, I swear! Who does?! Give me a name.
not_available Damn it, Marcos, give me a name! President Hassan's head of security Tarin Faroush! Tarin Faroush.
not_available Did you get that, Cole? Copy! Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available One more.
not_available I'm not gonna be able to do this in time.
not_available You tell my mother I'm sorry.
not_available Jack? Jack, do you copy? CTU, this is Jack.
not_available Marcos is dead.
not_available I'm gonna need to speak to President Hassan.
not_available Commissioner, I appreciate that your NYPD's overburdened, but I would ask you to do whatever you can to have my daughter's picture circulated.
not_available Please keep me posted if you get any information regarding her whereabouts.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sir, CTU is routing a call to you.
not_available From whom? Jack Bauer.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available Bauer? This is President Hassan.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I was told you were briefed on the situation at St.
not_available Julian's Hospital.
not_available I was.
not_available Sir, the suicide bomber is dead.
not_available His explosive vest was remotely detonated.
not_available Then you have no leads.
not_available No, sir, we actually do.
not_available Before the suspect was killed, he identified your head of security, Tarin Faroush, as a co
not_available conspirator.
not_available Tarin? Are you sure about this? Yes, sir.
not_available Right now you need to call UN security and have them take Mr.
not_available Faroush into custody until we get there.
not_available That won't be possible, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Tarin's not here.
not_available Where is he? I don't know.
not_available Somewhere with my daughter.
not_available Excuse me? They are in love so I've learned.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I suspected Tarin hours ago, and had him arrested for questioning.
not_available He escaped while being transported to our embassy.
not_available Kayla believed he was innocent, and has, apparently, run away with him.
not_available Do you have any idea where they might be? None.
not_available Can you contact your daughter? My wife has made several attempts, but she isn't answering her phone.
not_available Sir, you need to keep trying.
not_available Right now Mr.
not_available Faroush is our only lead.
not_available I'm going to jump in the shower.
not_available Hello, Mother.
not_available Kayla? I have her.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, 
not_available Darling, are you all right? we have Kayla on line with her mother.
not_available Oh, I'm fine, Mother.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you need to get me an address.
not_available I'm sorry I've been ignoring your calls, but I know Father has put you up to this.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available You know I can't tell you that.
not_available Is Tarin with you? Not at the moment, no.
not_available He doesn't want me to speak to anyone.
not_available Kayla, listen to me, you are in danger.
not_available Tarin is working with your father's enemies.
not_available That's not true.
not_available It's Father's paranoid delusions.
not_available It isn't.
not_available CTU just called to confirm.
not_available They're on the line with your father now.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Kayla, please.
not_available You know I loathed your father's behavior and the way that he's handled everything.
not_available I wouldn't be telling you this unless I believed it, too.
not_available Not Tarin.
not_available It has to be a mistake.
not_available Then we'll sort it out together.
not_available But you must tell me where you are.
not_available Kayla! The Teodore Hotel, suite 514.
not_available The Teodore, suite 514.
not_available Kayla, darling, just stay where you are.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available The police will be there shortly.
not_available They are at the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I promise I'll call you once the Americans give us asylum.
not_available Please don't tell Father we spoke.
not_available Kayla? 
not_available I love you, too.
not_available Hello? I thought we agreed you weren't gonna take your mother's call.
not_available I'm sorry, my love.
not_available I just didn't want her to worry.
not_available Did you tell her where we are? Did you? Of course not.
not_available Do you think I'm stupid? You know I could never think such a thing.
not_available You are perfection.
not_available Now come on.
not_available We must get dressed.
not_available Where are we going? Where do you think? To formally request our asylum.
not_available At this hour? My friend at the State Department made the arrangements.
not_available But I'm exhausted.
not_available We haven't even slept.
not_available I suppose you blame me for that, huh? Well, then can't we have a little more time together? No.
not_available Come on.
not_available You must get dressed.
not_available Why don't you just get dressed here? I'm just gonna clean up first.
not_available He's in the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.
not_available And Kayla's Kayla's with him.
not_available Our men are clearing out now.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available Where are we? I could have a Tac team at the Teodore in 20 minutes.
not_available No, NYPD can get there faster.
not_available I want your men to set up a perimeter and wait until we get there.
not_available If any of your men happen to come in contact with the suspect, it is imperative that they know we need to take him alive.
not_available Let's go.
