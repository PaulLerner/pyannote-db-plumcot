
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been targeted.
not_available And people that l work with may be involved in both.
not_available l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.
not_available You just gave your concession speech.
not_available That remains to be seen.
not_available l only hope your conscience comforts you when you finally realise this is all over.
not_available You mean the campaign or us? l saw the car explode.
not_available l lost my daughter! Kim is alive.
not_available She got out before the explosion.
not_available l talked to her.
not_available l'm gonna stick you back in the holding cell.
not_available Maybe that'll convince you not to screw around.
not_available Call this number.
not_available Tell them that l am Jack Bauer's daughter and that l'm here.
not_available Ask them if they think l'm screwing around.
not_available This is a prison facility.
not_available Why are you here? The people that want Palmer dead bribed someone from the power company.
not_available Something's gonna happen here.
not_available A prisoner's being delivered by chopper.
not_available His identity's classified, even from me.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available You recognise him? That's Victor Drazen, the man l killed two years ago.
not_available You haven't heard from your brother? 
not_available You seem anxious, Harris.
not_available Just getyour men ready.
not_available lt's time.
not_available The idea is to get my father out of prison.
not_available This is the best chance we'll ever have.
not_available Get against the wall.
not_available They are here.
not_available Well, it's official.
not_available The polls havejust closed in California, and the big story: Senator David Palmer seems to have swept California and every other state that held a primary this Super Tuesday.
not_available lt looks like he may have gotten a late boost based on the roller
not_available coaster events of his day.
not_available Earlier, the senator held a press conference to disclose the details of a scandal involving both his son and his primary financial backers.
not_available Palmer claims to have been unaware of any wrongdoing You're in my seat.
not_available Fine.
not_available l said, that's my seat.
not_available And how about you? 
not_available Would you excuse us for a moment? Thanks a lot.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You did it.
not_available We did it.
not_available That's not the best part.
not_available Fox News just did an instant poll.
not_available you handled the Ferragamo situation.
not_available Boy, that is great! Have we heard from Ames or his people? 
not_available They're all too busy running for cover.
not_available We don't wanna get cocky, but so far it couldn't have turned out better.
not_available Everyone, listen up.
not_available ln a bit, l'm going to give a speech to the country.
not_available We have a number of primaries in the coming months, so technically it's not a victory speech.
not_available But l'm gonna make it sound like one anyway.
not_available Now, as you know, in many ways this has been a difficult day for my family.
not_available And l am confident that being open and honest was the right thing to do, and that things will be resolved fairly for everyone concerned.
not_available And, in the meantime, l wanna thank everyone in this room for their support.
not_available This is our victory.
not_available Yeah! 
not_available This is our night.
not_available Yeah! And l just wanna give one last order, which will be obeyed with no exceptions whatsoever.
not_available Enjoy the rest of the evening.
not_available Division wants an update on the Palmer threat assessment.
not_available With Alexis under control, that threat may be minimal.
not_available Nina, it's your line.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Do what you can to get everyone together.
not_available lt's Bauer.
not_available l got it.
not_available What the hell's goin' on? 
not_available Listen up.
not_available The field we were standing in is hiding an underground detention facility.
not_available lt's being used as a prison to house Victor Drazen.
not_available You said you took him out two years ago.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available l'm staring at him.
not_available There's a team in place.
not_available They're ready to attack us.
not_available They've already cut off the power.
not_available l need you to send in a field unit now! George, what are you gonna do? 
not_available All right, l'll call Division.
not_available By the time you get approval, this whole thing'll be over.
not_available lf Victor Drazen escapes, it'll be our fault.
not_available George, you know what this man can do.
not_available You decide.
not_available What's going on? Dispatch a field unit to the location in Saugus.
not_available l'll clear it from my end.
not_available Get ahold of Chapelle immediately.
not_available What is going on? ls Jack all right? lt is such a shame.
not_available You're wasting the best years of your life on a married man.
not_available George And picking up Almeida on the rebound? 
not_available That is out of line.
not_available No, you're outta line.
not_available Think about it.
not_available l'm just tryin' to be a friend here.
not_available George, just tell me if he's 
not_available Nina, where's Jack? Teri, thank God you're OK.
not_available Any word on Kim? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available But we're working on it.
not_available l need to talk to Jack.
not_available He's not here.
not_available He's on assignment.
not_available On assignment? Has he been told what happened to us? 
not_available Well, not yet.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because we can't get ahold of him.
not_available Get ahold of him now.
not_available Teri, l'm sorry.
not_available lt's just not possible.
not_available Nina, l want to talk to Jack.
not_available Jack's in a situation where he needs our support.
not_available We're doing everything we can.
not_available What kind of situation? 
not_available That's all l can tell you right now.
not_available l need you to tell me everything that happened at your house before Tony arrived.
not_available l already told Tony everything.
not_available But it won't hurt to go over it again.
not_available Any details will help us, and they will help Jack.
not_available All right, but l need to know what's going on with my family.
not_available l know, and l promise l'll give you an update as soon as l have one.
not_available All right? Stand against the door.
not_available Lawrence, what's goin' on out there? Lawrence, do you copy? Ray, this is DeSalvo.
not_available Come in.
not_available Ray! 
not_available We gotta get out of here.
not_available Which way? The flood egress is to the right.
not_available Open the door slowly.
not_available Step out into the middle of the hall.
not_available Turn to your right.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Lawrence, where are you? Lawrence, do you copy? We have to get out of this hallway.
not_available We're too exposed.
not_available All right.
not_available What's the plan? How are they gonna break you outta here? You son of a bitch, if any of my men die What area of this building is most defendable? 
not_available Let's get outta here.
not_available Move.
not_available Fall back.
not_available Defend the retreat.
not_available Turn around.
not_available l've been trying to get ahold of Chapelle.
not_available Whatever he's doing, this is more important.
not_available Well, for starters, l sent a CTU field unit over to a DOD facility.
not_available l need to have some unity of command.
not_available l can give him a message.
not_available All right.
not_available Just get him to call me as soon as you can.
not_available Mrs Bauer.
not_available Teri.
not_available Mason.
not_available l thought you were being debriefed.
not_available Nina won't tell me anything, and l need to know what's going on with Kim.
not_available l'm afraid l don't know any more than Nina does, but l'm sure Kim's safe.
not_available Well, l wish l could believe that, but Based on what? l haven't been fully briefed, but the man that attacked you asked where she was, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So that means they're lookin' for her, too.
not_available As time passes it gets harder for them and easier for us.
not_available There's only a few of them, whereas we can cover the whole city.
not_available And believe me, we are.
not_available Jack is extremely important to all of us here, and nobody's gonna rest easy until your daughter's back with you, safe and sound.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Just doin' my job.
not_available Mason? 
not_available George, it's Nina.
not_available Uh
not_available huh? Our unit will be on site in 15 minutes.
not_available They wanna know who's in command, us or DOD.
not_available We are.
not_available Let me know when they're on site.
not_available All right.
not_available Was that about Jack? We got a lot of things goin' on.
not_available As soon as we get word from Jack, we'll let you know.
not_available You've been very kind.
not_available l'll have my assistant Rebecca look after you.
not_available You let her know if you need anything, OK? Do me a favour, keep your chin up, all right? 
not_available Rebecca.
not_available Yeah? l'm sending Jack's wife down.
not_available Baby
not_available sit her for me.
not_available OK.
not_available What do you want me to do with her? Whatever.
not_available l don't care what you do with her.
not_available Just keep her out of my face, OK? Got it.
not_available Where's Patty? 
not_available She's finishing up your speech.
not_available Hold that for me.
not_available l'll be right back.
not_available Senator.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Looks like you're going to the White House.
not_available We'll know by the end of the day.
not_available Hey, we missed you out there.
not_available Hi.
not_available l'm just going through it one last time.
not_available l made the changes you asked for.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available That's much better.
not_available l'm glad you like it.
not_available l can't believe you won all 11 primaries.
not_available You and your family must be so happy.
not_available Yeah, we are.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it's just all catchin' up with me.
not_available lt's been a long day.
not_available You know what, Patty? Why don't we move the second paragraph to the end? That'll close with the note about party unity.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available Uh, Senator? 
not_available Yes, Patty? There's, um, something l've been wanting to tell you, but every time l start it just seems inappropriate.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Well, it's just that, um l wanted to tell you how much l admire you.
not_available l don't see very many people who stand by their principles the way that you do.
not_available And l truly believe our country would be a better place with you leading it.
not_available Well! What is it? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available l'm just a little flustered.
not_available What a wonderful and unexpected compliment.
not_available Well, l'll just switch those paragraphs.
not_available All right.
not_available Barnes, this is Mason.
not_available What's your 20? We're approaching the site.
not_available What's going on down there? Barnes? Looks like the door's been blown in.
not_available Are the hostiles inside? 
not_available They must be.
not_available No activity here.
not_available We're preparing to go in.
not_available Let my father go! Drop your weapons! Stay back or l will shoot him! You don't stand a chance! Andre! 
not_available Drop it now.
not_available You're surrounded! Back off! Drop your weapons or l will shoot! Let my father go right now or this man dies.
not_available Drop your weapons! 
not_available l'll kill him.
not_available Don't do it, Bauer! Don't release that prisoner.
not_available Drop your weapons or l will shoot him! Drop your weapons! Don't do it, Bauer! 
not_available Drop it! l'll give you three seconds.
not_available One.
not_available Two.
not_available The weapon's up! No! Father! Andre! Where is Alexis? 
not_available He's been out of touch for some time.
not_available We have to assume the worst.
not_available Hostiles outside the main entrance.
not_available How many? At least a dozen, all well
not_available armed.
not_available Collapse the corridor immediately.
not_available Let's hustle, men.
not_available Down here.
not_available Down here.
not_available Take him.
not_available We may need him as a bargaining chip.
not_available Go, go, go! That was a mistake.
not_available Now you're trapped.
not_available We will see.
not_available l told you, don't mess with me.
not_available You got something that belongs to me and you better give it up now.
not_available l ain't got nothin'.
not_available We cool.
not_available l'm your friend.
not_available We cool if you and your girls back off.
not_available You holdin' out on me? You a bad girl.
not_available When we get outta here, maybe l'll mess you up like that.
not_available What is your problem? 
not_available You.
not_available Me? l'm only in here because you told the cops l was a part of the deal.
not_available You were a part of the deal.
not_available l didn't even know it was happening.
not_available Nobody told you to come over.
not_available lf this is about Rick Rick? You think l care about that loser? 
not_available He's not a loser.
not_available He kidnaps you, and you defend him? 
not_available He didn't know what was going on.
not_available Like l said, he's a loser.
not_available What are you shaking your head for? You're Daddy's little girl.
not_available You get everything handed to you.
not_available Shut up! l have been listening to this crap all day.
not_available About how l get everything l want, and how my life is great and everyone else's sucks.
not_available Wanna know something? You don't know anything about me.
not_available Last night l was kidnapped, tied up in a trunk, and then l got to see your friend Dan get shot in the head.
not_available Take all the bad luck you've had, it wouldn't fit into half of what's happened to me today.
not_available So messing me up may not be as easy as you think.
not_available But if you wanna try, bring it on 
not_available here, outside, any place you like.
not_available You think l am a monster because l want revenge on your wife and daughter as well as on you.
not_available You were a monster long before you ever heard of me.
not_available Oh, l see.
not_available You consider yourself informed.
not_available You have read magazines.
not_available You have studied intelligence reports, filed by people who tell their superiors only what they want to hear.
not_available And you have the audacity to judge me? When does your suffering end, Victor? After you've killed me and Senator Palmer and all the thousands of enemies you have? Yes.
not_available Simple, is it not? You're insane.
not_available lt's a psychotic fantasy.
not_available A fantasy which is coming closer and closer to a reality.
not_available This is Victor Drazen.
not_available Whom am l speaking to? This is George Mason.
not_available l'm the district director of the Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available You will be the person l will be negotiating with? Negative.
not_available We do not negotiate with terrorists.
not_available l'm willing to listen to your concerns.
not_available My main concern is Jack Bauer.
not_available Do you know him? 
not_available Yes, l know him.
not_available Do you want to see him alive again? How do l know he's alive? 
not_available George.
not_available Yeah, it's me.
not_available l've counted six of them.
not_available They've got assault rifles.
not_available As you hear, he is alive.
not_available l'll be speaking with my superiors and l'll get back to you.
not_available Drazen's taken command of the facility.
not_available He's got Jack.
not_available There's at least six of them.
not_available They've got assault weapons, explosives.
not_available Get that information to the field unit.
not_available Bring up the layout of the facility.
not_available How did Jack sound? Alive.
not_available lt's gonna be a long drawn
not_available out process.
not_available l know the drill.
not_available And you know it may not turn out well.
not_available lf you want me to put somebody who's less emotionally involved on this, l will.
not_available l can do my job, George.
not_available OK.
not_available Any word from Chapelle? 
not_available l still can't get ahold of him.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available Hope that bastard doesn't plan on blaming me if things go wrong.
not_available Take it.
not_available No way.
not_available l said take it.
not_available No.
not_available Who's smokin' pot? 
not_available That one.
not_available She threw it at me.
not_available Bitch! Why you lyin'? Give it to me.
not_available Give it to me! And who are you? 
not_available l swear it wasn't me.
not_available Oh, you're comin' with me.
not_available She's telling the truth.
not_available Don't make a liar outta me, blondie.
not_available No need.
not_available You are one.
not_available l didn't do nothing! Get off me! l'm gonna get you back, blondie, don't you worry! Officer? Wait.
not_available l wanna talk to the cop who busted me today.
not_available l think his name is Krugman.
not_available You wanna talk to him about what? 
not_available What happened tonight.
not_available He wants to know about it, so tell him that l'm ready to talk.
not_available Come on.
not_available Two years ago in Kosovo the man who went into the building before the explosion obviously wasn't you.
not_available You were using a double.
not_available A common technique.
not_available l am surprised your people were fooled by it.
not_available That's not my point, Victor.
not_available What is your point, Jack? You were using a double.
not_available That means you thought you were a target.
not_available When you let that man near your family, you put them in danger.
not_available You're responsible for their deaths.
not_available They were away on a trip.
not_available My daughter was ill.
not_available They returned one day earlier than expected.
not_available But, yes, l should have been more careful.
not_available Father, are you all right? Over the last two years l have accepted my share of responsibility for the death of my family.
not_available This is the day you accept your share.
not_available Come, Dada.
not_available Make sure he does not die.
not_available Come.
not_available ls this what you wanted? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Much better.
not_available Senator? Yeah, Elaine? 
not_available Mike says they're ready for you downstairs.
not_available Tell him l'll be down in 20 minutes.
not_available Do you have a copy for the TelePrompTer? 
not_available Uh, it's this one.
not_available All but the last page.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Would you like to be left alone? No.
not_available You can work in here if you want.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available What is it? lt's just that l feel bad that this day's been tainted for you.
not_available Don't feel bad for me.
not_available lt's Keith and Nicole who have been suffering.
not_available Excuse me for saying this, but you do that too much.
not_available Do what? 
not_available You worry about everybody else.
not_available Who takes care of you? You all take care of me.
not_available No.
not_available We all want to, but planning schedules and writing speeches isn't taking care of someone.
not_available l'm fine, Patty.
not_available Just relax.
not_available You need this.
not_available Oh, that does feel good.
not_available l appreciate it, Patty.
not_available l really do.
not_available But if l get too comfortable, l may not get off this couch.
not_available Yeah, well, uh l'll just go prepare tomorrow's briefing with Mike.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available CTU.
not_available Myers.
not_available Chapelle calling for Mason.
not_available Yes.
not_available l'll put you through.
not_available Mason.
not_available lt's Chapelle.
not_available Ryan, l've been tryin' to reach you for a half
not_available hour.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, l've been getting reamed by DOD and the Pentagon.
not_available But l think l've managed to untangle the mess you've made.
not_available What are you talking about? You should have kept Bauer on a tighter leash, a lot tighter.
not_available l'm not in love with the guy, but he delivers.
not_available Oh, really? Let's face it, if it wasn't for Jack, Victor Drazen would have escaped, which would have been embarrassing for some, if l'm not mistaken.
not_available You're very mistaken.
not_available l beg your pardon? Come on, George.
not_available Think it through.
not_available Drazen wasn't officially a prisoner, right? So he couldn't officially escape.
not_available lt wouldn't have embarrassed anyone.
not_available lt would have been 
not_available A nonevent.
not_available Exactly.
not_available lnstead, we have an assault team out there with all kinds of people in the loop.
not_available Soon the cops'll get wind of it, and then, God forbid, the press.
not_available You wanna talk about embarrassing? Now, we have to end this thing.
not_available And l'm not talking hours, l'm talking minutes.
not_available What about Bauer? Nobody asked him to go out there tonight.
not_available Now, get on with it, or l'll find someone who will.
not_available Yeah? l'm gonna have to order a full assault, starting in about five minutes.
not_available Team's making their final preparations.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available CTU.
not_available Almeida.
not_available This is Detective Krugman.
not_available We got a Kim Bauer here.
not_available Says she knows you.
not_available She's absolutely telling the truth.
not_available You sure she's OK? She's fine.
not_available Hang on a second.
not_available Her mother's worried sick.
not_available l wanna let her know.
not_available OK? Teri, it's Tony.
not_available Can you pick up? Hello? 
not_available Look, we've found Kim.
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's in a precinct.
not_available They're bringing her over.
not_available Are you sure she's OK? Can l talk to her? 
not_available We'll put you through as soon as we can.
not_available OK.
not_available You patch her through as soon as she calls.
not_available Thank you.
not_available OK.
not_available They found Kim.
not_available They did? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's great.
not_available l'm so relieved.
not_available Um Teri, l have some information about Jack.
not_available Why don't you sit down? We think he may have been captured by the same group that was after you and Kim.
not_available Oh, my God! l know that sounds bad, but we have rescue teams on the site, and the people who have Jack have been completely surrounded.
not_available Teri l know Jack.
not_available l know he will get out of this.
not_available l knew you'd want to be told.
not_available Team One is inside.
not_available Repeat: Team One is inside.
not_available Charges are in place.
not_available We are good to go.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available This is it.
not_available All right.
not_available What about Bauer? Just make sure you get Drazen.
not_available Go.
not_available Hit it.
not_available Go! Go! Kimberly.
not_available What is it? 
not_available We're releasing you.
not_available Did you speak to my dad? 
not_available No, but l talked to the people he works with.
not_available Melanie told me she lied before.
not_available She admitted you had nothing to do with the drug deal.
not_available So l called the number you gave me, and everything checked out.
not_available Sounds like you had a tough day.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you speak to my mom? 
not_available She's waiting at CTU.
not_available Are you serious? l'm serious.
not_available l'm gonna drive you there myself.
not_available l already processed you out, so you can call her from the car if you want.
not_available Ready? 
not_available l think so.
not_available Would you do me a favour, David? 
not_available What's that, Mike? Smile.
not_available Not a politician's smile, a real one.
not_available You've been through hell today, but you've come through it.
not_available And tomorrow morning the fight starts again.
not_available But tonight you need to celebrate.
not_available l'll be fine, Mike.
not_available Let go of it, just for a little bit.
not_available l can't.
not_available This thing with Keith is just beginning.
not_available And as for Sherry and me? You've had a front
not_available row seat today.
not_available You know it's not good.
not_available Let me explain something to you.
not_available Once you're in the White House, everything defers to the office.
not_available lt's what you need to do the job.
not_available lf it's your marriage that helps you that's great.
not_available But if not well, that's OK, too.
not_available You can have whatever you want, David.
not_available All right, Mike.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Patty.
not_available Yes, Senator? Thank you for all your help today.
not_available Congratulations, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Report.
not_available One dead body.
not_available No hostiles.
not_available Sector One secure.
not_available Sector Two secure.
not_available One dead body.
not_available Appears to be the warden 
not_available DeSalvo.
not_available No hostiles.
not_available Drake, this is Mason.
not_available What's goin' on down there? The entire staff, including the warden, is dead.
not_available But Drazen's gone, and so is anyone else who was here.
not_available Looks like they broke through another wall.
not_available Some sort of tunnel.
not_available Maybe an old sewer system.
not_available Follow them.
not_available Drake? Drake? lt's booby
not_available trapped.
not_available Laser mines.
not_available Can you disarm? 
not_available Given time.
not_available How much? About a half
not_available hour.
not_available Do what you can.
not_available Get your hands back on your head.
not_available Well done.
not_available Father, we have less than three hours left.
not_available Get down.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available l will offer you one consolation.
not_available Your family will be joining you soon.
not_available Your son Alexis do you wanna see him again? 
not_available Alexis is dead.
not_available No, he's not.
not_available We've got him.
not_available You are lying.
not_available How else would l know that he was supposed to meet with one of Palmer's staff, a woman named Elizabeth Nash, in room 1243 at 4.<br>30 this afternoon? 
not_available Yeah, that much is true.
not_available We captured him.
not_available l know where he is.
not_available Get him in! Can l borrow your phone? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, Mom.
not_available lt's me.
not_available Hi, honey.
not_available Can't wait to see you.
not_available l can't wait to see you.
not_available l'm glad you're OK.
not_available l thought l know.
not_available l thought they had you again.
not_available How did you end up in jail? 
not_available l'll tell you when l get there.
not_available Where's Dad? He's not here.
not_available He's working.
not_available l'm hoping he'll call in very soon.
not_available l love you so much, Mom.
not_available And l'm gonna be there in a few minutes, OK? l love you too, honey.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
