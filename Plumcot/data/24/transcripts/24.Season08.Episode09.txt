
not_available Renee.
not_available Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself.
not_available That's what happened.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I do, and if anybody else wants to ask you questions about that, I'll be right there with you to answer them.
not_available You implied something about Dana.
not_available I wanna know what it is.
not_available I think she went to meet some guy.
not_available Take a look at this.
not_available You think you can find her? You promise me I do this one thing for you, and then you'll leave me alone.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available This is a sweet operation that we got going here.
not_available You know? You getting the access codes, and us pulling the jobs.
not_available You can't do this to me, Kevin.
not_available You know who I am? All I know is that there's a very powerful man in the Russian Syndicate who's been trafficking weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available Who do you work for? I'm not at liberty to say.
not_available Dmitri, work on him, until he's ready to tell us everything.
not_available It's over, you know that, right? You want to know where the rods are? I will tell you.
not_available But I want full immunity.
not_available Command, are you seeing this? Where the hell are the rods? We've picked up trace radiation signatures.
not_available The rods were here.
not_available I told you, they were there.
not_available I had two of my men guarding them.
not_available We found their bodies; both shot.
not_available Josef.
not_available I wasn't sure I believed, Josef, that you would betray your father.
not_available You were upset that he was holding up delivery of the rods.
not_available Now I've gotten them for you.
not_available When will you get here? Less than five minutes.
not_available Just have my money ready.
not_available CTU.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Do you have Hastings there? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you ready to trace the call? 
not_available We're ready.
not_available As soon as Bazhaev gets his son on the phone, 
not_available we can begin to triangulate.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Farhad, where are you? You're late.
not_available Josef, it's me, your father.
not_available Don't hang up.
not_available Stay on the line.
not_available Please.
not_available I know you have the rods.
not_available Yes.
not_available I wanted you to know.
not_available The police know, too.
not_available They're here.
not_available You told the police? Of course not.
not_available It was Vladimir's buyer he's a Federal agent.
not_available Josef, just so we're up front, I'm here with your father.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer; I work with CTU.
not_available Well, do what you want with him; I don't care.
not_available Maybe you don't but your father cares about you.
not_available He negotiated immunity for you.
not_available All you need to do is bring the fuel rods in, and you can put the rest of this behind you.
not_available It's the only way you'll be safe.
not_available Safe? Did my father tell you about my other brother? What he did to him? Oleg was dying; you know that.
not_available Yeah, we could have saved him.
not_available He would be alive if not for your precious deal.
not_available You are right, maybe you are right, I don't know, but that doesn't bring Oleg back, and I cannot bear to lose another son.
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available No, you won't be.
not_available You won't be anything.
not_available It's over.
not_available Federal agents are here going through everything.
not_available The entire city is under guard.
not_available If you don't bring the rods in, they will hunt you down.
not_available They will kill you, Josef.
not_available I won't be able to protect you.
not_available I don't want to see you hurt.
not_available If I hand over the rods, how does this work? Tell us where you are, and we'll bring you in.
not_available Oh, just like that? After everything we've done? Yes, I told you they have given us immunity.
not_available Please, Josef, please.
not_available This is your last chance.
not_available Are you there? Yes, I'm here.
not_available You need to bring him in now, before Farhad gets there.
not_available Josef, did you hear that? You need to move.
not_available Josef? All right, I'm on my way.
not_available I'll call you from the road to let you know where to meet me.
not_available Careful with the rods.
not_available Sounded like shots fired.
not_available You need to help him! Where is he?! I don't know.
not_available Chloe, did you get a trace on that call? Not exactly, but it looks like he was in central Queens near Flushing Meadow Park.
not_available I want units combing that area.
not_available Jack, bring your suspect back to CTU.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Get him ready for transport now.
not_available Is he dead? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We need to hurry.
not_available The boat is waiting for us at the port.
not_available The port may not be the right thing.
not_available What do you mean? The authorities know our plan.
not_available We need a new one.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you get that? Yes, Jack.
not_available We're trying to get an I.D.
not_available off the voice print.
not_available So far, no luck locking down a location.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're on our way back now.
not_available We need to hurry.
not_available Take the van and get the rods We've got a match for the voice at the end of the call Farhad Hassan.
not_available So, he got his fuel rods.
not_available Any I.D.
not_available on the other man we heard? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, Rob Weiss for you.
not_available Tell him I'll be right with him.
not_available Give me an ETA on Bazhaev.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Start the interrogation as soon as he gets here.
not_available Yeah? Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available Hastings wants your ETA.
not_available He's anxious to interrogate Bazhaev.
not_available I'm about 15 minutes out.
not_available But I wouldn't count on getting anything from him.
not_available If Bazhaev could have told me how to get to the people that just killed his son, he would have.
not_available Jack, I heard about what you went through.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How's Renee? Pretty worried about you.
not_available They've still got her in medical.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Could you patch me through to her? Hold on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available Renee, I have Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available How are you? Uh, fine, I'm fine.
not_available What about you? We had a line on the fuel rods.
not_available We lost it.
not_available So what's the plan now? It's Hastings' call.
not_available I'm bringing the prisoner back to CTU, then I'm out.
not_available They ask you about what happened, about Vladimir? Uh, yes, Chloe did.
not_available Chloe did the debrief? Yeah.
not_available I mean, I wouldn't I wouldn't really call it a debrief.
not_available We talked, uh, mostly, and, uh, 
not_available then I wrote a statement.
not_available And you explained how you acted in self
not_available defense? Yes, like we agreed.
not_available That's how it happened.
not_available Renee, you've got to stick with that.
not_available Yeah, yes, I'm gonna try.
not_available I know this is hard for you, but you did nothing wrong, and you need to start believing that.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Jack, I don't I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it, 'cause I need to make sure that I'm not misunderstanding, but..
not_available when you say that I "have you" I meant it like it sounded.
not_available So now what do we do? We'll figure it out.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be in in about 15 minutes.
not_available Bye.
not_available Rob, it's Brian.
not_available I just got a flash from your office how this immunity situation the president authorized played out.
not_available It's not good, Brian.
not_available Really not.
not_available Now, as I understand it, Bazhaev's son swiped the rods from his father before we got there.
not_available That's correct.
not_available And now the son is dead.
not_available Yes.
not_available Do we know who has the rods now? Apparently, it's Farhad Hassan.
not_available And where is he? 
not_available We're looking.
not_available Meaning you have no idea.
not_available Brian, I pushed the president to resurrect CTU with you at the helm.
not_available Now, you tell me you can do the job, I believe you.
not_available I can do the job.
not_available Good to hear it.
not_available 'Cause when things get this colossally screwed up, people look for someone to blame.
not_available So what are you saying? I'm saying I don't want that person to be you.
not_available I put you there; you're my guy.
not_available If you fail, I fail.
not_available And that cannot happen.
not_available Are we on the same page here? So what have you got in mind? Renee Walker.
not_available She killed one of our main leads, isn't that correct? He was a psychopath she was defending herself.
not_available She stabbed him 15 times.
not_available What, are you saying it was murder? I'm saying that's for lawyers to decide.
not_available We're talking about a woman who put her life on the line when she didn't have to.
not_available I'm sure that will weigh in her favor.
not_available You know what a conviction would mean she'd go away for years.
not_available Well, someone has to pay for this, Brian.
not_available so you tell me who do you want that to be? I'm sending someone over from Justice.
not_available A Kristin Smith.
not_available She'll take care of everything.
not_available What do you need from me? Just open the door and get out of the way.
not_available We did a sweep, sir.
not_available No trace of any hazardous materials.
not_available Fine.
not_available Finish up, get back to base.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Arlo? Yeah.
not_available Find Dana yet? 
not_available I think so.
not_available I'm tracking the GPS coordinates off her phone.
not_available All right, send them to my PDA.
not_available Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, there could be a reasonable explanation 
not_available Hey, you're the one who stuck his nose in all this.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Coordinates are on your phone.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Look, I'm sending everyone back to CTU.
not_available What are you going to do? I'll be there within the hour.
not_available If Hastings asks, just tell him I'm following up a lead.
not_available Look, I know Dana means a lot to you, but do you really think this is worth going AWOL over? She's my fiancee, Arlo.
not_available Jim, I'm taking your vehicle.
not_available Find Owen, have him take SWAT back to CTU.
not_available Say I'll be right behind them.
not_available No problem, sir.
not_available Is Dana back yet? I don't think so, sir.
not_available Do you need her for something? Do I need her for something? Yes, Arlo, she's my chief data analyst.
not_available I need her to do her job.
not_available You track her down, and you let me know when you find her.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, Kristin Smith from the Justice Department 
not_available is here to see you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ms.
not_available Smith.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Did Rob Weiss brief you? 
not_available He did.
not_available I have to interview a Renee Walker.
not_available I read her statement on the way over.
not_available Did it appear to you that she's guilty of murder? Mr.
not_available Weiss warned me you might have issues with this.
not_available With hanging a brave woman out to dry? Yes, I do.
not_available There are major discrepancies between her statement and the forensic evidence.
not_available All I'm asking her to do is to set the record straight.
not_available I feel it would be prudent to restrict surveillance access 
not_available to this interview.
not_available Fine.
not_available But I would also like a video record of it in the event of legal proceedings.
not_available Can I ask you to provide that? Yes.
not_available Right this way, please.
not_available This is a transcript of your statement.
not_available You should review it before you sign it.
not_available How far out did Jack say he was? This is Kristin Smith from Justice.
not_available She needs to talk to Renee, so if you'll excuse us, Chloe.
not_available Talk to her about what? Now, Chloe.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available What is she talking to her about? She was about to sign her statement.
not_available I already debriefed her.
not_available Kristin just needs to fill in a few details.
not_available I already filled in the details.
not_available I know that you are protective of Renee.
not_available I respect that.
not_available Then let me sit in on the interview.
not_available Why? Was your debrief not a full and honest statement of the facts? We have nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists.
not_available Now, I need you back at your desk focused on that.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What is this place? A staging area.
not_available It belongs to a businessman who supports our cause.
not_available I don't want to delay too long.
not_available We need to find another way to get the nuclear rods out of the country.
not_available You heard what the American said to Bazhaev's son.
not_available They already know what we're trying to do.
not_available Which is why we need to move quickly.
not_available The Americans are not stupid, Farhad.
not_available If we go near any airfield or harbor now, the radiological detectors will spot us.
not_available Who are these men, Samir? These are men I have recruited.
not_available Our men.
not_available What are they doing here? They're going to unload the rods.
not_available We need to get rid of the van.
not_available And then what? You should rest.
not_available I don't need to rest.
not_available I need to know what we're doing.
not_available We can't get the rods out of the country.
not_available So let's use them.
not_available Use them? How? As a weapon.
not_available A radiological bomb.
not_available We'll show the Americans how strong we are.
not_available Show them how strong we are? Are you out of your mind? If we use the rods against the Americans, they will destroy our country.
not_available They'll bomb us, invade.
not_available And if we do nothing, they'll invade us anyway.
not_available That's what this peace treaty with your brother is all about.
not_available They're trying to turn us into another corrupt, Mid
not_available East regime with your brother as dictator, kept in power by American guns and money.
not_available Isn't that what we came together to prevent? Is there no other way? America will always be our enemy.
not_available Remember, my friend even a giant can be toppled by a single stone.
not_available We need to make them fear us.
not_available Then I'm with you.
not_available So you said in your statement that you killed Vladimir Laitanan in self
not_available defense.
not_available Is that correct? Yes, that's why it's in my statement.
not_available What I didn't see in the statement was any mention of your history with Laitanan.
not_available You did have a history with him.
not_available I worked an undercover operation with the FBI six years ago.
not_available Vladimir Laitanan was the target.
not_available And during the course of that operation, you had to get close to him.
not_available He became obsessed with you.
not_available He tried to rape you.
not_available Yes.
not_available But you were able to stop him.
not_available I fought him.
not_available Put me in the hospital with two broken ribs.
not_available I'm sure that's in there, too.
not_available You were able to fight off a stronger, violent man.
not_available It's impressive.
not_available But this time when he attacked you, you didn't fight him off.
not_available I couldn't.
not_available He had his hands around my neck trying to strangle me.
not_available I understand.
not_available You thought he was going to kill you.
not_available You were in fear for your life.
not_available So what happened next? He was choking me.
not_available I grabbed the knife and I stabbed him.
not_available In self
not_available defense? Yes.
not_available You stabbed him in self
not_available defense 15 times.
not_available The first blow alone could have stopped him, but you didn't stop.
not_available Look at me, Renee.
not_available You were an investigator for the FBI.
not_available By all accounts, one of the best they had.
not_available Put yourself on my side of the table.
not_available Look at what I'm looking at.
not_available There's a dead body.
not_available On the one hand, I have your statement saying you acted in self
not_available defense.
not_available On the other, I have these.
not_available Evidence of a sustained and furious assault with clear intent to kill.
not_available Now as an investigator, you know which version is true, don't you? I acted in self
not_available defense.
not_available Let me tell you what I think happened.
not_available You used an operation of unparalleled importance to seek revenge against a target without any regard for the final outcome.
not_available I'm telling you, he attacked me first.
not_available Ms.
not_available Walker, I'm well aware of your sacrifice in service to this country, but I do not think that it is fair or right that CTU should be taken down because you used this operation to seek out your own personal vendetta against Vladimir Laitanan.
not_available I looked at your file.
not_available This isn't the first time you lost control.
not_available You almost killed Alan Wilson.
not_available That's why you got fired by the FBI, isn't it? Yes.
not_available I can see what this is doing to you, Renee.
not_available It is tearing you up inside.
not_available Let it out.
not_available Tell me the truth.
not_available You killed Vladimir Laitanan because the thought of him touching you again was intolerable.
not_available Do the right thing here.
not_available That's what happened, isn't it, Renee? Is that right, Renee? Put him into holding.
not_available No phone calls.
not_available No communication.
not_available I would like to see my son's body.
not_available We haven't found him yet.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I've been trying to reach you.
not_available It's about Renee.
not_available She's being questioned again.
not_available I thought you said you already completed the debrief.
not_available I did.
not_available Hastings ordered it.
not_available He called in some woman from the Justice Department.
not_available Where's Renee now? She's in medical.
not_available Can you get eyes in that room? No.
not_available He cut off all access.
not_available What is going on? They're setting her up to take the fall for the failure of this mission.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available No one's They're setting you up.
not_available Don't say another word.
not_available It's too late.
not_available What do you think you're doing? Get out of here now.
not_available How dare you? After everything she sacrificed.
not_available After everything she's lost.
not_available Have you no decency? Jack.
not_available This is over.
not_available Hands in the air.
not_available Do it now! Son, you better put that down or you're going to get hurt.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Go.
not_available Ma'am, hands in the air.
not_available Do you have what you need to turn the rods into a bomb? We're gathering materials.
not_available Must be difficult at such short notice.
not_available Explosives, no.
not_available Detonator? We're working on it.
not_available I might know somebody.
not_available A professor in the city.
not_available With expertise in electronics.
not_available You sure he can be trusted? Yes.
not_available He will help.
not_available He will do whatever I ask.
not_available But still I will bring this up very carefully.
not_available I need to talk to him in private.
not_available Very well.
not_available There's a phone in the office.
not_available Ali will take you.
not_available What is the target? Is that decided? So many targets in New York.
not_available It will be hard to choose.
not_available Samir! Over here! It was Farhad.
not_available He escaped.
not_available Find him! Now! Cuffs off.
not_available Give us the room.
not_available Sit down, Jack.
not_available I'll stand.
not_available So, this is the new CTU you hang your own.
not_available If you mean Renee Walker, we're just asking some questions.
not_available Standard procedure.
not_available Standard procedure is a debrief, which Chloe completed.
not_available But instead, you've got some hack from Justice in there trying to initiate a criminal prosecution.
not_available We're just trying to establish the facts.
not_available You're trying to save your ass.
not_available I was there when you asked her for her help.
not_available And she gave it to you, and we acquired the target.
not_available And this is how you pay her back.
not_available I'm not going to let you do this.
not_available I'll call the White House first.
not_available The White House knows.
not_available Rob Weiss sent that woman over here.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Maybe I wasn't clear.
not_available I meant I'd call the president.
not_available Well, good luck with that, Jack, because I think the president takes murder pretty seriously.
not_available My recollection? She prosecuted her own daughter.
not_available Now, I'm not asking.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sorry to interrupt.
not_available We're busy, Chloe.
not_available I don't mean to intrude, 
not_available but I've got Farhad Hassan on the line.
not_available Farhad Hassan? I didn't believe it, either, but the voice prints match.
not_available Can you tell where he is? No.
not_available He's on a secure line.
not_available Can I just put him through? Mr.
not_available Hassan.
not_available This is Brian Hastings, director of CTU.
not_available There are people chasing me.
not_available They have the rods you're looking for.
not_available I thought you had the rods.
not_available No.
not_available No more.
not_available They turned against me.
not_available They have their own plan an attack on New York.
not_available An attack on New York? When, exactly? Soon.
not_available Very soon.
not_available Who are these people? They are IRK operatives working in this country.
not_available Okay, I need names.
not_available Just get me out of here.
not_available I'll tell you everything I know.
not_available We'll get you out, Mr.
not_available Hassan.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available Now, where are you? Forest Hills.
not_available Uh, some kind of boat warehouse.
not_available Hurry.
not_available I'm injured.
not_available They're hunting me.
not_available Hold on and keep this line open.
not_available What do you want me to do? Pinpoint his location and get me Cole.
not_available I can't.
not_available What do you mean, you can't? His team came back.
not_available He didn't.
not_available Owen said he was following a lead.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available Get me Owen.
not_available Tell him he's going to be leading the team.
not_available Owen? Are you sure? Just do it, Chloe.
not_available They're going to take you down and process you.
not_available I want you out of this building.
not_available Fine.
not_available Hey, hey, come on.
not_available What's the hurry? What's the hurry? What's the hurry? Your friend's a total freak show.
not_available I know, but come on.
not_available Don't go.
not_available I'll make it up to you.
not_available Okay? Come on.
not_available At least let me give you a ride back into town.
not_available We'll walk.
not_available Night, ladies! Gonna take a leak.
not_available All right.
not_available Cole, what are you doing here? You're asking me that? We're in the middle of an operation, Dana.
not_available You can't just abandon your post.
not_available I can explain.
not_available You can explain later.
not_available Right now, I'm taking you back to CTU.
not_available We can deal with our personal problems after we've secured the nuclear materials.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available Yeah? What do I think? I am not sleeping with him.
not_available Save it.
not_available I saw the pictures.
not_available What pictures? Just get in.
not_available I am not leaving! 
not_available Why the hell not? Because if I leave, this will never end.
not_available What will never end? You do not understand.
not_available Then make me understand, damn it! I don't think that I can.
not_available Try.
not_available Okay.
not_available We don't have a lot of time.
not_available So you better start talking.
not_available My name is not Dana Walsh.
not_available It's Jenny Scott.
not_available Yes? You find Farhad? Still looking.
not_available I injured him badly.
not_available He won't get far.
not_available We don't know who he might have contacted.
not_available I'll be traveling with the rods to a secure location.
not_available Do you want me to come in? No.
not_available You stay here, and you find him.
not_available It's a six
not_available acre warehouse complex in Forest Hills.
not_available Farhad is somewhere in one of these buildings.
not_available The rods must be there, too.
not_available Drones are airborne, but they won't have eyes for another 12 minutes.
not_available What about the police? They're redirecting their resources, but it's a big area it's gonna take 
not_available a while to cordon off.
not_available Director Hastings.
not_available You wanted to see me, sir? In the absence of Agent Ortiz, I assume you're ready to take charge of the operation.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Three units standing by.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll walk you out.
not_available There's a lot of pressure on you, Agent Owen.
not_available Oh, I can handle it, sir.
not_available All right, talk me through it.
not_available What's the attack grid? Our working theory's that the nuclear materials are still in the proximity of Farhad.
not_available Teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked with locating and securing the rods.
not_available What about Team Charlie? They're responsible for the actual evac, sir.
not_available It's a standard urban searchand
not_available rescue we're in, we're out.
not_available Nothing standard about it.
not_available Wait here.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available You've got something to say, say it.
not_available Think about it.
not_available The people that are chasing Farhad already know they've got a big security problem, so most likely by the time your men get there, those fuel rods will be long gone.
not_available And you're down to one team covering Farhad? What if they run into resistance? What if they do? Well, at that point, you start shooting at people that have a higher intel value than the man you're going to try and save.
not_available Agent Owen knows the priority is to take all hostiles alive.
not_available Under fire? No assignment's more difficult.
not_available Agent Owen has my full confidence.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If that were true, you wouldn't be standing here talking to me.
not_available You offering to bring in Farhad? Yes.
not_available If you drop the criminal investigation against Renee Walker.
not_available Look, I know you don't want to prosecute her.
not_available I can be your out.
not_available I hear what you're saying, but I can't help you, Jack.
not_available I've sat in that chair before.
not_available The chair you're sitting in now.
not_available I know what it's like.
not_available There's a lot of demands on you, many of them unreasonable.
not_available But the people that last here, the ones that mattered they knew when to say no.
not_available It's the White House; you don't say no.
not_available You are the head of CTU you've got a lot more juice than you think.
not_available Especially with a nuclear weapon in play.
not_available If we do this, Jack, it's not for one rescue operation.
not_available It's till this whole thing is over and done.
not_available You want Renee freed up, you're not in and out anymore.
not_available I want you in with both feet.
not_available Deal.
not_available Deal.
not_available I found an NYPD evidence warehouse in Queens with $120,000 from a drug bust just sitting there.
not_available It was only a matter of getting them in and out between patrols.
not_available Wait, you actually committed a robbery? Put yourself in my place, Cole.
not_available Kevin was going to tell Hastings I'm a convicted felon.
not_available He was going to ruin my life.
not_available What would you have done? Not this.
not_available Kevin promised that if I went along, he would never bother me again.
not_available Let me guess.
not_available He didn't keep his end of the bargain.
not_available That's why you're here, isn't it? What do you mean? What's in your hand? You were going to kill them.
not_available I don't know what I was going to do.
not_available You were going to shoot them in cold blood.
not_available Cole, listen to me.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available I see that now, but I was scared.
not_available I thought that I was doing this for us.
not_available For us? Are you out of your mind? I love you, Cole.
not_available Don't say another word.
not_available Not one more word.
not_available Cole, where are you going? Cole! Stay in the truck.
not_available Cole, don't do this.
not_available Cole.
not_available Please, I am begging you.
not_available This is my problem, not yours.
not_available Stay back.
not_available What? Hey, hey! Yeah, go for it.
not_available That way, I only have to deal with one of you losers.
not_available I think you got the wrong address, pal.
not_available Oh, do I? Somehow, I don't think so.
not_available Hey, maybe you should just tell us what it is you want.
not_available Maybe you should shut up and listen.
not_available Cole, please, come on.
not_available Let's just get out of here.
not_available I thought you looked familiar.
not_available Looky here, Nick.
not_available It's soldier boy.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available No kidding.
not_available You know, it's a shame that you and I can't go grab a beer sometime.
not_available You know, just the two of us.
not_available I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.
not_available I said shut up.
not_available Now, the way I see it, you guys have two choices.
not_available One, you go back to prison for grand larceny and aggravated assault.
not_available I go back to prison, she goes back to prison.
not_available My guess is, she's prepared to live with that.
not_available Choice number two: I let you walk.
not_available You keep your 100 grand or what's left of it and you go back to wherever it is you came from.
not_available That's it? That's it.
not_available But if I ever see you in this city again if I even hear about you crossing the state line, I'll skip the formalities and kill you myself.
not_available Do we have a deal or not? Yeah.
not_available We got a deal.
not_available Better be sure.
not_available I don't want to see either one of you ever again.
not_available Hey, what are you doing? Going after him.
not_available Why? Oh, we get rid of him, we're right back in business with her.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available We got what we came for.
not_available We got more.
not_available Now, let's just let's not push our luck.
not_available All right? Come on, all right? We're just getting started.
not_available We're done.
not_available Okay? You got me? Cole.
not_available What you did back there, I'll never forget it.
not_available Let's just get back to CTU.
not_available Cole, I'm serious.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Cole.
not_available Jenny! I'm sorry.
not_available I shouldn't have come back.
