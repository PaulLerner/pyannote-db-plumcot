
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate, my wife and daughter are in danger, and people that l work with may be involved in both.
not_available l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and this is the longest day of my life.
not_available There's an ambulance waiting to take you to a clinic where a doctor will examine you.
not_available Can't we stay with you? 
not_available No, sweetheart, l've gotta stay at CTU.
not_available l have to place you under house arrest.
not_available You'll be held here until we hand you to the FBl.
not_available Unfortunately, as you know, our procedures don't allow for any deviation from protocol.
not_available l can't reinstate you, Jack.
not_available l was raped.
not_available Excuse me, Dr Kent.
not_available Teri, we need to go.
not_available l'm sorry, we're not finished here yet.
not_available We need to move them to the safe house now, rather than wait.
not_available They're leaving now.
not_available We have to leave the state this afternoon.
not_available They've done a threat assessment.
not_available lt's too dangerous for us to stay.
not_available You asked me to check out Jack Bauer.
not_available Who is he? 
not_available He was in the Special Forces.
not_available That's what it was.
not_available The Drazen Mission.
not_available Senator Palmer, can l help you? 
not_available l'm here to see Jack Bauer.
not_available Mr Drazen, l can fix it for you.
not_available l appreciate the offer, Kevin, but plan B is already in effect.
not_available Can you get this to Mrs Palmer? l didn't have time to pack it.
not_available Aren't you coming? 
not_available No, l'm taking a later flight.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available l can't stay long, Alexis.
not_available Then we shouldn't waste any time.
not_available l can go over your head, Mr Almeida.
not_available And l assure you, there will be consequences.
not_available l apologise, Senator, but we do have protocol.
not_available Our director, Ryan Chapelle, is working on a clearance.
not_available But if l could tell him why you're here 
not_available All he needs to know is l need to see Bauer.
not_available And l need to do it now.
not_available Can l get you anything while? 
not_available No.
not_available Chapelle.
not_available l don't think l can stall him much longer.
not_available He wants to know why he can't see Jack.
not_available What did you tell him? Well, l told him you were workin' on it.
not_available And he still didn't say why he was here? 
not_available No.
not_available He just wants to see Jack.
not_available Well, until l know more, l don't wanna put those two together.
not_available l'm checking it out now.
not_available All right.
not_available So? You find out what Palmer's doin' here? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Any new intel on the backup shooters? 
not_available Yeah, uh, an Alexis Drazen.
not_available Looks like he's connected to two other shooters, but he stopped in DC for two days before landing in LAX on Saturday.
not_available There's other inconsistencies.
not_available l'm working on it.
not_available Where's the report? 
not_available l routed it to Nina's computer.
not_available Send me a copy, would ya? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Weren't we supposed to answer some questions at Jack's office? 
not_available We're gonna do that at the safe house now.
not_available ls my dad gonna be there? Not right away.
not_available Maybe when he's done at CTU.
not_available Are we OK, Nina? 
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available A small, controlled environment is the most secure place for you.
not_available Does Jack know you're taking us? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Myers.
not_available We're moving Teri and Kim to the safe house now.
not_available We should be there soon.
not_available Mom you never told me what the doctor said.
not_available No, l'm not worried about that.
not_available lt was a cyst that burst.
not_available She said it wasn't serious.
not_available Then why did she? 
not_available There's nothing to worry about.
not_available She said it would go away all by itself.
not_available Gaines first contacted me on my cellphone, directing me to a car parked at St Mark's Hospital.
not_available The transmitter was in the car? 
not_available That's when he asked me to put it in my ear.
not_available Can we take a break? Could you find out how my wife and daughter are doing at the clinic? 
not_available Teri and Kim have already left the clinic.
not_available What? They're fine.
not_available Nina's moving them to a safe house.
not_available You knew they were moving my wife and daughter and you didn't tell me? That's it.
not_available This is over.
not_available l don't say another word.
not_available l wanna speak to Chapelle.
not_available Now, Alberta! You're exhausting.
not_available l was surprised you called last night.
not_available l didn't think l'd see you again after DC.
not_available l'm not really that easy, you know.
not_available Will you have another break later in the day? The senator has to leave town this afternoon, and he's going to Nevada.
not_available Only a few of us were told about it, and l am one of the ones who has to go with him.
not_available You have to hold his hand? 
not_available ln so many words.
not_available Would it be too much to hope that you might have some free time in Nevada? You would wanna come? lf you want me.
not_available This is a pretty big shower.
not_available There's room enough for two.
not_available l'm on my way.
not_available Alan.
not_available Senator Palmer, what can l do for you? l'm trying to talk to a CTU agent named Jack Bauer.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available CTU, Los Angeles.
not_available They say l need clearance, but it's taking forever.
not_available Not a problem.
not_available Who's in charge over there? 
not_available Ryan Chapelle.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, l'll take care of this right away.
not_available Thank you, Alan.
not_available l owe you.
not_available Senator Palmer, Ryan Chapelle.
not_available What seems to be the problem, Ryan? Why can't l get in to see Agent Bauer? Please forgive the wait.
not_available When an agent is under internal investigation, procedure is to keep him isolated until he's been fully interrogated.
not_available lt's really out of my hands.
not_available Even if l can help you with your investigation? Mr Chapelle? Alan Optican from the Pentagon's on the line for you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Chapelle.
not_available This is Optican, Department of Defense.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Senator Palmer is to be given carte blanche.
not_available Make sure he gets whatever he needs.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Understood? 
not_available Of course, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bring Jack Bauer down here right away.
not_available Thanks for helping me cut through the red tape.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available l want all your cameras and recording equipment shut down.
not_available This is going to be a private conversation.
not_available l understand.
not_available l'll make sure the room is secure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available Hey.
not_available Listen, Nina called and wanted me to tell you that Teri and Kim are fine.
not_available Who's guardin' the house? 
not_available Paulson and Breeher.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Also, Chapelle wants to see you in the conference room.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks a lot, Tony.
not_available You got it.
not_available Milo, l'm sorry l had to switch the cards on you last night.
not_available l had no choice.
not_available We understand what you were goin' through.
not_available Thanks for your help.
not_available Senator Palmer.
not_available Leave us.
not_available l'll be outside.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Close the door.
not_available Sit.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available l wanna know who's working with you.
not_available ln which context, sir? l'm sorry, l don't 
not_available Right here, right now.
not_available We're gonna end this.
not_available l don't know what they told you 
not_available l know why you want me dead.
not_available l don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Kosovo! Kosovo? 
not_available l know you hold me responsible for the men you lost there two years ago today.
not_available You know about Operation Nightfall? 
not_available l authorised the mission.
not_available l know you took out Victor Drazen and his inner circle.
not_available And lost six men in the process.
not_available And you think l want revenge? 
not_available Yes, l do.
not_available With all due respect, l almost died today trying to protect you.
not_available And if l blame anyone for the death of my men in Kosovo, l blame myself.
not_available What were you doin' at the power plant? 
not_available l was trying to The reason l went for that agent's gun, sir, was to try and get you out of the room without giving myself away.
not_available The people that want you dead had kidnapped my family.
not_available They threatened to kill them if l didn't assist them in the assassination attempt.
not_available They didn't tell you any of this when you came in, did they, sir? No.
not_available lt's the truth.
not_available You can verify it with Chapelle.
not_available OK, they're just arriving at the safe house.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Show visual.
not_available This way, Mrs Bauer.
not_available These are Agents Paulson and Breeher.
not_available They've worked with Jack for many years.
not_available This is Jack's wife, Teri, and daughter, Kim.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, Kim.
not_available Where do you want us? One in and one out.
not_available Well, it's not exactly home, but it's relatively comfortable.
not_available There are motion detectors every ten yards.
not_available How long do we have to stay here? 
not_available We'll worry about that after we debrief you.
not_available Nina, where's the bathroom? 
not_available There's one in each bedroom, through there.
not_available lf you'd both like to clean up before we get started, please do.
not_available l was the head of the Special Defense Appropriations Committee in the Senate, which is just a euphemism for covert operations.
not_available Three years ago, the ClA brought to my attention atrocities committed by Victor Drazen in Kosovo.
not_available Massacres, torture, ethnic cleansing.
not_available The man was a monster, and was gaining support.
not_available l tried to go through the usual channels, but l couldn't get anyone to work quickly enough.
not_available So l contacted the one person l knew who could get the job done, have him terminated, off the books.
not_available And that would be Robert Ellis.
not_available That's right.
not_available Ellis was funded through a discretionary fund of my committee.
not_available His job was to implement the covert missions and see to it that no names were leaked.
not_available Now we're both on somebody's list.
not_available So this is payback for what happened that day.
not_available lt's the only thing that makes sense.
not_available But if someone could put your name and my name on a list together, that means they should be able to find Robert Ellis, too.
not_available You're right.
not_available Four sixes.
not_available Let's see 'em.
not_available l knew it! l saw it in your eyes! lf you could read what's in my eyes, you'd crawl under a rock and cry.
not_available Go again.
not_available Ellis.
not_available Bobby, it's David Palmer.
not_available You gotta be kidding.
not_available l'm not.
not_available l'm here with Jack Bauer.
not_available Get lost.
not_available What are you doin' with Bauer? l went to a lot of trouble to make sure you two never met.
not_available Someone close to Victor Drazen seems to have connected us.
not_available Explain.
not_available Someone wants me dead.
not_available And it appears they want Bauer, too.
not_available Today.
not_available The two
not_available year anniversary of Nightfall.
not_available l'm the only one who knows you both were involved.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available And if we're on the list, it's likely you are, too.
not_available Let me talk to Bauer.
not_available l'm right here, Bob.
not_available Jack.
not_available You still at CTU? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available To source this we need each other's help.
not_available Unfortunately, over the last 12 hours, l've had to cut a few corners.
not_available l'm being investigated right now.
not_available My hands are tied.
not_available Well, get them untied.
not_available David can help you there.
not_available lt has to be someone either connected to your team No.
not_available No one on my team knew of the senator's involvement.
not_available Well, then it has to be Drazen's group.
not_available l'll retrieve the closed file on Nightfall.
not_available lt'll contain the names of Drazen's associates.
not_available That'll take a few minutes.
not_available Meantime, you need to pick up a trail on the money.
not_available Odds are it's funded through Belgium.
not_available Can you get to your K3 accounts from there? 
not_available Yes, if l get reinstated.
not_available All right, start there.
not_available We'll compare names when we talk again.
not_available Where can l reach you? CTU, Los Angeles office.
not_available All right.
not_available Teri? Yes? 
not_available l put some clean clothes on the bed.
not_available Thank you.
not_available They called me and said you decided not to fly out.
not_available Aren't we going to Nevada? Apparently not.
not_available The senator needed to do something.
not_available He thought we'd be safest here.
not_available Are you taking a later flight? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available l hope so.
not_available Call the Times.
not_available Tell them l'll do that phoner, 45 minutes.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hello.
not_available You miss me yet? 
not_available Of course.
not_available l hope you didn't book your flight to Nevada.
not_available l was just about to.
not_available Why? We might not be going.
not_available When will you know? 
not_available ln about an hour.
not_available lf you stay in town, will you remain at the hotel? l don't know.
not_available They might switch us for security reasons.
not_available Either way, l'll let you know where l am.
not_available l can still smell your perfume on my skin.
not_available l'll call you as soon as l know.
not_available ls that the girl? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Palmer might not be leaving after all.
not_available Better for us.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Was there any problem getting rid of Gaines's people? No.
not_available You should never have used him.
not_available l told you it was a mistake.
not_available Fine.
not_available You fixed the mistake, now let's move on.
not_available She looks like Martina.
not_available Our sister's dead, Andre.
not_available Leave it alone.
not_available Have you spoken to Jovan and Mishko? 
not_available They have their targets in sight.
not_available And as for Palmer, l give you my word he will be dead by midnight.
not_available Hey.
not_available Do you have any toothpaste? 
not_available Yeah, it's right there.
not_available That's nothing.
not_available The doctor just wanted me to take it as a precaution.
not_available You scared me.
not_available Kim.
not_available What? You're pregnant.
not_available l don't understand.
not_available What happened today How is that possible? lt was Dad, of course, but a test like this, it takes time before You were trying to have a kid and didn't tell me? No, honey, it wasn't like that.
not_available Kim.
not_available Kim! What? 
not_available Please! This is just as much a shock to me as it is to you.
not_available Dad and l use birth control.
not_available lt's protection, but it's never 100%.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You don't need my permission.
not_available l'm not asking for your permission, Kimberly.
not_available Once in a while, you have to think about what another person is going through.
not_available Honey, l just found out l'm pregnant.
not_available You don't think that terrifies me? Well, it does.
not_available Mom l'm sorry.
not_available Are there any other names on the HK list that you recognise? 
not_available Rich Goen, Michael Redman.
not_available That's it.
not_available No, they weren't cleared until after the op.
not_available l'll use what we have so far.
not_available l shouldn't be here.
not_available Green's got me on priority.
not_available l cleared it.
not_available OK, Bob, he's here.
not_available Milo.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available Ah, l see you opened some sockets up to Ml5.
not_available How did you know that? 
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available We're tryin' to hook up some names.
not_available l'm gonna help you.
not_available Now, what's your login lD and password? Give it to him.
not_available The login lD is LFN.
not_available Password's foothill 94022.
not_available Lower case.
not_available OK, hang on.
not_available OK, looks like we got some partial results.
not_available Partial? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Looks like there's something missing.
not_available What do you mean, Bob? Something's been removed.
not_available l'll look into it.
not_available Meanwhile, Milo, l'm gonna l'm gonna send a file to your server.
not_available Why don't you print out hard copies for Jack and David? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks, Milo.
not_available All right, here we go.
not_available Feels like l haven't eaten in years.
not_available Feels good, doesn't it? Not being afraid any more.
not_available Yeah.
not_available l'm sorry, Mom, l was being really stupid before.
not_available So, when are you gonna tell Dad? You know what? Right now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Um 
not_available CTU.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Hi, Tony, it's Teri Bauer calling.
not_available Could l talk to Jack, please? 
not_available Hi, Teri.
not_available Actually, it's a bad time.
not_available He's he's kinda busy right now.
not_available Could you tell him to call? lt's important.
not_available Sure.
not_available l really want to hear his reaction.
not_available l'm so lucky to have you.
not_available Aw, baby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Sorry, but we need to start the debrief.
not_available CTU's eager to find out what you know.
not_available We're ready, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Great.
not_available l'd like to start with just you, Teri.
not_available Fine.
not_available l think l'm gonna go to my room.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available You should try and rest.
not_available This is standard procedure.
not_available We're gonna put you on videotape.
not_available OK.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Hi, Rick? Hey.
not_available Kim.
not_available Are you OK? Yeah.
not_available l just lost a little blood.
not_available You need to see a doctor.
not_available You don't sound good.
not_available l just need a few days' rest.
not_available Turn yourself in.
not_available You can get medical help.
not_available And l'll also get arrested.
not_available But you helped us escape.
not_available l'll tell them that.
not_available No! Don't tell them anything about me.
not_available Well, it's too late.
not_available My mom's already being questioned.
not_available They're gonna ask about you.
not_available l'm next.
not_available l can't lie.
not_available OK.
not_available Don't.
not_available Tell them that l didn't know anything about what was goin' on and that Dan threatened me, he had a gun.
not_available OK, but promise me you'll turn yourself in.
not_available l gotta think this through.
not_available l'm not like you, Kim.
not_available l don't come from a good family.
not_available System's not gonna give me a break.
not_available lt's your only way out of this, Rick.
not_available l brought you to Gaines.
not_available That's kidnapping.
not_available They could put me in jail for the rest of my life.
not_available What's incredible is that none of this has anything to do with me running for president.
not_available lt has nothing to do with the primary.
not_available lt has nothing to do with my being black.
not_available lt's just revenge for taking out Victor Drazen.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hello.
not_available David, it's Sherry.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Are you back at the hotel? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where are you? l'm at CTU, a government agency.
not_available Why? 
not_available There's some things l have to take care of.
not_available David, what's going on? l'm trying to find out who's attempting to kill me, Sherry.
not_available l've got to go.
not_available Wait for me at the hotel.
not_available OK? 
not_available OK.
not_available Bye.
not_available Just doesn't stop.
not_available l'm sorry this is happening to you, sir.
not_available You've been detained.
not_available Your family's been kidnapped.
not_available And you're concerned about me.
not_available That didn't have anything to do with the election.
not_available That was about my son.
not_available ls he OK? l just realised today that l haven't always been there for him.
not_available And what's killing me is that he's always been there for me.
not_available Being the son of a politician isn't easy.
not_available Being a son or a daughter or a father none of it's easy.
not_available Your wife and daughter OK? l don't know.
not_available l hope so.
not_available OK.
not_available Just try to be relaxed.
not_available OK.
not_available l just have a few questions.
not_available This just came in from Ellis.
not_available l organised it into three sections.
not_available Cross
not_available references are in the first part.
not_available Then there's a summary of Operation Nightfall.
not_available Details that may not be important are at the end.
not_available Any word on the missing file? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available OK, thanks, Milo.
not_available What is the Ambassador to Libya doing on this list? Probably kept Drazen's money separate from the government.
not_available We've had our eye on him for quite some time.
not_available Do you know a Rene Bonniere? 
not_available No.
not_available Who's he? 
not_available He's out of North Africa.
not_available A couple high
not_available ups over at District thought he was trying to set up terrorist cells in the US.
not_available Jack.
not_available Page four.
not_available Second paragraph down.
not_available Drazen's wife and daughter were in the bunker? Did you know about this? This wasn't in our initial report.
not_available They died in the explosion.
not_available My God.
not_available This is an eye for an eye.
not_available We took out Drazen and his family.
not_available Now someone wants mine.
not_available Who's in charge of protecting your family? Jack! Who has the authority to add security to your wife and daughter? Chapelle.
not_available Yes, Senator? 
not_available Send in Mr Chapelle right away.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available There was nothing else you saw or heard that gave you a glimpse into their operation? No, that's it.
not_available They really didn't talk much in front of us.
not_available Tell me about this boy Rick.
not_available He helped you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How? Well, different ways, but mainly he gave us a gun and he helped us escape.
not_available How'd he get a gun? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available And you don't know his last name? 
not_available No.
not_available l don't think Kimberly knows either.
not_available How did she meet him? Through her friend, Janet York.
not_available Everyone used to say ''Wait until she's a teenager, you'll finally understand the meaning of the word 'worry'.<br>'' l'm sure she'll grow out of it.
not_available Jack says she's basically a level
not_available headed kid.
not_available Jack talks about Kim? Just the usual stuff.
not_available lt surprises me.
not_available Jack's work always seems so serious and secretive.
not_available lt's hard to picture him sitting around the office talking about his family.
not_available Sometimes at lunch he'll bring up something if something's on his mind.
not_available So, do you think Rick had the confidence of lra Gaines, the leader of the group? l really couldn't tell you that.
not_available Nina, could l ask you a question? 
not_available Sure.
not_available When Jack and l were separated did he ever talk about me? Jack never discussed his marriage.
not_available Oh.
not_available Sometimes he would talk about Kim, you know.
not_available We all knew he was going through a very hard time and that he missed you both very much.
not_available When Jack and l got back together again he told me that he'd been with someone else.
not_available l told him it didn't matter what l did, what he did when we were apart 
not_available that was in the past.
not_available The only thing that mattered was what we did from that point on.
not_available lt was you, wasn't it? Teri.
not_available l saw it when we got off the helicopter.
not_available l saw it when you looked at him.
not_available After you were separated, yes, we saw each other.
not_available But it didn't last long.
not_available He realised it was a mistake and he went back to you.
not_available What about you? What about me? Did you think it was a mistake? Are you still sleeping with him? 
not_available No.
not_available Teri it was over before he went back to you.
not_available That is the truth.
not_available Look, l realise this is a terrible time for you to discover all this.
not_available When do you think a good time would be, Nina? l'm sorry.
not_available lt's just we have to get through the rest of this.
not_available l need to take a break.
not_available Yeah, Mike, l know.
not_available We'll be leaving in about five minutes.
not_available l can't wait for Ellis.
not_available l've got to go.
not_available Senator, they're not gonna let me continue to work here.
not_available l am technically still under arrest.
not_available Come on.
not_available Ryan! Yes, Senator? 
not_available l understand you have Jack under arrest.
not_available l told the senator l was being detained.
not_available There is an ongoing crisis that supersedes any charges that might be filed against him.
not_available But Senator 
not_available l want him reinstated immediately.
not_available Sir, you don't have the authority to make that decision.
not_available Alberta, please.
not_available Sir, what you are asking isn't possible.
not_available The charges against Agent Bauer are serious.
not_available We'd be in contempt of agency regulations if we reinstated him without a hearing.
not_available Ryan, you don't have to reinstate me.
not_available Not permanently.
not_available Nobody here has as much information about this situation as l do.
not_available Give me provisional status till the end of the day.
not_available Then you can take me back into custody, do whatever you want.
not_available Fine, Jack.
not_available You work the case out of CTU, but you answer to me.
not_available Good luck with your campaign, Senator.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Walk with me.
not_available Secret Service wants me to leave the state.
not_available They say it's not safe.
not_available Well, l agree with them.
not_available The one thing we know is that Drazen's people are here, and they want us today.
not_available And it's almost three o'clock now.
not_available The day is more than half over.
not_available l'm going to stay.
not_available Let's flush them out into the open and deal with them.

not_available Not exactly.
not_available l thought he and Dan brought you to Gaines? Well, it was mostly Dan.
not_available l mean, not Rick.
not_available l think he was actually just as surprised as we were about what was happening.
not_available Really? Well, yeah.
not_available He was fighting with Dan the entire time.
not_available He actually helped us escape.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Myers.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Chapelle reinstated me to provisional status for the rest of the day, at Palmer's request.
not_available That's great, Jack.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How's everything going over there? 
not_available Not bad.
not_available Look, we're sending over two more teams.
not_available Why? 
not_available Looks like Teri and Kim were targets as well.
not_available Nina this is not information they need to know, OK? 
not_available No, of course.
not_available Good, thanks.

not_available You OK? How you doin'? l'm OK.
not_available How's Kim? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available Tony gave me a message that you wanted to tell me something important.
not_available No, it's nothing important.
not_available Are you sure? You sound funny.
not_available lt's nothing, l just l just l'm so tired.
not_available Why don't you try and get some rest, sweetheart? Listen, if if you need anything from the house, Nina will make sure someone can go and get it for you, OK? 
not_available Yeah, OK.

not_available lt wasn't the right time.
not_available You should go back and finish with Nina, honey.

not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Bob.
not_available Hey, Bob.
not_available Yeah, l shot over a few more things to Milo, but l still can't locate the missin' file.
not_available How can l help? 
not_available l gave Milo enough to try it on your end.
not_available The more l look at this thing, the more l'm convinced the file was taken out deliberately.
not_available Which leads me to believe it contains what we're lookin' for.
not_available Can you give an estimate of when you think the file was stolen? Also a list of people you think could've had access to even get in there? Not yet, but you tell Milo l got some ideas on how to Urgh! Bob? Bob? Bob? Can you hear me? Bob?
