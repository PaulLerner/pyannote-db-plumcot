
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Jack Bauer is currently undercover with some of the terrorists.
not_available They're expecting Jack to help Them release a single canister Of Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills Shopping Mall.
not_available Do you mean to actually let Them release the Sentox? Are you out of your mind? We have the terrorists Under surveillance.
not_available Even if they kill Bauer, We will be able to track them Back to the remaining canisters.
not_available I'll go along with Your assessment.
not_available Let them release the Sentox, but you'd Better find those other canisters Or those people will Have died in vain.
not_available There is still time to move in And stop them before they Murder all those people.
not_available Audrey, we have a directive From the President.
not_available Do you realize how many More people could die If these men don't lead us To the other 19 canisters? Lynn, would you follow Through with that order, Stand by and watch as they Murder all those people? If those are the orders of the President? Yes, I would have to! The trigger's been reconfigured.
not_available You can activate the canisters now.
not_available Better hope it works.
not_available What's the unlock code? Jack, the unlock code Is alphakilo
not_available Charlie.
not_available Echobravo
not_available Charlie.
not_available Jack, this is a direct Order from the president.
not_available Now enter the correct code And let them release the gas.
not_available Now! 
not_available Make it work! I told you there's Nothing I can do! They have another way To release the gas.
not_available I managed to stop the flow of gas, But some got into the air system.
not_available We need to evacuate the mall now.
not_available What about the terrorists? One's dead, One escaped.
not_available Monitor the tracking device In the remote trigger.
not_available The hostile that escaped Still had it on him.
not_available I managed to activate the Valve before I got away.
not_available At least some of the gas Was released into the mall.
not_available What do you want me to do? Come back here.
not_available You were followed.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available No! Hostile down! Erwich is gone, the canisters are gone.
not_available We've got nothing here.
not_available Damn it! Despite an attempt by extremists To derail the process, the treaty was signed earlier today by President Logan and Russian President Yuri Suvarov.
not_available Officials from each country are hailing the agreement As a major milestone in U.S.
not_available Russian relations.
not_available The White House Press Secretary has called this a critical achievement in diplomacy and will set the course for President Sentox gas is genuine.
not_available The test was successful.
not_available I spent a year securing a weapon that would bring Moscow to its knees.
not_available And you waste it killing a handful of American civilians.
not_available We were betrayed, Bierko.
not_available Someone must pay.
not_available I agree.
not_available You were the one who trusted the Americans.
not_available Nathanson lied to us.
not_available He plotted to turn the gas against us.
not_available Your trust nearly cost us everything.
not_available Since I anticipated this, I have secured additional men and resources at great personal expense.
not_available Have you found a way to reconfigure the canisters with dispersal mechanisms? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do it.
not_available Nathanson will be eliminated.
not_available Then we will return to our original task
not_available striking at the heart of Russia.
not_available Where's Nathanson? 
not_available I don't know where he went.
not_available I swear, I don't.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I took out Nathanson's men.
not_available But there is no sign of Nathanson.
not_available Find him.
not_available Alpha
not_available seven.
not_available This is Nathanson.
not_available Someone just took out my men.
not_available Who? I think Bierko's hitting us back.
not_available Destroy all your databases.
not_available I know you're there, Jenny.
not_available Pick up the phone.
not_available Damn it, Jenny, I need the keycard from my wallet! Look, I'll leave the police out of this.
not_available You and your loser boyfriend can keep the money you stole, max out my credit cards, I don't care.
not_available Just give me back my keycard.
not_available It's important.
not_available We can't sell the keycard.
not_available Why can't we just give it to him? 
not_available I'm calling my brother.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available What is going on, Dwayne? 
not_available I'm handling this.
not_available Jenny? Please hold for the President.
not_available Have your people recovered the nerve gas? McGill? Yes, sir.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Do you have any leads? Have you intercepted the terrorists? No, sir.
not_available The man we followed from the mall took his own life before he could be apprehended.
not_available Damn it, McGill, I put this on you.
not_available If you'd let the terrorists release the Sentox gas in the mall as I agreed to let you do, we wouldn't be where we are right now, which is nowhere.
not_available Mr.
not_available President 
not_available Stop! Stop making excuses.
not_available Take responsibility and do your job.
not_available Although we were able to imit the casualties, the attack at the mall indicates that these terrorists intend to make good on their threat to release the nerve gas on U.S.
not_available soil.
not_available Unless we catch a break, we can expect to suffer multiple attacks, resulting in mass casualties.
not_available I assumed you'd want me to start without you.
not_available Just tell me where we are.
not_available LAPD is setting up a perimeter around the terrorists' last known location.
not_available We've activated all search protocols, including satellite and Caltrans surveillance.
not_available But we don't have any real leads, do we? If Jack Bauer would have followed orders and maintained his cover, we could have intercepted these people.
not_available We don't know that for sure, Lynn.
not_available What we do know is, Jack's field decision saved over 800 innocent people.
not_available It may well cost us 100 times that many people.
not_available In the meantime, we've contained both the physical threat and the media's awareness, which would have triggered massive civil unrest.
not_available Well, you tell yourself that if you want to, Ms.
not_available Raines, but the fact remains that these terrorists are at large with 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas, and we don't know where or when they're gonna hit us next.
not_available We're all aware of the threat, Lynn.
not_available Then why does she keep defending Bauer? I want Bauer placed in custody.
not_available I want him brought in here.
not_available I want him held responsible for what's happened.
not_available Jack can be disciplined later.
not_available Taking him out of the field right now is a mistake.
not_available Don't tell me how to do my job.
not_available He was authorized by the President, Lynn.
not_available But he works for me, and so do you.
not_available I want him here now.
not_available The rest of you, maintain your search protocols.
not_available Send your progress reports to my screen in ten minutes.
not_available It's all right.
not_available We're all under a lot of pressure.
not_available Let's get back to it.
not_available Manning.
not_available This is Buchanan.
not_available We have orders to bring Jack in.
not_available We weren't able to find anything that confirmed this guy's identity.
not_available I want you to take his picture, lift his prints, get him over to CTU as soon as possible.
not_available We've got nothing on this guy.
not_available We're gonna have to run him through NCIC and Interpol databases.
not_available I just got off the phone with Bill.
not_available Lynn McGill wants me to bring you back to CTU.
not_available He's on some kind of warpath.
not_available Why? Because I didn't think letting terrorists release Sentox nerve gas in a crowded mall was an acceptable loss? And because we lost our only real lead, and Lynn's looking for someone to blame.
not_available I was appointed by the President of the United States.
not_available It was a field call.
not_available I know.
not_available And between you and me, I think you made the right call back at the mall.
not_available I'm calling the President.
not_available Look, Jack the trail's gone cold.
not_available There's no point in fighting it.
not_available Let's just go back to CTU and square it.
not_available Fine.
not_available Look, I'm sorry, but I also have to take your gun.
not_available Jack, don't make this any more difficult than it already is.
not_available Fine.
not_available We can't afford to decommission Jack, especially now.
not_available I agree.
not_available What can we do about it? Nothing while Lynn's in charge.
not_available He may be in charge, Bill, but he is not in control.
not_available Ms.
not_available Raines, you have a call on line one.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be filtering Intel at Station three.
not_available Audrey Raines.
not_available Ms.
not_available Raines, if you try to trace this call or put anyone else on the line, 
not_available I will hang up.
not_available Who is this? My name is James Nathanson.
not_available I'm sure Walt Cummings has already told you all about me.
not_available You're the one who sold the nerve gas to the terrorists.
not_available That's close enough to the truth.
not_available What do you want? Transfer me to Jack Bauer on a clean line.
not_available Why Jack? 
not_available That's not your concern.
not_available You're getting to Jack through me.
not_available That makes it my concern.
not_available I'm going through you because I know you have a special relationship with Bauer.
not_available I know all about you, Ms.
not_available Raines.
not_available Which is why I'm counting on you to recognize an opportunity when t presents itself.
not_available What opportunity? I can help you find this nerve gas.
not_available How do I know you're telling the truth? You don't.
not_available Now put me through to Bauer.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, I know you're with Curtis, so I'm assuming that you can't speak freely.
not_available It's Audrey.
not_available It's personal.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm on the phone with a man who claims to be James Nathanson.
not_available He was Walt Cummings' contact.
not_available He says he has information about the terrorists, but he will only talk to you.
not_available Why me? You can hang up now, Ms.
not_available Raines.
not_available My phone has a node monitor.
not_available I'll know if anyone else comes on this line.
not_available Jack? That's all right, Audrey.
not_available Hang up the phone.
not_available All right.
not_available What do you want with me? 
not_available Protection.
not_available The terrorists you're after are trying to kill me.
not_available If the terrorists figured out that you were the one who rigged the canisters of Sentox to blow up in their faces, what do you need me for? Just turn yourself in to the authorities.
not_available They'll protect you.
not_available Cummings isn't the only one behind this operation who works inside the government.
not_available I need your help.
not_available You conspired to have me take the fall for President Palmer's assassination.
not_available What makes you think I'm not going to kill you myself? Because you want to stop the Sentox gas from being released on American soil.
not_available So do I.
not_available Where are you? There's a phone booth on the south side of Moorpark, just east of Densmore.
not_available Be there in ten minutes, or I'll be gone.
not_available Moorpark and Densmore.
not_available Got it.
not_available Jack? Audrey, I'll explain everything as soon as I get back to CTU.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's going to be strange for her.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Just yesterday, she thought you were dead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know it's none of my business, but she's a good person, Jack.
not_available I hope you two get half a chance.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't fight, Curtis.
not_available Don't fight it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Lynn McGill.
not_available It's Curtis.
not_available Jack escaped.
not_available What? He got a call from someone.
not_available The next thing I know, he blindsided me, took my car.
not_available Who called him? He said it was Audrey, but he may have been lying.
not_available Lynn? We can try to track him using your vehicle's onboard transceiver.
not_available I just tried bringing it up on my PDA.
not_available He's either disabled or shut down the transceiver.
not_available Curtis, how could you let this happen? I'll get dispatch on it.
not_available One of my team's en route to pick me up.
not_available We'll find him.
not_available You don't even known here to look.
not_available Get back to CTU.
not_available We'll deploy from here.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Chloe, run a triangulation on Jack Bauer's cell phone.
not_available Find out where he is.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Have you talked to Jack since he's been in custody? No.
not_available Well, he's not in custody anymore.
not_available He assaulted Curtis and stole his car.
not_available Why would he do that? Maybe you can tell me.
not_available I don't know where Jack is, if that's what you're asking me.
not_available You have no idea what he's doing? No, but I'm sure there's an explanation.
not_available Mr.
not_available McGill, we're not getting a signal from Jack's cell.
not_available The SIM
not_available card must be out of his phone.
not_available Well, if you think of anything you'll let me know, right? Of course.
not_available Thanks.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, what I'm about to tell you needs to stay between us.
not_available It involves Jack.
not_available What is going on? It just came on my screen that Jack's gone missing.
not_available He's following a lead on the Sentox gas.
not_available He needed to go alone.
not_available I just transferred a call from my station to him.
not_available I need you to delete the record.
not_available If Lynn finds out we're working behind his back Chloe, I know.
not_available Believe me, I know.
not_available But this is the only way.
not_available There isn't a lot of time.
not_available When did you make the call? 
not_available Communications archive.
not_available This is Lynn McGill.
not_available Bring up the phone logs at the station Audrey Raines is using.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I found the transfer.
not_available I can't dump just the one call.
not_available They're all cross
not_available indexed.
not_available Can't you unlink it? No.
not_available It would take like two hours.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available McGill, the call logs should be on your screen.
not_available Scroll through to station five.
not_available That's the one we dedicated to the DOD.
not_available The only way to get rid of the entry is to dump the entire log all the calls you've made and received today.
not_available Do it.
not_available It's done.
not_available Thank you, Chloe.
not_available a day that will long be remembered as a step forward for both the United States and Russia.
not_available President Logan and President Suvarov are expected shortly to deliver their closing remarks.
not_available Following this, the Russian head of What is it now, Mike? I'm sorry, sir, but there's a call you need to take.
not_available It just came in on this.
not_available And what is that? Walt Cummings' phone, sir.
not_available It's been in Secret Service custody.
not_available They just brought it to me.
not_available The caller's claiming he has the Sentox gas.
not_available Is someone tracing the call? 
not_available They can't.
not_available It's being sent through multiple relays.
not_available I'm not talking to a terrorist.
not_available You talk to them.
not_available You find out what he wants.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, he's demanding to speak with you.
not_available All right.
not_available But put him on speaker.
not_available This is President Logan.
not_available Is this Erwich? Ivan Erwich is no longer with us, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available His attack on your shopping mall was unsanctioned and unwarranted.
not_available It didn't serve our interests.
not_available What is it you want? What I want is to release the Sentox nerve gas on Moscow.
not_available Since that is now impossible, I'm forced to strike at Russia on foreign soil with your help.
not_available My help? I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.
not_available His entire route to the airport, along with a full profile of his security detail.
not_available I don't personally have that information.
not_available Then get it.
not_available Make no mistake, Mr.
not_available President, it's our Russian oppressors I mean to hurt, not your people.
not_available However, if you refuse to cooperate, I will have no choice but to release all of the Sentox gas in areas far more populated than your shopping mall.
not_available You just said that killing Americans didn't serve your interests.
not_available This this would be senseless murder.
not_available Yes, it would.
not_available So give me Suvarov's route.
not_available I'll need some time.
not_available You have 15 minutes.
not_available I'm I'm not sure He wants to assassinate Suvarov.
not_available We can't let that happen.
not_available If the Russian president is killed on U.S.
not_available soil, it wouldn't just nullify the treaty it would destroy our relationship with Moscow.
not_available Get me Suvarov's route from Secret Service.
not_available Mr.
not_available President No, I haven't made any decision yet, Mike, but whatever I decide, I'd better have the route in hand when he calls back, don't you think? Yes, sir.
not_available Somebody's screwing with me, Bill.
not_available I won't tolerate it.
not_available Screwing with you how? Audrey Raines' phone log has been erased.
not_available What? Take a look.
not_available Probably a system glitch.
not_available It wasn't a glitch.
not_available She did it on purpose.
not_available Audrey? You think Audrey did this? 
not_available I know she did.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available She's one of the most bythe
not_available book people I know.
not_available You don't go bythe
not_available book when you're trying to hide something.
not_available Did you know that she was on the phone with Jack right before he attacked Curtis? 
not_available No, I didn't know that.
not_available What does that prove? There's something going on with these two.
not_available What's their history? You know their history, Lynn.
not_available They worked together at DOD.
not_available There's more than that, right? It got personal later on, Lynn.
not_available Personal? And you didn't think it was important to tell me that? No, I didn't.
not_available What difference does that make? When did she find out Jack was still alive? This morning, with the rest of us.
not_available You sure about that? I was there, Lynn.
not_available I saw her reaction.
not_available Could have been an act.
not_available You're starting to sound paranoid.
not_available I don't care how I sound.
not_available From this point on, I want all our people on a tight leash.
not_available If someone has a hidden agenda, I want to know about it.
not_available CTU's become way too porous, and that's your fault, Bill.
not_available I don't need to hear this from you.
not_available You don't want to hear this from me? Then tell me why Audrey erased her phone logs.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Where are you? In a minute.
not_available First, I want to make sure that you weren't followed.
not_available Otherwise, there's no deal.
not_available Take the alley between the two buildings across the street from you.
not_available I left the gate open.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I don't know what you think I can do for you, but you committed treason.
not_available I don't see it that way.
not_available I love this country.
not_available You're never going to be able to justify killing David Palmer.
not_available That was an unfortunate necessity.
not_available We admired Palmer, but we had other priorities.
not_available This country needs a reason to secure its oil interests in Asia, a reason that Russia and the rest of the world can get behind.
not_available I've heard your reasoning from Walt Cummings.
not_available It's still treason.
not_available No.
not_available It's a real politics.
not_available Do you see the open door ahead? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Enter it, make two right turns, and walk back the direction you came from.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You have hostiles coming in after you.
not_available They are not CTU.
not_available Do you have a weapon? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Second floor.
not_available Try and make your way to the roof.
not_available I'll meet you there.
not_available Stay on the line.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available I understand.
not_available Audrey.
not_available DOD wants a fuller explanation about what happened at the mall.
not_available I told them we're still trying to find a thread on the nerve gas.
not_available I just spent the last five minutes getting grilled by Lynn.
not_available About what? 
not_available You and Jack.
not_available Your relationship.
not_available What'd you tell him? The truth.
not_available That you and he were once romantically involved and now I'm not sure.
not_available I don't see how that's any of his business.
not_available He thinks it is.
not_available He thinks you had something to do with Jack breaking from custody.
not_available Did you? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available What the hell does that mean? A man claiming to be James Nathanson called here about 20 minutes ago.
not_available He said that he had information on the terrorists.
not_available That he would only give it to Jack.
not_available Why didn't you tell me about this? I was afraid of losing this lead.
not_available I didn't know what to do, Bill.
not_available So Jack's meeting this man Nathanson alone, without backup.
not_available Where is he? I don't know.
not_available Nathanson dropped me from the call.
not_available Who else knows about this? 
not_available Just Chloe.
not_available She helped me cover the call from Lynn.
not_available Audrey.
not_available If you could just, uh, sign right here.
not_available District elevated the threat level.
not_available I'm briefing first responders on the high probability of multiple attacks, so I need to review DOD protocols.
not_available All right, I'll send them to your screen.
not_available We can do it here.
not_available Unless you have a problem working with me on this.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, it's fine.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Bauer? Yeah, where are you? 
not_available I'm in the freight elevator.
not_available You need to get out of there now.
not_available You're cornered.
not_available Bauer, where are you? I'm almost there.
not_available Just keep moving.
not_available Nathanson, stay down! Stay down! Nathanson! Look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available How do I find the canisters of Sentox? How do I find the canisters? In my pocket.
not_available What's on the chip? Please.
not_available What's on the chip?! Nathanson's dead, but there was someone else there.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available But he took out three of my men and disabled the helicopter.
not_available Nathanson may have given him information that compromises us.
not_available Keep looking until you find him.
not_available Where've you been? Let's go.
not_available Some critics have already said that by signing this treaty, we as the United States are taking on our ally's enemies as well as having to deal with our own.
not_available Diagram Seven lays out the Hierarchy for first responders.
not_available Civil Defense protocols for each agency are pretty well defined.
not_available Shouldn't you get that? Audrey Raines.
not_available It's me.
not_available Nathanson's just been killed, but he gave me Intel.
not_available I need you to uplink the data.
not_available Sorry, Steve, you have the wrong extension.
not_available I'll transfer you to I.T.
not_available Overlapping responsibilities default to federal, then to state.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Audrey just rolled my call over to you.
not_available What the hell's going on over there? It's Lynn.
not_available He's been shadowing her.
not_available He thinks that she's been talking to you behind his back, which I guess she has.
not_available Chloe, listen to me.
not_available I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox.
not_available I need you to data mine the files.
not_available Upload the drive to my socket.
not_available Access code 5J55J.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You should be getting it now.
not_available Chloe, I need you to keep this under the radar.
not_available You mean keep it from Lynn.
not_available At least until we know what we've got.
not_available My number come up on your screen? Yeah.
not_available Okay, I had to switch out phones.
not_available If you need to get a hold of me, call me back on that number.
not_available Okay, I will.
not_available Suvarov's motorcade with his security detail.
not_available Sir If President Suvarov is killed, and the Russians find out we supplied his killers with this information, it would be considered an act of war.
not_available The Russian motorcade has a significant security force.
not_available I see no reason to believe that the terrorists would even be successful.
not_available Maybe we should have an analysis done determine, uh, uh, the vulnerable points along the route.
not_available Sir, we can't do that without giving away the fact that we had advance knowledge of an attack.
not_available What attack? It's nothing that you need to be concerned about.
not_available Charles, you invited me into this circle.
not_available What attack? The terrorists want the Suvarovâs' motorcade route.
not_available They've threatened to deploy more Sentox gas if I don't give it to them.
not_available You're not seriously considering it are you? Martha Charles believes an assault on the Suvarovâs has a good chance Mike, will you please let the president speak for himself? May we have a moment? 
not_available Charles.
not_available Martha, please.
not_available If I don't give them the information they want, tens of thousands of Americans will die on our own soil maybe hundreds of thousands and I will be responsible.
not_available Charles, Charles there has got to be another way.
not_available You change their itinerary delay Suvarov from leaving.
not_available It's all over the news that the Russians are leaving after we make the joint statement.
not_available If there's any deviation from that, the terrorists will know that I've alerted them.
not_available Charles, what are, what are you telling me? What are you saying? That we are going to stand in front of the entire world with the Suvarovâs, you're going to look him in the eye shake his hand, knowing you're sending them to their deaths? If we were in Russia and Suvarov got this ultimatum, do you think that he would spare us? I am not talking about Russia.
not_available I am not talking about Suvarov.
not_available I am talking about you.
not_available You are the president of then United States of America.
not_available My God! Charles! You're talking about murder! Martha, my back is up against the wall.
not_available You Give me another solution.
not_available You stand up to them.
not_available Refuse to negotiate with them.
not_available Isn't that the policy of this country? Isn't that the point of the treaty you've just signed? It's not that simple, Martha.
not_available It never is.
not_available Oh, damn it.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available This is Chloe.
not_available What is it, Chloe? Jack just sent me the data he got off Nathanson.
not_available My decryption filters weren't working and I just realized why.
not_available The drive's DOD formatted.
not_available DOD? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't know how Nathanson got his hands on a highly classified government t
not_available drive.
not_available Audrey's the only one with clearance.
not_available Lynn's got her tied up.
not_available Exactly.
not_available How much time do you need? To decrypt all the vectors? Two, three minutes.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Lynn, do you have a minute? What is it? You were inquiring about a security breach with the phone logs.
not_available That's right.
not_available Why are you so interested in this? I'm serious about all breaches of security.
not_available What was that? 
not_available What? That last window you closed what was it? It was just the DOD protocols.
not_available What is going on here? Lynn, will you please just calm down? Don't tell me to calm down! The two of you are up to something and I'm not gonna stand for it.
not_available I think you're protecting Audrey and she's protecting Bauer.
not_available Look, I can explain, Lynn.
not_available So can I.
not_available This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority.
not_available Lynn, we are all on the same side.
not_available If your father wasn't the secretary of defense, I'd have you thrown out of here.
not_available I don't have that problem with you.
not_available Can I have Security to Station Five please, right away.
not_available What are you doing, Lynn? Place Mr.
not_available Buchanan in custody and take him to holding.
not_available You are making a mistake.
not_available Audrey.
not_available I want everyone's attention.
not_available I'm putting a section 2
not_available 3 redundancy into effect as of this moment.
not_available All of your stations will be mirrored and monitored through my office.
not_available Now get back to work.
not_available We need Bill to get through this crisis.
not_available You are jeopardizing our chances of finding that nerve gas.
not_available I will make sure that DOD and the Secretary of Defense are aware of that.
not_available Don't threaten me, Ms.
not_available Raines.
not_available I promise you, you do not want to threaten me.
not_available What do you got? The decryption element kicked out a company called Terra
not_available Dyne.
not_available Over the past three years, they've acquired more than 100 pounds of raw strontium isotope, used to create Sentox nerve gas.
not_available Where do I find Terra
not_available Dyne? La Canada.
not_available It's a subsidiary of a larger corporation called Omicron International.
not_available Hold on, did you say Omicron? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available What's wrong? Pull up their senior executive roster.
not_available See if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list.
not_available Why? 
not_available Just do it, please.
not_available Okay, here it is.
not_available Christopher Henderson, Senior Vice President of Research and Development.
not_available Do you know him? Yeah, I did once.
not_available Listen, send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.
not_available It's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now, Jack.
not_available Lynn is watching everyone like a hawk.
not_available Well, can Buchanan help you? He could if he weren't in holding.
not_available What are you talking about? Lynn detained him for insubordination.
not_available How could he do that? 
not_available Because he's losing it.
not_available I think the President's putting too much pressure on him to get those canisters.
not_available He can't handle it.
not_available Chloe, I still need the decrypted files.
not_available You're gonna have to find a way to get them to me.
not_available I'll try.
not_available They haven't called yet? Not yet, sir.
not_available President Suvarov's waiting.
not_available We'll be out in a minute.
not_available Martha please? This is a difficult decision for me both politically and personally.
not_available And maybe I won't have to make it.
not_available Maybe CTU will find the canisters before the Suvarovâs have to leave.
not_available That's what I'm praying for.
not_available But whatever happens, I need you to understand.
not_available I do.
not_available I understand, Charles, I do.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available It has been a challenging day so I especially appreciate how professional you have all been.
not_available Your president is fortunate to have such talented people working for him.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yuri.
not_available Anya.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm glad we have this opportunity to thank you and Mrs.
not_available Logan personally for your hospitality.
not_available Mr.
not_available President it's been our pleasure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We would love that.
not_available Wouldn't we, Martha? Yes.
not_available It would be lovely.
not_available Martha thank you again for being so kind.
not_available I read the text of your statement.
not_available It was excellent.
not_available And congratulations again on your brilliant handling of the crisis at the airport.
not_available Thank you, Yuri.
not_available And thank you for your steadfast support.
not_available Have there been further developments? No, no, not at all.
not_available There's always pressure, huh? But everything's under control.
not_available Ladies, the photographers are waiting.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The motorcade will take service roads to the 118, then to the 5 Freeway South Charles Martha, please, just just smile and wave.
not_available The motorcade will take Suvarov through this downtown corridor.
not_available That will give us our best shot at destroying all the vehicles.
not_available Tell our people this is where I want them to strike.
not_available All right, that's it, folks.
not_available We need to move.
not_available Charles, you can't let them get in that car.
not_available It's not too late.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Lynn McGill is calling from CTU.
not_available What about? He didn't say.
not_available He just asked to speak with you directly.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm afraid I have to say my good
not_available byes here.
not_available Affairs of state, you know the pressure's continuous.
not_available Yes, I understand, of course.
not_available Thank you, President Logan, for everything.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Anya.
not_available Charles.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available Aaron, I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovâs.
not_available You could have a car follow us.
not_available We're not detailed for that.
not_available I'll ride up front.
not_available No, Aaron, no that's not necessary.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Would you tell my husband where I am? I hope you don't mind if I accompany you.
not_available You sure your husband won't mind? No, of course not.
not_available This way, we'll have more time to talk.
not_available Ma'am, the President is being briefed by CTU right now.
not_available But I left word for you.
not_available Thank you.
