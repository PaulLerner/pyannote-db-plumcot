
not_available There's a convoy missing.
not_available It was headed from Illinois to Iowa.
not_available It disappeared inside the border.
not_available Disappeared? 
not_available They were due to call in.
not_available They didn't.
not_available I tried on comm stat.
not_available There was no reply.
not_available What was on the trucks? 
not_available A nuclear warhead.
not_available They found us.
not_available Where are you? It's over.
not_available They're gonna get us.
not_available You have to kill Prado.
not_available He knows too much.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Put the gun down! Who are you? 
not_available My name's Joe Prado.
not_available I'm innocent.
not_available Mr.
not_available Prado's rights will not be violated.
not_available Take me to him now.
not_available We have no choice, Curtis.
not_available A warhead's missing.
not_available This is our only lead.
not_available What's going on? You've got a key witness.
not_available We should be pressing this guy.
not_available It's Mike Novick.
not_available If we want information, we're gonna have to do it behind closed doors.
not_available Torture him? 
not_available I'm talking about what is necessary to stop this warhead being used against us.
not_available All right, gentlemen.
not_available I'll have an answer in 20 minutes.
not_available This thing could be over in 20 minutes.
not_available What if I find a way that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me? 
not_available I'm not gonna authorize that.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Accept my resignation.
not_available And if I do that, what then? 
not_available Release the suspect.
not_available Now you're throwing me out.
not_available Right.
not_available Make a sound and I will blow your brains all over the windshield.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available I don't know! Where is Marwan? OK.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Marwan's Marwan's gonna be at a place called The Hub tonight.
not_available Where is it? It's It's just Where is it? 
not_available Just east of downtown.
not_available This will help you with the pain.
not_available Yes, sir? 
not_available The White House.
not_available President Logan? 
not_available No, Mike Novick.
not_available One moment, please.
not_available We're still trying to locate Mr.
not_available Novick.
not_available Call me when you've got him on the line.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Prado talked.
not_available Who did this? Audrey 
not_available I represent DOD.
not_available I have a right to know, Bill.
not_available Did Jack do this? Yes, he did.
not_available It was the only way to get him to give up Marwan's location.
not_available President Logan gave Jack the authority to use force? No, Audrey.
not_available The president didn't.
not_available Where's Jack now? He's prepping a team to apprehend Marwan.
not_available Curtis.
not_available You want to utilize LAPD? TheyÂ’ll lock down a ten
not_available block perimeter.
not_available Marwan's people are coming and going.
not_available If we lock down, we give them a heads
not_available up.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll stay invisible.
not_available Excuse me for one second.
not_available What is it? The clinic are treating Prado for multiple injuries.
not_available Audrey, what do you expect me to do? Marwan has a nuclear warhead.
not_available He'll use it unless we find him first.
not_available I understand the situation.
not_available Then you know what I did was necessary.
not_available At least now we know where he is.
not_available Logan gave you an order not to use extreme interrogation methods without his authorization.
not_available Jack, you are acting against the president.
not_available I know.
not_available Jack, we're set.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available All right, everyone.
not_available Let's move out.
not_available Look, I've gotta go.
not_available Jack, you can't keep walking outside the line and not expect consequences.
not_available Trust me, no one understands the consequences better than me.
not_available No one.
not_available Jack Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Why? 
not_available Just asking.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Look, for whatever it's worth, you did the right thing with Prado.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Authorizing the torture of a foreign national is one thing, but torturing a US citizen I can't 
not_available Sir.
not_available This man, Prado, has information on the whereabouts of a nuclear warhead.
not_available We don't know that for sure.
not_available No, sir, we don't, because you're not letting CTU do what they need to do.
not_available I wanna wait till the attorney general gets back to me with an opinion.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we are running out of time.
not_available Walt, you were the first one to raise an objection to this.
not_available What do you think now? 
not_available I think you need to make a decision, sir.
not_available And sooner rather than later.
not_available Mr.
not_available Novick, Buchanan's on the phone from CTU.
not_available He's called twice.
not_available He says it's urgent.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What should I tell him? 
not_available Mr.
not_available President 
not_available Don't press me for an answer I can't give yet! I need more time.
not_available Sorry about the delay.
not_available The president is working through his decision.
not_available The president won't have to make that call.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Prado gave up Marwan's location.
not_available I thought Prado claimed he didn't know anything.
not_available He did.
not_available He changed his mind.
not_available You mean Bauer physically coerced him.
not_available Tell me what happened, chapter and verse.
not_available Bauer got the information we needed.
not_available I think it's best if I insulate you from the details.
not_available The president gave explicit orders.
not_available You should have restrained Bauer.
not_available With all due respect, restraint is a luxury we can't afford right now.
not_available What do I to tell the president? Convince him to sign off on the extreme interrogation, and we'll cheat the timeline.
not_available I made the mistake of deceiving one president.
not_available I won't make that mistake twice.
not_available Even though we both know Bauer was right? Mike.
not_available Someone out there has one of our nuclear warheads.
not_available May I speak off the record? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'm worried about President Logan.
not_available Worried? Why? His behavior over the last few hours.
not_available I'm concerned about his ability to lead us through this crisis.
not_available I understand.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Where are you? At the location.
not_available We arrived with the package.
not_available Has Sabir done the compatibility check? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Call me as soon as he's finished, then I'll have the next payment wired to your account.
not_available Is it compatible? 
not_available I'll need to reconfigure the mechanism.
not_available Is it compatible? Yes.
not_available How long will that take? 
not_available An hour, maybe less.
not_available Then you should start.
not_available Girlfriend.
not_available She'll leave a message.
not_available She's already left three messages.
not_available I don't want her calling around for me.
not_available Take the call, but hurry up.
not_available Nabila? Where are you? 
not_available It's the middle of the night.
not_available I asked you where you are.
not_available At the hotel.
not_available Stop lying to me.
not_available I called.
not_available You never checked in.
not_available Tell me what you're doing.
not_available Nabila, I can't talk about this now.
not_available Get some sleep and I'll explain everything tomorrow.
not_available After you've had time to come up with another lie? I found something on your computer, Sabir.
not_available A bookmark.
not_available Do you have something to do with what's been happening today? How can you ask that? 
not_available Are you working with these terrorists? Of course not! You know I'm not a violent man.
not_available I know your politics.
not_available Nabila, enough! Stop talking nonsense.
not_available Is it nonsense? 
not_available Like I said, I'll explain things tomorrow.
not_available Sabir, listen to me.
not_available She's fine.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I want schematics on the nightclub, options for a staging area, and traffic control.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bill.
not_available How could you let Jack torture Prado? Audrey, it had to be done.
not_available Logan made it clear he didn't want Prado's rights violated.
not_available He did make it clear, and he was wrong.
not_available We can't break protocol because we think it's right and expect to get away with it.
not_available Normally, I'd agree, but here I'd rather ask for forgiveness than permission.
not_available What kind of answer is that? 
not_available The answer is, it worked.
not_available We got Marwan's location.
not_available Audrey.
not_available With all due respect, this is not Washington, DC.
not_available Policy and politics do not always work on the front line, where we are today.
not_available Yes, well, Charles Logan is a politician, and he is not gonna give you forgiveness.
not_available I hope this does not come back to haunt you or Jack.
not_available If what we did gets us to Marwan, we'll live with it.
not_available What is it? CTU located Marwan.
not_available They sent a tactical team to grab him.
not_available That's good news.
not_available But I'm curious how they obtained Marwan's location.
not_available Did they use force? Yes, sir, I believe force was used.
not_available I'm sure I don't need to remind you this is an extremely time
not_available sensitive situation.
not_available Who's responsible, Mike? I'm asking you a question, Mike.
not_available Who did this? Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm the President of the United States.
not_available I can't allow this insubordination to go unanswered, especially at a time of crisis! I want Bauer arrested.
not_available I agree that should happen, sir.
not_available But I think we should wait until we have Marwan in custody.
not_available No.
not_available I want him arrested now.
not_available Sir, Bauer is heading the field operation.
not_available Bauer is not the only man who can do the job! Put someone else in charge! Mr.
not_available President 
not_available Get me Secret Service.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Has Jack set the robotic camera? 
not_available We're still a few minutes out.
not_available We're set to receive.
not_available Thanks, Curtis.
not_available Get this to Audrey Raines and have her stream it to DOD.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Bill, it's Mike Novick.
not_available I just got out of a room with President Logan.
not_available He knows how we got the information from Prado.
not_available How did he find that out? 
not_available He's not a stupid man, Bill.
not_available I'm not gonna lie to him.
not_available You have to convince him to leave it alone.
not_available I tried.
not_available He's not going to leave it alone.
not_available Tomorrow he can bring charges against me.
not_available I have to get back to the business of finding Marwan.
not_available It's not tomorrow and it's not you.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available He wants Jack Bauer arrested.
not_available Arrested? Mike! Jack is heading up the team that's bringing in Marwan.
not_available We're aware of that.
not_available Logan's adamant.
not_available He wants this dealt with immediately.
not_available Anything less he will take as a personal repudiation of his presidency.
not_available What's more important? His feelings or capturing the man responsible for today's events? I hear what you're saying, Bill, but Logan's already called the Secret Service.
not_available They're on their way to take Jack into custody.
not_available I suggest you warn him immediately.
not_available Before moving, we need confirmation Marwan's inside.
not_available I'll send in the remote camera.
not_available All right.
not_available What's your point of entry? 
not_available Ventilation shaft.
not_available Chloe, can you get the schematics for the AC configuration? Send it over to my PDA.
not_available I'm on it, Jack.
not_available I'll send it to you as soon as I can.
not_available OK, the camera's working.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available We got an LA woman reporting suspicious activities.
not_available First tier wants it kicked up to you.
not_available Crossreferenced an ID match? 
not_available She seems to be who she says she is.
not_available Send her information to my screen.
not_available Put her through.
not_available Here you go.
not_available This is Chloe O'Brian.
not_available How can I help you? I was just telling the man on the phone I'm not sure who exactly I should be talking to.
not_available I'm an analyst at CTU Los Angeles.
not_available Why don't you start at the beginning? 
not_available I'm calling about my boyfriend.
not_available What's his name? Please understand I'm not sure if this means anything.
not_available You were about to tell me his name? Sabir Ardakani.
not_available We've been going out since grad school.
not_available Uh, can you spell that? 
not_available Ardakani.
not_available Ardakan
not_available i.
not_available Where'd you go to grad school? 
not_available Berkeley Tech.
not_available We were both studying engineering.
not_available He's been traveling a lot lately.
not_available Business trips, he said.
not_available I'm not sure why I looked probably because of everything that's gone on today 
not_available but I found something on his computer.
not_available Tell me.
not_available I think Sabir may have become involved with radical groups.
not_available You mean terrorists? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where's Sabir now? 
not_available He said he was going to Arizona, but the hotel has no record of him.
not_available When you looked through his files, tell me what you found.
not_available Most of his files were encrypted, but there was one document that's a schematic for a microchip, a type I've never seen before.
not_available Jack, do you copy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Buchanan wants to talk to you.
not_available Now? He says it's urgent.
not_available Fine.
not_available Go ahead, Bill.
not_available Jack, we got a problem.
not_available Secret Service is on their way to arrest you.
not_available What are you talking about? Logan knows we violated his order about Prado.
not_available We can't interrupt this mission.
not_available You gotta stall them.
not_available I've been on the phone for the last ten minutes.
not_available There's nothing I can do from here.
not_available You have to get Marwan before Secret Service gets there.
not_available Curtis, did you copy that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll run interference.
not_available Give me a couple of minutes.
not_available I'll be ready to transmit.
not_available Jack, we're ready.
not_available Excuse me, Marwan.
not_available I just talked to Abad in New York.
not_available As soon as you're done, I'll upload the tape.
not_available Good.
not_available I want this delivered to television stations by dawn on the east coast.
not_available It won't be a problem.
not_available Do you wanna cover your face? 
not_available No.
not_available I want the American people to know who did this.
not_available Ready.
not_available People of America, you wake up today to a different world.
not_available One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you.
not_available It'll be days and weeks before you can measure the damage we've caused, but as you count your dead, remember why this has happened to you.
not_available You have no understanding for the causes of the people you strike down or the nations you conquer.
not_available You choose to meddle in their affairs without respect.
not_available You follow your government unquestioning toward your own slaughter.
not_available Today you pay the price for that ignorance.
not_available The camera is in the vent.
not_available I've got a visual on the main room.
not_available Approximately 50 civilians.
not_available Marwan won't be here.
not_available He's gonna want to stay out of sight.
not_available Hold on, I've got a possible sentry.
not_available A second possible sentry at the window looking at the street.
not_available Hey, Michelle, can you get a frame grab? 
not_available We're working on an ID.
not_available I'm sending a freeze
not_available frame to the facial recognition software.
not_available We have a match.
not_available He's a known associate of Marwan.
not_available That confirms it's a legitimate address.
not_available But not that Marwan is there.
not_available We can't risk exposing ourselves till we know he's in there.
not_available Castle.
not_available Secret Service is approaching your position.
not_available Jack, Secret Service has arrived.
not_available Did Marwan's people see them approach? 
not_available No, they came out through the rear alley.
not_available Moving over to the next room.
not_available Unless you renounce your policies of imperialism and interventionist activities, this attack will be followed by another, and another after that.
not_available I got a visual on people, what looks like a storage unit.
not_available How many? 
not_available Five.
not_available But they're talking to someone else out of my sightline.
not_available All right, copy.
not_available Stand by, Jack.
not_available What's going on? Secret Service.
not_available I'm Agent Moorefield.
not_available This is Agent Wells.
not_available We know this is a highly irregular situation.
not_available We have orders to take Bauer into custody.
not_available Curtis, let me talk to them.
not_available Go ahead, Jack.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available We are trying to confirm Habib Marwan is in this building.
not_available He is the terrorist who has a nuclear warhead.
not_available I cannot impress upon you how sensitive this mission is.
not_available The president was specific.
not_available We need to pull you off this now.
not_available I am in a concealed position.
not_available You pull me out now, you put this whole operation in jeopardy.
not_available As soon as this is over I give you my word, I will go with you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available If you don't come out, we'll have to come in and get you.
not_available Secret Service Command has confirmed the order.
not_available There's nothing I can do about it.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available We're gonna need to replace you.
not_available Jack, this is Castle.
not_available I'm heading out to you.
not_available Approach the south of the building.
not_available Got it.
not_available We're on the move.
not_available All right.
not_available Careful.
not_available Marwan, the police are here.
not_available Yasir saw an officer outside.
not_available Start packing.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I got a visual on Marwan.
not_available I have a visual on Marwan.
not_available He is in the building.
not_available They know we're here.
not_available Move on the building.
not_available Our cover's blown.
not_available Everyone, go, go, go, go! Get down! Everybody, get down! Get down now! Get down! Outta the way! 
not_available Freeze! I got him, Jack.
not_available Marwan's men have escaped through a hole in the wall.
not_available Set up a two
not_available mile perimeter.
not_available Cover all utility access points.
not_available Bomb! Bomb! Jack, what happened? Curtis! Curtis! Jack, are you OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Check out the men.
not_available Michelle, it's Jack.
not_available We can't pursue.
not_available They blew the tunnel up behind them.
not_available It's completely blocked.
not_available Have LAPD tighten up the perimeter.
not_available Get 'em to tell us what this tunnel feeds into now.
not_available Jack.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available Agent Moorefield, Secret Service.
not_available I'm sorry, but I'm here to take you into custody.
not_available Hand over your weapon, please.
not_available You blew this mission.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available I'm just following orders.
not_available Has anyone asked President Logan what the hell he was thinking? Curtis, we still have to focus on finding Marwan.
not_available We pulled up city records.
not_available The building is directly adjacent to a sewer line.
not_available How many ingress points are there? 
not_available 30.
not_available Marwan's probably passed our perimeters.
not_available We have to keep looking.
not_available LAPD and FBI will set down a grid there.
not_available Coordinate your men with them.
not_available We found a video tape on a man we shot.
not_available We should be able to recover most of what's on it.
not_available Have one of your men come back with it.
not_available Edgar's repositioned the satellite.
not_available WeÂ’ll let you know if we find anything.
not_available You got it.
not_available How did Marwan get past your men? 
not_available They had to move in before they were ready.
not_available Why? Secret Service showed up to take Bauer, which compromised one of our positions.
not_available I didn't mean That's not what I meant to have happen.
not_available With respect, sir, your orders were explicit.
not_available What other search protocols are you running? None.
not_available We're essentially without a lead.
not_available Bill, give us a few minutes.
not_available We'll get right back to you.
not_available Standing by.
not_available This is not my fault.
not_available None of this would have happened if Jack Bauer hadn't disobeyed my orders! I'm sorry, sir, but if you're asking me to agree with that assessment, I can't.
not_available If it wasn't for Jack, we wouldn't have located Marwan.
not_available CTU is waiting for us to call them back with a directive.
not_available What would you like me to tell them, Mr.
not_available President? I have no idea.
not_available And that's the problem, isn't it? It is my fault we lost him.
not_available This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead and I allowed him to escape.
not_available Mr.
not_available President 
not_available Stop.
not_available I don't even know if I deserve to be called that.
not_available Whatever I call you won't change the fact you are President of the United States.
not_available I shouldn't be.
not_available For the good of this country, I should resign.
not_available That's not an option, sir.
not_available Not without destroying the public's confidence, which is already at its limits.
not_available Three presidents in as many hours would be devastating.
not_available Then what should I do, Mike? Tell me what to do.
not_available There's someone who can advise you better than I can.
not_available You should consider bringing him in here to help you through this.
not_available Who? Keeler is in critical condition after Air Force One crashed a few hours ago.
not_available A White House spokesperson reports the president was taken to a military hospital following the crash.
not_available Sir, there's a secure call coming through for you.
not_available Thank you, Alex.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Mike? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm sorry to disturb you so late.
not_available No, I've been up all night following the news.
not_available This is a tragic day for our country.
not_available Yes.
not_available May I ask when you received your last intelligence briefing? 
not_available Three hours ago.
not_available Why? 
not_available The terrorist behind today's events, Habib Marwan, has taken possession of a nuclear warhead.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available How? Well, he recovered the football from the wreckage of Air Force One and he used it to track and steal a warhead.
not_available President Logan feels he needs help.
not_available What kind of help? 
not_available Substantial.
not_available I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.
not_available President Logan is requesting you run the effort to recover the stolen weapon and be in place to make whatever decisions need to be made.
not_available A crisis is looming.
not_available Hard choices may need to be made.
not_available And by the president's own admission, he feels he may not be up to the task.
not_available This country is very possibly about to face the worst terrorist act in its history.
not_available We need your leadership.
not_available Before I do anything, I wanna speak to President Logan face to face.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available I'll notify your Secret Service detail to bring you to the White House.
not_available All right, Mike.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Secret Service rescinded the order.
not_available Yeah, they're releasing Jack now.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Please step out of the car, Agent Bauer.
not_available What's going on? President Logan realized this was a mistake.
not_available You're free to go.
not_available I am genuinely sorry about all this.
not_available Doesn't really help us with our situation, does it? We had Marwan.
not_available Any sign of him? We have people all over the tunnels.
not_available So far, nothing.
not_available We had him.
not_available Dammit, we had him! 
not_available They're not finished searching the tunnels.
not_available If you haven't found him yet, you're not going to.
not_available Too many ways in and out.
not_available CTU have any new leads on Marwan or the warhead? 
not_available No.
not_available Great.
not_available Load everybody up.
not_available We're going back to CTU now.
not_available All right, everyone, let's go! 
not_available Edgar.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Release your system.
not_available It's the only one with the random sequencer.
not_available You'll have to wait.
not_available Someone called a lead in.
not_available I need to pursue this.
not_available I have agents out there looking for Marwan.
not_available I need to reconfigure the perimeter.
not_available You don't need your system to do that.
not_available They can just use the profiles on their panels.
not_available Things are changing every minute.
not_available They're field agents.
not_available They don't need you to coddle them.
not_available You know, that's a pretty rude attitude.
not_available I need your system.
not_available No.
not_available Tony.
not_available What? A woman thinks her boyfriend may have something to do with today's attacks.
not_available Did you verify it? 
not_available No.
not_available I need to use Edgar's system.
not_available Why? 
not_available Her evidence involves data that she got from her boyfriend's computer.
not_available It's in preparatory format.
not_available What's Edgar doing? 
not_available Moving agents Jack and Curtis don't need.
not_available Edgar! Yeah? 
not_available Let Chloe into your system.
not_available What about tactical? I got guys out there.
not_available Marwan's long gone.
not_available Most of those agents you can call back in.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available All right.
not_available Yes? This is Morrison.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available CTU found the club.
not_available How'd they know you were there? Must have been Prado.
not_available Has the warhead been reconfigured? Yes.
not_available Then our timetable remains unchanged.
not_available Marwan.
not_available We may have a potential security breach.
not_available Who? The technician, Sabir.
not_available His girlfriend's getting suspicious.
not_available But it's being taken care of? 
not_available Of course.
not_available It's being handled.
not_available Let me know when it's done.
not_available Tony.
not_available Yeah? The woman who was suspicious about her boyfriend panned out.
not_available What'd you find? 
not_available She sent us a schematic of a microchip.
not_available It's used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads.
not_available Including the one Marwan has control of? Yes.
not_available This is the design of the chip that controls the trigger on the stolen warhead.
not_available What do we know about the boyfriend? His name's Sabir Ardakani.
