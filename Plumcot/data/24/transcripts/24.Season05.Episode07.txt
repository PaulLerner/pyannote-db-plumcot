
not_available Has Bauer arrived at CTU? No, not yet.
not_available I need you to clear an entrance.
not_available Why are you tracking Jack Bauer? What the hell's going on here, Spenser? I was following orders.
not_available I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer, they have a reason.
not_available This man is a professional assassin.
not_available He just killed Dr.
not_available Paulson.
not_available He tried to kill me.
not_available Did you let him into CTU?! They told me he was here to place a tap on one of the servers.
not_available That's all I knew.
not_available Who told you? The White House.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gomez.
not_available David Palmer was murdered because he was about to expose Walt Cummings' connection to the terrorists.
not_available You want the nerve gas? Cummings is your connection.
not_available Cummings is the President's chief adviser.
not_available How exactly do you suggest we get to him? I could secretly meet with Mike Novick.
not_available Who did you tell? Who did you tell?! I didn't tell anybody, Jack! Tell your men to stand down! I'm sorry, sir.
not_available We can't do that.
not_available Put your hands in the air! Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country by separatists who think they're going to use it against the Russians.
not_available However, that nerve gas will never reach Russian soil.
not_available And you know this how? We control the remote detonators on those gas canisters.
not_available As soon as they've reached the terrorist base, we'll trigger the canisters by satellite and release the gas.
not_available You're a traitor.
not_available You'll let things play out as they are.
not_available Otherwise, your administration will be implicated, and your presidency will be destroyed.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, my name is Jack Bauer and I'm sorry to have to confront you like this.
not_available But your Chief of Staff is withholding information that is vital to this nation's security.
not_available Stop this! I'm done talking with you.
not_available You understand me? So for the last time, where is the nerve gas? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! I'll tell you! I'll tell you! It's on a freighter leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.
not_available CTU, we've located the target container.
not_available No hostiles present.
not_available You have a green light.
not_available Take possession of the canister.
not_available Open 'em up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Open 'em all up.
not_available Empty.
not_available Next.
not_available Moving on.
not_available What do we got, nothing?! There are no gas canisters here, CTU.
not_available The nerve gas is not here.
not_available Where are the canisters? I've told you everything.
not_available We know you've altered the arming codes, Mr.
not_available Cummings.
not_available Erwich, listen.
not_available We can negotiate something.
not_available I don't negotiate with my enemies.
not_available I eliminate them.
not_available Your country is about to pay a very steep price for betraying us.
not_available I was approached six months ago by a man named James Nathanson.
not_available He was my contact.
not_available Who is he? Former CIA.
not_available Said he was recruiting like
not_available minded individuals for this initiative.
not_available "Initiative." Is that what you call this? You helped terrorists acquire weaponized nerve gas! I told you we were gonna trigger the canisters once the separatists reached their base in Central Asia.
not_available This was not supposed to happen.
not_available But it happened! You got into bed with these people, and now they're threatening to use the gas on American citizens! Oh, you make it sound like our goal was to kill Americans! What the hell was your goal, Walt? Explain that to me.
not_available We're patriots, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We were acting in the best interests of this country.
not_available How is any of this in our best interest? Shoring up a strategic partner in the war on terror, ensuring a stable flow of oil.
not_available How is any of that not in our national interest? Chloe O'Brian's on the line for Jack Bauer.
not_available Chloe, are you set up for the trace? All set, Jack.
not_available We're ready to call Nathanson.
not_available How long do I have to keep him on the line? Until I give you a signal.
not_available Chloe, dial the number.
not_available The line's been disconnected, Jack.
not_available There's nothing to grab onto.
not_available They must know something went wrong.
not_available He's gone dark.
not_available Damn it, Walt! I don't want this weapon deployed on US soil any more than you do, but Nathanson cannot help you now and neither can I.
not_available These terrorists are operating on their own.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I think he's telling the truth.
not_available He can't help us, not anymore.
not_available Aaron, get him out of here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Jack.
not_available What do we do now? I need to be debriefed.
not_available After that, I'm leaving, sir.
not_available Given the current situation, things have become more complicated.
not_available CTU is gonna have to be responsible for the retrieval of the canisters.
not_available Why are you leaving? Sir, I have a daughter that doesn't know that I'm still alive.
not_available If I have to disappear again, in all fairness to her, I don't think she should know.
not_available Jack, terrorists just threatened to deploy chemical weapons on US soil.
not_available They have the ability to kill millions of people.
not_available I understand that, Mr.
not_available President, and I believe that CTU can handle this.
not_available Jack, your experience can make a crucial difference in stopping them.
not_available Look you and I have a complicated history.
not_available I realize that.
not_available And I'm not naive enough to expect any special personal allegiance from you.
not_available But I know your respect for this office and your concern for this country is just as strong as it was when you served under David Palmer.
not_available I'm asking for your help, just until this crisis is over.
not_available I will reinstate you.
not_available I will give you all the support you need.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you and I Jack, please! For God's sake, we need to recover this nerve gas before it's too late.
not_available Micro
not_available circuitry on this remote has been tampered with.
not_available As far as I can tell, unless we can repair it, we can't arm the canisters.
not_available Rossler will have a way.
not_available He should have called by now.
not_available Our real enemy is Russia.
not_available We should be figuring out another way to get back home, not wasting time trying to use the gas against the Americans.
not_available Question my orders again, and I will kill you.
not_available Do you understand? They've closed the ports.
not_available They will hunt us until they find us.
not_available So if we cannot use the gas against Russia, we will use it against America.
not_available Get up.
not_available Hello? L ynn? Jenny, now is a really bad time.
not_available Yeah, I know you're busy, but I need to see you, please.
not_available What is it? I need some help.
not_available You mean money.
not_available Lynn, I'm clean.
not_available I'm working two jobs and busting my ass to put my life back together.
not_available How much? $500.
not_available Can I, can I come over there? Absolutely not.
not_available Why? Are you afraid I'll embarrass you? Yeah, I am.
not_available Lynn, I got nobody else to turn to.
not_available You know, I can't go back on the street again.
not_available If you don't help me, I swear I'm going to hurt myself.
not_available For God's sakes, Lynn, I'm your sister.
not_available All right, listen.
not_available Jenny, listen.
not_available There's a parking lot across the street from CTU.
not_available I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you, Lynn.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available I was just explaining that Cummings provided us with a schematic of one of the canisters.
not_available Triggering mechanisms on the canisters can only be activated via satellite relay.
not_available Cummings says the terrorists have been given invalid detonation codes.
not_available Then these canisters are useless to them.
not_available Unless they can find a way to control the triggering mechanism.
not_available Are we running evacuation scenarios? 
not_available Evacuation isn't feasible, not without a time frame or a target.
not_available Erwich's threat was intentionally vague.
not_available What are we doing to track these canisters? Chloe? I pulled a voice print from Erwich's call to Cummings and I'm doing a scan of all satcom chatter.
not_available If Erwich is in contact with anyone on that bandwidth, we should be able to intercept and trace the call.
not_available We better get lucky 'cause we just got a new assessment from Civil Defense.
not_available They're estimating that the nerve gas from each canister will create kill zones between one and three square miles.
not_available The terrorists are in possession of 20 canisters.
not_available We're talking about potential casualties in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps over a million.
not_available Yeah? Ivan Erwich? Go ahead.
not_available Jacob Rossler.
not_available I was asked to call you by a friend in Moscow.
not_available You've been briefed on our situation? You need to reconfigure the remote trigger for an Aatox chemical delivery system, right? Yes.
not_available You have the canisters with you? Yes.
not_available You'll need to start by cutting into them.
not_available I'll give you the specifications.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available We just got a pattern match.
not_available Send me the hit.
not_available All interagency search protocols are being run through CTU.
not_available Ken, no one is going around you.
not_available All right, I'll make sure you're apprised in real time.
not_available Audrey, I thought you should know.
not_available Logan has asked Jack to be reinstated on a provisional basis.
not_available He's been given full autonomy and access.
not_available We got a possible intercept on Erwich.
not_available This just happened.
not_available On the inner casing, you will find a display window with a seven
not_available digit readout.
not_available I'll need them.
not_available And then what? And then I will program a new chip for your remote trigger.
not_available Put me through to Jack Bauer.
not_available Yes sir.
not_available Voice print is a 95% match.
not_available It's Erwich.
not_available He was on a sat
not_available phone.
not_available I can't trace it, but the call originated from a landline downtown.
not_available I have Jack Bauer for you sir.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, we may have a lead on Erwich.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available We intercepted a call between Erwich and an unknown associate.
not_available We weren't able to trace Erwich, but we may have a location for the associate.
not_available Chloe, bring up the building manifest.
not_available See who's in there.
not_available On it.
not_available &gt;From what we heard, Erwich is trying to acquire some kind of activation code.
not_available Yeah, he's trying to reconfigure the trigger mechanism so he can disperse the Sentox.
not_available Bill, we're running out of time.
not_available Okay, the penthouse is leased to a man named Jacob Rossler.
not_available Cross
not_available checking.
not_available He's a software programmer indicted for high security code infiltration, identity theft.
not_available Never convicted.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna need schematics on the building and vectors for every entrance.
not_available We'll have it for you by the time you get there.
not_available Bill, we're going to need to go in covertly.
not_available Have Curtis meet me at the location with a small team of four.
not_available But tell them to stay out of sight until I get there.
not_available Right.
not_available We'll be in touch.
not_available This is our new destination.
not_available They'll clear a landing zone for you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, this building's security system uses proprietary technology.
not_available It's a high
not_available end platform.
not_available It's a bitch to hack into, especially with the time constraints we're under.
not_available So, get Edgar to help you.
not_available Spenser is better.
not_available Chloe, absolutely out of the question.
not_available Spenser can do this faster than Edgar and I put together.
not_available He wrote an infiltration code that took us four months to hack.
not_available That's a bad idea.
not_available Stay out of this, Edgar.
not_available He didn't know Cummings was dirty.
not_available His polygraph proved that.
not_available He's was spying on us.
not_available He was spying on you.
not_available He lied to you.
not_available Sir, if you don't let Spenser help us do this, we're not going to get it done in time.
not_available He has to wear a security wristband and be under constant supervision.
not_available Fine.
not_available Audrey Raines.
not_available Audrey, it's Jack.
not_available Hey.
not_available Listen, I wanted to tell you myself, the president asked me to stay on until the canisters were retrieved.
not_available Jack, you know what this means.
not_available You'll be exposed.
not_available CTU can handle the crisis.
not_available Audrey, the President thinks i can help.
not_available Jack, you don't owe them this.
not_available Listen, Audrey, the reason why I called: I need to ask you to do me a favor.
not_available What? Kim doesn't know I'm alive yet.
not_available I don't want her to find out the wrong way.
not_available Do you want me to tell her? No, I just want you to call her and bring her in to CTU.
not_available I'll see her when I get back.
not_available All right.
not_available Are you sure you're comfortable doing this for me? Of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, your swing arm needs to be replaced.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're open till 5:00.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can I help you? Do you have some kind of precision tool for cutting metal? Sure.
not_available Where is everyone else? Lunch.
not_available Why? I need you to do some work for us.
not_available And we need it done fast.
not_available If you do it, you'll live.
not_available Do you understand? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Just take it easy.
not_available Get the canisters.
not_available Why haven't I gotten an update? Bauer left here on some sort of lead.
not_available Find out if CTU is any closer to recovering the nerve gas.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How are you feeling? Remarkably well for someone whose husband tried to have her committed without so much as a good
not_available bye.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't come here to fight with you.
not_available You have every right to.
not_available The two of us used to be a pretty good team.
not_available Do you remember? I was the one you would always come to first for advice.
not_available I remember.
not_available We've got to get back to that relationship, Charles.
not_available You're right, things are going to get rough for you.
not_available And you are going to need me and everything that I can give you.
not_available I don't know what to say, Martha.
not_available Don't you ever do that to me again.
not_available Mike, please, come in.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available Mike.
not_available Mike, I owe you a profound apology.
not_available You were in an impossible situation, sir.
not_available I understand why you did what you did.
not_available No.
not_available I panicked, Mike, that's it.
not_available Plain and simple.
not_available I'm not proud of how I handled myself.
not_available I intend to make it right from this point on.
not_available I'd like you to resume your duties.
not_available Of course, sir.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available CTU is in the process of tracking down the canisters, but we still have to deal with the issue of Walt Cummings.
not_available It's all right, Mike.
not_available I would like Martha's input on this.
not_available So what do we do about Walt? We can't detain him indefinitely.
not_available Maybe not, but we can keep him out of sight long enough for us to construct a credible narrative.
not_available Mike are you talking about a cover
not_available up? I mean, exercising discretion to spare this country unnecessary humiliation.
not_available Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.
not_available He has allowed these terrorists to get their hands on weaponized nerve gas that is at this point With respect a very real and present threat With respect Mrs.
not_available Logan, if we go public with Cummings, the president's reputation won't be the only casualty.
not_available The credibility of this office will be destroyed.
not_available Charles, you are going to take a hit on this.
not_available But it won't destroy you.
not_available You did nothing wrong except to trust someone who betrayed you.
not_available You are human.
not_available You might be overestimating the public's capacity for forgiveness.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not.
not_available The only thing they won't forgive is being lied to.
not_available I think you should issue a statement to the press, and the sooner the better.
not_available I agree.
not_available Why don't you and I work on it together, see what we come up with.
not_available Okay.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Go to Station 3.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available Thanks for getting me reinstated.
not_available I only did it because I need your help getting Jack through the high
not_available security building, not because I forgive you because I don't.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available We need to gain access to the security server at 22 North Figueroa.
not_available It's a proprietary network, so get to work.
not_available Chloe? I swear, I thought I was falling I don't care, Spencer.
not_available CTU, they've got eyes and ears on building security.
not_available We've got 2 units, one east, one west of the building.
not_available Chloe, do you copy? We're here, Jack.
not_available Spenser's countervailing the building's security protocols.
not_available What are you talking about? Spenser's under arrest.
not_available Buchanan released him from Holding.
not_available Fine, just give me Rossler's position.
not_available I've hacked into the building's motion sensors.
not_available According to them, Rossler is still in the penthouse.
not_available I have two guards on the penthouse level.
not_available What about the ground level entrance? There's one guard, three surveillance cameras.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stand by to take out all security cameras that are covering the front desk and the elevators.
not_available I can only shut them down for 60 seconds.
not_available After that, they will reboot automatically.
not_available That's as long as you have to subdue the lobby guard.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Teams A and B, you will remain in a holding position till you get a "go".
not_available We are 1 minute out.
not_available We have to cross the street to get to Rossler's building.
not_available We're ready to cut into the canisters.
not_available You have to cut precisely ten centimeters from the bottom of the casing to reveal the trigger.
not_available How thick is the outer casing? Five millimeters.
not_available Call me with the identification numbers when you're done.
not_available We're in position.
not_available We're set.
not_available We're ready to go.
not_available Give me a few seconds to access control.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here we go, Jack.
not_available On my mark.
not_available Camera's dark.
not_available Federal agent.
not_available Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands! Elevator code, let's have it.
not_available Uh four, zero, seven, three, pound.
not_available Unit one, status check.
not_available Just lost cameras A and C.
not_available Tell him you don't know why the cameras went down, but everything is okay.
not_available Everything is okay.
not_available Status check: blue.
not_available Don't know why the cameras are out.
not_available Everything's fine down here.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Back up to me.
not_available Back up to me.
not_available Where are the elevators? The elevator's almost there.
not_available You have two floors to go.
not_available The camera reboots in ten seconds, then you'll be visible.
not_available Move.
not_available Move! Unit one, status check.
not_available Where are you? You tell him you had to use the men's room.
not_available Base, headed to the men's room.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available Yes? Mr.
not_available Rossler? We may have a situation.
not_available What kind of situation? I'm not sure.
not_available Please remain in your office until you get the all clear.
not_available The guards look suspicious.
not_available One of them has an automatic weapon.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Federal Agents.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It hit my vest.
not_available Rossler's on the move.
not_available Where is he? Federal agent.
not_available Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon! Put your hands behind your head.
not_available Do it! Interlock your fingers.
not_available Rossler is in custody.
not_available I repeat: Rossler is in custody.
not_available All backup teams move in.
not_available I need a medic.
not_available We're patching you into the Situation Room.
not_available Someone else is in the penthouse, Jack.
not_available In the bedroom, to your right.
not_available North side.
not_available Curtis, cover him.
not_available I got him.
not_available Let me see your hands.
not_available Let me see your hands! Don't shoot.
not_available Who are you? I'm Inessa.
not_available Who did that to you? You are the police? Counterterrorist unit, Los Angeles.
not_available He is holding me here.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available You need to cut into the outer casing exactly ten centimeters from the bottom.
not_available The casting is five millimeters thick.
not_available You cannot puncture the inner lining.
not_available What's in these things? Don't worry.
not_available Just do what I say.
not_available Just Can't you tell me what this is all about? Do you have a family, Cal? A wife.
not_available My wife is in prison.
not_available She's been there for seven years.
not_available Her only crime was to support me while I fought for my country.
not_available My son lives in a state
not_available run facility He does not even remember what I look like.
not_available You want to know what this is about? Justice.
not_available It's about ending tyranny.
not_available When you're finished, we will leave.
not_available You won't hurt me? You're not my enemy.
not_available The government is my enemy.
not_available Hey.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Begin.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You're all right.
not_available Just take a seat.
not_available You're safe now.
not_available Have a medic take a look at her.
not_available I want CTU to do a full background check.
not_available I don't mind that they've dressed his wound, but make sure they don't give him anything for the pain.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Put him in a chair.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Get him up.
not_available Easy on my leg.
not_available Just get him over there.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm with CTU.
not_available a man named Ivan Erwich.
not_available What did he want you to do for him? I want my lawyer.
not_available You'll get a lawyer as soon as I get what I need.
not_available Mr.
not_available Erwich is in possession of 20 canisters of Sentox
not_available VX nerve gas, which he has threatened to deploy here in the United States.
not_available I guess you have a problem.
not_available No, sir.
not_available You have a problem.
not_available You've been conspiring with and aiding a known terrorist, which means I get to hold you for as long as I want.
not_available Now, we know Mr.
not_available Erwich can't deploy the canisters unless he reconfigures the trigger mechanism.
not_available Is that what he wanted you to do? Trust me.
not_available You don't want to go down this road with me.
not_available Go to hell.
not_available That's exactly where I'm going to send you unless you start to cooperate.
not_available You like hurting girls? Curtis.
not_available When I finish with you, you're gonna wish you felt this good again.
not_available Where is Erwich?! I want full immunity.
not_available Unfreezing of all my assets.
not_available And transport to a foreign country of my choosing.
not_available No.
not_available And Inessa.
not_available She comes with me.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
not_available We're not making a deal.
not_available Jack, it's Lynn.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We don't have the luxury to engage in brinkmanship.
not_available He's gonna tell us what we want to know.
not_available You may be right, but we're not gonna wait around to find out.
not_available Accept the deal.
not_available That's an order.
not_available Fine.
not_available It's your call.
not_available We're signing off.
not_available Make sure he follows through.
not_available I'll be back in a few minutes.
not_available I've been instructed to accept your proposal.
not_available A certified agreement, signed by the Attorney General.
not_available When I see that, I'll tell you what you want.
not_available And remember, I want Inessa.
not_available Your immunity agreement is being drawn up.
not_available Now I want something.
not_available Where's Erwich? I have no idea.
not_available I don't know the man.
not_available Not even what he looks like.
not_available I first spoke with him 30 minutes ago.
not_available We were put in contact through a mutual associate in Russia.
not_available Who? 
not_available Sergei Voronov.
not_available He's a commander in the resistance movement.
not_available What's Erwich want? He wants to reprogram the chip of the trigger.
not_available He's calling me back with the identification keys.
not_available What's your time frame? Within the hour.
not_available How is he going to receive the package? I was going to deliver it.
not_available We haven't agreed on a meeting place.
not_available I want that chip.
not_available It's in a safe place.
not_available Once I see some paperwork, I'll show it to you.
not_available I want you to be ready to fit that chip with a transponder so we can track him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Bill, it's Jack.
not_available Where are we with Rossler's immunity agreement? We have the Attorney General's sanction.
not_available You should have the documents in a few minutes.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Did we get any information on the girl? There isn't much.
not_available Inessa Kovalevsky.
not_available Reported missing 19 months ago from Kiev.
not_available The assumption is, she was kidnapped by traffickers in the sex slave trade.
not_available She's 15, Jack.
not_available Okay, thanks, Bill.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available You can't take the girl.
not_available Then you don't have a deal.
not_available You'll have your immunity, your freedom.
not_available Leave the girl out of this.
not_available No.
not_available Inessa is all I care about.
not_available She comes with me, or you lose Erwich.
not_available I've almost finished compiling those surveillance protocols.
not_available Whatever you have, port it over to Edgar's station.
not_available Why? 
not_available He'll be finishing that task.
not_available Fine.
not_available Chloe, don't you understand? I know.
not_available I'm bet you do.
not_available You don't work here anymore, Spenser.
not_available That's what I'm trying to tell you.
not_available What? Your reinstatement was temporary.
not_available Just until we got Rossler into custody.
not_available But there's still a lot of stuff that has to be done here.
not_available We pulled people from Division.
not_available We don't need you anymore.
not_available These men will escort you out.
not_available I know that was hard, but you did the right thing.
not_available Shut up, Edgar.
not_available You're right.
not_available We don't need that part.
not_available Okay, "I promise a full and open inquiry" "into this matter." "I will not rest until I've restored" "the faith that you have placed in this office," "and I can demonstrate to you, the American people," "that I bear its mantle of responsibility" "with respect and deep humility."
