
not_available As someone who has alienated followers by choosing the unpopular course, I suggest you tread carefully among your people.
not_available They will come after you.
not_available Authorise clearance for someone to get in the bunker.
not_available Once he's inside, he'll carry the ball.
not_available You mean kill the president? 
not_available We have a cover.
not_available Who? Assad.
not_available Assad? You're trying to make it look like he did this? This is Lennox.
not_available I need to speak to the ranking agent on site.
not_available Carson wondered if you were playing us.
not_available He didn't want to bring you into this, but I defended you! Nothing justifies the killing of a president.
not_available The deliverysystem software was programmed for five high
not_available priority targets.
not_available Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three.
not_available More than enough for our needs, Gredenko.
not_available I don't want to be exposed any longer than necessary.
not_available Do the authorities know we work with Fayed? If they don't, they will soon.
not_available Bill, it's Jack.
not_available I've got the address for Gredenko's safe house.
not_available A team will be there any minute.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Clear! Mr Buchanan, there's no sign of Gredenko or anyone.
not_available That call.
not_available That was from Gredenko.
not_available You tipped him off.
not_available Now over half my team is dead! It wasn't Gredenko on the phone.
not_available Those aren't his men.
not_available Who sent them?! 
not_available Your father.
not_available He has my son! Take a look out the window, the adjacent roof.
not_available Dad, it's over.
not_available There is no empire to protect.
not_available There is no legacy left.
not_available I'm the one you want.
not_available You let Josh go, I will surrender.
not_available You could have had it all.
not_available What are you waiting for? Do it! Who am I talking to? 
not_available It's Charles Logan, Jack.
not_available You must have exhausted all your options to find Gredenko.
not_available Come and see me.
not_available Come alone.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available Good.
not_available We've arrived.
not_available Is the shipment there from Nevada? No, they are behind schedule, but they will be here any moment.
not_available How soon can you deploy once we arrive? It will take us two hours to assemble the delivery system and run diagnostics, another hour to secure the payload.
not_available That's longer than I'd hoped.
not_available Listen, we are working with advanced technology.
not_available It can't be rushed.
not_available Remember, without us you'd be delivering your payload in weeks instead of hours.
not_available I haven't forgotten.
not_available It seems necessary to remind you now and then.
not_available I'll be glad when we no longer have to deal with these people.
not_available They are living in the Dark Ages, but they act like they own the world.
not_available I'd much rather be fighting them.
not_available If we succeed today, we'll never have to.
not_available The Arabs and the West can destroy each other.
not_available The ambassadorjust arrived.
not_available He's in the waiting area.
not_available Good.
not_available Will Tom Lennox be joining us? I spoke to Reed Pollock.
not_available He says Mr Lennox is briefing the speaker and minority leader.
not_available When Tom's finished, tell him I want to see him, please.
not_available Mr Ambassador.
not_available It's good to see you again, sir.
not_available Mr President, first allow me to express my country's shock and deep regret over the devastating attack in California.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Of course, any assistance you may require, you need only ask.
not_available I'm asking you now, sir.
not_available That's why you're here.
not_available I believe you know Hamri Al
not_available Assad.
not_available Mr Ambassador.
not_available I have never met Mr Assad in person, but I know him by reputation.
not_available His organisation has carried out terrorist actions against my country.
not_available Your own policies precipitated those actions.
not_available That's yourjustification for killing innocents? We define "innocent" in different ways.
not_available My own deputy lost his sevenyear
not_available old son in one of your bombings.
not_available That is how I define "innocent".
not_available We are not here to air past differences.
not_available Then why are we here? In our last meeting, I told you we were in contact with Assad.
not_available You told me it was a positive step.
not_available And I meant it at that time.
not_available But I must confess, after the last attack, I didn't expect to see you in the same room with him.
not_available And I'm not so sure I care to remain here either.
not_available It is no more pleasant for me, Your Excellency.
not_available Would you give us a moment? Certainly.
not_available Assad is here because of the attack.
not_available To be frank, sir, we have three more nuclear weapons loose in my country in the hands of terrorists.
not_available We didn't know that.
not_available In one hour, Assad will go on television and issue a statement.
not_available It will be a global appeal to extremists.
not_available He'll urge them to put down their arms and engage in peaceful negotiation with the West.
not_available Now, we are hoping to compel someone to come forward with any information.
not_available A petition like this, coming from Assad, it could have a profound effect.
not_available We're counting on that.
not_available What do you need from us? I want a statement of support from your prime minister, to follow right on the heels of Assad's.
not_available Mr Assad is a polarising figure in my country.
not_available A public endorsement of him could have grave political consequences for the prime minister.
not_available Tell your prime minister we have a carrier group operating less than 25 miles off his shores.
not_available My advisers are pressing me hard for a military response, so if we are attacked again I won't be able to hold them off.
not_available This is sounding like an ultimatum.
not_available It's not an ultimatum.
not_available I'm merely pointing out the fact that neither the prime minister nor I have the, uh, luxury of worrying about the consequences on a day like today.
not_available I am putting my presidency on the line, so please stop handing me excuses.
not_available Get on the phone and make this happen.
not_available Nadia, what's the status? Turner's team completed a second sweep, but the results were negative.
not_available If Gredenko was using this address, he did a good job of cleaning up after he left.
not_available There was one operating land line.
not_available Morris is checking to see if there was recent activity.
not_available Morris.
not_available Morris! 
not_available Yes.
not_available Any luck on the land line? 
not_available No.
not_available I mean, not yet.
not_available They must have used an inverter to stack their calls, cos I can't get any records out.
not_available Mr Buchanan, Jack Bauer's on the line.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'm near the airport across the street from the Grandmont Hotel.
not_available I know.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available It's complicated.
not_available Were the units dispatched? Two units are on the way.
not_available I'll have them meet you.
not_available OK.
not_available I want you to contact LAPD.
not_available Have them set up a five
not_available block perimeter around the hotel.
not_available They need to take my father into custody.
not_available Your father? He's involved.
not_available I'll debrief you when we've got time.
not_available Did you pick up anything on Gredenko? 
not_available No.
not_available Glasgow Street house was deserted.
not_available We're processing it, but we've come up empty.
not_available We can't be sure Gredenko was there.
not_available I might have a lead.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Charles Logan.
not_available Logan? I spoke to him.
not_available He says he has information.
not_available How did you trace this to Logan? 
not_available Through my father.
not_available I need you to get me a helicopter to take me to him.
not_available He's in Hidden Valley under house arrest.
not_available How? He was involved in the murder of David Palmer.
not_available He brokered a deal.
not_available He plead guilty to obstruction ofjustice.
not_available The public never knew of his involvement in aiding terrorists or Palmer's assassination.
not_available Get me a helicopter.
not_available We have one in the area.
not_available Shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Marilyn.
not_available Jack.
not_available What happened? My father escaped.
not_available I don't know where he is.
not_available I want you both to go back to CTU.
not_available Josh, I know there's a lot to explain, and when this is over you and I are gonna sit down and I will talk you through what happened.
not_available OK.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You're not coming? 
not_available No.
not_available Gredenko wasn't at the house.
not_available I need to follow up another lead.
not_available Take these people back to CTU.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Josh, get in.
not_available Jack, thank you.
not_available Thank you for saving my son.
not_available He reminds me of you.
not_available I can see it in his eyes.
not_available Marilyn, please, you have to go.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll take those, sir.
not_available Step on through.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sir.
not_available Gentlemen.
not_available Sign in, sirs.
not_available We'll need to process you again, Mr Carson.
not_available Of course.
not_available What's your occupation? 
not_available Policy analyst with the Stanton Institute.
not_available State your business here.
not_available I'm here to consult on defence procedures.
not_available At the request of Tom Lennox.
not_available Test.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Test.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Thank you, sirs.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We've got a problem.
not_available Lennox tried to warn Secret Service about us.
not_available What? 
not_available I stopped him before he alerted anyone, but I had to restrain him.
not_available You said that he was on board.
not_available I thought that he was.
not_available Either he's changed his mind or he's been playing us all along.
not_available Regardless, we're gonna have to deal with him.
not_available Son of a bitch! We've gotta move him.
not_available I'm gonna need this space.
not_available Get me some tape.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Over here.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Hands behind your back.
not_available We're gonna have to take care of him, make it look like a suicide.
not_available OK.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Eliminating Palmer is for the good of the country, it's the only way to get him out of office.
not_available Killing Tom Lennox only benefits us.
not_available We don't have any choice.
not_available Tom Lennox is a very smart man.
not_available I think that once Vice President Daniels is holding the reins and enacting the policies that Lennox himself created, we can convince him to keep quiet.
not_available I'm not gambling my life on Lennox's good judgment.
not_available It's a risk, but it is a risk that I am willing to take.
not_available We're not cold
not_available blooded murderers, we're just trying to save our country.
not_available We do not have time to resolve this.
not_available Assad goes before the cameras within an hour.
not_available You said it would take 25 minutes to assemble this? 
not_available 25 to 30.
not_available Then you'd better get started now.
not_available To frame Assad for the assassination, this bomb has to explode when they're together.
not_available We're never going to have a better chance than now.
not_available Reed.
not_available Yes, Melinda.
not_available I'm still waiting for the stats Tom promised me.
not_available Tom just emailed them to you.
not_available They should be on your screen.
not_available OK.
not_available By the way, is Tom in his office? Uh, no.
not_available No.
not_available Um, Tom is down in conference B.
not_available He's meeting with some policy analysts.
not_available I just came from Conference B.
not_available Secret Service is in there.
not_available Well, they must have switched to another room, then.
not_available Listen, I'll try to track Tom down for you.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I have to uplink traffic vectors to the sub net.
not_available I've been trying, I've been trying, and itjust won't go through.
not_available Check your SIP adaptor.
not_available What about my SIP adaptor? You've specified the wrong slot assignment.
not_available Oh.
not_available What an idiot.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That'll work.
not_available Did you call your sponsor? 
not_available I'm getting tired of the third degree.
not_available I didn't tell anyone you took a drink.
not_available I didn't take a drink.
not_available I spat it out.
not_available You promised you'd call your sponsor.
not_available And I did.
not_available Well? We had this long talk.
not_available I feel a lot better.
not_available Really.
not_available You're not acting like it.
not_available Why don't we install a breathalyser? Will that satisfy you? I just wanna make sure you're OK.
not_available I helped terrorists arm a nuclear bomb today.
not_available I'm not OK.
not_available That doesn't mean to say I can't do my job.
not_available Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to swap out this server port.
not_available Where's Morris? 
not_available He's swapping out a server port.
not_available He's supposed to be checking on Gredenko's land line.
not_available Well, he's juggling a lot right now.
not_available We're all trying to pick up the slack.
not_available I'm wondering if it's more than that.
not_available What? He's been tortured.
not_available He's under stress.
not_available Maybe he should be pulled.
not_available Yeah, he's a little upset, but he's better than 90% of the tech people here.
not_available We need Morris on the floor.
not_available All right, but I'm keeping my eye on him.
not_available If I see anything I don't like, I go to Buchanan.
not_available Fine.
not_available Hi, this is Jeannie.
not_available I'm not here right now.
not_available Please leave a message and I'll call you back.
not_available Hi, Jeannie.
not_available This is Chloe O'Brian.
not_available You don't know me, but I'm Morris's ex
not_available wife.
not_available Could you call me back as soon as possible? It's important.
not_available I'm at 310597
not_available 3781.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nadia.
not_available Jack will be arriving at Logan's estate any moment.
not_available I want TAC teams on alert and prepped for redeployment.
not_available We're out of leads.
not_available Let's hope Jack can get something from Logan.
not_available Can we have a moment, please? It must have been hard for you to find out about your father's involvement.
not_available I'm not here to talk about my father.
not_available Dmitri Gredenko, what do you know about him? I know Gredenko supplied Fayed with five Russian nukes, one of which exploded in Valencia and one of which you managed to disarm.
not_available So that leaves us three we need to recover.
not_available That's correct.
not_available I get regular intelligence updates and I still have my sources.
not_available So, you need Gredenko to find Fayed.
not_available Can you help us? 
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available But you want some kind of plea agreement.
not_available You're unbelievable.
not_available I don't blame you for thinking that, Jack.
not_available But I want you to know I'm not the same man I was two years ago, just as you're not the man who was dragged away and thrown into a Chinese prison.
not_available I've changed.
not_available I've had time to think about what I did.
not_available I've had time to reconnect to my faith.
not_available So, no, I don't want a pardon and I wouldn't accept it if it was offered to me.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I want to give you the information you need, with no conditions.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available I never dealt with Gredenko directly, but I know how to find him.
not_available How? 
not_available Through Anatoly Markov.
not_available He's a Russian consul general here in LA.
not_available CTU contacted the consul general when we saw Gredenko's name on the list.
not_available He denied knowledge of his whereabouts.
not_available Markov's lying.
not_available He's been the liaison for Gredenko for years.
not_available Liaison for what? For business concerns looking to acquire the products that Gredenko provides.
not_available No, don't.
not_available Don't make the wrong play, Jack.
not_available If you go down official channels, you'll end up in a hopeless maze.
not_available Markov has friends in the Russian government who can protect him indefinitely.
not_available If you wanna access what he knows right now, you need to go through back channels.
not_available What back channels? 
not_available Me.
not_available I'm your best chance to get the information.
not_available What are you proposing? 
not_available That I speak to Markov myself, in person.
not_available Why would Markov talk to you? 
not_available Because I have leverage.
not_available Markov was involved in the conspiracy that put me where I am today.
not_available I didn't give him up, but he knows I still can.
not_available I don't trust you.
not_available If you wanna find Gredenko, maybe it's time you started.
not_available Go ahead, Jack.
not_available Mr President, thank you for taking my call.
not_available You said it was urgent.
not_available We have a way of finding Gredenko.
not_available It was my understanding we lost Gredenko.
not_available Do we have a new lead? Yes, sir.
not_available Mr President, the lead is Charles Logan.
not_available Logan? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm with him now.
not_available He claims his administration had dealings with Gredenko and he has a contact.
not_available Who? 
not_available Anatoly Markov.
not_available The Russian consul in Los Angeles.
not_available When we learned about Gredenko, I called the consulate.
not_available That's a dead end.
not_available Not to Logan.
not_available He wants to meet with Markov in the consulate in person.
not_available He says that's the only way we can get the information we need.
not_available Jack Logan is under house arrest.
not_available That's why I'm calling you, Mr President.
not_available We need an executive order granting Logan a temporary furlough.
not_available Do you know what you're asking? Logan was behind the assassination of my brother.
not_available I would not call if I didn't think it necessary.
not_available I don't trust this man, Jack.
not_available This could be some manoeuvre to gain his freedom.
not_available I understand, but we need to take a chance on him.
not_available I will enter the consulate with Logan as part of a security detail.
not_available Sir, I believe we can trust him.
not_available I think he's after something else.
not_available And what exactly would that be? 
not_available Redemption.
not_available Jack, I have no desire to facilitate any kind of redemption for Logan.
not_available Mr President, right now he's the only way we're gonna find Gredenko and the bombs.
not_available Put him on.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available Hello, Mr President.
not_available I want to hear it from your lips.
not_available Tell me why I should agree to this.
not_available Because you need me, Mr President.
not_available Simple as that.
not_available I can talk to the Russian consul myself.
not_available You could, but you'd be wasting your time.
not_available I have a prior relationship with Markov that we can exploit.
not_available With due respect, sir, I have more experience of dealing with people of Markov's character.
not_available You mean criminals like yourself? I know how he thinks, and that's an advantage you can't afford to ignore.
not_available I want you to know that if this is a move to escape custody, I will commit the resources of my administration to hunt you down.
not_available I can assure you, I have nothing like that in mind.
not_available Several years ago I was in the same situation and reached out to your brother for counsel.
not_available David helped me successfully navigate that crisis.
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available And you repaid him by killing him.
not_available I would like to do for you what your brother did for me 
not_available help you get through this.
not_available Don't assume this represents forgiveness on my part.
not_available I understand that, Mr President, but I hope, over time, to earn your forgiveness.
not_available Put Jack on the phone.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available I'm granting the furlough.
not_available Just make it count, Jack.
not_available I'll do my best.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available This isn't easy for you, is it, Jack? What? The possibility I may not be the same man you hated for so long.
not_available You are late.
not_available Did you have any trouble? We had to bypass a vehicle inspection in Riverside.
not_available Other than that, a smooth trip.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's have a look.
not_available The US military has spent millions to develop this drone.
not_available Today American taxpayers will get a demonstration of what their money has produced.
not_available According to Charles Logan, Anatoly Markov, the head of the consulate, has information on Gredenko.
not_available Logan and Bauer are going to see Markov now.
not_available I want comm locked on any communication outside, and possibly inside, the consulate.
not_available Are you still the lead on decoding diplomatic communication leaving the consulate? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I want you to hand that over to Chloe.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because of what you've been through.
not_available I'm not sure you can handle it, and we can't afford any mistakes.
not_available Look, I'm 
not_available I want you to take over Morris's workload.
not_available Hold on 
not_available It's OK.
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available It's not OK.
not_available It's not OK.
not_available I'd like to say something to everyone.
not_available I'm very sorry that I gave the reprogramming device to Fayed.
not_available If I could take it back, I would, but I can't.
not_available And if you don't think that I can do my job, Mr Buchanan, then I should leave.
not_available But I can do my job.
not_available OK, Morris.
not_available Give your task full priority.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr Buchanan, I have to disagree with your decision.
not_available I'm sorry, but I don't think you're ready.
not_available Your objection is noted, Nadia.
not_available My decision stands.
not_available You're wasting your energy and you're distracting me.
not_available The president's gonna die.
not_available There's nothing you can do about it.
not_available They're starting to ask questions about Tom.
not_available Are you on schedule? I told you the bomb would be ready in 30 minutes.
not_available OK.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available You can't go soft on us now, Reed.
not_available No, it's it's just starting to hit me.
not_available What we're about to do.
not_available My God.
not_available We're killing the President of the United States.
not_available We're trying to save this country.
not_available That's all you need to think about.
not_available Chloe, look at the function prototypes on Morris's report.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available Take a look.
not_available You mean the missing sectors? 
not_available Yes, the missing sectors.
not_available Did Buchanan make a mistake by reinstating Morris too soon? No.
not_available The Pentagon put a lock on these items.
not_available I told him we'd backfill them later.
not_available It's not gonna be to anyone's benefit if you're covering for him.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Fine.
not_available Morris, I need you to tell me the truth.
not_available Have you been drinking? I just had a couple of beers, love.
not_available Don't be sarcastic.
not_available Your data merge is incomplete.
not_available I had to cover for you 
not_available Wait.
not_available What was incomplete? 
not_available Look For crying out loud.
not_available These are irrelevant.
not_available I only fill them in when I file my final report.
not_available Nadia wants these completed.
not_available Nadia only wants to prove to Buchanan that she was right and that I shouldn't be here.
not_available No one is out to get you.
not_available Look, even I know that I shouldn't be here.
not_available There's a big part of me that wants to go home, crawl into bed and forget this day ever happened.
not_available But I'm staying because CTU needs me.
not_available As events unfold in Los Angeles, the rest of the country has been galvanised into action as well.
not_available Authorities in all major metropolitan areas, including those hit in the attacks recently, are now urgently stepping up efforts to protect their citizens.
not_available Indeed, the entire nation is on alert and moving toward a state of full readiness, but that could take some time to accomplish.
not_available Clearly, what has happened in California could happen anywhere in the country.
not_available And with hundreds of millions of lives at stake across America, all available resources will be utilised, but also severely strained.
not_available Surely this will place a huge burden He brought me out of a horrible pit and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings.
not_available One step at a time, Charles.
not_available One step at a time.
not_available Logan is ready.
not_available We should get to the consulate in 45 minutes.
not_available What have you got on Markov? 
not_available We ran his name through the sub net.
not_available He's a career diplomat.
not_available Assigned consul general in '96.
not_available Worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Russian Federation.
not_available No red flags from NSA, Interpol or CIA.
not_available As far as they're concerned, he's clean.
not_available What if he isn't telling the truth? 
not_available We're out of options.
not_available I have to trust him.
not_available We have no jurisdiction at the consulate.
not_available Just make sure we have teams ready.
not_available All right.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, contact the highway patrol.
not_available Clear a corridor from Logan's estate to the consulate.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Jeannie.
not_available You left a message.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks for getting back to me.
not_available What can I do for you? I know you talked to Morris earlier and this is probably out of line and against your confidentiality agreement, but I'm really worried about him.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I haven't spoken to Morris since I left the programme three years ago.
not_available Hello? OK.
not_available Sorry to bother you.
not_available Have you seen Morris? 
not_available No, sorry.
not_available IT.
not_available Is Morris there? I haven't seen him, but if he comes down I'll Morris? Chloe? Morris, what are you doing in there? Open the door! What the hell is going on? 
not_available I called Jeannie.
not_available She hasn't talked to you in three years.
not_available Are you crazy? I trusted you.
not_available I put my job on the line.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available I didn't lie.
not_available You did.
not_available I didn't lie to you.
not_available Jeannie's not my sponsor any more.
not_available Ted is.
not_available Ted? 
not_available Remember Ted with the hair? He's my sponsor.
not_available I called him, just like I told you.
not_available I'll give you his number.
not_available Not now! I don't know what to say.
not_available I was worried about you.
not_available Marching into a men's room isn't worried, it's obsessed.
not_available Now, I appreciate your concern I love your concern 
not_available but, darling, you have to take a look at what's going on in your head.
not_available It's not pretty.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Mr President.
not_available From the attorney
not_available general, sir.

not_available If you try to call out, Carson will kill you and I cannot stop him.
not_available You understand? OK.
not_available You've got to put a stop to this.
not_available No.
not_available Mr Lennox, when this is done and the president is out of the way, I think that you will see things differently.
not_available I think you will see that this is better for our country.
not_available No.
not_available You're going to destroy this country, Reed.
not_available You're just as bad as Fayed.
not_available No, no.

not_available Are you sure you can do it? I'm the only one who can get close enough to that podium without attracting attention.
not_available I can do this.

not_available Please notify the president.
not_available Can we have some water for the podium? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Before we continue, I would just like to express my appreciation.
not_available You're taking a great risk, Mr President.
not_available You and I both share in that risk, sir.
not_available And maybe that, in and of itself, is something of a victory.
not_available I just hope that someone will listen to our appeal.
not_available You sound sceptical.
not_available The people we're trying to reach abandoned the political process a long time ago.

not_available Is there something I should know? 
not_available Something you should know, Mr President? Reed, I know how Tom feels about this address, but I was under the impression that he put his opposition aside and was working with me to make this policy succeed.
not_available I'm sure that that's a valid impression, Mr President.
not_available Then he'll be here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available He will be here.
not_available Good.
not_available You try that again and I'll kill you.
