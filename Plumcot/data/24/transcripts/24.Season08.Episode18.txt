not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Someone needs to take the reins of the I.R.K.
not_available government, someone who believes in the same ideals and principles as Omar Hassan and who shares his strength.
not_available If it is the will of my people, l will take my husband's place at the peace conference.
not_available Did you find him, President Taylor
not_available the man who killed my father? Samir Mehran.
not_available Yes.
not_available He was badly wounded, but he'll live to stand trial.
not_available I took care of him.
not_available So there is no connection to us.
not_available We're in the clear.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available There was a woman there who might have recognized me.
not_available What woman? She may be C.T.U.
not_available l'm not sure, but I've seen her face before.
not_available Once again, Mr.
not_available Novakovich, you're giving every indication that Russia has no interest in this peace accord.
not_available I don't understand how you can believe that installing Hassan's widow will alleviate our concerns about the instability of the I.R.K.
not_available government.
not_available l have close friends in Moscow.
not_available Do you honestly think your relationships can change their minds? Let's just say l'm going to be able to exercise some leverage.
not_available Jack thinks that someone inside of C.Î¤.U.
not_available is working for the terrorists.
not_available I spoke to Hastings.
not_available He cleared me through, Jim.
not_available Stay where you are and keep your hands where I can
not_available She just entered the parking garage.
not_available Who are you, you lying bitch? Don't move.
not_available Renee.
not_available Renee! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available You were on the phone with her right before she got shot.
not_available What were you talking about? Samir Mehran was given a lethal injection at the scene of his capture.
not_available Renee thought she recognized one of the E.M.Î¤.'s from her days undercover with the Russian mob.
not_available l
not_available l gotta get back to you.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available She didn't make it.
not_available The following takes place between 9:00 a.m.
not_available and 10:00 a.m.
not_available [ Woman On P.
not_available A.
not_available , Indistinct .]
not_available Sir? Sir, l'm so sorry, but we need to move her now.
not_available Sir, are you the husband of the deceased? 
not_available No.
not_available WelI, we need to contact her next of kin.
not_available Can you help us with that? Do you know where her parents live? Are they alive? l
not_available l don't know.
not_available Sir, are you gonna be all right? l don't know if these will fit.
not_available I got them from an intern.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, l heard about Renee.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available What can l do to help? Tell me who did this.
not_available You told me earlier Renee thought she recognized someone at Hassan's crime scene
not_available an E.M.T.? 
not_available Let us deal with that.
not_available We have everyone here working on it.
not_available Don't try and handle me, Chloe.
not_available Not now.
not_available Who did she see? She thought she recognized somebody from the Russian mob, Red Square.
not_available Bazhaev's group? Right.
not_available l want to talk to him.
not_available Like l said, l'm already on it.
not_available Îe's in custody somewhere, Chloe.
not_available l brought him in myself.
not_available Where is he? There's something that you need to know.
not_available Division replaced Hastings with me.
not_available Î¤hat means l'm responsible for what happens to Bazhaev.
not_available l know you're upset about Renee.
not_available So am I.
not_available But Bazhaev's our only lead.
not_available l need whoever taIks to him to be in complete control.
not_available l don't think that's you right now.
not_available l won't interfere with your investigation.
not_available You think you can stick to that? I give you my word.
not_available Chloe, l'm gonna ask you one more time.
not_available Where is he? Îe's in federal court downtown.
not_available He's being arraigned right now.
not_available Plan was for this chamber to be full by now.
not_available Ethan, what in the world are you doing here? You should be resting.
not_available Doctor said it was my call.
not_available Ethan.
not_available l'm fine.
not_available l was thinking, Madam Presidentour discussion about enlisting Charles Logan
not_available It's done.
not_available You've contacted him already? He's on his way to talk to the Russian foreign minister.
not_available That was fast.
not_available The Russians were about to announce that they were pulling out of the talks.
not_available l didn't see a lot of options.
not_available So, what's his angle? Madam President, you said he's on his way to talk to Novakovich.
not_available Îow does he intend to get the Russians to stay? l assume he uncovered something in his business dealings with them.
not_available But you don't know what it is? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available Madam President, he's operating in your name.
not_available Shouldn't we find out? l agreed l wouldn't.
not_available "Don't ask, don't tell" was the price for Logan's cooperation.
not_available Mikhail! Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The Russian people join you in mourning President Hassan.
not_available His death was a tragedy for all peace
not_available loving nations.
not_available You can save your platitudes.
not_available You want the truth.
not_available Why not, for a change? Espresso.
not_available Sir.
not_available l assume President Î¤aylor sent you here to bring my country back to the bargaining table.
not_available She is going to be disappointed.
not_available President Î¤aylor lured the whole world here with the promise that Hassan had united the l.R.K., that there would be peace for the first time in decades.
not_available Well, now it is clear that was a lie.
not_available There was no unity even with Hassan, and now that he is gone
not_available His widow, Dalia, can pick up the mantle.
not_available Not in our estimation.
not_available Hassan was undone by his own opposition.
not_available Îow could his widow possibly succeed where he failed? 'Cause we both know the opposition that undid him had outside help.
not_available Nuclear threats, assassination plots against a heavily guarded head of state
not_available Î¤his was not some third world malcontents lashing out.
not_available This was a highly organized effort orchestrated by a major rival to the United States, a rival convinced that their best interest was to stop the peace process by killing Hassan.
not_available lf you are insinuating
not_available Insinuating, no.
not_available l'm saying it was people inside your government
not_available first among them, you.
not_available That is an outrageous accusation.
not_available lt's a fact for which l have proof.
not_available l don't believe you.
not_available Well, that's your right.
not_available But l'll tell you this.
not_available You don't want to test me.
not_available Because what l have, I will share with President Taylor if you and l fail to come to an understanding here.
not_available Espresso, sir.
not_available At this point, President Taylor knows nothing about any of this.
not_available l didn't see what good could come out of inflaming the situation between our countries further, not without talking to you first.
not_available And now l have.
not_available Î¤he president's expecting me at the U.N.
not_available I need to go.
not_available And what will you tell her? What l would like to tell her is that Russia is back at the table and her peace process is on track.
not_available But if neither of us hears from you before l get there, l'm afraid what l'll have to tell her instead is the unvarnished truth.
not_available Sergei "Bazayoff." Bazhaev, Your Îonor.
not_available We'd like to waive reading.
not_available I'm sure you would, given the charges here.
not_available I can tell you right now, I'm gonna deny bail.
not_available Judge Ruffin, Sergei Bazhaev is a businessman with deep ties to this community.
not_available He's a foreign national.
not_available That's true, Your Honor, but he has lived in this country continuously since 1985.
not_available His entire family lives here.
not_available ln fact, several members of his family are represented in court todayhis wife, daughterinlaw, grandson
not_available for whom, incidentally, he is the sole means ofsupport.
not_available According to the charges, he's their sole support because he killed the boy's father, not to mention the other counts
not_available trafficking in nuclear materials, assassination, conspiracy.
not_available Like l said, I'm gonna deny bail.
not_available I'm remanding him to Marion immediately.
not_available Your Honor, may l have five minutes with my client, please? Fine.
not_available You have five minutes.
not_available Court will recess for 30 minutes.
not_available Clear the courtroom, please.
not_available My client would like to have a word with you.
not_available lf you touch my family, I swear to God, l
not_available You're not really sitting in the right chair to be making threats.
not_available Who shot Renee Walker? l don't know that name.
not_available She was a former F.B.l.
not_available agent.
not_available Approximately six years ago, she worked undercover in your organization.
not_available Earlier today, she recognized one ofyour men as Red Square.
not_available There is no Red Square.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Let me explain myself.
not_available Î¤his agent, Renee Walker
not_available l considered her to be my family.
not_available So take a long, hard look into my eyes and realize that I will have no problem taking out each member of yours before they even get home today unless I get the information l want.
not_available Whoever killed her had nothing to do with me.
not_available Enjoy your time at Marion.
not_available l'll tell your wife and your daughterin
not_available law you said hello.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait! lf I tell you, they'll kill my family anyway.
not_available We'll provide them with witness protection.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available Moscow.
not_available The Russian government.
not_available They're behind it, not me.
not_available Everything that happened today, all of it, was them.
not_available Who inside the government? I don't know.
not_available What do you mean, you don't know? You're talking about 1 00,000 people.
not_available l need names.
not_available I don't know names.
not_available Î¤hey never let me get close.
not_available The woman working with them arranged everything.
not_available What woman? Î¤he one they planted at C.Î¤.U.
not_available Dana Walsh.
not_available Sir, let's go.
not_available You promised.
not_available Nerveracking, isn't it
not_available waiting? l only saw Novakovich's face, sir, but you definitely had his attention.
not_available Hmm.
not_available lt's the president.
not_available CharIes Logan.
not_available Charles? Yes, Madam President.
not_available I just got off the phone with the Russian foreign minister.
not_available You did? And what did he say? Îe said that the two of you had a very interesting discussion, and that he would be coming to the United Nations in five hours, with the Russian premier, to sign the treaty as scheduled.
not_available He also said the credit for that is all yours.
not_available Oh, uh
not_available He was in the mood to be convinced, Madam President.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Ethan Kanin here.
not_available So you're back on your feet.
not_available Yes.
not_available And l'm curious.
not_available What did you say to the Russian minister to convince him to come back to the peace talks? l told him that peace is in all of our interests.
not_available Seriously, I'd like to know how you did it.
not_available Madam President, those
not_available those details are for me alone.
not_available That was our agreement.
not_available Am l right? Yes, you are.
not_available So, Ethan, um, let's not do anything to
not_available to sully our victory.
not_available And it is a victory, for all of us.
not_available It's a good feeling, isn't it? What? Being of service to your country.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I'll see you at the U.N.
not_available shortly.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Bazhaev's family just left the courthouse.
not_available They're gonna need witness protection.
not_available I want you to pick 'em up and bring 'em in.
not_available What did he say? Îe said the people who were behind Renee's murder weren't Russian mob.
not_available Said they were people inside the Russian government.
not_available Îe claims that Moscow is behind everything that happened today.
not_available l thought the l.R.K.
not_available opposition was trying to stop Hassan.
not_available No, he said the Russians were just using them.
not_available Îe didn't have time to explain why they don't want the peace accord to go through, but he did say something important.
not_available Îe said Moscow's main contact on the ground was Dana Walsh.
not_available Dana? You believe that? Î¤hat would explain how she managed to breach C.T.U.
not_available Anyways, l'm on my way in.
not_available I want to talk to her.
not_available l'll set it up.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Cole, l need your help.
not_available Jack's on his way here to interview Dana.
not_available Dana? What about? According to Jack, she's some kind of agent with the Russian government.
not_available He says they're behind everything that happened today, including Renee's murder.
not_available Listen.
not_available If Dana knows who killed Renee, or Jack thinks she's in any way responsible, there's no telling what he might do.
not_available Jack respects you.
not_available You might be the only one who can deaI with things if he gets out of hand.
not_available l know this is difficult for you, but during the questioning
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available lt's good to be back in the game, even if it is through the rear entrance.
not_available President Î¤aylor's worried about her image.
not_available Îuh.
not_available Believe me, I of all people understand that.
not_available She can't keep you hidden away forever, sir.
not_available Î¤hat's right.
not_available Credit given where credit is due
not_available publicly.
not_available That's our deal.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
not_available No, no.
not_available Believe me.
not_available The president will be grateful to know.
not_available Okay.
not_available Who is that agent? I want him reassigned.
not_available Sir, that was one of my contacts at JusticeYou hear me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l'll take care of it.
not_available But we have a more immediate problem.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Bauer? 
not_available What does he have to do with any of this? He was just downtown at the federal courthouse
not_available the arraignment of a Sergei Bazhaev.
not_available Bauer got to him behind closed doors and got him to talk.
not_available Îow much does this Bazhaev know? He knows about Dana Walsh, the mole the Russians planted at C.T.U.
not_available l know who she is.
not_available Bauer's headed to C.T.U., presumably to talk to her.
not_available Sir, my sources tell me Walsh hasn't given up anything about Moscow's involvement, not yet, but she knows enough to bring everything down.
not_available lf she gets in a room with Bauer
not_available Obviously, that can't happen.
not_available We need to stop Bauer before he talks to her.
not_available Î¤hat won't be easy.
not_available Îe may have a personal stake in this.
not_available Apparently, he was asking Bazhaev about a Renee Walker.
not_available She was shot dead in Bauer's apartment less than an hour ago.
not_available Sir, this could easily get out of hand.
not_available You may need to ask President Taylor to intervene.
not_available What are you suggesting
not_available that I tell her the truth? lf she finds out what the Russians have done, she'll be furious I kept her out of it.
not_available She might back out of our deal.
not_available Sir, you really need to stop Bauer now.
not_available l don't see any other way.
not_available You have to talk to the president.
not_available Bauer torpedoed my presidency, tried to ruin me
not_available almost did.
not_available Î¤here's no way I'm gonna let that happen again.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dana Walsh ready? Yes.
not_available l'll take you to her.
not_available l'm so sorry about Renee.
not_available I don't even know what to say.
not_available Dana know I'm gonna be interrogating her? No.
not_available I didn't want to give her a heads
not_available up.
not_available Good.
not_available Jack.
not_available l'm sorry about Renee.
not_available l have to leave the cameras on, Jack.
not_available You think I'm gonna kill her? l wouldn't blame you if you did.
not_available lf I wanted her dead, Chloe, she'd be dead.
not_available I'm just gonna wake her up to the idea of it.
not_available Open the door.
not_available What do you want? l want to know who killed Renee Walker.
not_available Renee's dead? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That doesn't make any sense.
not_available lt
not_available lt must have been a mistake.
not_available No mistake.
not_available l'm sorry, Jack.
not_available Really.
not_available You're sorry.
not_available l want to know who the shooter was.
not_available l want to know ordered it! I want names! Now! 
not_available Stop him.
not_available Let it play, Chloe.
not_available You hit me, and you get nothing.
not_available You think you get to make demands here? 
not_available I can give you the hitter, the man behind him, all the way up to the top.
not_available l want more than just names.
not_available I want proof! I have proof.
not_available An audio file, film.
not_available Where? First, l want my immunity deal back.
not_available Soon as l start talking, l'm dead.
not_available Your move, Jack.
not_available lf you lie to me, l'll find you, no matter where you try and hide.
not_available You understand that, right? Good.
not_available We've had such little good news these last few hours, l wanted to tell you right away.
not_available Î¤he delegates have voted unanimously to accept you as the representative of the I.R.K.
not_available at the signing of the treaty.
not_available l'm pleased.
not_available Î¤hank you for all your efforts.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available There is one proviso, of course.
not_available Î¤hat my own country accept me as signatory of the treaty.
not_available l know you've had very little time to pursue this.
not_available Jamot and l have been making progress.
not_available ln the next hour, our constituent assembly will vote on the issue, but as we've already received pledges of loyalty from most of my husband's coalition, l believe we have a good chance of success.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Dalia, we might just make it yet.
not_available We might.
not_available Madam President? Mrs.
not_available Hassan.
not_available Uh, l need a word.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Logan wants to speak with you.
not_available About what? He wouldn't say, except that it's urgent.
not_available Îe's waiting in your office.
not_available Following President Hassan's death, the expectation was that the delegates to the peace conference would have to pack up and go home, but the latest rumors coming out of the U.N.
not_available are pretty sensational
not_available that Dalia Hassan might be stepping into her husband's shoes.
not_available In fact, there are already street demonstrations taking place in Kamistan in support of Dalia Hassan's candidacy.
not_available Mr.
not_available Logan, the president is here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for seeing me, Madam President.
not_available Ethan said you wanted to speak with me.
not_available Um
not_available Can we have the room, please? 
not_available What's this about, Charles? Jack Bauer.
not_available He's out of control.
not_available He's already pressured a
not_available a Russian mafioso in federal court, and now he's on his way to question a woman in custody at C.T.U.
not_available Dana Walsh.
not_available Why does he want to talk to her? Îe thinks she knows who's behind the, uh
not_available the shooting of a Renee Walker.
not_available Agent Walker? She's dead? How did this happen? 
not_available That's still being investigated, but in the meantime, what l'm saying is Bauer needs to be stopped.
not_available Why? You're going to have to trust me.
not_available What we need to do right now is lock Bauer down.
not_available You better tell me exactly what's going on.
not_available Oh, Madam President, l
not_available No! l won't do a thing about Jack Bauer until you tell me the truth.
not_available Elements inside the Russian government were behind both the assassination of President Hassan and the supply of nuclear material to his enemies.
not_available Î¤he Russian government? 
not_available Why do you think they're back at the table? Because I threatened to expose their role in today's events.
not_available You knew about this and you didn't tell anyone? 
not_available l was trying to protect the president.
not_available Protect her? You've compromised her
not_available hopelessly! Why didn't you say anything before? l told you that l had leverage with the Russians.
not_available YY
not_available You must have understood it was significant.
not_available Significant, yes! Evidence of a sex scandal, some kind of financial malfeasanceNot this, for God's sake! lf I find that you were in a position to prevent anything
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available This information came to me only very recently.
not_available From whom? 
not_available l can't tell you.
not_available You will tell me.
not_available l can't, Madam President, because i
not_available it would do no good.
not_available My sources would plausibly deny even knowing me.
not_available Î¤he Russian involvement
not_available that's what Jack Bauer is about to bring out into the open? lf he taIks to Dana Walsh, yes.
not_available The Russians inserted her at C.T.U.
not_available months ago.
not_available She was their agent.
not_available lf Bauer gets to her, it'll all come out, and thenand then this
not_available this will all be finished.
not_available lt's finished anyways.
not_available You think the president wants anything more to do with the Russians after what they've done? Yes.
not_available Yes, you do, Madam President, because you are looking at the bigger picture, the greater good.
not_available Îow can you call any of this good? Because it is good, an undeniable good, a peace that's escaped the world for generations! That's what you're on the verge of achieving.
not_available Do you really want to throw it all away? Do you really think Dalia Hassan will sit down at the table with the people who murdered her husband? Who says she has to know? Believe me, l know how hard you worked for this, how you sweated and prayed, the sleepless nights
not_available I know.
not_available The power to make a difference
not_available that's why we came into politics.
not_available Îow few of us get to achieve it, but you have.
not_available You so nearly have.
not_available Ethan will tell you to make a stand.
not_available l applaud his
not_available his moral clarity, but then he's on the sidelines.
not_available He can afford it.
not_available That's enough! ls the situation ideal? No! Far from it, but you have a real chance to make the world a better place.
not_available Don't listen to this, Allison.
not_available lf the treaty's not signed today, it's not the end.
not_available You can build a better peace, with honest partners.
not_available "There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune." What the hell does that mean? Î¤he president knows.
not_available It's from Julius Caesar.
not_available lt means "Now or never." 
not_available Madam President.
not_available I have Jack Bauer for you.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available He's at C.T.U.
not_available He wants to talk to you about an immunity agreement for a Dana Walsh.
not_available l'll have to call him back.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President, there is no choice here.
not_available But there is a choice, Ethan, and unfortunately, only l can make it.
not_available l'm going to C.Î¤.U.
not_available To do what? To see Jack Bauer.
not_available Did the president call back yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Jack, are you sure you want to do this to yourselff? We can take it from here.
not_available Î¤he minute Dana's immunity deal is back in place, we can roll up the names, close this out.
not_available l need to see this through.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Î¤he president's on the phone, line 3.
not_available She asked for Chloe.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian, I'm on my way to see you.
not_available You're coming to C.Î¤.U.? 
not_available Yes.
not_available l'm almost there.
not_available l need to talk to Jack Bauer.
not_available Make sure he doesn't leave.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Let Security know the president will be here any minute.
not_available She's coming here? 
not_available Î¤hat's what l just said.
not_available Have them standing by.
not_available Why's she doing this? 
not_available She said she wants to talk to you.
not_available Why didn't she just talk to me on the phone? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You should probably meet her in Hastings's office.
not_available Fine.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Welcome to C.Î¤.U.
not_available I'm Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Thank you, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Is Jack inside? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Right this way.
not_available l want to say how grateful l am for all your efforts today.
not_available We've taken some pretty hard hits, but we've managed to keep ourselves in the game.
not_available Î¤he peace process is still alive, and I am counting on your hard work and your vigilance to keep it that way.
not_available l know you won't let me down.
not_available Thank you, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I'll go up alone.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available Madam President.
not_available l am so sorry about Agent Walker.
not_available l gather she meant a lot to you.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Which makes what l'm about to ask so very, very hard.
not_available Please, Jack.
not_available l need you to stand down.
not_available l
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available l do not want you to question Dana Walsh.
not_available Madam President, the information that I can extract from Dana Walsh is not limited to the murder of Renee Walker.
not_available l believe she knows the names of the people who facilitated the assassination of President Hassan, people working within the Russian government.
not_available That is pure speculation.
not_available Then grant her immunity.
not_available Let me question her.
not_available lf she's lying, you lose nothing.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available l won't give Dana Walsh immunity.
not_available I can't.
not_available Î¤he peace process is back on track.
not_available Dalia Îassan will represent her country at the signing.
not_available Î¤he Russians have accepted her and have undertaken to support the treaty.
not_available Madam President, the Russians have been trying to destroy the treaty.
not_available You can't trust them.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Î¤he information that l have came from Sergei Bazhaev, and I believe him.
not_available lf you let me question Dana Walsh, I can prove it to you.
not_available No.
not_available l won't allow it.
not_available You don't want to know the truth.
not_available What l want is to keep the Russians at the table.
not_available Allegations of this sort will drive them away.
not_available What if the allegations are true? lf I keep the Russians at the table, I can bring peace to a part of the world that has known nothing but war for generations.
not_available That is the greater good that I am working toward, and to achieve it, there have to be sacrifices.
not_available With all due respect, Madam President, these people gave nuclear weapons to terrorists who were willing to obliterate half of Manhattan.
not_available You don't know that! And I'm telling you, we have to move on.
not_available Even Îassan's widow has picked up the torch and is continuing the peace process.
not_available Does she know the Russians helped murder her husband? Do you think she'd be willing to sign that treaty if she knew? Have you even told her? That's enough.
not_available Have you told her? l said that's enough! Î¤his peace treaty is in the interests of the United States and of the world.
not_available That makes it a good in itself, and certainly more important than your desire for revenge.
not_available Madam President, l don't want revenge, I want justice.
not_available And I want peace.
not_available lf there were another way, I would take it, but there's not.
not_available Î¤hat's my decision.
not_available Do you understand? Do you understand, Jack? Yes, ma'am.
not_available l've arranged a helicopter to fly you from C.Î¤.U.
not_available to McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available You're locking me down.
not_available You'lI be debriefed there.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Jack.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l had them gather your things.

not_available I'm leaving C.T.U.
not_available now.
not_available I'll be with you in 10 minutes.
not_available Î¤hey said you wanted to see me? 
not_available Yes.

not_available No one gets access to her without my express permission.
not_available Is that clear? l guess.
not_available What about Jack? Jack is going to McGuire Air Force Base to be debriefed.
not_available He didn't seem very happy about that.
not_available He was disappointed that l wouldn't grant Dana Walsh immunity in exchange for her testimony.
not_available But Dana knows who's responsible for everything that's happened today.
not_available She is a sociopath.
not_available She'll say anything.
not_available And the last thing we need right now is a bunch of unfounded allegations derailing the peace that we've all worked so hard for.
not_available Do you understand, Chloe? We're having a press conference at the U.N.
not_available in two hours to present Dalia Îassan as the new leader of the I.R.K.
not_available and to announce that the peace talks are still on track.
not_available What we need C.Î¤.U.
not_available to do is to make sure security is airtight.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Î¤im Woods speaks very highly of you.
not_available When the situation got out of control, he was quite adamant that you were the one to take over.
not_available l'm surprised he even knows who I am.
not_available lt was a pleasure to meet you finally, Chloe.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Cole, we're gonna be back on U.N.
not_available detail.
not_available What's happening with Dana? 
not_available As of now, nothing.
not_available What about the immunity agreement? 
not_available There isn't gonna be one.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Î¤he president says that Dana's a lying sociopath who will wreck the peace treaty.
not_available What's Jack say about that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available He's being choppered to McGuire for debriefing.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What the hell's going on? Î¤here's gonna be a press conference soon, and the president needs us to guarantee security.
not_available You'll need to get your teams ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine.
