
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Just hear me out.
not_available You used up the public's goodwill with Sherry.
not_available They don't want to hear about you being involved with someone else who's not trustworthy.
not_available You have got to respect the people who voted for you.
not_available Her ex
not_available husband clearly had his own agenda.
not_available And it shouldn't be difficult to prove that he's a liar.
not_available Ann, it's me, Ted.
not_available Come up in my office.
not_available Come up and I'll explain everything.
not_available I have some documents that will prove your innocence.
not_available Kim, it's me.
not_available Are you alone? Where are you? Chappelle ordered you back here.
not_available I'm not coming back until I find your father.
not_available I just found out where Hector Salazar is.
not_available Small town in northern Mexico called Las Nieves.
not_available I'm sure Jack's taking Ramon there now.
not_available You cannot go in there alone.
not_available Hector's gonna have an army down there.
not_available Kim, I need to hear you promise, you're not gonna tell anyone you talked to me.
not_available Be careful, Chase.
not_available What are you doing, Jack? Your brother tried to kill me on the plane! That is not what we talked about.
not_available Hi, brother.
not_available I¡¯m so glad to see you.
not_available What's going on? I don't understand.
not_available I'll tell you all about it in a minute.
not_available I promise.
not_available Good job, Jack.
not_available Come.
not_available We have a lot of work to do.
not_available Where's Chappelle? 
not_available Interrogation 820.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Talk to me, you son of a bitch.
not_available Almeida, what are you doing here? 
not_available Get him out of the room.
not_available Why? 
not_available He's in.
not_available What are you talking about? Who's in? 
not_available Jack.
not_available Gael and I have been working with Jack.
not_available We've been trying to get him back undercover with the Salazars.
not_available That signal means he's back in.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I'll explain everything.
not_available Right now we got to call the President.
not_available The Following takes place Between 8:00 pm and 9:00 pm.
not_available So, you're telling me that Bauer's been playing a game with us all this time.
not_available It's no game, Ryan.
not_available But he's back under with the Salazars.
not_available And they trust him again.
not_available That's what we're counting on, yeah.
not_available I'm your boss, Tony.
not_available You should have come to me first.
not_available Look, Ryan.
not_available You'll understand everything once I've explained it to the President.
not_available After that if you feel like I've acted inappropriately, you can do what you got to do.
not_available I will.
not_available Count on it.
not_available The President's coming in on the line.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Go ahead, Mr.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, this is Tony Almeida director of CTU Los Angeles.
not_available Mr.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Thank you for taking my call, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You're also on with my chief of staff, Wayne Palmer.
not_available I was told this was an urgent matter.
not_available Yes, sir, it is.
not_available It's also fairly complex so I'll try to keep it as clear and concise as I can.
not_available Go on.
not_available Sir, everything that's happened today, from the infected body at Health Services through Ramon Salazar's prison break has been a part of an elaborate sting operation.
not_available Sting operation? Yes, sir.
not_available Planned and executed by Jack Bauer, agent Gael Ortega and myself.
not_available Elaborate, Mr.
not_available Almeida? Jack Bauer wanted to fill you in on this situation himself, sir.
not_available Jack Bauer is a fugitive from the law.
not_available If you indulge me sir, there's a video file you should see.
not_available It's on a designated CTU server.
not_available You can access the file with the pass code, delta 3 delta 59 Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The fact that you are viewing this recording now means that I have successfully completed the first phase of a secret operation.
not_available Contrary to what you¡¯ve been led to believe the Salazars are not in possession of the Cordillera Virus.
not_available The idea that they are, is a lie which I promoted deliberately, in order to achieve a more important goal.
not_available Please, sir, let me explain.
not_available About a month ago I learned from a contact that a group of scientists from the Ukraine were trying to sell a weaponized virus on the open market.
not_available They were looking for a buyer with cash and credibility.
not_available I only managed to get their interest when I suggested the Salazars are potential buyers.
not_available As long as I can get the Salazars to agree, CTU would seize the virus as the sale took place.
not_available Our goal was to remove the virus stock pile from the market place.
not_available Because Mr.
not_available President it is without a doubt the most lethal threat that we have ever faced.
not_available But all of this here has done convincing the Salazars that I have switched sides.
not_available And the only way to get in their trust was to break Ramon Salazar out of prison.
not_available Mr.
not_available President I'm sorry for deceiving you.
not_available But I assure you it was a benign deception.
not_available And I assume complete responsibility for my actions.
not_available Sir, if things went wrong you would have been exposed personally, legally and politically.
not_available And this is the only way I could see to avoid that risk.
not_available But now it¡¯s time for you to know the truth.
not_available And I'm asking you to allow CTU director Almeida to coordinate an interdiction with the military so we can take possession of this virus and keep it from our enemies.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? Keeping me in the dark on the matter of national security is inexcusable.
not_available We were trying to protect you, sir.
not_available I know what you were trying to do.
not_available And it was a mistake.
not_available And you and your colleagues will take responsibility for it, 
not_available when this is over.
not_available Yes, sir, I understand.
not_available Where's Bauer now? 
not_available In Northern Mexico.
not_available He's setting up a meeting between the Salazars and the Ukrainians who are selling the virus.
not_available When is this meeting expected to take place? In the next few hours, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm requesting your permission to activate the interdiction plan.
not_available Under the circumstances I don't have a choice but to say yes, Mr.
not_available Almeida.
not_available But even if this plan works flawlessly you haven't heard the last of it.
not_available I don't like decisions being taken out of my hands.
not_available Well, David some decisions you want to keep as far away as you can.
not_available Not this decision, it's too important.
not_available Jack Bauer had no right to keep me out of the loop.
not_available I disagree.
not_available Bauer protected you as he should have.
not_available And when this is all over you probably gonna have to punish him for form's sake But while you¡¯re punishing him, know this He did do the right thing.
not_available Michelle.
not_available We need extended network using protocol four, alright? Thanks.
not_available I'm not so sure this is gonna work out well for you Almeida.
not_available Maybe not, but right now I got to help Jack get this virus.
not_available And I don't need you looking over my shoulder, alright? You work for me.
not_available You don't give orders, you take them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Except the President put me in charge of this particular operation.
not_available Now if you object, give him a call.
not_available I may be wrong, but I didn't get the impression that he's in the mood for any bureaucratic squabbling today.
not_available Ryan, just let me do my job, alright? Yeah, I'll be watching.
not_available Las Nieves, Northern Mexico Are you ready to listen, Ramon? Alright.
not_available Tell me all the men we traded this is not our friend.
not_available Bauer came to me with an opportunity.
not_available An opportunity? 
not_available Yes.
not_available To make more money than we have ever dreamed of.
not_available Bauer found out about a virus that was coming in the market.
not_available These men will have it there, they are from the Ukraine.
not_available They're scientists.
not_available All they want to do is to make their money and disappear.
not_available How much are they asking? A hundred million.
not_available Al Qaeda pays ten times as much North Koreans too.
not_available I made all the causable.
not_available I had the buyers all lined up.
not_available That's a billion dollars.
not_available How do you know this virus is real? The Ukrainians gave us a demonstration.
not_available Bauer delivered one of the bodies to Health Services in LA.
not_available He used it to scare the Americans to letting you go.
not_available The scientists, where are they now? They're not far from here.
not_available I'm supposed to call their representative, a man named Michael Amador in the next hour.
not_available What's in it for you, Jack? Ramon, we don't like each other.
not_available But it doesn't mean we can¡¯t do business together.
not_available I need your capital and you need my access to the virus.
not_available I will never have thought that Jack Bauer was for sale.
not_available My wife was killed because of my job.
not_available My daughter's never been the same since.
not_available Just last year well you know what I went through to bring you in.
not_available What did I get for? Pad on the back? In the end the demotion and a heroine habit.
not_available I'm tired of putting my ass on the line for nothing.
not_available I'm done putting my ass on the line for nothing.
not_available If you don't want to go through with it blow him away.
not_available But just remember, you're blowing away a billion dollars.
not_available Ramon, no! Are you crazy? You are crazy for trusting him! 
not_available Give me the gun.
not_available No.
not_available Who are you to refuse me? I run our business, not you! If not for me, me! You wouldn't have been here.
not_available Like I said I have to call them within an hour.
not_available These men are not gonna wait around.
not_available There's too much at stake.
not_available You can either shoot me or let me make the call.
not_available But you'd better decide quickly.
not_available Jack's transponder pinpoints his location somewhere east of Las Nieves just south of the border.
not_available Satellite photo shows that it is some sort of ranch or farm.
not_available Our units will hold a perimeter of 10 miles.
not_available All communication will be on a designated frequency.
not_available And nobody makes a move unless it goes through me first, alright? Chloe, I want you and Chase provide tactical assistance.
not_available Where is Chase? 
not_available We¡¯re not sure.
not_available Chapelle ordered him back over an hour ago.
not_available Right, let me know when he gets back here.
not_available And let me make this perfectly clear.
not_available For the next few hours all of our resources are dedicated to helping Jack Bauer intercept this virus.
not_available Any questions? Alright, let's get back to work.
not_available Tony.
not_available I spoke to Chase.
not_available When? About an hour ago.
not_available He is not coming back to CTU.
not_available What are you talking about? I thought Chapelle gave him a direct order.
not_available He ignored it.
not_available He still doesn't really know what's going on.
not_available None of us did until you spoke to the President.
not_available Chase still thinks my father was captured by the Salazars.
not_available And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack.
not_available Yes.
not_available He knows about Las Nieves, he's on his way there right now.
not_available Probably by plane.
not_available How the hell did he find out about Las Nieves? He said he followed a lead.
not_available Damn it! If he goes in, he's gonna blow Jack's cover 
not_available and we're gonna lose this virus.
not_available I know.
not_available Alright, maybe I can get hold of him.
not_available Tony, you won't be able to reach him.
not_available Why not? 
not_available He's gone dark.
not_available Hector thought you might be hungry.
not_available Look at you.
not_available You're pathetic! Looks like a junk in you.It's the only real thing about you.
not_available It makes me sick to think that I ever believed you.
not_available You said you'd take me away from here.
not_available Remember? Do you remember, Jack? Yes, I remember.
not_available Well there is one small thing you forgot to mention You were a cop.
not_available But even that wouldn't matter if you meant half the things you said to me.
not_available I meant everything I ever said to you.
not_available Do you think I am stupid? You were doing a job! My compliments, you did it very well.
not_available But you know the saddest thing, Jack? You couldn't even be true to that.
not_available You betrayed Hector and Ramon, betrayed me.
not_available And now you betray your own people.
not_available God knows there are times when I despise Hector but at least he's true to himself.
not_available He knows who he is.
not_available You? You're a man without a soul.
not_available Does Hector know about us? Do you think I'd be alive if he did? You know where he is right now? He's with Ramon, deciding whether you should live or die.
not_available But you sit here shaking like a leaf.
not_available You need a fix, don't you? Well there's plenty here, Jack.
not_available You want me to get you a fix? Is that what you want? No.
not_available Jack.
not_available You were a man once.
not_available What happened to you? Right, I'm sending his photo to you, right now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Remember, Miguel, this guy's acting on his own authority.
not_available Make sure you tell Gutierrez that he's not dangerous.
not_available Okay.
not_available I will confirm with you.
not_available Right, good.
not_available I just spoke to my contact in Mexican Intelligence.
not_available He says he can send a man in Las Nieves in less than 20 minutes.
not_available An agent named Rafael Gutierrez.
not_available Won't local police be quicker? No.
not_available If we bring them in we might as well send a telegram to the Salazars that Chase is on his way.
not_available What about our delta teams? No, it's gonna take them over an hour.
not_available It'll be way too late.
not_available We're analyzing the areal map of Las Nieves.
not_available There's only one landing strip.
not_available He won't use it.
not_available Landing strip¡¯s too exposable.
not_available Especially if it's the only one.
not_available Alright.
not_available Run a topographical overlay.
not_available Find the mostly likely landing area the size of the airfield.
not_available Yes, David? Have you seen or heard from Anne? Not for some time.
not_available Why? I can't reach her.
not_available Is this about your health? No.
not_available I'm concerned about her.
not_available She was pretty ripped up after the debate.
not_available We're all pretty ripped up here, David.
not_available Listen, this allegation by Anne's ex
not_available husband is no small bump in the road.
not_available Now I've been thinking about this and there may be no way to defend ourselves against Keeler's accusation and Anne was involved in something illegal.
not_available You have to do better than that, Wayne.
not_available I know you like to deal things head on.
not_available But I think the best course of action for right now is to be evasive.
not_available So if the press brings this up you make it clear that you're not gonna answer any questions.
not_available That you are gonna wait for all the facts to come in as should they.
not_available Well you may be right but in the meantime I need you to find Anne.
not_available The reporters are gonna be chasing her and she's not up to this.
not_available I'll put Perry on it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello, Anne.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available I just wanted to have a chance to apologize face to face for what I did.
not_available I don't know what I was thinking.
not_available Where are the letters, Ted? Right here.
not_available For god¡¯s sakes, Anne.
not_available It's not meant for you.
not_available No, for whom then? Just take the letters and go.
not_available Ted? You're not going to kill yourself, are you? Oh, no! 
not_available It's for self defense.
not_available Don't lie to me.
not_available Look, you got what you came for.
not_available So go! You don't need to be here for this.
not_available At least talk to someone.
not_available I know some good doctors.
not_available High priced phonies are gonna talk me out of doing what I should have done 5 years ago? No, thank you.
not_available I'm a failure, Anne.
not_available Everything I touch goes bad.
not_available It's just the way it is.
not_available Don't shed any tears for me because I don't deserve it.
not_available Just just go.
not_available Don't come any closer.
not_available Let me call someone.
not_available No! Please Now you're a great woman, Anne.
not_available Much better than I ever deserved and I'm sorry I let you down.
not_available But just get the hell out of here.
not_available I said go!! 
not_available It doesn't have to be like this.
not_available No? How can it be? Can we be 25 again? What you did was wrong.
not_available But you made it right.
not_available And that means something.
not_available That means you can start again.
not_available People do it all the time, Ted.
not_available Why not you? You're really something.
not_available I believe if I gave you a few more minutes, you might actually be able to talk me out of doing it.
not_available Ted No! The President can expect updates directly from me.
not_available How often do we call you? 
not_available Every 15 minutes.
not_available I'll let him know.
not_available Alright, we'd be in touch.
not_available You should be in the hospital.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What have you got? Briefing package on Las Nieves.
not_available Alternate landing sites that Chase might use instead of the air strip.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is there something wrong? Just worried about you, that's all.
not_available What is it? It's not the time.
not_available Michelle.
not_available What is it? This whole thing you've been planning with Jack Look I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.
not_available Jack planned it and he wanted absolute secrecy and I agreed.
not_available You don't have to explain.
not_available No, I want to explain.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I trust you with my life.
not_available But this job is what it is.
not_available Jack said he came up with the plan a month ago.
not_available Is that how long you've known? Something like that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just I had no idea¡¦ you were hiding something from me.
not_available But that's my problem.
not_available Just got off the phone with CTU.
not_available Bauer's near a place called Las Nieves.
not_available Delta teams are scrambling now.
not_available When does CTU expect to intercept the virus from the Ukrainians? As soon as Bauer gives them a signal.
not_available Tony Almeida says he'll be giving us an update every 15 minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available It's Wayne Palmer.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, hang on.
not_available David, it's Anne.
not_available She says it's important.
not_available Hello, Anne? David? It's Ted.
not_available He just committed suicide.
not_available Oh, Anne.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Are you alright? Not really, no.
not_available I was umm I was with him when he did it.
not_available What were you doing there? He asked to see me, David.
not_available He said that he was sorry and that he wanted to make things right.
not_available And I Did you call the police? 
not_available Yes, they're here now.
not_available What can I do to help? Well there's something that I need to give you.
not_available Something Ted wanted me to give you.
not_available What's that? It's letters that umm exonerate me from any connection to the falsified research data.
not_available That's why I was here on the first place.
not_available Because he wanted to give them to me.
not_available And you have these letters.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available So, I'll be in the clear and hopefully puts an end to the negative fall for you as well.
not_available That's secondary to you're well being.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available I'll come over as soon as I'm done here.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you then.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is everything alright? Ted Packard just committed suicide.
not_available And he did it in front of Anne.
not_available Oh, my god, David.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Listen I don't mean to I don't mean to sound callous but what was she doing with him? He wanted to give her letters.
not_available Which will apparently prove she's innocent.
not_available You're serious? She's gonna bring them over in a while.
not_available Well I guess that's some sort of silver lining it.
not_available Listen, David I know I've been somewhat hard on Anne.
not_available But she cleaned up her own mess and I respect that.
not_available Maybe she's learned what it takes to be in this game after all.
not_available Why do we even need Bauer? Because he made the first contact with the Ukrainian scientists.
not_available They want to deal with him.
not_available They trust him.
not_available You trust him too The man who pretended to be our friend and then put me in prison.
not_available And got you out again! 
not_available He has an angle, Hector.
not_available Count on it.
not_available Of course he does! You saw him.
not_available He's a shell, there's nothing left.
not_available No future, no family.
not_available And a habit he can't beat.
not_available He's not the same man who fooled us before.
not_available So sure of that? You know we have people in the American agencies.
not_available In the military too.
not_available All of them, every one of them confirmed the prison break was real.
not_available Bauer is a fugitive from his own country.
not_available If they hadn't wanted you alive they would have killed him.
not_available That's a fact.
not_available So, if we go through with this, what happens afterwards? We just forget what Bauer did to us and let him walk away? Do you think I can forget what he did to us? As soon as we have the virus we kill him.
not_available Now that's the first thing you said that I like.
not_available Now Bauer is clever and he'll expect it.
not_available And what can he do? Alone, surrounded.
not_available Don't underestimate him.
not_available It's me who's been underestimated, Ramon.
not_available But I will earn your respect.
not_available When we make more money in one day than we've made in both of our lifetimes.
not_available But you don't have all night to decide.
not_available This man Amador is waiting for Bauer's call.
not_available Bring Bauer in.
not_available Right away, Ramon.
not_available What have you decided, Ramon? I'm not sure yet.
not_available I don't trust you and I never will.
not_available All I want right now is to spill your blood.
not_available But I won't.
not_available Not yet anyway.
not_available Out of respect for my little brother, I am willing to play this out a little longer.
not_available So make your call.
not_available Amador won't be at the number he gave me for another 15 minutes.
not_available We'll wait.
not_available You won't be sorry.
not_available Tony, it's Rafael from Las Nieves.
not_available Patch me over here.
not_available Yeah, Rafael.
not_available Yeah, I'm at the landing area now.
not_available There's no sign of any incoming craft.
not_available What size team do you have? What team? It's just me.
not_available You got to be kidding me.
not_available Look, this is a corrupt area.
not_available Salazar's got a lot of influence here, we don't know how far it reaches.
not_available Miguel wanted me to do this on my own.
not_available Alright, well you're gonna have your hands full cause Chase's one of our more capable agents.
not_available Alright, how do you want me to approach? Well don't surprise him.
not_available Make sure he knows you're working with CTU.
not_available Hey.
not_available Yeah, this must be him.
not_available It's a twin engine prop on approach.
not_available He's landing now.
not_available You have the photo we sent you? Yeah.
not_available Make sure it's him, be careful.
not_available We'll keep this line open.
not_available Good.
not_available Alright, I'm moving in.
not_available Right, be careful.
not_available He's not expecting company.
not_available Edmunds.
not_available Edmunds.
not_available I'm here to help.
not_available Edmunds? Edmunds? Edmunds? Gutierrez, talk to me.
not_available He's not here.
not_available The plane's empty.
not_available He must have spotted you.
not_available It's that way.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Yeah, alright.
not_available Edmunds! Edmunds? Edmunds? Wait, wait, wait! Take it easy! Who the hell are you? 
not_available My name in Rafael Gutierrez.
not_available Mexican Intelligence.
not_available Check my pocket, my left pocket.
not_available Check it! Down on your knees.
not_available Hands behind your head.
not_available Lock your fingers.
not_available Alright.
not_available How do you know my name? 
not_available Your boss sent me to find you.
not_available Tony Almeida, CTU.
not_available His access code is 3 tango 664.
not_available Get up.
not_available What does he want? He wants you to call him.
not_available I've got a phone right here.
not_available He says it's a matter of life or death about Jack Bauer.
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Almeida.
not_available It's Edmunds.
not_available Listen, Chase If you're trying to get me to come back, you're wasting¡¦ Chase! Chase, what's going on? Chase, can you hear me? Tony, are you there? What's going on? 
not_available The guy you sent is dead.
not_available A sniper took him out.
not_available I'm being pursued.
not_available Chase!? Chase? Can you hear me? Chase? Doctor Packard? I'm supposed to see the President.
not_available Follow me, ma'am.
not_available Come! Anne.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Are those the letters? This is good David.
not_available This is very good.
not_available This clears up everything.
not_available Yes, yes it does.
not_available Once these get authenticated we'll take them to the press.
not_available You'll be off the hook and Keeler should be hoisted right up on it.
not_available Yeah, I thought you'd be pleased.
not_available Anne, listen umm I'm sorry about Ted.
not_available I really am and if there's anything that I can do.
not_available Anything at all please just Let me know.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Anne? I'm alright, David.
not_available I'm gonna be alright.
not_available But¡¦ Something came out of this.
not_available And it was suddenly so clear to me.
not_available What was clear? I don't know how to say this except to just say it.
not_available I think we need to end things.
not_available After what's just happened After what's been happening all day I can understand why you want some time apart.
not_available David, it's not about time apart.
not_available Oh, Anne 
not_available And it is true today has been awful.
not_available But It just confirmed something that I have been feeling for a while.
not_available I can't live in your world.
not_available The things that people do to each other.
not_available The things they have to do in order to survive.
not_available I just I can't 
not_available That's exactly why I need you.
not_available You need someone who can stand beside you.
not_available Not someone who stands back and watches and Or maybe passes judgment on things she doesn't really understand.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You are the finest man I have ever known.
not_available And Wayne, god bless him.
not_available He's just what you need and I'm so glad you have him.
not_available But it's not for me.
not_available Goodbye, David.
not_available Anne! Hello? 
not_available Michael! It's Jack Bauer.
not_available Can you hear me? 
not_available I can hear you, Jack.
not_available I'm glad you arrived safely.
not_available Where are you? You know I can't tell you that, Jack.
not_available Okay fine then where do you want to meet? I'll call you back in a few minutes.
not_available Give me the number you're calling from.
not_available Okay, I'm on a satellite phone.
not_available One second.
not_available Number's 3422
not_available 1.
not_available You'll hear from me soon.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available You better have your money prepared.
not_available Don't worry about that.
not_available He came in by plane.
not_available Just south of the town.
not_available He was with a federally that they killed.
not_available I know this man.
not_available It's Bauer's partner.
not_available Was he with anyone else? 
not_available No, just the federally and him.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? 
not_available Hey, shut up! If he's here, others will be here soon.
not_available We got to get out of here.
not_available Thomas, make sure everything is ready.
not_available We're moving out of here, now! Bauer has been lying to us all along.
not_available That's not true! I had no idea he was coming down here.
not_available You've been playing us for fools again! Ramon, you're making a mistake.
not_available Hector, please.
not_available We can still do this deal.
not_available Don't let your brother piss away a billion dollars.
not_available You know what if he's telling the truth? You keep hearing what you want to hear.
not_available This is an act.
not_available It's all been an act! How do you know? Ramon I swear to you, I'm not lying.
not_available Please, let's do this deal.
not_available What the hell is going on here, Jack? 
not_available Shut up, Chase! You should have never followed me down here.
not_available You're with them? Yes, I'm with them.
not_available You say he's not with you.
not_available Yes, that's right.
not_available Then kill him.
not_available Kill your partner.
not_available You want me to kill him? Fine, I'll kill him.
not_available But we would be smarter to use him for information and maybe even as a hostage.
not_available No more clever talk! You keep saying you're on our side.
not_available Now prove it, once and for all.
not_available Fine.
not_available You should have never come down here, Chase.
not_available You should have listened to me.
not_available Very good, Jack.
not_available We'll take him with us.
not_available Bauer is right.
not_available Let's find out what he knows.
not_available Break him down.
not_available See if anyone came here with him.
not_available We'll go up to a safe house.
not_available And we'll wait for Amador's call.
not_available Jack.
not_available Shut up, Chase! You want to get through this? Just shut up! Damn it! Tony.
not_available I don't know how but the transponder on Jack's watch just went dead.
not_available Did you try reset? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Damn it! By the time the assault teams are in position we'll have no idea where he is.
