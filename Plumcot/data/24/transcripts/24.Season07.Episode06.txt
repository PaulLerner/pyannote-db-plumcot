not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Without you, Sangala has no leader.
not_available These people
not_available they work for Dubaku, don't they? Mr.
not_available Matobo.
not_available We've accessed the air intake to your safe room.
not_available We're now feeding in ammonium distearate gas.
not_available If you do not open the door, you will die.
not_available Ule.
not_available Alama, no! Get him out of there! Get the woman too.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available Sam.
not_available I can't stay long.
not_available They killed Roger and made it look like a suicide.
not_available Who are they? 
not_available I don't know who they are.
not_available They just said they would kill me if I said anything.
not_available Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department.
not_available It's all here
not_available account numbers, trading records, everything that he knew.
not_available Roger was looking into things he shouldn't have.
not_available You killed my son.
not_available Tetradiazene, sir.
not_available It's a neuromuscular paralytic.
not_available Situation here is in control.
not_available Are you tracking Ms.
not_available Roth? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Time to get her back to her apartment.
not_available Ms.
not_available Roth.
not_available Henry Taylor sent me.
not_available Yes? Mr.
not_available Taylor's been looking into the matter you discussed.
not_available My God.
not_available He believes you're in imminent danger.
not_available He wants me to place you in protective custody.
not_available Larry, it's Renee.
not_available I've got a visual on them loading Matobo and his wife into a truck.
not_available Where the hell is SWAT? 
not_available They're still about five minutes out.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Far as I can tell, she's alone.
not_available Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.
not_available Nichols wants her out of the way before we deliver Matobo.
not_available Kill her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Turn around.
not_available If you trust me, I will get you through this alive.
not_available The following takes place between 1:00 p.m.
not_available And 2:00 p.m.
not_available I want three more teams combing the site where Matobo was abducted.
not_available Pull 'em in from Regional if you have to.
not_available We're gonna expand the search.
not_available Coordinate with Metro Police to set up a pointbypoint grid encompassing a 10
not_available mile radius.
not_available And talk with N.S.A.
not_available I wanna back all of this up with synchronized satellite sweeps.
not_available I'll do what I can.
not_available What does that mean? Well, every time I ask for something, they pull that cloak and dagger nonsense.
not_available I have to get approval for every little scrap of data.
not_available Janis, this isn't easy for anybody.
not_available Just please, make it happen.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We know that another attack could be imminent.
not_available The only way to stop it is to find Almeida and Bauer and take control of the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available Um, for those of you who haven't heard Renee Walker was abducted by these people.
not_available We're the only chance she's got.
not_available Well, let's get to work.
not_available What've you got? 
not_available Audio forensics cleaned up the recording.
not_available Walker is extraneous.
not_available Kill her before you get here.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be with you soon.
not_available Be quick about it.
not_available Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the prime minister.
not_available We've been combing through it, looking for a tag that'll give up their location.
not_available So far, nothing.
not_available Is there anybody else you can put on this? Larry, I don't think it's worth it.
not_available There's nothing here.
not_available All right.
not_available Fine.
not_available HelpJanis coordinate with N.S.A.
not_available I'm sorry about Renee, Larry.
not_available She was a good agent.
not_available We don't know that she's dead yet! All right? 
not_available All right.
not_available Just
not_available Are you sure this is it? She's gonna run out of air.
not_available Tony said near the backhoe.
not_available Here.
not_available I got her, Chloe.
not_available I got her.
not_available All right.
not_available Here she is.
not_available Here she is.
not_available She's not breathing.
not_available Give me the adrenaline.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You're okay.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available We're working with Jack.
not_available He told us where to find you.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available Take deep breaths.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available We're close to the rendezvous point.
not_available What's your E.T.A.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you then.
not_available It's all set.
not_available Nichols is on his way with the diamonds.
not_available Something bothering you, Jack? You know, I was wondering why you never told Tony how you got him out of C.T.U.
not_available How did you do it? Christopher Henderson.
not_available Christopher Henderson tried to kill him.
not_available Henderson had no intention of killing Tony.
not_available He purposely missed the artery when he injected him.
not_available It was just enough to slow his heart to the point where you'd think that he was dead.
not_available My job was to extract and revive him and use him against you.
not_available And? By the time I stabilized him, you'd already killed Henderson.
not_available The mission had failed, so my team went dark.
not_available Why didn't you just let Tony go? Tony chose to stay with us.
not_available He was consumed with hatred and anger over what the government had done to Michelle.
not_available Anyway, I talked to him.
not_available More importantly, I listened to him.
not_available Pretty soon, he came to realize that I was right.
not_available About what? That the rules had changed.
not_available That there was nothing such as honor left.
not_available That we would have to take care of each other.
not_available Like brothers.
not_available Mr.
not_available Emerson.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available We're almost there.
not_available How's the deal gonna go down? Don't worry, Jack.
not_available You're about to find out.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available Go help Litvak with the door.
not_available Go get the Matobos.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You better tell me what the hell's goin' on.
not_available Drop the gun, David.
not_available I just couldn't figure out your play so I tried to give you some time so you'd come clean.
not_available 'Cause we are like brothers, right, Tony? 
not_available Put the gun down, David.
not_available You actually think that I would let you steal those diamonds from me? It's not about the diamonds.
not_available It's about killing innocent people.
not_available I can't let you finish this.
not_available Take the shot.
not_available Put down the weapon, or I will kill him.
not_available Tony, take the shot! Shut up, Jack! 
not_available Put it down, or he's dead! David, I don't want to kill you, but I will! Damn it, Tony! Drop the
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available David? Okay, you say Bauer and Almeida are working undercover, but C.T.U.
not_available Has been shut down.
not_available So, I mean, if you're telling the truth, who's running this operation? We are.
not_available We're not working with any agency.
not_available We believe there's been widespread infiltration of the government by Dubaku and theJuma regime.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need to contact my boss.
not_available He needs to know that I'm okay.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Dubaku has informants in the F.B.I.
not_available If they found out you're alive, they'll know Jack is working against them.
not_available You don't know who you can trust.
not_available I can trust Agent Moss.
not_available You're not listening to me.
not_available You cannot contact the F.B.I.
not_available You will jeopardize this operation, and I won't let you do that.
not_available Well, I don't work for you.
not_available I work for Larry.
not_available Now, give me a phone.
not_available Sit still, please.
not_available We're nearing the endgame.
not_available Dubaku is the key to finding out who in the government has been corrupted.
not_available Luckily, we have something he wants.
not_available Matobo? He's our best chance to locate Dubaku, reacquire the C.I.P.
not_available Module and get to the bottom of the government corruption.
not_available Until all that happens, you have to stay dead.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Did you find Agent Walker? Yeah, we got her, Jack.
not_available She's fine.
not_available Where are you? Northwoods Airfield.
not_available Litvak is dead.
not_available Emerson's been wounded.
not_available Nichols is en route.
not_available I need you to get over here now.
not_available Have you talked to Matobo? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available He needs to agree to this.
not_available We can't do it without him.
not_available I'll get him to agree.
not_available Just get over here.
not_available It's all right.
not_available What the hell is going on? Mr.
not_available Matobo, I'm not gonna hurt you or your wife.
not_available I know how scared you are, and I know what you've been through, but we are here to help you.
not_available What in God's name are you talking about? You kidnapped us! We had to, to gain Dubaku's trust.
not_available That's the man we're after.
not_available We're trying to stop him.
not_available I want to call my people.
not_available I can't let you do that.
not_available Not until you hear me out.
not_available Sir, we have a plan to stop Dubaku, but we can't do it without your help.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available Please, come with me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Dubaku.
not_available I'm heading to the meeting place.
not_available They're bringing Matobo now.
not_available And his wife? 
not_available Both of them.
not_available Once you have Matobo, you know what to do.
not_available Emerson's team is now a loose end.
not_available Tie it off.
not_available Are you sure about this? We may need their services again.
not_available I would rather keep my diamonds.
not_available And Almeida has proved to be a liability.
not_available So any response from the White House? Not the one we wanted.
not_available American forces are still in position.
not_available President Taylor must know we have Matobo.
not_available She can't attack Sangala without him.
not_available The country would collapse.
not_available Taylor may be holding out hope that she can somehow retrieve Matobo.
not_available Or she doesn't believe we are willing to carry out our threats.
not_available She will only respond when there are dead Americans.
not_available I'll call you when I have Matobo.
not_available These gentlemen are at your command.
not_available There are still 1,300 planes in the air.
not_available Which region do you want targeted? Washington, D.C.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I understand, Bob.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That was Bob Cornell at N.S.A.
not_available They've detected another firewall breach.
not_available There's been another attack? Not yet, but they believe the C.I.P.
not_available Device is being utilized.
not_available We have to assume Dubaku is initiating another attack.
not_available It's safe to say this won't be another warning shot.
not_available This time, Dubaku's gonna make sure that people die.
not_available I want to speak personally with all first responders across the country.
not_available They need to know to brace for the worst and that they have our full support.
not_available Instead of preparing for it maybe we should be trying to preempt this attack, Madam President.
not_available The deadline Dubaku gave us for withdrawing our troops from Sangala has passed.
not_available But if we made some kind of gesture began an immediate pullback, it might keep Dubaku from pulling the trigger.
not_available We've discussed this, Ethan.
not_available It's not an option.
not_available I won't be dictated to by this madman.
not_available Madam President, we can't invade Sangala without Matobo.
not_available And there's very little chance ofhim being recovered.
not_available Why are we risking American lives? I've told you my reasons.
not_available I implore you, withdraw our forces before it's too late.
not_available You asked me to be your adviser because you trust my opinion.
not_available I'm givin' it to you now.
not_available We're out of options.
not_available We're not, Ethan.
not_available The N.S.A.
not_available Is attempting to localize what part of the infrastructure is being targeted and the F.B.I.
not_available Is still trying to track down the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available I'll keep an open channel with both agencies.
not_available I'll keep you apprised.
not_available Good.
not_available Let me see it.
not_available Let me see it! This wasn't about the diamonds, David.
not_available You crossed a line I wasn't willing to cross.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're looking for forgiveness.
not_available Go to hell.
not_available You live with it.
not_available You are asking us to risk our lives to be delivered into Dubaku's hands, based on nothing but what you have told us.
not_available Everything I have told you is the truth.
not_available Dubaku is in this country, and we need to find him.
not_available You have as much at stake as we do.
not_available He's attacked both our countries.
not_available Listen to him, Ule.
not_available You told me yourself President Taylor will not commit forces to Sangala until these attacks are stopped.
not_available But how can we trust this man? 
not_available Because he has no reason to lie.
not_available I will do what you ask, but I will go alone.
not_available Dubaku wants you and your wife.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available No.
not_available I will not put my wife in the hands of that monster.
not_available I will be honest with you, sir.
not_available He wants your wife as leverage.
not_available If I don't deliver both of you, he will back out.
not_available Leverage? You mean he want to torture her to make me tell him what I know about the resistance in Sangala? Yes, sir.
not_available And we won't let that happen.
not_available We'll be following you.
not_available Still, you can't promise me that she won't be harmed, can you? Can you? I won't do it.
not_available May I speak with my husband? 
not_available Of course, ma'am.
not_available I want to do this, Ule.
not_available What? I am ashamed that I opened the door to the safe room.
not_available I want to do what is right for our country.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available You can't stop me, Ule.
not_available Sangala is my country too.
not_available I have been by your side for 22 years.
not_available I am not going to leave it now.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available We will do this together.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You are both very brave.
not_available We'll need to go soon.
not_available Excuse me for one moment.
not_available Tony.
not_available The Matobos are gonna work with us.
not_available We've gotta go.
not_available Tony.
not_available Let's get the bodies out of sight.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're locked onto the F.A.A.
not_available Node.
not_available Begin rerouting the targets.
not_available R.S.A.
not_available 471, turn right, heading 27
not_available 4.
not_available Descend and maintain flight level 27
not_available 0.
not_available Call the White House.
not_available The latest report from the N.S.A.
not_available I can summarize it for you.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available They've had no luck in localizing the firewall breach.
not_available Dubaku's attack could hit anywhere.
not_available And what about the F.B.I.
not_available They've dedicated every available agent to the manhunt for Matobo.
not_available They're no closer to finding him.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We're at a dead end, Madam President.
not_available You need to order the pullback, and you need to order it now.
not_available Can it be traced? Yeah.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Madam President? What is it, Tim? I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.
not_available It's from Colonel Dubaku.
not_available He's demanding to speak with you.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available This is President Taylor.
not_available Madam President I'm disappointed that you have not taken my demands seriously.
not_available Your forces are still in position near my country.
not_available Colonel Dubaku, I assure you we've had very serious discussions regarding your demands.
not_available The time for discussions is over.
not_available The deadline for your forces to begin their withdrawal has passed.
not_available Go to the window.
not_available Look to the southwest, Madam President.
not_available What? 
not_available See what you have done.
not_available Colonel Dubaku, if you're endangering one American life
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Go, Madam President.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Comply with my demands within the hour or 10,000 more Americans will die.
not_available Is the cabinet still assembled? Yes, Madam President.
not_available It was Flight 131 out of Chicago.
not_available It collided with a small commuterjet carrying 21 people.
not_available There's also a high probability of casualties on the ground.
not_available The aircraft went down in a residential neighborhood near Edgeborough.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We've also just gotten word that Congressman Brighten and his wife may have been on 131.
not_available We're waiting for confirmation.
not_available How many planes are still in the air? Over 1,300.
not_available Madam President, this is a catastrophic loss of American lives.
not_available It's only gonna get worse.
not_available We have to withdraw our forces before the next deadline.
not_available I'm forced to agree, Madam President.
not_available Go ahead, Tim.
not_available I want to hear what you think.
not_available We're simply not prepared to contend with the scope of damage these people can inflict.
not_available The tragedy we just witnessed is nothing compared to what could happen if they begin targeting more sensitive installations
not_available power grids, nuclear facilities.
not_available We're talking deaths in the hundreds of thousands.
not_available All in support of a policy that cannot possibly succeed without Matobo.
not_available He is the only man who can stabilize Sangala.
not_available Without him, the entire operation is pointless.
not_available There's still a chance that Prime Minister Matobo will be recovered.
not_available And while that chance exists, I'm not giving in.
not_available Admiral Smith, your strike force will remain in position and at full battle readiness.
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available You are guaranteeing another attack on our country.
not_available We will not be blackmailed, Joe, and we will not be held hostage.
not_available This country does not negotiate with terrorists.
not_available Tell that to the families of the dead.
not_available Do you have any idea what the public reaction will be when word gets out that these are acts of terrorism brought about by your reckless foreign policy? I can guarantee there will be a call for your impeachment.
not_available That's enough, Joe.
not_available I will not stand by and let this happen.
not_available Then turn in your resignation, Joe, because I'm not changing my mind.
not_available Now sit down or leave.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm sorry, Madam President.
not_available You people think about what you're doing here about the price you're willing to pay.
not_available Gentlemen, ladies.
not_available I know that there are many of you here who agree with Secretary Stevens.
not_available If I can't alleviate your doubts I can at least help you to understand my reasonings.
not_available When I took the oath of office I swore to myself and to the American people that this country would continue to be a force for good in this world.
not_available We're a nation founded on ideals and those ideals are being challenged today.
not_available Now, how we respond will not only define this administration, but an entire generation.
not_available And not just Americans but Sangalans and anyone else who looks to us for guidance and strength.
not_available I won't fail them and neither will you.
not_available We're in for some tough times ahead.
not_available Let's make sure we're ready.
not_available Thank you, everyone.
not_available Rescue teams continue at this time.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available They're over there.
not_available I want you to put a wire on Mr.
not_available Matobo as fast as you can.
not_available Go.
not_available You okay? What do you think, Jack? You shot me and buried me alive.
not_available If we hadn't, Emerson would've killed you.
not_available I'm sorry we had to keep you in the dark, but we didn't have a choice.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available You could've trusted me.
not_available If I had told you everything back at the F.B.I., would you have believed me? Have a seat please, sir.
not_available What's that? It's a transmitter.
not_available I'll be affixing it to one of your teeth.
not_available We'll know exactly where you are at all times.
not_available You won't be alone.
not_available Are you with the F.B.I.
not_available No.
not_available I'm a stayat
not_available home mom.
not_available Open your mouth, please.
not_available Wider.
not_available Good.
not_available Chloe accessed the F.B.I.
not_available Server.
not_available Dubaku brought down two planes just outside the capitol.
not_available Over 270 people were killed.
not_available He's threatened to kill 10,000 more.
not_available We have less than an hour to stop him.
not_available How long before Nichols gets here? 
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available Here's your comm.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just a little dizzy.
not_available You should take a seat.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Is all of this really true? Yeah.
not_available I've devoted my life to the Bureau and you expect me to believe it's corrupted, the entire government's been corrupted? Not all of'em.
not_available But until we find out who, we can't trust anyone.
not_available The four of you really think you can stop this? 
not_available We have to.
not_available It's as simple as that.
not_available Ethan.
not_available Can we? The president is completely alone on this, and she's gonna get a lot of Americans killed.
not_available We've gotta find a way to talk some sense into her.
not_available We're both on the same side, Tim.
not_available I'm gonna need your help if we're gonna change her mind.
not_available How do you propose we do that? There is someone she'll listen to.
not_available Maybe we can convince him to help us.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I just dropped her off.
not_available She's on her way up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stay in the car and keep watch.
not_available I'll call you when it's done.
not_available Oh! Mr.
not_available Taylor, how did you get in here? Um, the agent you sent just brought me by to get a few of my things before we
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor, are you all right? Mr.
not_available Taylor, are you okay? Mr.
not_available Taylor, unless you tell me what's wrong, I don't know what
not_available Help me.
not_available Help me, please.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available Kanin? 
not_available Agent Gedge, I'm looking for Henry Taylor.
not_available He's not answering his phone.
not_available Is he with you? 
not_available You can't talk with him right now, sir.
not_available Why not? Where is he? Well, he's meeting with Samantha Roth in her apartment, sir.
not_available For what possible reason? 
not_available Well, I don't know, sir.
not_available He didn't tell me.
not_available Why aren't you with him? Mr.
not_available Taylor insisted on meeting with her alone, sir.
not_available I'm in the car.
not_available I'm just outside the building.
not_available I don't give a damn what he insisted.
not_available We went through this, Agent Gedge.
not_available You were supposed to keep him away from her.
not_available What the hell were you thinking? 
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available I'm not interested in your apology.
not_available Just pull him out of there and have him phone me as soon as possible.
not_available Don't try to speak, sir.
not_available There's nothing left to say.
not_available Additional rescue teams have been brought in to join the emergency teams
not_available We are ready.
not_available All right.
not_available They're coming.
not_available One car, from the service road.
not_available How many people? 
not_available I can't tell.
not_available The windows are tinted.
not_available Copy that.
not_available How you doin', Tony? 
not_available All right.
not_available I was glad to hear you're still with us.
not_available Where's Emerson? 
not_available You're not gonna be dealing with him today.
not_available What do you mean? He's dead.
not_available So's Litvak and Bauer.
not_available I got 'em in a back room.
not_available You wanna say hi? You better start telling me what the hell is going on.
not_available I decided I'd rather not split the cut.
not_available Well, I don't understand.
not_available I thought you and Emerson were friends.
not_available Yeah, that's before he left me to rot with the F.B.I.
not_available You want Matobo or not? Where is he? 
not_available Close.
not_available I want to see him and his wife.
not_available Diamonds.
not_available Matobo.
not_available He's in the back of the truck.
not_available Keep your tracks clean.
not_available We might call on you again.
not_available All right? Okay then.
not_available Let's put that behind us.
not_available You got what you want.
not_available Now get the hell out of here.
not_available Now! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Chloe? 
not_available Jack, I've got him.
not_available Get everyone ready to move out.
not_available Gedge.
not_available Gedge.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Please.
not_available There has been no comment from the White House but the incident's proximity to the Executive Mansion has lead to widespread speculation that terrorists were indeed responsible for the midair collision that caused the deaths of 270 passengers and crew and an unknown number
not_available The White House still has not complied.
not_available American forces are still in position.
not_available I think this president is not just stubborn.
not_available She's insane.
not_available What do you intend to do? 
not_available Exactly what we promised.
not_available We're ready, sir.
not_available I'll see you in a moment.
not_available Where is the target located? 
not_available Kidron, Ohio.
not_available Population? 
not_available 30,000.
not_available The processing facility is located two miles west of the town center.
not_available Casualties will be high
not_available about 18,000.
not_available Begin.
