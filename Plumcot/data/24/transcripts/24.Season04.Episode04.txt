not_available <ix>In three hours, Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity.</ix> <ix>If he is proven guilty, he will be executed in accordance with our laws.</ix> When the trial begins, you may have an opportunity to escape.
not_available You have to take it, even if it's dangerous.
not_available When Dad told me to take the briefcase to Omar, Debbie followed me.
not_available Debbie saw the warehouse where we're holding Heller? Yes.
not_available Father found out and he wants me to get her over here.
not_available You know what that means.
not_available Debbie, thank you for coming.
not_available Sure.
not_available I need you to build a firewall around station four.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Marianne.
not_available I want to make sure she doesn't stray from her area.
not_available Fine.
not_available Listen.
not_available The terrorists will try and execute Heller in less than three hours.
not_available Bring him in.
not_available I don't think that's the right call.
not_available I believe that they'll lead me to Heller and the kidnappers.
not_available Jack Bauer is no longer cooperating with this investigation.
not_available All departments need to work on the capture of Jack Bauer and the hostile he's tracking.
not_available Our first priority is to find these terrorists.
not_available I'll need satellite surveillance to track them.
not_available You want me to steal satellite bandwidth from CTU.
not_available Yes.
not_available Will I have satellite coverage in the next minute or two? <ix>It'll take at least five.</ix> I'm gonna have to figure out a way to keep this guy here.
not_available Keep working on it.
not_available Everybody put your hands up now! You, don't move.
not_available Slowly move back to the corner.
not_available Everybody, just stay calm.
not_available We'll be out of here before you know it.
not_available You, hop up on the counter, black out that camera.
not_available Anybody else working in the back? Put your hands up.
not_available Move over there with the others.
not_available Now! <ix>Do you have the IDs of the other two?</ix> 
not_available If I did, I'd tell you.
not_available <ix>I'll keep you updated.</ix> 
not_available Thank you, yeah.
not_available Please do.
not_available Briefing in five minutes.
not_available County just reported that Andrew Paige was taken into their ER.
not_available Paige? The programmer Jack went to pick up? That's not all.
not_available The bodies of two unidentified Middle Eastern men were found at the site.
not_available Gunshot wounds.
not_available Bauer must have done that to save the kid.
not_available Where did they find all this? 
not_available Moorpark.
not_available It's out of control.
not_available We lose an agent and a witness has been disabled.
not_available What about the hostile and Bauer? 
not_available Still at large.
not_available Erin, we've less than three hours before Heller's executed in front of the country.
not_available Maybe we shouldn't concentrate on Bauer, pursue other leads.
not_available Except for Heller's son, we have no other leads.
not_available I want all tactical teams working on finding Bauer and the hostile.
not_available You got it.
not_available Keep moving back towards the corner.
not_available Move! 
not_available Everybody get down.
not_available Lady, get down.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Shut up.
not_available You wanna get through this, you listen to me.
not_available Get down on the floor now.
not_available I want your wallets and your cell phones.
not_available Make it quick.
not_available Where's yours? 
not_available I don't have one.
not_available Where's your cell phone? What's this? You some kind of cop? 
not_available No.
not_available What do you need this for? 
not_available Protection.
not_available I get my money, no one gets hurt.
not_available Do I make myself clear? You, in the cap, what's your name? 
not_available Doug.
not_available Doug, give me your keys.
not_available Which one of these opens the front door? Which one? The brass one.
not_available There's an electrical problem.
not_available We're closed.
not_available I just need a pack of cigarettes.
not_available I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go to the gas station across the street.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is the satellite up yet? No, I have to reposition without Driscoll noticing.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm in a Mercury Mart.
not_available I staged a robbery.
not_available What? It was the only way to stop him getting back on the road.
not_available How long? 
not_available It's gonna take ten minutes.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Please hurry.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Chloe, Driscoll's called a briefing.
not_available I'll be there in a couple minutes.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Now.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available To a briefing.
not_available Should I be in that? 
not_available No.
not_available Hi, I'm Marianne.
not_available I'm helping out today.
not_available OK.
not_available And you are? This is Chloe O'Brian, our senior sys tech.
not_available She doesn't have time to chat either, Marianne.
not_available It's nice to meet you, Chloe.
not_available As some of you know, about an hour ago a hostile abducted a witness, Andrew Paige.
not_available Do we know where this hostile is? 
not_available No, but we have a general direction of travel.
not_available County Emergency Services called this in.
not_available His best route of escape is the freeway.
not_available He'll likely dump his vehicle and try to hijack another one.
not_available This is Andrew Paige.
not_available He was apparently tortured and about to be killed when it seems Jack Bauer intervened.
not_available If this took place in the last half
not_available hour, and the hostile continued east, he's somewhere in northeast Ventura County.
not_available We'll coordinate with Caltrans and Ventura sheriffs to set up watch points.
not_available I want every resource on this.
not_available Edgar, lead satellite positioning.
not_available Sarah, you'll coordinate with NSA.
not_available That's all.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Chloe.
not_available I'm sorry about Andrew.
not_available They said there's a good chance that he'll pull through.
not_available Thanks.
not_available And, Chloe, there's nothing you could have done.
not_available I want you to put a pipe into Chloe's system.
not_available What for? 
not_available She knew about Paige.
not_available How do you know? Her reactions.
not_available Which means she's been in touch with Jack Bauer.
not_available Well, I'll need her access code.
not_available Doug, get over here now! Open the safe.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why don't you take it and leave? I
not_available I won't tell the police.
not_available When does the armored truck come? About 12:30.
not_available What, you want to rob the armored truck too? Shut up.
not_available Get back in the corner.
not_available Move! He's gonna keep us here another two hours? We have to do something to stop him.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Something is wrong.
not_available Kalil is not answering his phone.
not_available Maybe he's out of range.
not_available No, not for this long.
not_available Check with our people in the area.
not_available Find out if anything has happened to him.
not_available Kalil may not be here in time.
not_available We'll have to boot up the routers without him.
not_available Take care of it.
not_available Let my daughter go.
not_available You don't need her.
not_available She has already been useful.
not_available Please.
not_available I'll do whatever you want.
not_available I know you will.
not_available That's why we are keeping her.
not_available I don't care if you kill me, but if you kill her, even your own people will see you as a barbaric pig.
not_available Is this what your religion teaches you? 
not_available Dad, Dad, calm down.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Where's your medication? Your nitroglycerine, where is it? I left it in the car.
not_available My father has a heart condition.
not_available He needs his medication.
not_available Has Chloe been in contact with Bauer? 
not_available No.
not_available Keep watching.
not_available This is Edgar Stiles.
not_available Edgar, it's Chloe.
not_available Why you calling me? 
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Meet me at Archives.
not_available When? 
not_available Now.
not_available Why are we meeting like this? 
not_available I need you to help me.
not_available With what? 
not_available I think Sarah piped into my system.
not_available Why? Driscoll must have asked her to.
not_available If Driscoll's spying on you, she must have a reason.
not_available I'm not getting involved.
not_available I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.
not_available What? 
not_available That's right.
not_available So either help me or turn me in.
not_available I'm turning you in.
not_available Jack can find Heller.
not_available Driscoll won't let him.
not_available That's her call.
not_available She's wrong.
not_available That's your opinion.
not_available These decisions are not ours to make.
not_available How about if you do it as a favor to me? How many times have I helped you since you started here? A lot.
not_available What about the first two weeks when I did all your work because you were nervous? You owe me.
not_available This could get me fired.
not_available Not if I say I ordered you to do it.
not_available Remember, I outrank you.
not_available I'd take the heat.
not_available What do I have to do? I need to reposition a satellite and I need to do it now.
not_available Since Sarah's piping my system we have to use yours.
not_available OK.
not_available Send it to Archives Three.
not_available I've transferred my calls there.
not_available I want to know who's in charge here.
not_available I want to speak to the man who was just in here.
not_available You'll speak to him later.
not_available No, now.
not_available I am the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America.
not_available You will listen to me.
not_available Dad, don't make it worse.
not_available What do you mean? What can be worse than waiting here to be murdered by these lawless, godless thugs? 
not_available Dad, calm down.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available Don't tell me to calm down.
not_available We're here, OK? The best we can do is hope that someone comes and Hope? Hope that we get rescued? We have to do something.
not_available We have to take Argh! Argh! Dad, what is it? What's happening? Dad, just OK, take a deep breath.
not_available Help me.
not_available I think he's having a heart attack.
not_available Dad, you've gotta lie down.
not_available Just lie down.
not_available Dad, are you listening? It's OK.
not_available He's coming.
not_available Step back.
not_available Step away from him.
not_available We need to lie him down, please.
not_available Hurry, you've got to get him 
not_available Step away.
not_available Go on.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available You still with me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Go back! Go back! Put your weapon down.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Both of you, hands on your head.
not_available If another one of my men dies, your daughter will be killed.
not_available How many men come with the truck? 
not_available Two.
not_available One by the door.
not_available One takes the money.
not_available They park in the front or the back? 
not_available In the front, by the street.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Everybody up, we're moving to the back of the store.
not_available Now! 
not_available Stand there.
not_available The longer you keep us Shut up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You try that again and I will kill you.
not_available You understand me? Get up.
not_available Now! Move to the back of the store.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Everybody in the freezer.
not_available Now.
not_available Not you.
not_available Move.
not_available Anybody makes a sound, I kill all of you.
not_available Doug, you in there? 
not_available Make him go away.
not_available Sorry, I didn't hear you.
not_available I was in the back.
not_available How come you're closed? 
not_available I'm taking inventory.
not_available In the middle of the day? Yeah.
not_available OK, then.
not_available You're sure everything's all right? 
not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available You don't look fine, Doug.
not_available I'm just a little tired.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You mind if I use the head? It's broken.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available Are you gonna tell me, or do I have to see for myself? Don't even think about it.
not_available Step inside now.
not_available Move.
not_available Grab the counter.
not_available Doug, lock the door.
not_available Give me your keys.
not_available Go over there and get me his gun and his radio.
not_available Move.
not_available Come on.
not_available Take out his cuffs.
not_available Officer, put your hands behind your back.
not_available Cuff him.
not_available Go back to the freezer.
not_available Let's go.
not_available <ix>At this time we have no more information</ix> <ix>regarding the kidnapping of Secretary of Defense Heller</ix> <ix>and his daughter, Audrey, other than the image you are now seeing</ix> My husband and I realize we've been unfair to you.
not_available We've treated you as badly as we have been treated ourselves by certain ignorant people.
not_available Well it was pretty obvious you didn't approve of us going out.
not_available Is that OK to say? 
not_available Yeah, it's OK.
not_available Well, we hope you'll accept our apology.
not_available That means a lot to me.
not_available That said, there is something else I want to discuss with you.
not_available What's that? This morning you followed Behrooz to his father's warehouse.
not_available Oh.
not_available Um I thought Behrooz was seeing someone else.
not_available I got jealous.
not_available Oh, I understand, but Mr.
not_available Araz moved his inventory there because he's been robbed a few times and we've been trying to keep that place secret so it doesn't happen again.
not_available I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.
not_available Good.
not_available And you haven't told anyone yet? No.
not_available I haven't talked to anyone but Behrooz today.
not_available Well, then, that's settled.
not_available Thank you for inviting me here, Mrs.
not_available Araz.
not_available It's my pleasure.
not_available Has Behrooz ever shown you pictures from when he was a child? No.
not_available Show her, Behrooz.
not_available Have a look at these.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available That's not you.
not_available Hm.
not_available It is.
not_available You were so cute.
not_available Hm.
not_available Thank you, Hana.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Have you been following this, Mr.
not_available Araz? 
not_available <ix>Secretary of Defense James Heller</ix> Yes.
not_available It's horrible.
not_available It makes it so difficult when people from home do these unspeakable things.
not_available I agree.
not_available Yes.
not_available The girl didn't tell anyone.
not_available <ix>Are you sure?</ix> 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available It'll be taken care of, then? 
not_available Soon.
not_available Have Behrooz do it.
not_available He created this problem, he should solve it himself.
not_available I agree.
not_available I'll call you when it's done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available <ix>Two Charles Nine, there's a 211 in progress at 2221 Mill Road, cross street Cedar.</ix> <ix>Two males seen leaving the bank with shotguns.
not_available Respond code three.</ix> <ix>Two Charles Nine, do you copy?</ix> Stand back from the door! 
not_available Step back.
not_available <ix>Do you copy?</ix> 
not_available You.
not_available Are you unit nine? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You tell them you're on your way.
not_available One wrong word and I will kill you.
not_available Now.
not_available Two Charles Nine Help! We're being robbed! <ix>We have help on the way.</ix> 
not_available Get up.
not_available Now! 
not_available Now would be the time to let us go.
not_available Shut up.
not_available These people are your responsibility.
not_available You better start talking to them.
not_available Sarah.
not_available Has Chloe had any contact with Bauer yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Could her work be on his behalf? 
not_available No.
not_available I've been watching her system.
not_available Chloe is not stupid.
not_available Assume she's taken measures to protect herself.
not_available Maybe she's coopted the help of someone else inside.
not_available I'm not quite sure how much of my time you want me to devote to this.
not_available I expect you to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.
not_available Chloe's loyal to Bauer.
not_available There's a good chance she's helping him.
not_available Find out how.
not_available What are you doing? That looks like a satellite.
not_available It was.
not_available I mean it is.
not_available A satellite for what? 
not_available We're trying to find Bauer.
not_available Division's doing that.
not_available I'm just going over it.
not_available Sometimes they miss data.
not_available Do they know that you're doing that? 
not_available Yeah, they know what I'm doing.
not_available Here, call them if you don't believe me.
not_available Relax.
not_available I don't have to call anybody.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available I will.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available There's a chance that Jack might try to contact Chloe.
not_available If you see or hear anything, call me, OK? Why would Jack try to contact Chloe? 
not_available He just might.
not_available Let me know.
not_available Sure.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available <ix>Edgar, what did she want?</ix> She wants to nail you to the wall.
not_available Remember our deal.
not_available If you get caught, you don't take me with you.
not_available And if I get caught, you say you ordered me to do this.
not_available You don't have to repeat the deal.
not_available Did you reposition the satellite? I'm working on it.
not_available Leave me alone.
not_available No.
not_available We'll use our own people for that.
not_available Hang on, Ed.
not_available Yes, what is it? <ix>Your daughter's on line two.</ix> 
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Tell her I'll call her back.
not_available <ix>She says it's important.</ix> Fine.
not_available Ed, I'm gonna have to get back to you.
not_available OK, bye.
not_available Maya? 
not_available I need you to come home.
not_available <ix>What's wrong?</ix> 
not_available I'm having a bad day.
not_available Have you been taking your medication? 
not_available No.
not_available If you don't take it you're going to feel bad.
not_available It numbs me.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available Do you like feeling like this better? 
not_available Come home.
not_available I can't, Maya.
not_available Why not? Listen.
not_available I want you to take the pills and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
not_available You promise? 
not_available Of course.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available I'll take my pills.
not_available Good.
not_available Do you love me? 
not_available You know I do.
not_available Then why don't you say it? I love you, Maya, OK? 
not_available I do.
not_available OK.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Behrooz, can I see you for a moment? Yes.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I talked to your father.
not_available We both agree you have to be the one who'll take care of this.
not_available She didn't tell anyone.
not_available We're fortunate that's the case, but she still saw the warehouse, and she could tell the authorities about it if she's ever brought in for questioning.
not_available This is riskier than letting her live.
not_available If she disappears, her mother will call the police.
not_available By the time this day is over, the police will be too busy to look for a runaway girl.
not_available Now, take it.
not_available Don't make me bring your father into this.
not_available Just take her to the basement and do it.
not_available Don't think about it.
not_available Get it over with.
not_available Behrooz? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Everything OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I want to make a copy of this one.
not_available Can I take it home and scan it? Sure.
not_available We need to get out of here.
not_available You're in danger.
not_available From who? 
not_available Don't ask questions, just come with me.
not_available What? Behrooz? Trust me, Debbie.
not_available We're OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available I can't.
not_available Why not? What's wrong? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Answer me, Debbie.
not_available What's wrong? Come on, Debbie.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Get up, Debbie.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Please help me.
not_available What's wrong? Debbie, come on.
not_available Debbie, what's wrong? What did you do to her? 
not_available I didn't expect you to be able to do it.
not_available Debbie.
not_available Debbie.
not_available Come on, Debbie.
not_available Debbie! Give me the gun.
not_available Give me the gun.
not_available Hey! I am so disappointed in you.
not_available Yeah? <ix>This is Sergeant McGrath.
not_available You're surrounded.</ix> You should know that I've got hostages.
not_available I will kill them if you use tear gas and send your men in.
not_available Let's not go there yet, OK? Who do you have in there? The owner, two men and a woman.
not_available What about Officer Dotson? 
not_available Yeah, I got him too.
not_available <ix>You only need one hostage.
not_available Keep Officer Dotson and let the others go.</ix> I need to think about that.
not_available <ix>Yeah?</ix> 
not_available I've got satellite coverage.
not_available OK, good.
not_available The suspect will be free in five minutes.
not_available He'll be on foot on Route 11.
not_available I'll find him.
not_available One of you is coming with me.
not_available You.
not_available Come here.
not_available Put your hands up against the rack.
not_available Now! Everybody else, to the back of the cooler.
not_available Move! Open the door.
not_available Lock the door with the chain.
not_available Now, I will let you go as soon as we are clear.
not_available If you try and be a hero, I'll kill you.
not_available Understand? 
not_available I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Which car is yours? 
not_available The blue Lexus.
not_available Unlock the door.
not_available Move.
not_available Tell those officers to put their weapons down and step back.
not_available OK.
not_available We'll try and help you through this.
not_available Tell them to do it now! 
not_available OK, drop your weapons and move back.
not_available Stand back! 
not_available <ix>Do it.
not_available Step back.</ix> Get into the car.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Come on, open the driver's door.
not_available If you try and follow me, I will shoot him.
not_available On my count, get in.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Move.
not_available Go! Go! Call in a roadblock.
not_available Suspect driving east on Route 11.
not_available One hostage.
not_available Move the rear
not_available view mirror to the right so I can see out the back.
not_available There.
not_available When do you let me go? 
not_available When I feel like it.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available What do you mean? You don't seem like you need to rob a Mercury Mart.
not_available That Mercury Mart was a money drop.
not_available There was supposed to be 18 grand in that safe.
not_available How did you know that? We're done sharing.
not_available I'll not forget your face and I've got your license.
not_available You talk to the police, it's not gonna be hard to find you.
not_available Do you understand me? I won't tell them a thing.
not_available OK, pull over here.
not_available Now! Get out of the car.
not_available Move! Start running.
not_available Now! O'Brian.
not_available <ix>You got him?</ix> 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Download his position to my PDA.
not_available Stay reachable.
not_available I will.
not_available I'm sorry, could you repeat that? Hold on a second.
not_available Ms Driscoll.
not_available Yes, Sarah? You have a phone call from your neighbor.
not_available A George Kliavkoff.
not_available It's about your daughter.
not_available What line? 
not_available Six.
not_available It's Erin.
not_available There's been another incident with Maya.
not_available What's happened? She came into the back yard and started screaming at Evan again.
not_available Is Evan OK? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Fortunately I was home.
not_available But this is the end.
not_available I've got to protect my boy.
not_available Did you call the police? 
not_available Yes.
not_available They're on their way.
not_available Where's Maya now? <ix>She went back to your house.</ix> 
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available This will not happen again.
not_available It can't, Erin.
not_available Ms Driscoll? Is everything all right? No, it's not.
not_available Is there anything I can do to help? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Call LAPD Westside and find out who they dispatched to pick up my daughter.
not_available She has a condition.
not_available She suffers from schizophrenia.
not_available There was an incident with one of my neighbors.
not_available What would you like me to do? Tell the officers to cancel the call.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Yeah, I don't think that's possible.
not_available They have to follow through.
not_available CTU has pre
not_available emptive privilege over local.
not_available Only in a national security situation.
not_available Sarah, I'm asking you to do something.
not_available Should I ask someone else? No.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Send a unit over to my house.
not_available One medic, one field agent.
not_available Bring Maya back to our clinic.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I found Jack Bauer.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Somis.
not_available He's tracking the hostile.
not_available Now he's using satellite.
not_available How do you know that? DOD complained that someone was stealing bandwidth.
not_available I took a look at the imagery and found him.
not_available All right.
not_available Bring them both in.
not_available Who logged on to that satellite? Chloe.
not_available Chloe, why are you logged on to an active DOD satellite? 
not_available All right, you're done here.
not_available Whatever.
