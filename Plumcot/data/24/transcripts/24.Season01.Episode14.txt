
not_available Right now terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter are in danger and people that I work with may be involved in both.
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
not_available And this is the longest day of my life.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you all right? Who's in this chopper? 
not_available Just Jack and his family.
not_available The prisoners are in another transport.
not_available Are you hurt? No.
not_available My stomach's been bothering me for a couple of hours.
not_available Sweetheart, did something happen there? Sweetheart, did something happen there? No.
not_available It's probably just from all the stress, honey.
not_available They called ahead.
not_available There's an ambulance to take you both to a clinic where a doctor will examine you.
not_available Can't we stay with you? 
not_available No, I've got to stay here at CTU.
not_available Jack.
not_available Alberta, this is my wife, Teri, and my daughter, Kim.
not_available Hi.
not_available Thanks, Nina.
not_available The ambulance will take them to the clinic.
not_available Good.
not_available You'll go with Agent Scott.
not_available He'll take care of anything you need.
not_available Jack, what's going to happen with you? 
not_available It's all right.
not_available They'll just debrief me.
not_available Hey, come here.
not_available Call them in, give them an ETA.
not_available Give us five minutes.
not_available Don't worry, okay? I'll call you as soon as I can.
not_available We'll be doing more than debriefing you, Jack.
not_available I have to place you under house arrest.
not_available You'll be held here and questioned until we hand you over to the FBI.
not_available Nina.
not_available I want you to watch over Teri and Kim.
not_available Make sure they're okay.
not_available Green's got me doing mop
not_available up on the operation.
not_available Get Tony to do it.
not_available Just get over to the clinic.
not_available I have to get Green's approval.
not_available Nina, please.
not_available Contact District.
not_available Tell them we have him in custody.
not_available All right, I'll take care of it.
not_available Could you ask them for some water? Right away, sir.
not_available Alberta.
not_available Tony's finishing the procedures and the mop
not_available up.
not_available I've been here since before midnight.
not_available I'd like an hour off, go home, clean up.
not_available Denied.
not_available Come on, Alberta, please? I've been through hell today.
not_available One thing I have a great eye for is B.<br>S.
not_available If you want an hour off, tell me where you're going.
not_available Jack asked me to look after Teri and Kim.
not_available They're feeling a little isolated since he can't be there.
not_available There's an irony for you.
not_available You looking after Jack's wife.
not_available Make sure Tony's got everything he needs before you leave.
not_available Elizabeth, have we heard from Christopher yet? Yes, but he only had early projections and those were from New York and Massachusetts.
not_available Get with me when he has the numbers from the other states.
not_available I want to know If the Incident at the breakfast Is hurting us.
not_available Of course.
not_available This is not what I asked for.
not_available What's on your mind, Sherry? You've got to go out there today with your best face on.
not_available There can be no talk about Keith and no talk about Ferragamo.
not_available Ferragamo's death was an accident.
not_available I'm not going to talk about Ferragamo.
not_available I'm dropping it.
not_available Really? I'm being blackmailed.
not_available By who? By some of the people that have been financing my campaign.
not_available What do they want? They're determined to see me in the White House and if I don't do what they want they say they can build a first
not_available degree murder case against Keith.
not_available For Lyle Gibson? 
not_available No.
not_available For Dr.
not_available Ferragamo.
not_available No.
not_available Keith was nowhere near Ferragamo's office today.
not_available According to Carl, who's been doing all their dirty work someone planted evidence that could implicate Keith in Ferragamo's murder.
not_available No, David.
not_available This is what happens when you cover things up.
not_available Don't preach to me, David, okay? What are we going to do? I don't know yet.
not_available Does Keith know anything? 
not_available No.
not_available And he's not going to.
not_available You must be Teri.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Kent.
not_available We're going to be taking very good care of you today.
not_available This is your daughter, Kim? 
not_available Hi.
not_available We were alerted to your abdominal pain.
not_available I'd like to get an ultrasound.
not_available It's actually not as painful as it was before.
not_available That's good.
not_available But we want to make sure we know what It Is.
not_available Is there any other discomfort? Anything you want to tell us before we examine you? No.
not_available Mom? Mrs.
not_available Bauer? I was raped.
not_available I see.
not_available Okay.
not_available Then we're going to need to draw blood and do some tests and I would like to recommend you to one of our psychiatrists.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Bauer, you can do what you want but under the circumstances It's Important for you to take a few minutes and speak to someone.
not_available I'd like to keep this confidential.
not_available The records are private.
not_available Only the doctors involved have access.
not_available I mean, from my husband.
not_available All right, if that's what you want to do.
not_available A nurse will be in shortly.
not_available We should spend some time with Senators Blalock and Gleeson pretty soon.
not_available I don't feel comfortable aligning myself with those guys.
not_available You're going to need their states.
not_available Just being seen with them will go a long way.
not_available Okay.
not_available Was there something else you wanted to discuss? I'm worried this Ferragamo thing is not going to go away.
not_available Let me handle the Ferragamo situation, Mike.
not_available You just make sure the rest of the day gets back on track.
not_available Did I hear you say something about Dr.
not_available Ferragamo? 
not_available There was a fire in his office.
not_available I'll get on this.
not_available Thanks, Mike.
not_available Dad, what are you Keith, I'm sorry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ferragamo died.
not_available When? About an hour ago.
not_available We just found out.
not_available Wait, I don't get it.
not_available What kind of fire? We're still waiting to hear the details.
not_available What's going on? Are you saying that my psychiatrist Dr.
not_available Ferragamo, was involved in this? That he told Maureen Kingsley something I said to him during a session? Is that how this whole story about Lyle Gibson started? Seems that way.
not_available But he died in a fire an hour ago? It was an accident.
not_available No, I don't believe this.
not_available Keith, look 
not_available We have to let it go right now.
not_available Let it go? No, you mean cover it up.
not_available There's nothing to cover up.
not_available Sure there is.
not_available Somebody didn't want him to talk about this because it'll hurt your campaign.
not_available What do you want me to do? Go to the police.
not_available I can't.
not_available I don't get it, Dad.
not_available What were you saying before about trusting the system? I do trust the system.
not_available When my hind parts are on the line.
not_available But when it comes to your campaign My campaign's been on the line ever since you lied to me about Lyle Gibson.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You've been on me all night to keep quiet about Gibson's death.
not_available This isn't about Lyle Gibson anymore, is it? I might have been Involved In Gibson's death but somebody murdered Dr.
not_available Ferragamo and they have to pay.
not_available Keith He meant something to me.
not_available That's right.
not_available I was in real pain and Dr.
not_available Ferragamo was the only one there for me.
not_available So we're not going to pretend Iike this thing never happened, okay? Keith 
not_available You don't know how I was.
not_available I wouldn't have made it without him.
not_available Just give me a little time.
not_available Let me get to the bottom of what happened.
not_available If there was foul play I promise you, we'll come forward.
not_available Why can't we come forward now? 
not_available Because we can't.
not_available Son.
not_available I love you.
not_available You have to know I'm doing what's best for you.
not_available You have to know It.
not_available Afternoon, Tony.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chappelle.
not_available Looks like they're bringing in the big guns.
not_available What do you think they're going to do to Jack? Not going to name a street after him.
not_available He's in Holding 2.
not_available All right, thank you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available Ryan, it's good to see you.
not_available I've got five priority cases on my desk this morning.
not_available Your name's on all of them.
not_available I can imagine that.
not_available Look, I just want to say 
not_available Hang on.
not_available You were saying? At approximately 12:15 I got a phone call from Agent Nina Myers telling me to assemble the team at CTU District Manager Walsh Where's Teri Bauer? I don't know.
not_available Who are you with? FBI.
not_available And you? CTU.
not_available Waiting for the rest of my debrief team.
not_available We're going to interrogate some of the prisoners they're bringing to the clinic.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available I'm with CTU.
not_available Where's Teri Bauer? 
not_available She was moved to Room 7.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Teri? 
not_available There you are.
not_available Nina.
not_available I didn't know you were going to be here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hi, Kim.
not_available We didn't officially meet.
not_available I'm Nina Myers.
not_available I work with your dad.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm so glad the two of you are okay.
not_available I'm here until you're done.
not_available If you need anything, I'll be in the waiting room.
not_available Nina? What's happening with Jack? He's being questioned.
not_available Is he in trouble? 
not_available That depends.
not_available He broke a few laws last night but he was doing It to save you so I think they'll understand.
not_available If he doesn't piss them off first.
not_available My thoughts exactly.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available I guess you know Jack just about as well as I do.
not_available I'm sending someone to your house to pick up some clean clothes.
not_available What's going to happen when we get released? Why can't we just go home? Until we know what happened, we want to take precautions to keep you safe.
not_available When do we get to see my dad? I don't know.
not_available A lot of things have to happen first.
not_available Some people are going to want to talk to you.
not_available Division, Secret Service, us.
not_available Because you see, this wasn't a simple crime.
not_available This was a terrorist conspiracy, and you were In the middle of It.
not_available But that's over now.
not_available Nina, wait.
not_available Yeah? I don't know all the details, but I understand you're a big part of the reason why we're still alive.
not_available So thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll be out here.
not_available Close this area down.
not_available There's so much going on all the time.
not_available We have radiology.
not_available The pharmacy Is on the other end.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Nina Myers, CTU.
not_available Is that man FBI? Hold on.
not_available Yeah, he's with me.
not_available He was in 3 earlier.
not_available I'd like to speak with him.
not_available Sure.
not_available But he wasn't in 3.
not_available We just got here.
not_available Stu? Who else is here from the Bureau? 
not_available Just the two of us.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Of course, I'm sure.
not_available And the reason I didn't call CTU immediately for backup Frankly, I was worried things could get out of control.
not_available My family was still in the compound But you did eventually call.
not_available Yes.
not_available The second Teri and Kim were with me, I called Alberta Green.
not_available You did what any loving father would do.
not_available Unfortunately, as you know our procedures don't allow for any deviation from protocol.
not_available I can't reinstate you, Jack.
not_available Ryan, have you heard a single thing that I've said? Do you understand what's happening? Senator Palmer is still in danger.
not_available Now that my family is safe, I can help you.
not_available As of right now, your case will be put in the hands of the Justice Department.
not_available Justice Department? For God's sakes, yes, under the circumstances I had to break the rules of procedure with CTU to protect my family! But I never deviated from my assignment to protect Senator Palmer, and you know that! I know that and that's what might keep you from going to prison.
not_available But that's not my call.
not_available You don't have time for this, Ryan.
not_available I have come in contact with suspects still at large and I guarantee you they have a contingency plan.
not_available I am a resource.
not_available I can identify them.
not_available You want to put me in jail? You do that later.
not_available But you let me help Senator Palmer get through the rest of this day.
not_available I'll ask Alberta if she wants your help.
not_available She's been here for four hours, Ryan! 
not_available Chappelle.
not_available Can Myers talk to Bauer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll patch you through.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Okay, we're through here.
not_available It's Nina.
not_available Keep him company.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hey, it's Jack.
not_available How's It going over there? They're handing me over to the Justice Department.
not_available Didn't you explain to them why you did it? Yes, of course I did.
not_available I think Alberta Green Is trying to make a career move.
not_available How's Teri and Kim? They seem okay, considering what they've been through.
not_available How much longer will they stay at the clinic? A couple of hours,then they'll be transferred for questioning.
not_available Nina, I can't thank you enough for being there.
not_available Really, I appreciate It.
not_available Nina? 
not_available Yeah, I'm here.
not_available What's wrong? When Walsh told you that someone inside the agency was working against Palmer did you think that It was more than one person? He didn't say, but I've been thinking about this, too.
not_available Someone had to recruit Jamey.
not_available You're going to have to work under the assumption that someone else is on the inside.
not_available Maybe not CTU.
not_available The District, Division, maybe Secret Service.
not_available Why? What are you thinking? I just want to make sure that Teri and Kim are safe here.
not_available What do you mean? At the clinic? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why wouldn't they be? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm just exhausted and probably getting paranoid.
not_available What's going on there? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll make sure that they are safe here.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Can I talk to them? 
not_available They're being examined right now.
not_available Okay, get back to me as soon as they can talk, please.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Any more information on the backup plan to assassinate Palmer? The information that came in half an hour ago matched what we got from Division's database.
not_available Things are falling into place.
not_available Give me the headlines.
not_available Three shooters, possibly hired to kill Palmer in case the breakfast attempt failed.
not_available Jovan Myovic entered the country two days ago.
not_available Mishko Suba, also from the Balkans, came in three days ago through Florida.
not_available And the other one? No names yet.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available If he's connected with the others, we need to know where he is and what he's doing.
not_available Let's leave it right there.
not_available Get the equipment in the shed.
not_available I'll be in to brief you on our exit strategy.
not_available Let's move it out! 
not_available Mr.
not_available Drazen, it's Kevin.
not_available Yes.
not_available We just got to the transfer point.
not_available What about Gaines? 
not_available He's dead.
not_available I see.
not_available Listen, Mr.
not_available Drazen when Gaines hired me for this I told him there were a couple of defects in his plan that could be exploited.
not_available Not to say "I told you so" but I'm not surprised that any of this happened the way It did.
not_available Is there a point to any of this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available I can fix it for you.
not_available Interesting.
not_available And how can you do that? I've done this before.
not_available I know people.
not_available When I was working for the DEA in Florida I was able to get to a witness that no one else could find.
not_available Problem solved, if you get what I'm saying.
not_available I appreciate the offer, Kevin, but as you Americans so often say Plan B is already in effect.
not_available What does that mean? Hello? Drazen? Get away from me.
not_available Is there anything left in the truck? Go to hell.
not_available I need copies of this report as soon as you can get them.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Are we saying Senator Palmer should stay in for the duration? No.
not_available He's got to get out of California now.
not_available The backup shooters are in LA and they're going to come after him.
not_available All right, leave that with me.
not_available Let me look it over one more time before I do anything.
not_available Tony? Yeah? Are you satisfied with your position here? Sure.
not_available Because I always had the impression you had too much talent to be a number three at CTU.
not_available What do you want me to do, Alberta? That's what I like about you, Tony, you get right to the point.
not_available Before Chappelle makes his final evaluation of Jack, he's going to want to talk to you.
not_available Why me? Because you called in the lockdown.
not_available And, let's face it Nina is hardly impartial when it comes to Jack, and Chappelle knows that.
not_available And you want me to tell him what? The truth.
not_available That even though Jack's family was in danger, he could have dealt with it without compromising the integrity of CTU.
not_available If Jack had confided in you from the beginning you never would have had to call George Mason to lock things down.
not_available Am I right? Jack? Alberta.
not_available Chappelle asked me to debrief you personally.
not_available Fine.
not_available I have to tell you, Jack, this is your turf.
not_available I feel uncomfortable debriefing you.
not_available That's quite all right.
not_available It's pointless for me to ask you questions.
not_available Why don't you just tell me what you think I need to know? Save us some time.
not_available I went through the timeline events with Chappelle.
not_available You need the threads and IDs to proceed tactically over the next few hours.
not_available Do you mind? No, but before we get started, I need something.
not_available What's that? I want to be able to phone my family.
not_available They don't know what's going on with me.
not_available I want to ease their minds.
not_available Sorry, Jack, I can't do that.
not_available Why don't we dispense with the, "Are you all right, Jack? I feel uncomfortable" crap? Okay, you want to talk straight? Fine.
not_available Don't handle me.
not_available Tell me what you know.
not_available First thing you need to do is get a hold of Langley.
not_available Have them open up their Balkan terrorist database.
not_available Why the Balkans? The people buying the Palmer hit were being financed by a man named Ted Cofell.
not_available He was an investment banker with family connections in Europe.
not_available Was? He died three hours ago.
not_available Keep talking.
not_available The money that we traced came back to Ted Cofell Industries which Is based out here In LA.
not_available CTU.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, I have a problem.
not_available himself to me as FBI but I know he's lying.
not_available How do you know? Because I met the only FBI agents assigned here.
not_available They knew nothing about him.
not_available Maybe the right hand's not talking to the left? No, I don't think it's that.
not_available Can you send someone over? I need to pull prints off a phone.
not_available Sure.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available No, that's it.
not_available Just hurry.
not_available All right.
not_available You got it.
not_available And the Senator wanted to get your approval on these.
not_available What are they? Photographs for the Time magazine piece.
not_available Right, I wanted to see those.
not_available Nice.
not_available Mom? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Use that one.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, what's going on? I talked to Dad.
not_available And? 
not_available And I'm a little confused.
not_available He's been trying to convince me that it's best to air this thing about Nicole's rape and the death of Lyle Gibson.
not_available Don't worry about that now.
not_available No, that's just it, we do have to.
not_available I know about Dr.
not_available Ferragamo.
not_available I know the fire was no accident.
not_available We got to do something.
not_available Keith, look Dad wants to keep it quiet 
not_available Don't get yourself worked up.
not_available I am worked up.
not_available Hey.
not_available Covering up an accident is one thing but we're talking about murder.
not_available I'm going to the police.
not_available You will not.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've made up my mind.
not_available You will listen to me, Keith! It is not your decision to make.
not_available Can't beiieve you're saying this.
not_available Because you don't know what it takes to raise a family and to keep it safe.
not_available What does this have to do with safe? 
not_available Everything.
not_available Nothing is simple in life.
not_available Sometimes you just have to make a decision.
not_available That is what we did, and you will respect that.
not_available Do you understand? I understand Have Patty pack up your things.
not_available We have to leave the state today.
not_available Why? They've done a threat assessment.
not_available They claim it's too dangerous to stay here.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada.
not_available Have you discussed this with Mike? 
not_available Of course.
not_available He believes this isn't a call they would make unless the threat was imminent.
not_available I thought you said that the man from the breakfast, Jack Bauer, was already in custody.
not_available He is, but he may not be working alone.
not_available There are others that are after me.
not_available So, let's go.
not_available Let's get our things together.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Now.
not_available Come on, Keith.
not_available You didn't call it in.
not_available As long as my family was in danger, I didn't want to call CTU.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Chappelle's ready for you.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available Hey, Tony.
not_available Sir.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available We have an important decision to make pretty soon about Jack Bauer.
not_available Whether or not to pursue criminal and disciplinary charges.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'm not going to lie to you.
not_available This may boil down to your testimony as you seem to be the most impartial direct observer of last night's events.
not_available Let me save you some time, Mr.
not_available Chappelle.
not_available I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Bauer.
not_available I don't agree with the way he delegates authority and I don't Iike the way he runs operations.
not_available But since midnight last night you won't get me to disapprove of a single action he's taken.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available You talked to Nicole? Yeah.
not_available They're taking care of her.
not_available They're going to meet us at the airport.
not_available Yeah, I'll tell him.
not_available Thanks.
not_available That was the Pentagon.
not_available Remember after the Incident at the breakfast you asked me to check out the name Jack Bauer? Who is he? He used to be in Special Forces.
not_available Led a six
not_available man team into Kosovo a couple years ago.
not_available That's what it was.
not_available The Drazen mission.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He handpicked his men and trained them.
not_available Only Bauer survived.
not_available He blames me for the loss of his team.
not_available That's what this is about.
not_available Can you get this to Mrs.
not_available Palmer? I didn't have time to pack it before she left.
not_available Aren't you coming with me? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm taking a later flight.
not_available I have an aunt in town.
not_available I promised my mom I'd visit.
not_available She's in a nursing home.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay, now we need to get the estimations on that one and make sure you fax that to the other office.
not_available Hold the elevator, please.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available I can't stay long.
not_available Then we shouldn't waste any time.
not_available Anything? Nothing.
not_available That can't be.
not_available I'm sure I saw him holding the phone.
not_available Those prints have been wiped off.
not_available But it doesn't make sense.
not_available Housekeeping didn't come in.
not_available No one used the room.
not_available It wasn't housekeeping.
not_available There's not a single print on that phone.
not_available This was done by a professional.
not_available The grade of weapons there would be consistent with that scenario.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Green.
not_available Alberta, It's Nina.
not_available I'd like permission to move Teri and Kim to the safe house now.
not_available Are they done there? Everything but the debrief.
not_available I can do that myself, once we're over there.
not_available Fine.
not_available Do it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The ultrasound showed the remnants of a small follicular cyst.
not_available A cyst? It must have burst.
not_available That's what caused the pain.
not_available The good news Is, It's the most common type of ovarian cyst and It's benign.
not_available Why did it burst? 
not_available Could have been the assault.
not_available It can also happen when your uterus enlarges.
not_available When was your last period? Last month.
not_available It's due sometime this week.
not_available I'd like to do a pregnancy test just to rule it out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me, Doctor.
not_available Teri, we need to go.
not_available Get your things.
not_available I'm sorry, we're not finished here yet.
not_available Plans have changed.
not_available We must move them.
not_available Is something wrong? We want to get you and Kim to the safe house now.
not_available Aren't we safe here? Everything is fine.
not_available You're just not as contained as we'd like.
not_available Kim! Come on! Kim, get your things.
not_available Right now? 
not_available Now! Go.
not_available Here's the test I told you about.
not_available I want you to take it soon.
not_available Thank you for everything.
not_available They're leaving now.
not_available His name was Theodore Cofell.
not_available We traced his finance company here to LA from money that they rerouted from the Balkans.
not_available Senator Palmer.
not_available Can I help you, sir? 
not_available I'm here to see Jack Bauer.
