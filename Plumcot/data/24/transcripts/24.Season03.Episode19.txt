
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Tony, its me.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available We just determined a man who was exposed to the virus got out of the hotel Son of a bitch.
not_available Howd that happen? He must have slipped out right before we reinforced the perimeter.
not_available Its likely he had no idea had been exposed.
not_available If we dont find this guy before he becomes symptomatic, we might be looking at an outbreak.
not_available What do you want? To give you your next assignment.
not_available There is a man named Ryan Chappelle, regional director of CTU.
not_available I want him killed.
not_available This man Saunders has proven that he will use this virus to inflict mass casualties if you dont do what he says.
not_available How long am I supposed to let him hold this country hostage? Until we catch him.
not_available Saunders called in with another demand.
not_available What does he want now? He wants you killed.
not_available Hes threatened to release the virus into the main population unless we deliver your body by 7:00 a.m.
not_available My god, jack He has proven he will use the virus.
not_available The president didn't have a choice.
not_available Ryan, I think we found Saunders.
not_available apartment not far from here.
not_available Chase is leading a strike team over there now.
not_available Good, Jack.
not_available No one is here.
not_available Saunders, why are you doing this? Even if I told you, you wouldnt understand.
not_available A van will be arriving shortly.
not_available Leave Chappelles body with the driver.
not_available I am sorry, Ryan, we got to do this.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available I am sorry we let you down, Ryan.
not_available God forgive me.
not_available The following takes place between 7:00 am and 8:00 am.
not_available He is clean.
not_available There is no tracker.
not_available If you try to follow us, Saunders will release the virus.
not_available Wayne Palmer.
not_available This is Jack Bauer Chappelles body has just been picked up by Saunders' people.
not_available Thanks Jack.
not_available Ryan Chappelle is dead I ordered the death of one of our agents, one of our finest.
not_available As unthinkable as that was, I had to buy some time in order to protect civilian lives.
not_available I will not cave in to any more of this terrorists demands.
not_available David, unfortunately we are vulnerable as long as Saunders has his virus and is willing to release it.
not_available So far, over 700 people have been infected, and they're all gonna die.
not_available Now, unless you are willing to accept more loss of life, I dont know what else we can do.
not_available He has us in a corner, David.
not_available Convene the Cabinet.
not_available Yes sir.
not_available What did you find? We worked up the money trails that Chappelle had on his system.
not_available Stephen Saunders has been sending $10000 a month to his daughter Jane.
not_available He has a daughter? Yes.
not_available Right here on the screen.
not_available She is 19, she lives in Santa Barbara.
not_available She goes to school there.
not_available All right, find out where she is now.
not_available Call Santa Barbara PD (Police Department), make sure they are on standby.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, its Jack.
not_available Jack, what happened? Chappelle is dead.
not_available Saunders people picked up his body.
not_available black van, no plates.
not_available All right, look, I will see if we can SAT track it.
not_available I already put Adam on it.
not_available Do we have any idea why Saunders wanted Chappelle dead yet? I was just about to call you.
not_available We found a thread that Chappelle was working up on his own.
not_available Looks like Saunders has a daughter.
not_available A daughter? Yeah, the money trail Chappelle was following leads to a Jane Saunders.
not_available What do we know about her? We are still digging up information.
not_available We know she is 19 years old, she goes to school in Santa Barbara.
not_available Is she still there? Yeah.
not_available I was just about to call the Santa Barbara office to have her picked up.
not_available Wait, Tony, Tony, dont.
not_available Thats not the right play.
not_available Why not? Think about it.
not_available We dont know anything about this girl.
not_available We dont know if she even knows who her father really is.
not_available And obviously Saunders is going to everything he can to protect his daughter.
not_available So someone is watching her.
not_available If you want to grab her for questioning, you are going to have to do it without him knowing.
not_available Which means we have to conduct a plain sight swap, switch her out with one of our own agents.
not_available Jack, I dont know that we have the time.
not_available We are going to have to find an agent that looks like the girl within the next half hour.
not_available Right now Saunders is calling all the shots.
not_available If we dont do something soon, we are going to be completely paralyzed.
not_available All right, I will get started.
not_available Chloe, we need to find a Jan Saunders look alike.
not_available I need you to abstract a physical description cross referencing with our CTU agents in regions 2 and 3.
not_available Ok, when do you need it? Right now.
not_available I just started the file on her.
not_available Chloe, just do it for me, please.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Hey, its me.
not_available Did you get the test results? I wont know if I am infected for another hour.
not_available Whats taking so long? They couldnt interpret the result here.
not_available They had to send everything back to the lab.
not_available How are you feeling? I am, I think I am ok.
not_available No nose bleeds? Nothing on your skin? No.
not_available Look, NHS has everything under control here.
not_available I want to keep busy.
not_available How can I help? Adam is working on a citywide containment.
not_available I will have him split off some of his workload on your system.
not_available Open a socket, you can help with NHS deployment.
not_available I will call you later, ok? Yeah, ok.
not_available Michelle is still at the hotel.
not_available I just told her youd send over some of your system updates for her to work on.
not_available Ok, I will send them right over.
not_available Where are we on this guy who escaped from the hotel? His name is Bill Cole, he is an insurance sales rep.
not_available We contacted his wife by phone, but she wasnt being very cooperative.
not_available We did manage to get from her that Cole came home unusually late and left early.
not_available For work? Probably, but his office doesnt open for another half hour, so we are looking for him now.
not_available NHS has just arrived and they will quarantine the house and test the wife.
not_available Who are we sending over there? Chase.
not_available He will be there soon.
not_available Agent Bauer, I have the President for you.
not_available Patch him through.
not_available Jack Mr.
not_available President Stephen Saunders, the man who is in control of the virus, you know him, correct? Yes sir.
not_available I worked with him a number of years ago on a mission that you sanctioned.
not_available The Drazen mission in Kosovo.
not_available The last conversation I had with him, he said there would be other demands.
not_available His exact words: the main event to come.
not_available You have any idea what he means by that? I wish I could tell you, sir.
not_available Right now Stephen Saunders is in a vengeful state of mind.
not_available Any demands that he makes will be detrimental to American security.
not_available What I am asking, Jack, is what will he do if I say no to him? Mr.
not_available President, when I worked with Stephen Saunders, I never thought he was capable of mass murder.
not_available Today we know he is.
not_available He still has the virus.
not_available If you dont meet his demands, sir, I believe that he will continue to release it.
not_available Thank you, Jack.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Here is the list you wanted of the top ten agents that could double as Jane Saunders.
not_available None of these are in Los Angeles.
not_available I know.
not_available The closest is CTU San Francisco.
not_available Did you put together a 2nd tier list? Yeah.
not_available You sure this is right? Yeah, I double checked when I saw the results.
not_available Kim Bauer.
not_available Yeah, Kim, could you come up to my office, please Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You are not thinking of using her? We dont have a choice.
not_available Shouldnt you talk to Jack first? Chloe, I will take care of it, all right? Thank you.
not_available Why dont you sit down.
not_available Ok.
not_available Kim, we need to question Jane Saunders without her father knowing about it.
not_available The problem is, we are pretty sure he has somebody watching her.
not_available Fine.
not_available What do you need me to do? Well, you are the same age, similar body types, your facial fertures are different, but no so different that we couldnt disguise it from a distance.
not_available You want me to pose as Jan Saunders.
not_available Well, we have better matches, but they are too far away from this office.
not_available So, the bottom line is, you are our best chance.
not_available Now, we dont have much time.
not_available We are still in the early stages of planning this mission, but if all goes according to plan, it shouldnt be too dangerous.
not_available No, I am not going to order you to do this.
not_available I know, and I know whats been going on today.
not_available And if you had a better option, I know youd take it So, I am fine and I will do it.
not_available You sure? Positive Chloe, I am leaving for Santa Barbara in a few minutes, so you are going to need to transfer all my stuff onto your system.
not_available I know everything thats happening, I already pulled your data.
not_available Good.
not_available I think its only fair that I tell you.
not_available I told Tony I didnt think you should do this.
not_available Field work isnt learn as you go.
not_available I am not doing this to be a field agent, Chloe, there is no one else.
not_available Yeah, thats why I didnt fight Tony harder.
not_available Not that he would listen to me anyway.
not_available I am not so out of it that I dont know he doesnt respect my opinions on tactical matters.
not_available Ok, look, I have to go.
not_available Ok, I just wanted to let you know how I felt, and I want you to know that I am behind 110% I really hope nothing bad happens to you.
not_available Listen, Chloe, are you coordinating this operation from inside? Of course.
not_available Ok, maybe you should start prepping, because I bet there is about 2 dozen agents still waiting for comm.
not_available Codes.
not_available I like your energy, Kim.
not_available Use it.
not_available Adam, could you send me a list of all the personnel working on the Jan Saunders operation? I cant do it right now, Chloe, I am monitoring Chase.
not_available Did he find Bill Cole? Not yet, he is interrogating Coles wife.
not_available This thing is out of control.
not_available I already told the people on the phone that Bill isnt here.
not_available I know, I know, but when he was here, did you notice anything out of the ordinary? Was he bleeding from the nose for instance? No, not that I saw.
not_available What about rashes, skin irritation, anything of that sort? No.
not_available Why would you think that hed be sick? He came in contact with some people who are sick at the Chandler Plaza Hotel.
not_available When was he at the Chandler Plaza? Earlier this morning.
not_available No, no, he wasnt.
not_available He was with a client at the office.
not_available He did it again, didnt he? That bastard did it again.
not_available Maam Then I hope he did get something.
not_available I hope that he dies.
not_available Please, Mrs.
not_available Cole, I need you Get out of here.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Cole Get out of my way Mrs.
not_available Cole, you need to stay calm, because I cant let you leave.
not_available Agent Edmunds Yeah One of my men just found this.
not_available Where? Wastebasket in the bathroom.
not_available Blood is tacky, which means its fresh.
not_available Then Bill Cole is symptomatic.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need you to contact every urgent care facility in a 30 mile radius.
not_available Yes sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I have had a nose bleed for about an hour.
not_available I cant seem to stop it.
not_available Did you put ice on it? Yeah.
not_available Didnt do anything.
not_available Try an ER, get it cauterized.
not_available That will take too long.
not_available I got to go to work.
not_available We dont have anything here that will stop that.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available The swap will take place at the campus library.
not_available She works there in the mornings.
not_available This is a file of relevant personal data.
not_available All right.
not_available Chloe, where is Tony? He is in the teleconference room with Kim.
not_available Why isn¡¯t she working the satellite track with you? Uh, you might want to talk to Tony about that.
not_available When you get into the position, just act naturally Try to look up a place.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available What are you doing with Kim? Chloe came over a list of potential matches for Jan Sanders.
not_available Good, so we have got one? Well, you are not going to like it.
not_available It¡¯s Kim.
not_available My Kim? I am not crazy about it either, but she is the only one that matched both physically and geographically.
not_available You are not sending her into the field.
not_available She can handle it, plus she has a safety net.
not_available Find someone else, Tony.
not_available Jack, you said yourself, we need to get Saunder¡¯s daughter without him knowing.
not_available Kim is our best shot at doing that.
not_available She is not doing it.
not_available It¡¯s not up to you, it¡¯s her decision.
not_available Fine.
not_available I will order her not to do it.
not_available She doesn¡¯t work for you, Jack She works for me Don¡¯t Dad Get out of here.
not_available Please don¡¯t do this, please Get out of here now.
not_available Or I will throw you out myself.
not_available Move Jack You talk it over with your father.
not_available If we have to abort this, I want to know now.
not_available I will be outside.
not_available I know you think you are doing the right thing, but this is not going to happen.
not_available Somebody has to do it.
not_available Someone will, not you I am the best match You are not a field operative I have weapons training.
not_available This is decoy work.
not_available Saunders¡¯ people won¡¯t even come close to me.
not_available Kim, you don¡¯t know what you are talking about.
not_available If everything was to go right in this scenario, which is not a chance I am willing to take You are not taking it, I am The reason why you have got this job, the reason why I gave you this job is so that I an make sure you¡¯d be safe.
not_available I took this job because I wanted it, not because you wanted me here.
not_available I know that this is hard for you, but this is not your decision.
not_available This is my job, better yet, my duty.
not_available I am going to be safe, but I am doing it.
not_available They are ready to go All set Ok, now as soon as we get there, they are going to deal with your hair and makeup.
not_available Remember, we are not trying to fool anyone at close range.
not_available You will be in a position where Saunders¡¯ people can only view you from a distance.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is your comm.
not_available unit getting a clear signal? Oh, it¡¯s fine.
not_available Kim Yeah? This is a gun I got for you.
not_available I don¡¯t think you are going to have to use it, but if you do, don¡¯t hesitate.
not_available Ok Come on, let¡¯s go Please be seated.
not_available Thank you for assembling on short notice.
not_available You have already been briefed on the Cordilla Virus that¡¯s now threatening our cities.
not_available What you don¡¯t know is we have 2 new developments.
not_available Wayne.
not_available First, a vial of that virus has already been release.
not_available The Chandler Plaza Hotel, here in Los Angeles, was the site of the first attack.
not_available That situation is being addressed.
not_available Secondly, we discovered the identity of the perpetrator.
not_available His name is Stephen Saunders and he is a former MI6 agent.
not_available Now, apparently, Mr.
not_available Saunders has at least 11 more vials and is threatening to release them unless we meet his demands.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, what are those demands? So far there have been 2.
not_available The first was for the President to use the phrase ¡°the sky is falling¡± in a press conference.
not_available He then demanded that we terminate one of our own agents.
not_available One of our agents? Why? Well, we are still looking into that.
not_available What was his response when you didn¡¯t comply? It devastates me to tell you that I had no choice but to comply.
not_available A half hour ago, we delivered this agent¡¯s body to one of Saunders¡¯ representatives.
not_available My God.
not_available Millions of lives are at stake.
not_available I am going to need each of your departments to open your files to CTU Los Angeles.
not_available Give them whatever they need.
not_available Tony, I am trying to get into some DOD files for Jack, I need authorization from Cahppelle.
not_available When is he going to be back? He is not.
not_available What do you mean? Could I have everybody¡¯s attention, please? I am sorry to tell you that, Ryan Chappelle was killed in the line of duty about a half an hour ago.
not_available I can¡¯t give you any more details, but I will be assuming Ryan¡¯s responsibilities until we hear from Brad Hammond at division.
not_available Now, there will be an opportunity to pay proper respects to Ryan, but now is not the time.
not_available Tony, it¡¯s Chase on line 5.
not_available Thanks Almeida.
not_available Yeah, it¡¯s me.
not_available I am at Cole¡¯s house.
not_available We found evidence he is almost certainly symptomatic.
not_available All right, how many people did he come in contact with over there? Just his wife.
not_available NHS is moving her into isolation right now.
not_available All right, I will let the teams know.
not_available Tony, transfer me to Kim.
not_available She was running a simulation for me.
not_available Yeah, I gave that to Adam.
not_available Kim is out on assignment right now.
not_available What kind of assignment? Well, we are pretty sure that Saunders has his daughter under surveillance, so Kim is gonna take her place when we grab her.
not_available Kim is not a field ops What the hell is she doing out there I don¡¯t want to hear about it, chase, all right? Kim was the only match we had available.
not_available Tony, there is got to be other agents you can use for this.
not_available What the hell are you thinking? No, there aren¡¯t Back off, Chase Where is she now? She is on her way to Santa Barbara with Jack.
not_available Jack signed off on this? First of all, it¡¯s my call.
not_available Secondly, yes, Jack did, but most importantly, Kim accepted the assignment.
not_available Now, I am gonna transfer you over to Adam.
not_available Fine.
not_available Look, I am sorry about what happened earlier about grabbing you.
not_available I didn¡¯t mean to scare you.
not_available I just don¡¯t think what you are doing is right.
not_available But I need you to understand something in the field I am in command.
not_available You do what I tell you to do.
not_available Do you understand me? Do you understand me?? Yes Ok, good My nose has been bleeding for almost an hour, and I can¡¯t get it to stop.
not_available All right.
not_available Have a seat and fill this out.
not_available How long will that take? There are a couple patients ahead of you, it shouldn¡¯t be too long Thanks TV: As to how serious this illness is, we have no new information and the authorities are not commenting.
not_available We can¡¯t verify this but we are hearing that whatever is infecting the people of this hotel, it¡¯s very serious and possibly deadly.
not_available Body bags have been spotted, and rescue workers are positioned around the Chandler Plaza.
not_available Authority do not give any information regarding the estimated Hey One minute, sir.
not_available No, now.
not_available I need to see a doctor now.
not_available I was at that hotel.
not_available There is something seriously wrong with me Oh, my god, you are him Dr.
not_available Joyner.
not_available The man we are supposed to isolate, he is here Yes We have just identified the body And it¡¯s Chappelle? It's confirmed.
not_available The thumbprint matched the one in his file.
not_available Good.
not_available Dump the body.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You take care of your problem? Yes, Chappelle is dead.
not_available But CTU is still gonna try to find out what he was working up, so tell Lennox to stay alert, make sure he doesn¡¯t let Jan out of his sight.
not_available Yeah Any problems? No.
not_available She is leaving her apartment now.
not_available She is going to work.
not_available All right, stay with her.
not_available The next few hours are crucial.
not_available I will be here.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we have started down a slippery slope here, and unless we are Cut the euphemisms, Jeseph.
not_available What are you trying to say? Sir, we are concerned about the fact that you ordered the death of a high ranking member of our intelligence I don¡¯t think we are here to second guess actions that have already been taken.
not_available Joseph, no one is more aware than I am of the moral ambiguity of my decision.
not_available I did it to buy CTU more time to find Saunders and to delay for as long as possible the slaughter of millions.
not_available I made the decision to protect their future not mine Saunders.
not_available I have to take this.
not_available Yes I have confirmed the identity of Chappelle¡¯s body, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available It will be disposed of respectfully.
not_available We know who you are, Mr.
not_available Saunders.
not_available Whatever you are trying to accomplish, you are going to fail.
not_available Your only chance is to relinquish the virus and hope we don¡¯t find you.
not_available That¡¯s not going to happen.
not_available What is it you want? To make America clean again.
not_available You see, Mr.
not_available President the world hates America and for good reason I won¡¯t bother going into the details, you know better than I the atrocities your nation commits.
not_available But we are going to change all that.
not_available You and I, together, are going to dismantle the military machine that exports its ugliness across the globe.
not_available And how are we going to do that? We will start where the work gets the dirtiest, something I know a little about.
not_available Covert foreign nationals.
not_available In 32 countries across the Middle East and Asia, your government employs grade A through H intelligence consultants.
not_available They are citizens of the countries in which they reside.
not_available They are spies Working against those countries at the behest of the American military machine.
not_available In 45 minutes, I want a list of their identities sent to me by way of a web site Sylviaimports.com If you fail to cmply, I will release 2 vials of the virus in major cities.
not_available And this time, they won¡¯t be in hotels where they can be contained.
not_available Agent Bauer, Rachel Forrester.
not_available This is Agent Kim Bauer.
not_available She is gonna be doubling for Jana Saunders.
not_available We have already set up a staging area outside the library where she works Is it a safe distance away? Yes, we won¡¯t be detected.
not_available Is she there yet? No.
not_available She will be in a few minutes.
not_available Let¡¯s go ahead.
not_available Let¡¯s go.
not_available Make sure everybody on the block is contacted and nobody leaves their house.
not_available Sheriff¡¯s department is sending officers over to patrol a 3 block area until they get here.
not_available Use your men.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Edmunds.
not_available Yeah, we found Bill Cole.
not_available Where? 
not_available He is at an urgent care center not far from you.
not_available Laurel Canyon and Moorpark Yeah, I know where that is.
not_available I want you to get over there, get as much as you can off of Cole.
not_available He is pretty agitated, you are gonna have to help him focus.
not_available Tony Yeah Is Kim in play yet? No.
not_available She just landed in Santa Barbara.
not_available All right, I will call you.
not_available Where is Jane now? My people have her under surveillance in the library working behind the reference desk.
not_available How crowded? Well, one of them belongs to Saunders, and their orders are gonna be not let her out of their sight, not for one second.
not_available I know.
not_available We have taken over the surveillance cameras and we have narrowed down a list to about 5 probables.
not_available Ok, get that intel over to Tony Almeida at CTU.
not_available Ok, let¡¯s see her.
not_available Ok, now remember, Kim You are not gonna fool anyone who knows Jane Saunders up close.
not_available I know The staff knows what¡¯s happening But I want you to stay at least and I want you to keep your head down as much as possible.
not_available the wig looks darker than Jan¡¯s hair color.
not_available That¡¯s the best we could do on such short notice.
not_available You are gonna have to match every detail as closely as possible, her life depends on it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cole, when you were inside the store, who did you come in contact with? What do you mean, contact? Who did you talk to? Just the pharmacist behind the counter.
not_available How many others? Customers? Yeah, there were some other people there.
not_available How many other people were there? Bill If we do not identify and track down everyone you have come in contact with, we are gonna have a citywide epidemic.
not_available So how many people? I, I don¡¯t know Think! That¡¯s it.
not_available We are now patched against security.
not_available No audio from the system Nothing on B Go ahead, try six This screen go ahead isolate front desk Thank You Oh I am so sorry You are not supposed to have drinks in here.
not_available I am sorry, I will throw it away.
not_available It¡¯s ok Start tracking that man in the red shirt.
not_available I want to know everything that he does.
not_available Yes Sir.
not_available Subject is on camera 4 right now.
not_available I was just about to replace those.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Clear What the hell is taking her so long? Checking all surveillances now Nothing on 1, nothing on 2 Come on Sir, she came out from 4 Kim There is a man handing towards the bookcase at your 3 o¡¯clock, red shirt Might be one of Saunders¡¯ men.
not_available I want you to angle away from him slowly.
not_available Good We just got off the phone with Chase who is with Cole right now.
not_available After Cole left the hotel, he went to his house in Burbank.
not_available He stopped at a gas station on Riverside Drive But it was self service and according to what he told the urgent care unit what his wife confirmed, he didn¡¯t become symptomatic until after he got home.
not_available The nose bleeds and the sweating? Right Here is where the ripple effect starts.
not_available At 7:20, he stopped at a pharmacy and asked the pharmacist Sam Tyler for some medication to stoop the bleeding There were 3 other people inside that pharmacy at the same time Right.
not_available One of them, Anne Schwartz.
not_available She¡¯s has been going to the pharmacy for years, so they had her address on file.
not_available We have sent NHS people to her house.
not_available She has a husband and 3 children.
not_available What about the other 2 customers? ID is unknown.
not_available These people could be anywhere, spreading the disease to anybody they come into contact with It gets worse.
not_available At the urgent care facility in Studio City there were 6 patients in the waiting area when cole came in, who left before the quarantine was put in place.
not_available We are tracking them down But between then and the staff at the facility We could be looking at up to 75 people Just in their immediate families.
not_available If any of these people are in a supermarket or a mall when they become symptomatic This thing is going to be impossible to contain.
not_available We need to identify and find them now.
not_available Also, I need you to coordinate with NHS and HazMat.
not_available We have to set up a quarantine in 2 neighborhoods in the Burbank Studio City area.
not_available Department heads report to Adam.
not_available Looks good, everybody, it looks like this worked.
not_available Maintain monitering Kim.
not_available Come get me if anything happens.
not_available I got it.
not_available Thank you, good work What¡¯s going on? who are you? My name is Jack Bauer, I am a federal agent.
not_available You are not in any danger What do you want? We need your help We need to get in touch with your father.
not_available Then get in touch with him.
not_available What do you need me for? We don¡¯t know where he is and we think you do.
not_available What¡¯s this about? You don¡¯t know who your father really is.
not_available First of all, I hardly know my father.
not_available And whatever this is, I know it¡¯s illegal.
not_available You have no right to keep me here.
not_available Release me now, I haven¡¯t done anything wrong You¡¯d better listen to me very carefully, Jane.
not_available Right now your father is engaged in terrorist activity against the United States of America.
not_available This morning, he killed hundreds of people, and he is threatening to kill thousands more.
not_available Now, I can only imaging how difficult this must be for you to believe, but trust me, you are going to cooperate with us.
not_available There is a lot at stake, and there is not a lot of time.
not_available I am not going to do anything.
not_available I want to talk to a lawyer.
