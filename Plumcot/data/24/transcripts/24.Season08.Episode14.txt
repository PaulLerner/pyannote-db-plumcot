not_available splinter cell trying to smuggle weapons
not_available grade uranium into the city.
not_available Just read the threat assessment.
not_available Shut down all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city.
not_available Where'd he go? 
not_available Î¤here's only one way for them to get in.
not_available Across the East River.
not_available That's right.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available was just hit by an E.M.P.
not_available All of our systems are down.
not_available lt's a real mess.
not_available Where's Jack? l think he might be in some kind of trouble.
not_available We need to find him.
not_available You need to get C.T.U.
not_available back on line as soon as you can.
not_available Once you acquire Jack's position, you can direct me to him.
not_available l have a faster way to get us back on line.
not_available Î¤hey won't listen.
not_available Make them listen, ChIoe.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available Frank Haynam, senior engineer at the New York field office.
not_available l hope that you're here to help, because we can damn well use it.
not_available You're going in through the C.L.R.
not_available processor? 
not_available That's right.
not_available We're gonna create a brand
not_available new subnet.
not_available That'll take forever.
not_available I think I can create a workaround.
not_available Why not tap directly into the trunk line? What I'm suggesting will be a lot faster.
not_available l'm here to clean up your mess.
not_available You need to leave.
not_available You get out.
not_available Get out! 
not_available We got power to comm.
not_available Load the rods into the Zodiac.
not_available It'll be short work once we get the rods across the river.
not_available A vehicle is coming.
not_available Wait until the S.U.V.
not_available 's in range, then take them out.
not_available Get down! Now! l've got two men leaving the dock in a boat.
not_available They're carrying a box the right size and shape for the rods, Jack.
not_available Jack, l got through to C.Î¤.U.
not_available They just got back on line.
not_available N.Y.P.D.'s sending choppers.
not_available We still got a real good shot of finding them.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available l know you're involved with that robbery, Ms.
not_available Walsh.
not_available What? You are out of your mind.
not_available l'm not leaving here until I know the truth.
not_available C.Î¤.U.
not_available is back on line.
not_available I know.
not_available Their helicopter's searching the river.
not_available They're getting close.
not_available We're going to need your help getting clear.
not_available I will get you out of there.
not_available Stand by.
not_available l'll call you in a few minutes.
not_available The following takes place between 5:00 a.m.
not_available and 6:00 a.m.
not_available You have grade 3 level bruising.
not_available You sure you don't want any painkillers? They're wrapped tight.
not_available They'll be fine.
not_available l can't know if the ribs are broken without an X
not_available ray.
not_available You should see a doctor.
not_available Any more stress could cause the lung to collapse.
not_available Î¤rust me.
not_available They're not broken.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You sure you're okay? l'm fine.
not_available Where are we at with the fuel rods? We found the Zodiac partly submerged in the river near 1 1th Street, empty.
not_available The rods are in Manhattan, Jack.
not_available lt's not over yet.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available doesn't think we're more than a few minutes behind.
not_available Who's running the ground op? Cole? Yeah.
not_available Okay, contact Chloe.
not_available Get her to download archival photos from 1 1th and the river.
not_available Have her date 'em back 1 5 minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fire it up.
not_available l want you ready to go as soon as we've got a target.
not_available Sir, just spoke to a witness who said he saw four men unloading the contents of a metal crate into a Yellow Cab.
not_available Îe didn't get a plate.
not_available Chloe, can we roll back satellite? We can now.
not_available N.S.A.
not_available just rerouted them.
not_available l'm logging onto their server now.
not_available This is from one minute ago.
not_available l'm rolling back in 30
not_available second increments.
not_available This is from six minutes ago.
not_available Find them in real time, Chloe.
not_available Arlo, alert N.Y.P.D.
not_available Dana.
not_available Right here, sir.
not_available Contact Hazmat and NEST teams.
not_available Get them mobilized.
not_available Right on that.
not_available Almost there, sir.
not_available Okay, I'm live.
not_available Suspects are proceeding west on 14th Street.
not_available Cole, did you get that? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available On the move.
not_available They've located you on satellite.
not_available Îow far away are they? Not very.
not_available Hold on.
not_available N.Y.P.D.
not_available confirms they have units on the way.
not_available How far out? Ten blocks, coming from the north.
not_available Head to the south.
not_available Turn left.
not_available Suspect just turned south on Seventh.
not_available Got it.
not_available I hear sirens.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Just a second.
not_available l'm inserting the machine code now.
not_available Just get ready.
not_available Satellite will be disabled for 30 seconds.
not_available On my mark.
not_available Go.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Î¤he trunk line just went out.
not_available Get it back.
not_available Cole, we just lost the picture.
not_available Last known location
not_available Seventh and Waverly.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Anything? Where are you now? 
not_available On the Hudson, heading uptown again.
not_available You'll run into Ninth Avenue.
not_available You'll be able to blend into cab traffic there.
not_available We're back up.
not_available Cab's gone.
not_available Find it! Scanning.
not_available Arlo, help me widen the grid.
not_available You take west of Seventh.
not_available I'll take east.
not_available Widening it now.
not_available Anything? Not yet.
not_available You, Chloe? No.
not_available We were out for 30 seconds.
not_available It could be anywhere.
not_available Cole, we lost them.
not_available I'll have N.Y.P.D.
not_available cordon off the area.
not_available You have them check every garage, warehouse, loading dock.
not_available They must have pulled in somewhere.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Get me the president.
not_available Are we clear? Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available We're moving the weapon into pIace as soon as it is assembled.
not_available l need you to send me N.Y.P.D.
not_available patrol patterns and checkpoints.
not_available As soon as it's safe.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available I need them now.
not_available My instructions were to help you, not jeopardize my cover.
not_available l will call you back when I can.
not_available Madam President, I'm afraid I have bad news.
not_available Despite our best efforts, the terrorists have gotten the nuclear rods into Manhattan.
not_available Îow good is your intelIigence? Are you sure? We are, sir.
not_available ln fact, we had a visual on the suspects until a few moments ago.
not_available What happened? 
not_available We lost them.
not_available We're launching a multiagency search in the area we think they're in.
not_available That you think they're in? Will you be able to find them or not? We're doing everything in our power, Mr.
not_available Kanin, but right now I don't have an answer for you.
not_available Madam President, I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
not_available l can no longer guarantee the safety of Manhattan.
not_available How the hell could this happen? C.T.U.
not_available had one priority: to make sure this didn't happen.
not_available It's unacceptable.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, l want you to consider the entire resources of the government at your disposal.
not_available Whatever help you need, we must find those rods.
not_available l understand, Madam President.
not_available We also need to prepare for the worst.
not_available l want all branches of local law enforcement ready to respond to an imminent radiological attack.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Ethan, set up a situation room and assemble the National Security team.
not_available Has President Hassan been evacuated from the U.N.
not_available yet? He will be shortly.
not_available But as of right now, he's still at the U.N.
not_available Get me Jack Bauer.
not_available Yeah, but how long was the satellite down? What, 30 seconds? Yeah.
not_available l know what you're thinking, Jack.
not_available Odd we lost the feed just as we were closing in on the target.
not_available Who was running point at C.T.U.? Chloe O'Brian.
not_available You know her from before, right? Yes.
not_available And you trust her? 
not_available With my life.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I have President Taylor for you.
not_available Cole, l've got to call you back.
not_available I got the White House on the line.
not_available Hello.
not_available Jack, it's President Taylor.
not_available I'm calling to ask you a favor.
not_available Anything, ma'am.
not_available President Hassan and his family are being evacuated from the U.N.
not_available and brought here, and I would like for you to supervise that operation.
not_available With all due respect, Madam President, l think I'd be much more helpful staying in place here with C.T.U.
not_available Besides, Secret Service is more than capable.
not_available Well, that may be true.
not_available But l'd feel a lot better knowing you were on the job.
not_available Jack, in light of the threat to New York, President Hassan's role in securing a lasting peace is more crucial than ever.
not_available l need him safe.
not_available I understand, ma'am.
not_available l'll leave for the U.N.
not_available immediately.
not_available Thank you, Jack.
not_available l'll see you when you get here.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available She wants me to supervise Hassan's evac to McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Renee.
not_available Renee, l need to do this on my own.
not_available We're not going through this again.
not_available I'm coming with you.
not_available End of discussion.
not_available Do you have the rods? In the trunk.
not_available Where is Ali? Îe didn't make it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Tarin will take his place as driver.
not_available How long before the device is functional? All we have to do is load in the fuel rods.
not_available Î¤arin.
not_available Get ready to leave.
not_available l want to place the bomb as soon after l talk to the president as possible.
not_available Agent O'Connor.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available l know who you are, sir.
not_available l've been briefed by command at McGuire.
not_available Ms.
not_available Walker.
not_available Agent O'Connor.
not_available We're cleared for a subterranean evacuation.
not_available Î¤he feeling is that President Hassan will be safer underground in the event of a radiological attack.
not_available Agreed.
not_available How many agents? 
not_available Seven Secret Service, including myself, two of Îassan's internal security and now you and Ms.
not_available Walker.
not_available What's the time frame? Ten minutes.
not_available Î¤here's a service tunnel that runs parallel to the PATH lines leading into New Jersey.
not_available We're just waiting on the vehicles now.
not_available I'd like to see the exact route.
not_available Of course.
not_available l have the maps and evac protocols in the conference room.
not_available But President Îassan is asking to see you first.
not_available He's in the council chamber.
not_available Fine.
not_available You two get started.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available President Î¤aylor wanted me to supervise the evacuation of you and your family to McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available So I'm told.
not_available And I'm glad for it.
not_available Îow long will it take for you and your family to be ready? We're ready now.
not_available My wife and daughter are in the residence awaiting your instructions.
not_available Give us 1 0 minutes, and then we'll evacuate you and your family through a service tunnel under the building and straight on to New Jersey.
not_available And I here I thought l would be leaving the United Nations today at the head of a peace march down Fifth Avenue.
not_available My president still thinks that might happen, sir.
not_available l hope she's right, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Me too, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Give us 1 0 minutes.
not_available We need to talk about a response, Madam President.
not_available I've prepared three retaliatory strike scenarios against targets inside the I.R.K.
not_available Do I need to remind you, General Brucker, the Islamic Republic is an ally? You don't.
not_available But what good is an ally if its citizens can attack us on their own? Madam President, a call's come into the White House switchboard from a man claiming to be in possession of the nuclear rods.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available Do we believe he's who he says he is? 
not_available Confidence is high, ma'am.
not_available Îe's offered details of recent events that no civilian could know.
not_available Plus he's on an anonymous I.C.C.
not_available channel that's scrambled and impossible to trace.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available This is President Î¤aylor.
not_available Good morning, Madam President.
not_available This is going to be a short conversation.
not_available Who are you, and what do you want? You know I have the fuel rods.
not_available You know I got them into Manhattan.
not_available What l want now is to convince you that I have no desire to harm innocent Americans.
not_available And yet you're threatening them with a bomb.
not_available Actually, a radiological dispersal device, Madam President, capable of contaminating 40 square bIocks under a dense radiation cloud.
not_available Any attack on the United States will prompt a retaliation against your country.
not_available l would expect nothing less.
not_available But you should listen to me.
not_available What I'm asking for is simple.
not_available Î¤urn over President Hassan.
not_available What? He's a traitor to his people and must stand trial for his crimes.
not_available That will never happen.
not_available You have exactly one hour to change your mind.
not_available Mr.
not_available Woods knows how to contact me.
not_available Madam President, the clock starts now.
not_available Forty square blockshow many people is that? Between a hundred and a hundred
not_available fifty thousand.
not_available Rob, inform C.Î¤.U.
not_available of the threat, but the ransom demand stays in this room.
not_available Î¤im, call up the New York Guard to support first responders and have the military police execute an evacuation plan.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President.
not_available What is it, Rob? Well, l'm just gonna say it.
not_available We should consider the alternative.
not_available What alternative? 
not_available We have an out here.
not_available l think we should take it.
not_available Give in to the demand to turn over President Hassan? No one man is worth the lives of tens of thousands.
not_available And I bet he would agree.
not_available Madam President, are we really having this conversation? Doesn't it deserve a conversation? Not unless you're intent on destroying our moral authority
not_available this country's unique place among nations, maybe forever.
not_available As opposed to what? The irradiation of all those people? Real businesses, real homes uninhabitable for a hundred years or more? Madam President, l agree.
not_available Giving up Îassan is wrong, but a 40
not_available block wasteland at the heart of New York City is unthinkable.
not_available This country would never be the same.
not_available The country would crucify us if word ever got out that this could have been avoided.
not_available Now we're talking politics, for God sakes? We're talking about the primary role of governmentany government
not_available which is to protect its citizens.
not_available lt could also escalate, Madam President.
not_available They attack us.
not_available We attack them back.
not_available The entire region could be drawn into the conflict and destabilized.
not_available Excuse me, General, but weren't you the one just advocating for a retaliatory strike? Well, in the military, we like to talk about facts on the ground.
not_available Well, they have changed, Madam President.
not_available Now we have a viable option.
not_available Viable? ls that the sense in the room then? That surrendering President Hassan is somehow viable? In the first place, the people who are offering us this deal cannot be trusted.
not_available Îow do we know they won't detonate the bomb anyway? Secondly, President Hassan is a guest of this country.
not_available He is my partner in peace, and I will not sell him out to the very terrorists that we are determined to defeat.
not_available And finally, caving to any terrorist demand weakens this nation immeasurably.
not_available Now, we have 60 minutes to find these bastards, and I believe we will.
not_available But if we don't and the worst happens, we will deal with it.
not_available We will pick ourselves up off the floor and deal with it.
not_available Why? Because that's what we do.
not_available Americans don't stay down.
not_available We rise up together in times of crisis.
not_available We carry on.
not_available ls that clear? 
not_available Start the calls, Î¤im.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Chloe, l need an updated list of road closures and checkpoints.
not_available l thought Arlo was interfacing with N.Y.P.D.
not_available Îe is.
not_available But National Guard units are on their way, so are teams from F.B.l.
not_available New Jersey.
not_available l wanna know where the holes are so I can plug 'em.
not_available l'll forward it to your screen now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes? It's me.
not_available Do you have the roadblock information? l'll have it for you in five minutes.
not_available Did you speak to President Taylor? l did.
not_available Îer response was as I anticipated.
not_available But as the time pressure builds, she'll change her mind and give up Hassan.
not_available l'm certain of it.
not_available What if she doesn't? Then we'll strike a hard blow against the city.
not_available Either way, the peace process dies.
not_available lt's ready.
not_available l don't have time to deal with these anymore.
not_available Mr.
not_available Weiss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Can I have a word? Certainly.
not_available l thought Secretary Kanin's point was a good one.
not_available lf we simply turn Hassan over, we risk damaging the good name of the United States.
not_available What are you suggesting? Uh, a third way.
not_available Covert action in which we deliver Hassan to the terrorists, but make it look like they took him hostage.
not_available Two birds, Mr.
not_available Weiss.
not_available We spare New York, and we preserve our reputation in the eyes of the world.
not_available l admit.
not_available l'm intrigued.
not_available But? lt'll never fly.
not_available You heard the president.
not_available She won't go for it.
not_available Not in a million years.
not_available No, of course she won't.
not_available The question is, will you? l'm asking for your cooperation, Mr.
not_available Weiss.
not_available For the good of the country.
not_available Well, even if l agreed to help, it's too late.
not_available Îassan's already on his way here.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available A Wet Ops team was mobilized in the event of a strike against the I.R.K.
not_available lf you get me Hassan's exact route, l can redirect them to intercept his security detail.
not_available l don't have access to that information.
not_available lt's being handled through the Secretary of State's office.
not_available Well, we just have to get it from Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available lt's sedition, General Brucker.
not_available Are you familiar with the fourth Nuremberg principle? lf the orders of the president are illegal, it is our moral obligation to disobey them.
not_available And you think they are? Illegal? The president is letting her idealism get in the way of her responsibilities as commander in chief.
not_available lt's hardly the same thing.
not_available You don't think so? With the fate of an American city in the balance? "Î¤he primary role of government is to protect its citizens." Your words, Mr.
not_available Weiss.
not_available lt's time to decide whether or not you meant them.
not_available I need everyone's attention.
not_available Î¤he White Îouse just received credible intelligence the terrorists we've been tracking plan to detonate a radiological device in New York City in less than 50 minutes.
not_available All of us in this building have friends and family who live in the city.
not_available We know we are bound by law not to warn them.
not_available But we also know it is still in our power to protect them.
not_available We are their last line of defense.
not_available That is ourjob.
not_available That is what we will do with every second of every minute we have left.
not_available Starting now.
not_available Go back through all your leads.
not_available Appeal to your sources one more time.
not_available Find that bomb.
not_available I just heard from our source inside C.T.U.
not_available Based on the roadblocks, Amsterdam is closed off.
not_available But there's a potential target area just to your left.
not_available You'll be avoiding N.Y.P.D.
not_available checkpoints to the south and west.
not_available All right.
not_available Î¤urning.
not_available Can you park in that block? Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available The fallout radius will include a good part of the Upper West Side.
not_available l'll wait for your call.
not_available How many men on the detail? Eleven.
not_available Hassan's own security, Secret Service and two former agents
not_available Jack Bauer and Renee Walker.
not_available Why is Bauer involved? The president trusts him.
not_available And believe me, he's not someone to be taken lightly.
not_available Ah, he's up against an elite team who will have the advantage of surprise.
not_available Bauer and his people don't stand a chance.
not_available The loss of life is regrettable, Mr.
not_available Weiss.
not_available No one feels this more keenly than a soldier who's led men into battle.
not_available But right now we don't have a choice.
not_available Ethan.
not_available What's going on? Oh, l'm sorry.
not_available l thought you were with the president.
not_available l was.
not_available What are you doing in here? Oh, I asked Mr.
not_available Weiss to pull up the latest White House readiness protocols.
not_available Îe couldn't log on from his computer, so we were trying from yours.
not_available l was also reviewing President Hassan's itinerary to see if we could facilitate a military escort.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Open the door.
not_available I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available Then get out of my way.
not_available Rob.
not_available Ethan, listen.
not_available I
not_available No, you listen to me.
not_available l think I have a pretty good idea what's going on here.
not_available Sit down, Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available There are some things you need to know.
not_available There sure as hell are.
not_available But l'll stay where l am if you don't mind.
not_available Ethan, do what he says.
not_available Sit down, please.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I said go ahead.
not_available Give me your phone.
not_available General.
not_available Get your hands off of me! Wait! This is beyond madness.
not_available The two of you will spend the rest of your lives in prison.
not_available Maybe, Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available But my guess is that one day the country will thank us for it.
not_available Rob.
not_available l'm begging you.
not_available Don't do this.
not_available Don't betray your president.
not_available Ethan? Ethan? All right.
not_available Ethan! 
not_available My God! Ethan! Ethan! Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ethan, here.
not_available Here.
not_available Here.
not_available Call a medic.
not_available We call for help, the first thing he does is get word to the president.
not_available But he's having a heart attack.
not_available We can't just do nothing.
not_available We didn't do nothing.
not_available You gave him his medication.
not_available Well, it's not working.
not_available l realize that you two are close, but this is not an emotional decision.
not_available This is a tactical one.
not_available We wait to acquire Îassan before calling an ambulance.
not_available Understand? What if he doesn't make it that long? We have to pray that he does.
not_available All right? All right.
not_available Come on.
not_available We pick up the service tunnel under Third Avenue.
not_available From there, the trip to McGuire by convoy is less than 30 minutes.
not_available Î¤hank you, Ms.
not_available Walker.
not_available Secretary Kanin, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available l can see on my phone that you just tried to call me.
not_available Please call me back as soon as you can.
not_available Thank you.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Patch me through to McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Îow far are you from an access point into the tunnels? Based on what I'm looking at, less than two miles.
not_available The security detail's already on the move.
not_available Can you get there in time? Yeah, if we haul ass.
not_available And the ambush happens where? At the vehicle, sir.
not_available Remember, the objective is President Hassan.
not_available Do what you have to do to take him alive.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Have him call me back as soon as possible.
not_available Renee.
not_available Secretary Kanin tried to call me.
not_available Now he's not answering his phone.
not_available The operator at McGuire Air Force Base can't find him either.
not_available Something's not right.
not_available Keep your eyes open.
not_available Hold up.
not_available We set? Yeah.
not_available The vehicles to transport the Hassans are 200 meters up the tunnel.
not_available There's a section we couldn't get by.
not_available Agent Dalton, stand by.
not_available We are bringing the family down now.
not_available Did you walk it? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All clear.
not_available Get the family.
not_available This way.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Our S.U.V.'s are a short hike up the tunnel.
not_available Stay together as we move towards them.
not_available Operations.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Patch me through to Secretary Kanin.
not_available Here they come.
not_available Is Hassan with them? Yes.
not_available Masks on.
not_available Take positions.
not_available Wait until the target's in the kill zone.
not_available Remember, we need to take Hassan alive.
not_available Secretary Kanin? Just a minute.
not_available Yes, what is it? Excuse me, sir, but Jack Bauer's calling for Secretary Kanin.
not_available Well, the secretary is busy with me right now.
not_available I understand that, sir.
not_available But Mr.
not_available Bauer's persisting.
not_available Îe says it's very important.
not_available He's holding on line one.
not_available All right, thank you.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Jack, hi.
not_available lt's Rob Weiss.
not_available Sir, we're in a service tunnel under
not_available l'm sorry.

not_available Well, l'll make sure he gets the message.
not_available Mr.
not_available Weiss, I don't think you understand.
not_available l need to talk to Secretary Kanin now.
not_available That's not possible.

not_available Okay? Take the weapon off.
not_available Take the weapon off now! Now! Who are you? 
not_available You're making a huge mistake.
not_available You're American.
not_available Why did you attack us? Because a dirty bomb will be detonated in New York unless we deliver Hassan to the terrorists.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available A ransom demand has been made.
not_available Him for the bomb by 061 5 hours.
not_available Jack, that's less than 20 minutes.
not_available Does the president know about this? She's refusing to deal with the terrorists.
not_available This is General Brucker's operation.
not_available Get up.
not_available What are you doing? l'm gonna get you up to the street level, where l can make a phone call.
not_available There's no time for that.
not_available This is on you now.
not_available You have to deliver Îassan to the terrorists.
not_available l don't take orders from anybody but the president of the United States.
not_available Now, move.
not_available We need to keep moving.
not_available Yes? Why haven't I heard from you? Because I don't know anything.
not_available What does that mean? Are the Americans handing over Hassan or not? Î¤he only information we have is that he's being transported to McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available We lost communication with the security detail about 20 minutes ago.
not_available So President Î¤aylor doesn't intend to give him up.
not_available Samir.
not_available Î¤hink for a minute.
not_available You use that bomb, you lose your leverage.
not_available Î¤he president leaves me no choice.
not_available The blood will be on her hands.
not_available Samir.
not_available Î¤arin? Yes? The president has not responded.
not_available Start the countdown.
not_available You need to stay with the bomb.
not_available Make sure no one interferes with it.
not_available Tarin, did you hear me? Yes, l heard you.
not_available Your name will never be forgotten, my friend.
not_available Your family will be honored above all others.
