not_available Someone stole it from me.not_available This is what she was likenot_available before you sent her to Vermont.not_available Are you suggesting that I readmit her?not_available 
not_available For her sake, if nothing else.not_available Aaron, my wife is gone.not_available We have a priority alert.not_available You've been burrowing into classifiednot_available CTU protocols without authorization.not_available I don't know what you're talking about.not_available Stop.

not_available Cummings.not_available I don't understand the problem.not_available David Palmer was murderednot_available because he was aboutnot_available to expose Walt Cummings' connectionnot_available to the terrorists.not_available When Cummings couldn't pinnot_available Palmer's murder on menot_available he tried to kill me.not_available All that may be true, Jack,not_available but we don't have proof.not_available We can prove that Cummings used Spensernot_available to get Jack's assassin into CTU.not_available All we have is Spenser's word.not_available That's not enough to build a case.not_available You don't have time to build a case.not_available You want the nerve gas,not_available Cummings is your connection.not_available Cummings is the President'snot_available Chief Advisor.not_available How exactly do you suggestnot_available we get to him?not_available I can secretly meet with Mike Novick,not_available enlist his help.not_available How do we know Novick's not in thisnot_available with Cummings?not_available Because I know him.
not_available He'll listen to me.not_available And the President will listen to him.not_available With Novick's help,not_available we can isolate Cummings.not_available Jack, as much as I appreciatenot_available you wanting to be involved,not_available you don't work here anymore.not_available That's exactly the reason whynot_available I should do this.not_available If it backfires,not_available there'll be no fallout on you.not_available I think it's worth a try.not_available 
not_available I agree.not_available It's your call.not_available All right, Jack.not_available But just so we're clear,not_available this is about finding the nerve gas,not_available not getting revenge for David Palmer.not_available Understood.not_available Work out your protocols with Ms.

not_available Six" nerve gasnot_available stolen from the airportnot_available is far more lethalnot_available than the gas we just saw used.not_available If released in a town or city,not_available for example,not_available the cloud will remain lethalnot_available for much longer.not_available It's Jack Bauer.not_available Call me on a secure line.not_available Are we any closer to findingnot_available the canisters?not_available There haven't been any reportsnot_available of progress, Sir.not_available Tell no one.i/not_available Excuse me, Mr.

not_available The bulletin only describesnot_available the missing canisters.not_available No mention of chemical weapons.not_available Good.

not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.not_available No, no! Keep me out of this!not_available The last thing I wanna donot_available is comment to the pressnot_available about the roadblocks coming up.not_available And we can't have any leaksnot_available about the nerve gas.not_available It would just cause a panic.not_available Come in.not_available Pardon me, sir, we found Mrs.
not_available Logan.not_available Is she all right?not_available She is fine, sir.not_available She was hiding in the stables.not_available Stables? What the hell did she thinknot_available she was doing?not_available Mr.
not_available Presidentnot_available I feel awkward mentioning this, butnot_available Mrs.
not_available Logan said some thingsnot_available About David Palmer.not_available Yes, sir.not_available I've heard her conspiracy theories,not_available Aaron.not_available I've heard them all.not_available But thank you for your concern, Aaron.not_available They found my wife.not_available Good.not_available Mr.
not_available President we need to talk.not_available What is it, Walt?not_available I was hoping to spare you from thisnot_available butnot_available I'm afraid Jack Bauernot_available is forcing my hand.not_available He's on his way herenot_available to meet with Mike Novick.not_available Bauer? Why?not_available He's going to accuse menot_available of helping the terroristsnot_available acquire the nerve gas.not_available That's ridiculous.not_available No, sir.not_available It's it's the truth.not_available What did you say?not_available Through a proxy, I leaked informationnot_available to the terroristsnot_available about where the nerve gas was hidden.not_available You have to understand, sir,not_available this gas was never gonna pose a threatnot_available to American lives.not_available Never pose a threat?!not_available People died in the airport!not_available Hostages were killed!not_available We had hoped to limitnot_available the collateral damage.not_available "Collateral damage"?!not_available What are you thinking?not_available This is an unspeakable crime.not_available Waltnot_available you have to answer for this.not_available Mr.
not_available Presidentnot_available it's in your best interestnot_available to hear me outnot_available before you make that phone call.not_available What do you mean "my best interest"?not_available The Sentox gas is being smugglednot_available out of the country by separatistsnot_available who think they're gonna use itnot_available against the Russians.not_available However, that nerve gasnot_available will never reach Russian soil.not_available And you know this how?not_available We control the remote detonatorsnot_available on those gas canisters.not_available As soon as they've reachednot_available the terrorists' base,not_available we'll trigger the canisters by satellitenot_available and release the gas.not_available So everything that happened todaynot_available was just to kill some terrorists?not_available No, the goal is to producenot_available a smoking gun,not_available proof of the existence of weaponsnot_available of mass destruction in Central Asia.not_available This is unbelievable.not_available It's necessary.not_available It will finally give us a pretextnot_available to increase our military presencenot_available in the region,not_available guaranteeing the flow of oilnot_available for the next generation.not_available How dare you?!not_available How dare you act without my consent?not_available How dare you put this administration,not_available this entire country in jeopardy?not_available You're a traitor.not_available No, no, Mr.
not_available President, I am a patriot!not_available Doing what needs to be donenot_available for the continued safetynot_available and wellbeing of this nation!not_available My Godnot_available You gave the ordernot_available to have David Palmer killed?not_available That was an unfortunatenot_available but necessary intervention.not_available He found out too much and we hadnot_available Walt!not_available You're rationalizing murder,not_available the murder of a president.not_available You're going to contact these peoplenot_available and recover the nerve gasnot_available before it leaves the country.not_available I'm afraid I can't do that.not_available 
not_available Why not?not_available I don't know where the nerve gas is.not_available And the man I have working insidenot_available has gone dark, he's unreachable.not_available Now, you'll let things play outnot_available as they arenot_available otherwise, your administrationnot_available will be implicatednot_available and your presidency will be destroyed.not_available It's your choice, Mr.
not_available President.not_available Jack.not_available Thanks for seeing me like this, Mike.not_available What is it?not_available Did you tell anyone we were meeting?not_available Of course not.not_available Son of a bitch!not_available Who did you tell?not_available Who did you tell?!not_available I didn't tell anybody, Jack!not_available Jack Bauer, stay right where you are!not_available Put down your weapons!not_available What's the meaning of this?!not_available Tell your men to stand down!not_available I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.not_available He's here at my request!not_available We have orders to use forcenot_available if necessary.not_available Orders? From who?not_available The President of the United States.not_available Get on your knees.not_available That is affirmative, sir.not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer was apprehendednot_available with no resistance on his part,not_available we're transporting himnot_available back to the retreat now.not_available Thanks.not_available Novick and Bauer have been takennot_available into custody.not_available So we're just gonna locknot_available Mike Novick up?not_available For the time being.not_available But what for?not_available Eventually, he's gonna get out,not_available and he's gonna talk to the press.not_available What can he say?not_available He doesn't know anything.not_available I thought you told menot_available he talked to Jack Bauer.not_available We stopped Bauernot_available before he could give Mike any details.not_available What's he gonna think?!not_available We're detaining him!not_available Bauer was about to divulgenot_available national security secretsnot_available that Mike's not authorized to hear.not_available That's why Mike's being detained.not_available And what about Bauer?not_available He must have talked to other peoplenot_available at CTUnot_available and told them what he knows.not_available As soon as this nerve gasnot_available leaves U.S.
not_available soil,not_available it's gonna be very difficult to provenot_available that either of usnot_available is connected to this in any way.not_available And you're sure that thesenot_available these detonators will work,not_available that the Sentox gas will be releasednot_available before it can be usednot_available against the Russians?not_available Yes.not_available Right now, all you need to donot_available is authorize menot_available to terminate CTU's involvementnot_available in this matter.not_available We'll tell them we've got the situationnot_available under control,not_available and that we'll deal with Bauer,not_available who, after all, is not officiallynot_available affiliated with them any longer.not_available All right.not_available Good.not_available Yes?not_available Mr.
not_available President,not_available I have Mrs.
not_available Logan for you.not_available Not now.not_available Yes, sir.not_available Dunley.not_available What is Jack Bauer doing here,not_available why is he under arrest,not_available and why wasn't I told?not_available Orders of the President.not_available Directly?not_available No.not_available It came through Walt Cummings' office.not_available Okay.not_available Thank you.not_available We're no longer running pointnot_available on the search for the canisters.not_available We've been ordered off by Division.not_available Why?not_available The White House wants their own peoplenot_available to coordinate from now on.not_available That does not make sense,not_available we'll waste hoursnot_available getting another agency up to speednot_available Yeah, I tried to call the President.not_available He's not taking my calls.not_available What about Mike Novick?not_available Jack should be with him now.not_available Novick people say he's unreachable,not_available and Jack's cell goes straight to voice
not_available mail.not_available Something's wrong.not_available Yeah, I know,not_available but I don't know what we can do about it.not_available I do.not_available What?not_available We can disregard the order.not_available We're not disregardingnot_available a presidential order.not_available If we don't,not_available we will not find this nerve gas.not_available Sending Jack Bauer to havenot_available a conversation with Mike Novicknot_available as a private citizen is one thing,not_available but I'm not about to start consideringnot_available disobeying a direct ordernot_available from the White House.not_available That's because you don't havenot_available the experience to know any better.not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan,not_available will you step outside for a moment?not_available I can't have you talk to me like thatnot_available in front of this people.not_available You're right.
not_available I'm sorry.not_available Are we clear about who's in charge here?not_available Yeah, but my advice stands.not_available If this order jeopardizes our chancesnot_available of finding that nerve gas,not_available it's your responsibility to ignore it.not_available At least until we can make our casenot_available to the White House.not_available You also need to learnnot_available to make decisions faster.not_available Billnot_available One more thing that comesnot_available with experience.not_available Lynn,not_available if we don't do everything in our powernot_available to stop these terrorists,not_available we're not doing our job.not_available Okay, disregard the order.not_available Thank you.not_available Is there anything elsenot_available you'd like me to pack for you?not_available Maybe a few of your nicer dresses?not_available I'm being confinednot_available to a psychiatric ward, Evelyn.not_available I don't think there are gonna benot_available any black
not_available tie events.not_available Sorry.not_available How'd this happen?not_available What's that, Mrs.
not_available Logan?not_available Charles and me.not_available I was his confidant.not_available All those years in Congress, mynot_available opinion was the onenot_available that mattered most to him.not_available And now I'mnot_available less than an afterthought.not_available I'm sure the President would be herenot_available if he could.not_available He's the President of the United States,not_available Evelyn.not_available He can do whatever he wants.not_available If he wanted to be here, he would be.not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, you're being movednot_available per the President's orders.not_available Where?not_available To a class three 3 detention facility.not_available On what charges?not_available I was invited here by Mike Novick.not_available Those are my orders, sir.not_available You're Pierce, right?not_available Aaron Pierce.not_available You served under David Palmer.not_available Yes, I did.not_available I need to speak to younot_available just for a moment, please.not_available That's not possible.not_available It concerns David Palmer's killer.not_available All right.not_available David Palmer was assassinatednot_available because he was on the vergenot_available of discovering that the terroristsnot_available that attacked us today were being helpednot_available by someonenot_available within Logan's administration.not_available Who?not_available Walt Cummings.not_available Why would Mr.
not_available Cummingsnot_available be involved with terrorists?not_available I couldn't tell you.not_available But I can tell you thatnot_available the terrorists are now in possessionnot_available of a weaponized nerve gas,not_available and Walt Cummings may benot_available the last chance we havenot_available to stop them in time.not_available Walt Cummings orderednot_available the assassination of David Palmer.not_available I know that's hard to believe,not_available but I can prove it, it's true.not_available Actually, it's not that hard to believe.not_available The First Lady also thinks someonenot_available in the administration was involved.not_available Your primary responsibilitynot_available as lead agentnot_available is to protect the Presidentnot_available of the United States.not_available Someone in his administrationnot_available is undermining his authority.not_available That is equivalent to a coup d'Ãtat.not_available Agent Pierce, pleasenot_available Please, I need your help.not_available Bauer's escaped.not_available When?not_available I didn't get a code alert.not_available My comm's down.not_available Call it in,not_available have agents cover the west gate,not_available That's where he was headed.not_available 
not_available What about you?not_available I'll take your post.not_available Go.not_available Yes, sir.not_available That was NSA.not_available CTU hasn't transferrednot_available the search operationnot_available in their jurisdiction yet.not_available What's the problem?not_available I don't know.not_available But you need to call Lynn McGill,not_available make sure we're in charge.not_available I've been avoiding his callsnot_available because he's just gonna ask me whynot_available I'm pulling CTU off the search operationnot_available and I don't know what to tell him!not_available You don't have to tell him anything.not_available You're the President.not_available Agent Pierce,not_available we're in the middle of a meeting,not_available if you don't mind.not_available Mr.
not_available President,not_available my name is Jack Bauer,not_available and I'm sorry to have to confront younot_available like thisnot_available but your chief of staffnot_available is withholding informationnot_available that is vital to this nation's security.not_available Stop this!not_available I'm the President of the United States,not_available get your hands off this man!not_available Agent Pierce, do something!not_available I am, Mr.
not_available President.not_available I'm upholding my oath to protect you.not_available That won't have any effect, sir.not_available I've overridden the distress line.not_available Mr.
not_available Cummings is guiltynot_available of conspiring with terrorists.not_available He facilitated the theftnot_available of a military
not_available grade nerve gas,not_available and today is responsiblenot_available for the death of at least 3 people,not_available including David Palmer.not_available I know about that,not_available but there's an explanation.not_available What do you mean, you know about that?not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, please, I just found outnot_available a couple of minutes ago.not_available It's very complicated.not_available I don't know what this man has told you,not_available but we must find that nerve gas now,not_available and I mean immediately,not_available before it is too late.not_available It's already too late.not_available What do you mean?not_available Apparently, it's on its waynot_available out of the country.not_available Where is it?!not_available He told me he doesn't know!not_available He's lying to you, sir!not_available The man I have inside has gone dark,not_available I don't know.not_available I'm done talking with you,not_available you understand me?not_available Now you read my file.not_available First thing I'll do,not_available I'll take out your right eye,not_available then I'll move overnot_available and I'll get your left.not_available And then I'll cut you.not_available I'm going to keep cutting younot_available until I get the informationnot_available that I need, you understand me?not_available So for the last time,not_available where is the nerve gas?not_available I don't know.not_available Stop!not_available Stop! Stop! I'll tell you!not_available I'll tell you!not_available What the hell!not_available It's it's on a freighternot_available leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.not_available How is it concealed?!not_available In a containernot_available carrying medical supplies.not_available What's the container number?not_available I don't know.not_available What's the number?!not_available I don't know!not_available I'd tell you, I swear!not_available Mr.
