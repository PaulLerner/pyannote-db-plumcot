not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Î¤his is Meredith Reed.
not_available Ms.
not_available Reed.
not_available Î¤he people you think are responsible for kilIing Hassan were not working alone.
not_available Î¤hey were being funded and managed by people working inside the Russian government.
not_available How do you know this? l'm being set up, just like you were yesterday.
not_available l need to get this evidence to you.
not_available Arlo got a cell phone intercept report off N.S.A.'s Echelon.
not_available Key words: "Jack Bauer." We confirmed the voiceprint.
not_available Reed's connection to Hassan means she'd be highly motivated to help him.
not_available Take it to the press.
not_available That's his next move.
not_available This is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir
not_available Bauer and the evidence.
not_available l need to find Jack or else they're gonna kill him.
not_available lf we can get to him, we can expose the cover
not_available up.
not_available Jack's gotta be working with someone.
not_available Who? l don't know.
not_available I never saw him.
not_available But Jack showed up with stateofthe
not_available art weapons and comms.
not_available Pavel, do you see Bauer? If you have a shot, take it.
not_available I've got him.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Everything's all clear up on top, Jack.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Do exactly what l say.
not_available Move! 
not_available He knew it was a trap.
not_available Î¤he evidence is on this memory card.
not_available Î¤ake it.
not_available When you see it, you'll know it's real.
not_available The hit on Hassan is all arranged.
not_available Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.
not_available l already know that you killed Renee Walker.
not_available What l want to know is the name of the Russian pig inside your government that gave the order.
not_available Where's the SIM card for your phone? You dumb bastard.
not_available You swallowed it.
not_available Î¤his is for my friend.
not_available You've reached the mobile number of President Charles Logan.
not_available The following takes place between 1:00 p.m.
not_available and 2:00 p.m.
not_available As a principal player in this unprecedented and historic peace initiative, Secretary of State Kanin's untimely decision to withdraw for health reasons was a difficult one.
not_available However, the president wishes it to be known that in Secretary Kanin's absence and per his own recommendation, she has sought and gained the counsel of former President Charles Logan.
not_available Now, the president is acutely aware that this decision bears some controversy.
not_available But President Logan's experience with foreign policy and his skills in negotiation have already proven to be a great asset in these final hours before the signing of the peace agreement with the Islamic Republic.
not_available Once Mrs.
not_available Hassan
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available and the I.R.K.
not_available delegation
not_available Your car to the heliport is ready and waiting downstairs.
not_available Îas, uh, President Suvarov's plane arrived yet? lt should be touching down at J.F.K.
not_available within the next 20 to 30 minutes, and then he'll be choppered in to the 93rd Street Heliport.
not_available Î¤hank you, Ellen.
not_available Î¤ell them l'll be down in a moment.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hassan and the I.R.K.
not_available delegation have hashed out a few remaining points of protocol with President Taylor, 
not_available the signing will commence as scheduled.
not_available Î¤ell me you have a Iead on Bauer.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available We tracked him to an adjacent building, but Bauer managed to get out of the cordon along with the reporter, Meredith Reed.
not_available Also, he's kiIled PaveI.
not_available l've taken jurisdictional control of the scene from N.Y.P.D.
not_available We should be able to keep this contained, but it's not gonna matter if Bauer's already passed along the evidence he got from Dana Walsh to the press.
not_available The story's going to come out.
not_available No, not necessarily.
not_available We still might be able to manage this.
not_available Look, sir, I
not_available l know you've told me that you're committed to seeing this through, but you can still extricate yourself from this mess.
not_available There's no evidence of your involvement yet.
not_available You can still delay the press announcement.
not_available It's too late for that, Jason.
not_available Î¤he White Îouse press secretary just announced my role in the peace process.
not_available Î¤here is no turning back.
not_available And there's something else you should know.
not_available Bauer didn'tjust kill Pavel.
not_available He butchered him.
not_available Îe beat him savagely, and then he eviscerated him.
not_available l don't think Bauer's just looking to expose the Russians' involvement in the pIot against Hassan.
not_available Î¤his guy's out for blood.
not_available Then you better find him and stop him, hadn't you? Yes, sir.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available l'm not going any further till you tell me what happened back there.
not_available You killed that man, didn't you? Ms.
not_available Reed, your life is in danger.
not_available You want to get through this thing alive, you're gonna do exactly what I say.
not_available Do you understand? Jack, l can't get a locate on the number you called from this cell phone.
not_available lt's restricted.
not_available I'm gonna have to route a back trace.
not_available Can you do it here? 
not_available No.
not_available I need the equipment at my place.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you got a location.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Who is it you're looking for? Someone who can give me the names of everyone else involved.
not_available And what are you gonna do when you find them? It doesn't concern you.
not_available How can l trust you if you don't tell me what you're doing? Because I'm not the person who's trying to kill you.
not_available The video file l gave you is the only proof of the Russians' complicity in President Îassan's assassination, but the conspiracy doesn't end with the Russians.
not_available People within our own government are trying to cover this up, including President Taylor.
not_available Why would the president want this covered up? Because she's trying to keep the peace accord alive with the l.R.K.
not_available She knows if Dalia Hassan finds out that the Russians had a hand in the death of her husband, she'll never sign the agreement.
not_available What do you want from me? l need you to break the story in case I don't make it.
not_available l think President Hassan deserves that, don't you? Let me see your cell phone.
not_available Okay.
not_available Wait.
not_available What are you doing? They've seen you with me.
not_available Î¤he authorities are going to start monitoring your usuaI forms of communication.
not_available You can't go home, you can't go back to your office.
not_available Is there anyone that you work with that you trust? Uh, my editor, Gary Klausner.
not_available You need to try and get him the evidence.
not_available l can get you as far as a pay phone.
not_available After that, you're on your own.
not_available l'm glad we were able to come to terms.
not_available So am I.
not_available Î¤hank you, Madam President, for your patience with me.
not_available I am still new to this.
not_available You are a natural leader, Dalia, and you have a superb adviser in Minister Jamot.
not_available l appreciate the endorsement, Madam President.
not_available Pardon me for interrupting.
not_available We were just finishing up.
not_available Dalia Hassan.
not_available Charles Logan.
not_available l'm honored to finally meet you, Mrs.
not_available Hassan.
not_available l was a great admirer of your husband.
not_available I'm so sorry for your loss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available President Î¤aylor tells me you were instrumental in convincing the Russian delegates to stay at the negotiating table.
not_available l'm honored to play even a smaIl part in such an historic event.
not_available Madam President, may I have a few moments with you? l'll see you at the signing.
not_available You still haven't found out how Logan convinced the Russians to stay? l've investigated it, but l learned nothing from the delegates.
not_available l can have our intelligence service Iook into it.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you, Jamot.
not_available l trust President Î¤aylor.
not_available We have to assume that if she involved Logan, it was for a good reason.
not_available Î¤he operation to capture Jack Bauer was unsuccessful.
not_available He got away, along with the evidence that he took from Dana Walsh.
not_available You said you had the situation under control.
not_available Clearly, I was overly optimistic.
not_available And in my optimism, l neglected to tell you that Bauer made contact with a journalist.
not_available Meredith Reed.
not_available My God.
not_available You need to call her publisher right away.
not_available Deny any foreknowledge of whatever evidence she has and demand that they do not run the story.
not_available You're suggesting muzzling the press? Îave you forgotten that freedom of the press is constitutionally protected? You are the president, for God's sake.
not_available Invoke national security.
not_available You tell them this story will start a war.
not_available Innocent lives will be lost.
not_available New lies to cover old ones.
not_available The time has passed for hand
not_available wringing, Madam President.
not_available lf you don't use the power of your office to shut this story down, your peace agreement won't be the only casualty.
not_available You don't need me to tell you the damage that your criminal prosecution will do to this country.
not_available This country survived your presidency.
not_available But it won't survive yours.
not_available Me
not_available l inherited my presidency.
not_available l was never nearly as popular as you are.
not_available And most of my alleged misdeeds never made the press.
not_available But if you were to bare your sins to the people who put you in office
not_available You are a beacon of righteousness, not only for Americans but for the rest of the world.
not_available You are the president who had her own daughter arrested rather than see justice go unserved.
not_available You're poison.
not_available l never should have let you to do this.
not_available With due respect, Madam President, l
not_available l gave recommendations, l made whatever arrangements needed to be made, but every decision was yours.
not_available Let's not pretend otherwise.
not_available l've
not_available l've studied you for a number of years, Allison.
not_available l pride myself on being a good judge of character.
not_available You're a smart woman.
not_available You've always known what needed to be done and were willing to do it.
not_available Which is why l know you will call Meredith Reed's publisher and make sure he kills the story.
not_available l would suggest you do it now.
not_available You, uh
not_available You have a signing ceremony to prepare for.
not_available And I need to go meet President Suvarov.
not_available Chloe, you need to see this.
not_available What is it? 
not_available l just tapped into a live feed from Pillar's team.
not_available This guy was found strung up and sliced open in an abandoned building across from the department store.
not_available Îe's got Russian papers on him, but I can't make 'em out
not_available the rez is too low.
not_available Looks like someone left a sniper rifle at the scene.
not_available What's the caliber? Bring it up.
not_available Î¤hey tagged it as a .308 Springfield.
not_available Î¤hat's the gun that killed Renee.
not_available That's gotta be the shooter.
not_available Jack did this, and you still think you're gonna be able to talk him down? l gotta try.
not_available Pillar and his people are just gonna kill him, and I can't let that happen.
not_available Got a match from the department store security feed
not_available 82% .
not_available Î¤hat's the guy helping Jack? Yeah.
not_available James RickerEx
not_available Green Beret, Special Ops.
not_available Îe served with Jack in the Gulf before Jack was enlisted by C.T.U.
not_available Just one problem.
not_available Îe's dead.
not_available Says he was killed in a chemical plant explosion in Basra seven years ago.
not_available Yeah, well, then he must have a twin who was there when Jack reversed the ambush.
not_available You better go back to your station.
not_available Pillar's watchdog is getting suspicious.
not_available Arlo, cross
not_available reference Ricker's photo with the state D.M.V.
not_available database.
not_available Îe must be living under an alias in the city.
not_available We find Ricker, we find Jack.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah? You get the location? You didn't tell me that was Logan's phone that I was tracing, Jack.
not_available Does it matter? 
not_available Yeah, it kind of does.
not_available l think you know it, too, or else you would've been straight with me.
not_available Listen, taking out a bunch of Russian spooks is one thing.
not_available Moving on an ex
not_available president, that's quite another.
not_available That's a serious line you're crossing there, pal.
not_available I know exactly what I'm doing.
not_available Are you gonna give me the location or not? Logan's in a vehicle.
not_available He's moving west from the U.N.
not_available l'm syncing up with the Secret Service deployment grid.
not_available l'll upload his route to your tablet.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Okay, I've got it.
not_available Listen, Jack, I sure hope you know what you're doing.
not_available Because this path you're on, there ain't no coming back from it.
not_available l wasn't planning on coming back.
not_available Look, you're right.
not_available You've already done more than I had a right to ask for.
not_available l want you to start erasing all your connections to me.
not_available Jim, thanks for everything.
not_available Good
not_available bye.
not_available Oh.
not_available Î¤hank you.
not_available Are you sure that's all you need? Should l call the doctor? lt's just a headache.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You wanted to see me, Madam President? Yes, Tim.
not_available Please sit down.
not_available You remember the reporter C.T.U.
not_available arrested last night? Yes, uh, Meredith Reed.
not_available lt has been brought to my attention that she intends to publish an unfounded story regarding Omar Hassan's murder.
not_available What is she gonna be writing? l need you to contact the F.B.l., have them search the SundayMagazine offices, locate Reed and seize whatever evidence she purports to have.
not_available Um, Il
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Îer allegations are false, but the allegations alone could derail the peace process.
not_available Even so, Madam President, you have to be aware, they'll accuse you of censoring the press.
not_available Tim, l did not ask for your counsel.
not_available l know exactly what I'm ordering you to do, so please just do it.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Hey, drop
not_available off and receiving? Ah.
not_available Straight ahead.
not_available Right there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Just make sure Duggan knows he's covering the Logan profile.
not_available Î¤ell him we'll work out the byline Iater.
not_available Editor's desk.
not_available Î¤his is Klausner.
not_available Gary, it's me.
not_available Look, a
not_available are you alone? Can you speak freely? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, whwhat's going on? 
not_available l don't have a lot of time.
not_available l have a lead on a story.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available l have a digital video recording indicating that the I.R.K.
not_available terrorists who killed Hassan were being funded and run by Russian operatives.
not_available YYou sure it's legit? Where did you get it? 
not_available From Jack Bauer.
not_available Bauer? 
not_available The man's a fugitive.
not_available Look, Gary, it's really not safe for me to talk.
not_available l'll explain more when I see you.
not_available Can you meet me? Sure, of course.
not_available All right, that diner with the coffee you hate.
not_available l can be there in, uh, 1 5 minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available And, Gary, don't tell anyone.
not_available All right? l got it.
not_available Meredith.
not_available Be safe.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You too.
not_available Î¤here's no need to panic.
not_available Do you know what he did to Pavel? He was beaten savagely, gutted like a pig, his men shot dead.
not_available l'm
not_available I'm sorry to hear that, but we both knew that, uh, Bauer would be a difficult problem to solve.
not_available You know what he's doing, don't you? Îe's eliminating everyone involved, working his way up.
not_available How long before he gets to me? That's not going to happen.
not_available How can you be so sure? Because you told me yourself your man would never talk, and if that's true, then nobody outside of your inner circle can point the finger at you.
not_available l promise you, Bauer's never going to know.
not_available And on the upside, his recent activities have given us a bit of an advantage.
not_available What advantage? C.T.U.'s orders concerning him have been upgraded to "shoot on sight." First you have to find him.
not_available Î¤hey're going to find him.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He can't stay under the radar forever.
not_available l'll keep you posted.
not_available Come in! We're under assault! We're trapped in the 4th Street underpass! Î¤his is unit L.E.Z.
not_available 1 requesting immediate backup.
not_available Both entrances are blocked! We are boxed in! Oh, that's
not_available that's Jack Bauer.
not_available That's got to be.
not_available Did you hear what I said? That's Jack Bauer! Don't just sit there! He's coming for me! Sir, stay in the vehicle.
not_available We're armored and the glass is bulletproof.
not_available CIose the door! 
not_available Î¤he assailant is masked.
not_available It may be Jack Bauer.
not_available Close the door! Secure the vehicle! Close the door! 
not_available Stay down, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Get out! Hurry! 
not_available Kill him! 
not_available Mr.
not_available President, get up, or I will kill you right here.
not_available Move! 
not_available l just got your flash.
not_available What'd you find out about Ricker? You were right.
not_available D.M.V.
not_available records show Ricker living in Suffolk County under the name Simon Strocker.
not_available l tried to confirm, found out he moved from there 1 8 months ago, but he left a forwarding address with the postal service
not_available it's right here in SoHo.
not_available Hey, Devon, what's going on? Pillar's requesting backup for the team in the field.
not_available Why? 
not_available You didn't hear? Jack Bauer just kidnapped Charles Logan.
not_available Îow the hell did he pull that off? Charles Logan? l need to hear what's going on in that room.
not_available Follow me.
not_available How far out are you? 
not_available We're approaching the tunnel now.
not_available Îow the hell did Secret Service let this happen? Bauer hit the Î¤own Car with tear gas.
not_available The agents were too incapacitated to pursue.
not_available P.D.'s got the tunnel locked down.
not_available l'm working on getting you schematics.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available C.T.U.! Make a hole! Where did Bauer take President Logan? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available You must have seen something.
not_available Come on, tell me you saw something.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available Nothing? No one saw anything.
not_available Eden, they went through an underground service gate.
not_available I need those schematics.
not_available Sending them to you now.
not_available Go.
not_available Kirsch, take the corridor.
not_available Brown, you're down there.
not_available Ames, you're with me.
not_available Remember, unless it poses an immediate threat to President Logan, you shoot Bauer on sight and you shoot to kill.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Through here.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I said look at me! You're gonna tell me everything I want to know.
not_available Jack, you're making a mistake.
not_available Don't you even try and pretend you're not a part of this.
not_available l found the man who killed Renee Walker, the Russian operative Pavel Tokarev.
not_available l got his cell phone.
not_available The last call he got was from you.
not_available l know how it looks.
not_available You got to let me explain.
not_available Explain what? Î¤hat you sent for him to kill me? You sent him to kill me, right? Yes, damn it, yes! Why did you take out a hit on Renee Walker? I had nothing to do with that! l was brought in after that happened.
not_available Who brought you in? President Î¤aylor needed my help to bring the Russians back to the table.
not_available ll
not_available l called my sources in Moscow.
not_available Î¤hey told me that people in their government were behind Hassan's assassination.
not_available l told the Russian delegation l had evidence of that fact and the names of everybody involved.
not_available It was just to keep them at the conference.
not_available What evidence? lt doesn't exist.
not_available l was playing poker.
not_available It was a bluff.
not_available It worked.
not_available lt kept Î¤aylor's peace agreement on the table, but you were determined to screw things up.
not_available Easy, Jack! Jack! No, no! l admit, I was part of the cover
not_available up, but l'm not part of the Russian conspiracy.
not_available l had nothing to do with the terrorist attack or your friend's death.
not_available ll
not_available l'm not the bad guy here.
not_available But you know who is.
not_available You know the person inside the Russian government who's giving the orders.
not_available I want that name.
not_available JackJackGive me the name! 
not_available You got five seconds before I put a bullet through your head.
not_available No! You don't have to do that! Five.
not_available Four.
not_available Î¤hree
not_available I'll tell you.
not_available Mikhail Novakovich! He's the head of the Russian delegation.
not_available Îe's been trying to kill the peace treaty from the start.
not_available You're lying.
not_available No, no, no! I'm not lying to you! You got my call off of Pavel's phone.
not_available Check the previous calls.
not_available Î¤here's a dozen more from Novakovich.
not_available I'm telling you.
not_available Îe's the one you want.
not_available Shut up! 
not_available Say another word, and I'll drop you right here.
not_available Go.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available No.
not_available No, please.
not_available Don't kill me, Jack.
not_available lf I was gonna kill you, you'd already be dead.
not_available Bauer was just here.
not_available Find him! Mr.
not_available President? Mr.
not_available President? Are you okay? Can you hear me? Eden, I need a med unit at the 49th junction.
not_available On its way.
not_available Is it Bauer? 
not_available No.
not_available lt's the president.
not_available He's unconscious.
not_available Bauer escaped.
not_available l'm gonna need you to redirect the pursuit.
not_available l'll stay with the president.
not_available Understood.
not_available They still might catch up to him.
not_available They haven't yet.
not_available Do you have Ricker's file? Yeah, including his current address.
not_available l'm sending it to you now.
not_available How are you planning to handle this? We can't send any tactical units to pick this guy up without Pillar finding out about it.
not_available l'm not using any of them.
not_available Who are you going to get? All of our agents are deployed.
not_available Î¤here's nobody to send.
not_available There's one.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian! l just saw the flash from Division.
not_available They approved your request to release Agent Ortiz into your custody? Yeah, l'm in a hurry, so
not_available What do you think you're doing? Îe's a noncooperative witness who is facing federal charges.
not_available l'm still in charge of U.N.
not_available Security and you've taken away all my resources.
not_available And not that it's any of your business, but Ortiz designed the entire U.N.
not_available operation.
not_available The signing is in less than two hours.
not_available Îis assistance in the field is vital.
not_available l'm going to have to clear this with Pillar.
not_available Do what you want.
not_available But to me you have bigger problems, like not finding Jack Bauer.
not_available A day ofstartling events in New York has resonated around the globe.
not_available Shortly after the kidnapping and murder of Kamistani President Omar Hassan today, the I.R.K.
not_available parliament unanimously approved the ascension of Dalia Hassan to the office ofpresident of Kamistan.
not_available In the wake of Hassan's death
not_available Are you Meredith? Yes.
not_available There's a Gary Klausner on the phone for you.
not_available It's up by the cashier.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Î¤hanks.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Meredith, the F.B.l.
not_available is here.
not_available Showed up before I could leave.
not_available They're looking for you, questioning everyone, including me.
not_available You didn't tell them anything, did you? Of course not.
not_available But they've got an executive order from the president.
not_available They say you're in possession of materials that pose a national security risk.
not_available lt's a cover
not_available up, Gary.
not_available The White House is trying to suppress the story.
not_available You can't let them.
not_available Look, until we clear this up, you have to protect that evidence.
not_available l told them l haven't had any contact with you, but for all l know they're tracing this call.
not_available You better get the hell out of there.
not_available And go where? Mr.
not_available Klausner.
not_available We said no communication outside of our presence.
not_available I'm canceling an appointment.
not_available Gary, they're going to bury the truth.
not_available Not if I can help it.
not_available l'll try to put a call in to Ed Sampson at the Justice Department, but until then lay low.
not_available Now go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Where are we going? I have to go to the U.N.
not_available Division has given you a temporary furlough into my custody.
not_available Since you had earlier command of U.N.
not_available security, l need your help coordinating protocols and deployment for the signing ceremony.
not_available And Pillar's okay with this? l'm still provisional director of operations.
not_available I don't need his consent.
not_available So, are you coming, or would you rather wait here for your federal prosecution? Let's go.
not_available l'll take him from here.
not_available You want to tell me what's really going on? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You were right about Jack.
not_available He is working with somebody.
not_available lt's James Ricker, ex
not_available C.l.A.
not_available op.
not_available We found him living at a place on Mercer Street under the alias Simon Strocker.
not_available Maybe he's still with the company.
not_available No.
not_available I checked with Langley.
not_available He was listed as deceased.
not_available Likely he's gone into business dealing arms or intel.
not_available ln any case, he's not going to be happy we tracked him down.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Why are you telling me this? l need you to talk to him, get him to tell us where Jack is.
not_available Are you good with that, or have you still not taken sides? l want to expose this cover
not_available up as much as you.
not_available l'm in.
not_available Good.
not_available Log sheets will show you accompanying me to the U.N.
not_available l've secured you a separate vehicle waiting at the gate.
not_available ls there any more intel on Jack? Has he resurfaced yet? Yeah, you could say that.
not_available Sir, l just received word.
not_available President Suvarov's plane has touched down at Kennedy Airport.
not_available Tell lvan to bring the car.
not_available l want to be at the U.N.
not_available when the president arrives.
not_available Where's Novakovich? l'm not going to ask you again.
not_available 1 1th
not_available How do l get up there? Secure elevator inside of garage.
not_available Where's your key card? l don't have one.
not_available Where is your key card? I don't have one.
not_available l swear.
not_available Îis personal guards have them at elevator.
not_available How many? Two.
not_available And upstairs? One outside the suite, two inside, another by elevator.
not_available Where else? Where else? That's all I know.
not_available Do you really need an arsenal? Better to have it than to not.
not_available Besides, Ricker's a trained killer.
not_available Îe's gone to a lot of trouble to stay off the grid.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available l also have to consider the possibility that Jack's with him.
not_available Listen, Chloe, I can't be worried about Jack anymore, not after what you told me he did to Logan.
not_available Obviously Logan's part of the conspiracy.
not_available Îe terrorized a tunnel fuIl of commuters with automatic weapon fire.
not_available He shot Secret Service agents.
not_available He shot to wound.
not_available Îe's careless, and he only cares about revenge.
not_available Does that sound like the man you know, like the man you're trying to save? This is about exposing the Russians' cover
not_available up.
not_available It's not about Jack.
not_available Are you sure about that? Because if Jack's there and he makes any move other than complete surrender, l'm putting him down.
not_available You still want me to go? I don't really have a choice.
not_available Whatever happens, call me at the U.N.
not_available You got it.
not_available You'll approach the rostrum immediately prior to the signing ceremony and take a seat here in position three, next to your mother.
not_available l'm honored.
not_available But is that appropriate? I may be her daughter, but I don't have any official role in the government.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Ms.
not_available Îassan? There's a call on your father's secure line, a woman demanding to speak with your mother.
not_available She's in a meeting.
not_available That's what I said, but this woman is quite insistent.
not_available Who is she? She won't say.
not_available We're done, Ms.
not_available Hassan.
not_available I'll see you in the staging area.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Line two.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Îello.

not_available l know who you are.
not_available What do you think you're doing calling here? l know I'm the last person that either of you wants to talk to right now.
not_available You're right.
not_available l'm hanging up now.
not_available No, please, please.
not_available Your mother needs to hear what l have to say before she signs the agreement with President Taylor.
not_available What is it that is so important? l
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l
not_available l need to speak to your mother directly.
not_available Îaven't you caused my mother enough pain? Leave us alone! lt's about the people who really murdered your father.
not_available What are you talking about? We know who was responsible.
not_available What you don't know is, those people were working under the orders of Russian agents.
not_available What? 
not_available Hello? When your mother gets back, have her call me at this number.
not_available Can you take this down? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's 21 2555
not_available 01 21 .
not_available l'll explain everything to her then.
not_available Wait! Meredith Reed? F.B.I.
not_available Get your hands where we can see 'em.
not_available What
not_available What is this? What is this? You have no right to take that.
not_available l
not_available l haven't done anything wrong.
not_available What is this? You're under arrest.
not_available l
not_available l've done nothing wrong.
not_available l've done nothing wrong! 
not_available Yes? Mr.
not_available Woods, ma'am.
not_available l've just received word from the F.B.I.
not_available Reed is in custody and they've secured a data card they found on her.
not_available No one sees what's on it but me.
not_available Understood.
not_available Watch it.
not_available All right.
not_available Sir, we'll take it from here.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available I'm riding with him to the hospital.
not_available Give him some space.
not_available No
not_available Novakovich.
not_available Bauer knows.
not_available Warn Novakovich Bauer's coming after him.
not_available Sir, we gotta get going.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Just do what you can for him here.
not_available I understand.
not_available Yes? Mr.
not_available Novakovich? Hello? Hello? 
not_available lt's Berkov.
not_available We've been attacked.
not_available lt was Bauer.
not_available Where's Novakovich? He's dead.
not_available Everyone is dead.
not_available Berkov, did Novakovich say anything to Bauer? 
not_available I need an ambulance.
not_available Just answer my question.
not_available What did Novakovich say to Bauer? Nothing.
not_available Bauer just came in shooting.
not_available But he was bleeding.
not_available l think he was wounded by one of the guards.
not_available An ambulance is on the way.
not_available Go.
not_available Novakovich is dead.
not_available Bauer killed him, killed all of his men.
not_available l don't know if Novakovich said anything to Bauer though.
not_available Yuri.
not_available Help me.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Yuri.
not_available Charles Logan.
not_available l was under the impression you were going to be at the heliport for my arrival.
not_available Yes, well
not_available I ran into some trouble.
not_available l'm afraid I have bad news.
not_available lt appears that Mikhail Novakovich was just murdered by Jack Bauer.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bauer learned that, uh, Novakovich was responsible for ordering and coordinating Omar Hassan's assassination, as well as the rest of Samir's activities.
not_available Where would he get that idea? 
not_available From me! The lunatic was gonna kill me, Yuri.
not_available What can I say? Think of it as, uh, sacrificing a rook for a king.
not_available Then Bauer has no idea that Novakovich was operating under my orders? None.
not_available According to a witness, Mikhail didn't have a chance to give you up, even if he wanted to.
not_available As far as Bauer is concerned, the trail ended with Novakovich, and he's being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the city.
not_available And ll've heard that, uh
not_available he's been wounded.
not_available Wounded.
not_available There is nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal.
not_available Look, if you're so worried about Bauer, you never should have given the order to kill Renee Walker.
not_available That's what stirred up the hornet's nest.
not_available lf I had known that you were going to find out about our activities and use that information to blackmail me into signing Taylor's peace agreement, l wouldn't have bothered with the woman.
not_available Water under the bridge, Yuri.
not_available l needed an opportunity to put myself back in the game.
not_available l'm sorry that it has come at your expense.
not_available You wouldn't begrudge an old friend his second chance in the sun.
not_available All right, then, l will, uh
not_available I will meet you at the United Nations as soon as I can.
