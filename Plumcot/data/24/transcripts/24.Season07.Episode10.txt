not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Madam President, we have your husband, but he's sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.
not_available Is my husband going to be okay? We're not gonna know anything until the doctors see him.
not_available Since your husband was the only leverage that Dubaku had left it's safe to say that he's trying to leave the country now.
not_available Whatever we're gonna do, we're gonna have to do it fast.
not_available Whatever it takes, I want that son of a bitch found.
not_available Have someone find my daughter Olivia and bring her to me.
not_available What is it that's so important for my mother to steal me away while I'm trying to do business? It's your father.
not_available He's been shot.
not_available My God, l
not_available Do you think I am a fool, Mr.
not_available Burnett? If anything should happen to me on my way out of the country a data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved will be sent to theJustice Department.
not_available You told me that once Dubaku served his purpose, you'd take him out.
not_available Why are we still helping him? He's threatening to expose us using a database he's kept with names and accounts of everyone involved.
not_available Including mine? We don't know where the file is, so you better pray that he gets away.
not_available I'm begging you, Marik
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Don't move! Get on your knees now! Where is Dubaku? 
not_available Who? 
not_available Don't play games with me! Ik√© Dubaku! 
not_available You know this man? 
not_available She was going to meet him.
not_available When the car arrives, we would like you to go with the driver so that we could follow you back to Dubaku.
not_available You want her to go and face him? It's the only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available You keep her safe, you hear me? We will.
not_available You're less than a mile behind the target car.
not_available I got Metro P.D.
not_available Trying to build a roadblock around us.
not_available We can't afford to lose them, Jack.
not_available I gave this woman my word we'd protect her.
not_available Get out slowly! Get out of the vehicle slowly! She's a federal agent! She is a federal agent! 
not_available Your girlfriend's been turned by the F.B.I.
not_available If you let her come to you, you're risking your chances of escape.
not_available I'll call my driver, have him take care of her.
not_available No.
not_available I'll take care of her.
not_available The following takes place between 5:00 p.m.
not_available And 6:00 p.m.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, under my authority.
not_available Sean, I need to talk to you.
not_available Is it important? You tell me.
not_available Did you issue a federal warrant on this vehicle? What? 
not_available I found a digital footprint on server four's backup partition.
not_available It originated from your station.
not_available I'd like to know what the hell is going on.
not_available Keep your voice down.
not_available You want to get us caught? I sent out the warrant to sideline Bauer and Renee.
not_available They were closing in on Dubaku.
not_available I thought you said Dubaku's on his way out of the country.
not_available He is, but his girlfriend's talking to F.B.I.
not_available They used her to track him.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I took care of it.
not_available Bauer and Renee are in police custody.
not_available By the time they're released, Dubaku will be long gone.
not_available Are you sure? Positive.
not_available Why didn't you just tell me what's happening? 'Cause I knew you'd react like this.
not_available Last thing I need right now is one of your meltdowns.
not_available Now listen.
not_available I got you into this, and I'm gonna get you out of it but not if you start panicking.
not_available You gotta keep it together.
not_available I'm just really scared, you know? I know.
not_available I am too.
not_available I'm just a little better at hiding it than you are.
not_available I've got everything covered.
not_available I ran a bounce tap into the conference room's speakerphone that they'll never find and I can hear everything they're saying.
not_available Now sit at your station.
not_available Try and act normal.
not_available Let me worry about Bauer and Renee.
not_available Okay? 
not_available The man that we were tracking is responsible for today's terrorist attack.
not_available If you don't let us go, he's gonna get away.
not_available Look, my captain's on the phone with his superior.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available You've gotta let us go.
not_available That warrant had to be sent out by one of Dubaku's operatives.
not_available I know.
not_available Then Dubaku knows that Marika is working with us.
not_available He will kill her, Jack.
not_available We should not have used her like this.
not_available We didn't have a choice.
not_available She was our only asset.
not_available She's not an asset, Jack.
not_available She's a human being.
not_available Colonel.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Still looking for us, sir.
not_available I'll do this quickly.
not_available Wait there for me.
not_available Samuel.
not_available What is it? Sweetheart, what's wrong? 
not_available Give me your cell phone.
not_available My cell phone
not_available I know you've been talking to the F.B.I.
not_available You've been working for them, Marika.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I trusted you.
not_available How could you do this to me? The F.B.I.
not_available Told me who you really are about the terrible things you've done.
not_available And you believed them? 
not_available They showed me proof! They showed you lies created by my enemies.
not_available You don't know me, and you don't know my country.
not_available I brought peace to Sangala.
not_available No.
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available Don't be afraid.
not_available It's just when I heard what you had done it was like you had driven a dagger through my heart.
not_available I'm a forgiving man, Marika.
not_available I still want you to come with me.
not_available I want to give you the life that I promised.
not_available I can't go with you.
not_available I don't know who you are! You do.
not_available You do.
not_available L
not_available lf you look past your fear, you'll see that I am still the man that you fell in love with.
not_available I won't leave without you, Marika.
not_available All right.
not_available You won't be disappointed.
not_available Come.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available May be close.
not_available Your story was verified by F.B.I.
not_available I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
not_available Did F.B.I.
not_available Find Marika Donoso? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You can ask 'em yourself.
not_available Agent Moss wants to talk to you.
not_available Larry, where are they? Where's Marika? 
not_available We lost the cell phone signal.
not_available What do you mean? What happened? Don't know.
not_available Just went dead about three minutes ago.
not_available Where? 
not_available In an alley on the corner of N and 10th Street.
not_available I'm looking through traffic cams now.
not_available All right.
not_available We're goin' to comm.
not_available Stand by.
not_available They lost Marika's signal.
not_available That's it.
not_available There.
not_available Jack, we got a make on the car.
not_available It's a dark grayJeep Grand Cherokee.
not_available Turned south on 11 th Street about two minutes ago.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Moving to intercept.
not_available Did you see Marika? Yes.
not_available She got in the car with Dubaku.
not_available Chloe, stay on those traffic cams.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available We're 10 minutes from the airfield.
not_available Is my plane ready? Fueled and waiting.
not_available Did you take care of the problem? She's had a change of heart.
not_available She's coming with me.
not_available Colonel, she was working with the F.B.I.
not_available You were almost arrested because of her.
not_available She's not your concern.
not_available You just worry about getting me out of the country.
not_available Who was that? 
not_available It was a government official.
not_available He's been working for me.
not_available A very corrupt man.
not_available I look forward to no longer dealing with people like him.
not_available I want to spend time with people I really care about.
not_available They're still on 11 th.
not_available Theyjust crossed over New York Avenue.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Come on! 
not_available Jack, they're turning left.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Go! Go! Hold on! 
not_available Get on top of the car.
not_available See if you can maintain a visual.
not_available Marika! Marika! Jack, they crashed! 
not_available Go! Get back to your car! Larry, Dubaku's vehicle's been involved in an accident.
not_available We need an ambulance now! 
not_available Copy.
not_available Back away! Stay on your knees! Get on the ground now! Now! 
not_available I got Dubaku.
not_available Agent Walker, the car's on fire! Get outta there! Get outta there! I gave her my word! So back off or help me! It's her leg.
not_available It's pinned.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Pull! Pull! Go.
not_available Jack? Go! Go! You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Larry, where is my ambulance? Dubaku's badly injured.
not_available He's still conscious.
not_available I need that ambulance now! 
not_available They're on their way, Jack.
not_available Admiral Smith estimates we'll have the capital of Sangala secured within the hour.
not_available He's surprised how little resistance our troops have encountered.
not_available And you'll be happy to know we have liberated the refugee camps in Kasanga Province.
not_available Two thousand civilians are safe from Juma's forces.
not_available Madam President? I'm sorry, Ethan.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Kasanga Province.
not_available That's
not_available That's very good news.
not_available Uh, maybe we should finish this another time.
not_available Can I get you anything, Madam President? No, thank you.
not_available Would you like to talk about it? What happened to Henry was my fault, Ethan.
not_available He never believed our son committed suicide, and he was right.
not_available And I didn't listen to him.
not_available And if I had, we wouldn't be here right now Henry wouldn't be fighting for his life, and we might have exposed this conspiracy.
not_available And our government wouldn't be paralyzed.
not_available I didn't believe Henry either.
not_available No one did.
not_available But I'm his wife.
not_available He deserved my trust.
not_available Madam President, I'm sorry to interrupt.
not_available It's all right, Bill.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I just spoke to Larry Moss at F.B.I.
not_available We captured Dubaku.
not_available But he was seriously injured in a car crash during the pursuit.
not_available How bad? 
not_available Critical.
not_available Non
not_available responsive.
not_available Jack Bauer and Agent Walker are with him.
not_available They'll be there to question him, should he regain consciousness.
not_available So you're saying that if Dubaku dies our chances of uncovering this conspiracy die with him.
not_available He could be the only one who knows the names of everyone in the government he's corrupted.
not_available Madam President, given this latest news, I don't think it's safe for you to remain here.
not_available I strongly urge you to return to the White House.
not_available I'd prefer to stay with my husband.
not_available You're too exposed.
not_available I can't effectively protect you.
not_available Am I any safer at the White House? My administration has been corrupted, Bill.
not_available And now you're telling me we're about to lose our only lead.
not_available Madam President, I assure you I've taken every precaution to secure the White House.
not_available It's the safest place for you to be right now.
not_available Henry will be in surgery for several hours, Madam President.
not_available There's nothing more we can do here.
not_available You are needed in the Oval Office.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll have the cars brought around.
not_available I'll redirect your daughter's escorts to the White House.
not_available Thank you, Bill.
not_available What are we going to do, Ethan? How can we possibly run this government when we don't know who we can trust? We'll just have to prayJack Bauer can get those names from Dubaku.
not_available You got him stabilized? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We're transporting him right now.
not_available Bring him around.
not_available I need to talk to him.
not_available He's in no condition to speak right now.
not_available This man has information vital to national security.
not_available Bring him around now.
not_available Now! 
not_available One milligram epinephrine.
not_available I know you can hear me.
not_available You're in federal custody.
not_available These paramedics are trying to save your life.
not_available You want 'em to continue, you're gonna tell me what I want to know.
not_available I want the names of everyone in the United States government that you've been workin' with.
not_available Come on.
not_available You and I both know the game is over for you now.
not_available There's no sense in trying to protect them.
not_available You and I, we're both soldiers.
not_available I know you don't care about your own life, but you got a family.
not_available I know where your son is in Sangala.
not_available I know where he lives, and I swear I will track him down and I will make him suffer and I will make sure that he knows his father was responsible.
not_available All you gotta do to make me stop is give me the names.
not_available Just give me the names.
not_available Don't tell my family.
not_available I have a list
not_available list.
not_available Where's the list? 
not_available His B.P.
not_available Spiked.
not_available Where's the list! 
not_available He's going into cardiac arrest.
not_available Bring him back! 
not_available Get the paddles.
not_available Start at 200 joules.
not_available Clear.
not_available No response.
not_available There's a glitch.
not_available Once more.
not_available Clear.
not_available There it is again.
not_available Electronic interference.
not_available This could be it.
not_available Feels like a metal plate or something.
not_available All right.
not_available Amping up to 300.
not_available Clear.
not_available Where's the plate? 
not_available All right, he's stabilized.
not_available Let's get him boarded.
not_available Where's the plate? 
not_available It's below his rib cage.
not_available Open him up.
not_available Sir, we don't have time.
not_available I have to ask you to step aside.
not_available You open him up now.
not_available Do it.
not_available Sir, this man will die if we don't get him to the hospital.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Patch me through to Agent Moss.
not_available This is Moss.
not_available Larry, it's Jack.
not_available Go ahead, Jack.
not_available I found some kind of digital storage device implanted under Dubaku's skin.
not_available What is it? 
not_available In an effort to protect his family he said he would provide me with a list of his government contacts.
not_available He said it was on him.
not_available He meant in him.
not_available Larry, this is his insurance policy.
not_available I'm sure of it.
not_available We need that data as soon as possible.
not_available Can you upload the files to F.B.I.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I've never seen anything like it.
not_available Hold on one second.
not_available Officer.
not_available All right.
not_available Officer.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm working with the F.B.I.
not_available I need you to get this device to regional headquarters.
not_available I want you to give it to Agent Larry Moss.
not_available Put this in his hands only.
not_available Understand? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Do it.
not_available You got a chopper coming your way.
not_available You should have the drive in five minutes.
not_available We're gonna stay with Dubaku.
not_available Get back to us as soon as you've got anything.
not_available Copy that.
not_available [Water Shuts Off Sean.
not_available What is it? What's wrong? 
not_available Just listen to me and try not to overreact, okay? We have a situation, but I think I have a way to handle it.
not_available What situation? You told me you had everything under control.
not_available I do.
not_available But they have Dubaku's database.
not_available What? Sean, our names are on that list.
not_available You told me you were taking care of this, and now you're telling me they have our names? No, they don't have our names yet, okay? So here's the plan.
not_available No, Sean, we have to get out of here.
not_available We have to get out of here right now.
not_available I'm not going to jail, Sean.
not_available Do you hear me? 
not_available Nobody's going to jail.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Don't! I'm sick of your promises.
not_available You promised me that this is taken care of! You promised me you're leaving your wife? You make all these promises, but you never keep
not_available Stop talking and just listen to me.
not_available I have a way out of this, but I need your help.
not_available Do you understand that? Now, listen.
not_available Okay? As soon as O'Brian downloads those files we're gonna crash the entire system
not_available every single server on this floor.
not_available That's crazy.
not_available No, it's not crazy.
not_available We're gonna go up to the mainframe room, initiate a system
not_available wide reformat.
not_available We'll wipe everything clean, and they won't be able to stop it.
not_available We're gonna have to bypass a lot of safety protocols, okay? But nobody's better at dealing with those servers than you are.
not_available I mean, isn't that true? I need your help.
not_available I can't do this without you.
not_available Hmm? Erika? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Um
not_available We're gonna have to tie the main servers together.
not_available I'll need an A.V.I.
not_available Motherboard but you're gonna have to reconfigure it for a macro uplink.
not_available Okay.
not_available We have to hurry.
not_available The drive is gonna be here any minute.
not_available Go up to the mainframe room and get started.
not_available I'm gonna prep the motherboard.
not_available I'll meet you up there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available We're gonna be fine.
not_available Huh? I love you.
not_available Hmm? 
not_available I love you too.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available Can you get that line in? 
not_available Sure.
not_available These are Marika Donoso's personal effects.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Copy that.
not_available And get back to me.
not_available That was Larry.
not_available They got the drive.
not_available Chloe's gonna be working on them.
not_available They should have something in the next few minutes.
not_available That's all that matters, right, Jack? I don't like what happened to Marika any more than you do.
not_available We did what was necessary.
not_available You better figure out a way to live with it.
not_available How, Jack? Pretend that it never happened? Is it that easy for you? I'll let you know when Chloe's got something.
not_available Here it is.
not_available This is a PX17 drive.
not_available It's got an auto
not_available erase function.
not_available We've only got one download.
not_available Where have you been? It just took a little longer than I thought.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Checking surveillance.
not_available Better keep an eye on Larry and O'Brian.
not_available Once we do this, they're gonna realize someone's up here in a few seconds.
not_available We'll have to make a clean exit.
not_available How much longer is this gonna take? I just have to bypass safety protocols.
not_available Once they're down, I'll start the reformat.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Dubaku hasn't arrived at the airfield and he's not answering his cell phone.
not_available What's goin' on? 
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Got him.
not_available What? How long have you known about this? They're not going to get anything out of him.
not_available He's unconscious in the hospital.
not_available There was a crash during a chase.
not_available Listen.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Recovered that database you told me about, the list of names.
not_available I'm in the process of deleting it.
not_available I'm gonna erase every trace of it.
not_available I don't have to tell you what will happen if they get that list.
not_available They won't.
not_available I'm gonna take care of the database.
not_available You need to take care of Dubaku.
not_available Don't worry about him.
not_available You just make sure
not_available Damn it! I gotta go.
not_available What's wrong? It
not_available It isn't working.
not_available What do you mean? All the inputs are active, the servers are aligned, but the reformat won't start.
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available Okay, just think it through, Erika.
not_available All right? Would you just shut up, okay? Okay.
not_available Has to be server three.
not_available Server three was upgraded last week which means they restored the partitions to the system default settings.
not_available How could I be so stupid? I just have to configure parameters.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay? Is that it? I think so.
not_available Program's running.
not_available What's happening? What's goin' on? The hard drive's reformatting.
not_available What? 
not_available The files are being erased.
not_available We're losing everything.
not_available Well, make it stop.
not_available I don't have the access.
not_available Get the PX17 out.
not_available It's too late! It's erased! This is deliberate.
not_available It's not a glitch.
not_available Someone's trying to crash the system.
not_available Where's your mainframe room? Come on.
not_available Here they come.
not_available We gotta get outta here.
not_available Almost there.
not_available Erika
not_available It's done.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It'll take a few minutes for the reformat to be complete, but there's no stopping it.
not_available All right.
not_available I knew you could do it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're gonna be okay? We're gonna be fine.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Get on the floor! 
not_available Wasn't me.
not_available Get on the floor! Larry, it wasn't me.
not_available Chloe! 
not_available Larry, I followed her up here.
not_available She was trying to crash the system.
not_available She shot me.
not_available I went for the weapon, and it went off Security, this is Agent Moss.
not_available I need a team to lock down the mainframe room.
not_available And get a medic here.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Chloe, can you recover the files? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available What files? What the hell is happening? You tell me what the hell is happening, Sean! You were shutting me out, Larry, so I looked around on my own.
not_available I found out that Erika was rerouting the subcom channel.
not_available What the hell was she doing? She sent out a
not_available a warrant on a vehicle with two suspects.
not_available I knew something was wrong.
not_available That's not part of her job.
not_available I asked her about it, and she tried to deny it.
not_available She was acting very strangely.
not_available Why didn't you say anything? 
not_available I don't know what the hell it meant so I hacked into her hard drive, and I found schematics for the main server.
not_available Bypass codes for the safety protocols.
not_available I followed her up here to see what she was up to.
not_available The second I realized she was trying to crash thethe system, l
not_available I confronted her.
not_available She shot me.
not_available I went for the gun.
not_available Larry, I didn't mean to kill her.
not_available Number one, main server.
not_available Hold! Hold! 
not_available Larry, it's too late.
not_available The system's fried.
not_available Dubaku's files are gone.
not_available Are you sure? Can you recover anything? The server's wiped clean.
not_available She got everything.
not_available Is this everything you got? 
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I didn't have time to print out every single message that came through Erika's workstation.
not_available That's everything she was doing for the past three days.
not_available Look, Larry.
not_available I told you what happened.
not_available I feel like you owe me an explanation.
not_available What the hell is going on here? 
not_available The government's been compromised by Dubaku.
not_available F.B.I., Secret Service
not_available God knows who else.
not_available That's why I shut you out, brought in Chloe O'Brian.
not_available We were in the middle of decrypting a file that had the names of everyone on Dubaku's payroll.
not_available Erika erased it when she wiped the server.
not_available That was our only lead.
not_available You should've told me about this.
not_available You should've trusted me.
not_available Sean, I didn't know who to trust.
not_available You all right? How's your arm? Ah, it hurts like hell.
not_available It's fine.
not_available When you're up for it, I'm gonna need you to write a statement.
not_available Okay.
not_available And keep your mouth shut.
not_available We don't know who else in this building might be working for Dubaku.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Larry, don't ask me how, but I did it.
not_available You did what? I recovered Dubaku's files.
not_available What? 
not_available I was running a mirror file on an outside server.
not_available I always do that when I'm dealing with sensitive materials.
not_available Erika's parameters were too narrow to catch it.
not_available How soon can you have it decrypted? It's decrypted.
not_available It's been decrypting this entire time.
not_available Dubaku kept detailed evidence on everyone.
not_available Phone logs, financial records
not_available It's all here.
not_available Listen, I'm going to need you to cross
not_available check with F.B.I.
not_available Personnel.
not_available Sean said Erika was working by herself, but I gotta be 100% sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Chloe recovered the files.
not_available That's great.
not_available I should get to that statement.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sean.
not_available When you're done there, I want you to go downstairs and see Dr.
not_available Weber.
not_available You shot a fellow agent.
not_available You're gonna wanna talk to somebody.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hey.
not_available Do you have any idea what's goin' on with the servers? 
not_available Not a clue.
not_available The whole system's down.
not_available I tried to get into the mainframe room, and security's got it locked off.
not_available Ask Larry about it, Janis.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available I gotta run an errand.

not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, sir? 
not_available Get me Bill Buchanan at the White House.
not_available What's the blood pressure? 
not_available 80 over 40.
not_available Where's my sister? Where's Marika? 
not_available There was an accident.
not_available What happened? Marika didn't make it.
not_available What
not_available What do you mean? There was a crash.
not_available Uh, it happened during the pursuit.
not_available Marika was killed.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You said that you'd protect her.
not_available You said she'd be okay.
not_available We wouldn't have caught Dubaku without Marika's help.
not_available She was very, very brave, Rosa.
not_available What is this? This supposed to make everything okay? Marika was all I had.
not_available I trusted you with her life, and you let her die? 
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Don't
not_available Don't touch me! You killed my sister.
not_available And you don't care how you did it or who got hurt! 
not_available Agent Walker.

not_available [Woman On P.A.
not_available Any available resident to L&amp;D.;
not_available A ny available resident to L&amp;D.;
not_available I just got off the phone with Larry.
not_available Dubaku wasn't lying.
not_available On the drive was a list of everyone he was working with in the government.
not_available They're getting ready to make arrests.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's not over for Rosa.
not_available What happened to Marika was a tragedy.
not_available But I'm not gonna stand here and tell you what we did was wrong, because we weren't.
not_available She made a choice, a brave one, to get involved.
not_available But she made it.
not_available God, listen to yourself, Jack.
not_available You don't even sound human.
not_available Don't you feel anything? 
not_available We had a job to do.
not_available To protect the hundreds if not thousands of innocent lives that would not have had a choice if we let a terrorist attack take place.
not_available What we did wasn't wrong.
not_available It was necessary.
not_available I read your file.
not_available When your wife was killed, did you feel that? Or did you just tell yourself that that was necessary? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? 
not_available I just want to know you feel something.
not_available I want to know that you feel the same kind of pain that I do! Do you feel that? Do you feel that? 
not_available It's all right.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available It's gonna take a while.
not_available But you will learn to live with it.
not_available What if I don't want to learn to live with it? Then quit.
not_available And by the way, that stunt you pulled by the car? You ever pull your weapon on me again, you better intend to use it.
not_available I did.
not_available Olivia.
not_available What's going on? How's Dad? 
not_available He's still in surgery.
not_available We're waiting for word.
not_available Is he gonna be all right? He was seriously injured.
not_available The bullet went through his lung.
not_available Livy, the doctors are doing everything they can.
not_available Who did this? 
not_available It's complicated.
not_available I want to know who shot my father.
not_available Your father found out about a conspiracy inside the government.
not_available And the people behind it tried to kill him.
not_available Who are these people? 
not_available We're trying to find out right now.
not_available That's all I can tell you.
not_available Okay, I want to go to the hospital.
not_available I want to be there when he wakes up.
not_available I can't let you do that.
not_available The people who shot your father are still out there.
not_available It's not safe.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I want to see Dad.
not_available This is not a debate! I'm not gonna risk anything happening to you.
not_available You're staying in the White House, and that's the end of it.
not_available Madam President, Bill Buchanan's here to see you.
not_available I'll be right out.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available There's a lot we need to talk about, Olivia.
not_available We've been ignoring things for far too long.
not_available It took Dad getting shot for you to finally want to talk? Oh, let's not go down this path.
not_available Not again.
not_available And not today.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available One of the guards will take you up to the residence.
not_available All right, Bill, what is it? 
not_available I have very good news.
not_available Jack Bauer just recovered a database hidden on Dubaku.
not_available It contains the names of everyone in the government who was working with him.
not_available How many? 
not_available Close to 100 people across all agencies.
not_available Some at very high levels.
not_available My God.
not_available Dubaku kept detailed files on every person.
not_available This is exactly what we'd been working toward, Madam President.
not_available We can finally put an end to this conspiracy.
not_available I assume you've already begun acting on this information.
not_available Yes.
not_available As a matter of fact, Larry Moss just identified two more individuals working within F.B.I.
not_available Who were on the list.
not_available He's confident the Bureau is secure.
not_available What's the next step? 
not_available I'm working with F.B.I.
not_available To coordinate an interagency sweep.
not_available We should start making arrests within the hour.
not_available Bill, I don't know what to say to thank you.
not_available What you have done here today puts all of us in your debt.
not_available I appreciate that, Madam President but there are a lot of people to thank including Jack Bauer.
not_available He's scheduled to resume his testimony before the Senate committee tomorrow morning.
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available Madam President, forgive me if I'm out of line but I feel Senator Mayer is on a personal crusade againstJack.
not_available He's already taken his pound of flesh.
not_available He dismantled C.T.
not_available U attacked the reputations of people who have served this country with honor.
not_available Now he wants to make an example ofJack? It isn't right, Madam President, especially after today.
not_available What are you asking me to do, Bill? I'm asking you to speak to Senator Mayer.
not_available Jack Bauer helped save this country.
not_available He doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison.
not_available I appreciate your sentiments, Bill but I'm gonna have to think about this.
not_available That's all I'm asking, Madam President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? 
not_available I need to talk with you.
not_available About what? I told you I was gonna follow up on a lead.
not_available No, you said you were gonna turn yourself in as soon as this was over.
not_available And I will.
not_available But this ain't over yet.
not_available There's gonna be another attack, here in D.C.
not_available Dubaku is in custody.
not_available He's provided us a list of everyone in the government that was
not_available It's not Dubaku.
not_available It's his boss, Juma.
not_available He knows he's about to lose control of his country so he's gonna try and rally his people behind him by striking back at the U.S.
not_available How do you know this? 
not_available I tracked down a source.
not_available What source? 
not_available He's one of the men I worked with on Emerson's crew.
not_available He had a direct line of communication with theJuma regime in Sangala.
not_available It wasn't easy getting the information out of him but I'm convinced it's accurate.
not_available Then you should hand it over to the F.B.I.
not_available No.
not_available My source tells me that the window opens at 1900 hours.
not_available By the time the F.B.I.
not_available Wades through their procedures and red tape, it's gonna be too late.
not_available What's the target? He doesn't know the exact target.
not_available But it's definitely gonna be of high value and high impact.
not_available He gave me the name of somebody who's been involved in the planning.
not_available Who? 
not_available Ryan Burnett.
not_available Senator Mayer's chief of staff? That's right.
not_available He's been involved from the very beginning.
not_available What about Mayer? No.
not_available He's not involved.
not_available You're sure about that? Yeah.
not_available You better not be lying to me, Tony.
not_available This is real, Jack.
not_available Burnett will be on Dubaku's list.
not_available As soon as he finds out Dubaku's in custody, he'll start running.
not_available You don't have a lot of time.
not_available I've already got a tail on him.
not_available Listen, Jack.
not_available If you're with me, meet me at the corner of First and Constitution.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Thank you for your patience.
not_available As I'm sure some of you already know, our government and its ancillary agencies including this office, have been infiltrated by operatives in league with Ik√© Dubaku.
not_available Yes, Senator? Ryan, can you step in here? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm going to the White House.
not_available Sir? President Taylor wants to speak to me regarding Jack Bauer.
not_available Bauer? What about him? I don't know.
not_available But we'll find out soon enough.
not_available It's odd, though.
not_available What is, sir? Bauer was pulled away from the Senate hearings this morning to help the F.B.I.
not_available With an investigation.
not_available And now the president wants to talk to me about him.
not_available I don't like the timing of this.
not_available Grab your laptop, Ryan.
not_available I want you there with me.
not_available Yes, sir.
