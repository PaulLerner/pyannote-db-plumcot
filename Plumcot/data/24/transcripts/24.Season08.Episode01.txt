not_available The following takes place between 4:00 p.m.
not_available and 5:00 p.m.
not_available Events occur in real time.
not_available lt's him.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Couldn't get off the shot.
not_available Stand by.
not_available We'll get him on the way out.
not_available ManueI! Hey, Manny! 
not_available Manny! Hey, Manny.
not_available Yes? Put Mauricio on the phone.
not_available Victor? 
not_available Just put Mauricio on.
not_available He's dead.
not_available What? Someone shot him in the head.
not_available What the hell is happening? l see him.
not_available He's leaving the building.
not_available l'm set.
not_available Stop.
not_available It's not him.
not_available He can't be far.
not_available Coming at you! Gray sedan! 
not_available Target is out of range.
not_available Move out.
not_available Yes.
not_available l want to report a stolen vehicle.
not_available License plate: SNE1 5C5.
not_available Yum, yum, yum, yum.
not_available Hey! What's up? Hey, you! That's not yours! Jack? Yum, yum, yum! Bug off, kid! Oh.
not_available Sweetheart, we already talked about this, remember? You're supposed to call me Grandpa.
not_available You don't look like a grandpa.
not_available l couldn't agree with you more.
not_available The cartoon you turned on is boring.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll find another one.
not_available air traffic delayed
not_available ÃÂ¤his is the boldest diplomatic initiative we've seen in a generation.
not_available It could finally lay a foundation for real peace throughout the entire region.
not_available Bob, the president's certainly betting her legacy on the success of these negotiations.
not_available Grandpa, this isn't a cartoon.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available 
not_available A sloth of bears ÃÂ¤his one! l like this one! A mob of cows A herd ofsheep A litter ofpigs 
not_available Finger, finger, finger! 
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available ÃÂi, Dad.
not_available Sorry we're late.
not_available ÃÂ¤hey're redirecting everyone around the U.N.
not_available ÃÂ¤hat's all right.
not_available We're doing fine.
not_available How was the zoo? ÃÂ¤o be honest, we spent most of our time just going back and forth between the black bears and the polar bears.
not_available l forgot to mention that she's going through a bear phase.
not_available Well, she certainly knows what she wants.
not_available She reminds me of you.
not_available That's funny.
not_available l always tell Stephen how much she reminds me of you.
not_available Anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll meet you in the lobby.
not_available Sounds like they had fun.
not_available They always do.
not_available What's wrong? We talked to him about moving to L.A.
not_available the night we got here.
not_available And he said he'd think about it.
not_available And he hasn't mentioned one word about it since, and we leave tonight.
not_available Maybe he has to check with his doctors.
not_available No.
not_available ÃÂ¤hey cleared him two weeks ago.
not_available ÃÂe's finished with treatment.
not_available l don't know.
not_available My father's been on his own for so long.
not_available Maybe he doesn't know how to live any other way.
not_available Why don't you just ask him again? My father is not the type of person you ask twice.
not_available lf you want, l can do it.
not_available Here at the United Nations, a White House spokesman just confirmed that Presidents Taylor and Hassan will be holding a joint press conference later this hour.
not_available lt is widely expected that President Hassan will announce the dismantling of his country's nuclear weapons program.
not_available President Hassan has stated that he considers these negotiations a historic success and a new beginning for his country and the entire Mideast region.
not_available I believe that that is a reasonable compromise.
not_available Now, Mr.
not_available President, let's move on to the issue of verification.
not_available The language in your latest proposal is vague.
not_available Let me be clear.
not_available My country agrees to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons with full lnternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
not_available But our terms, Mr.
not_available President, were that the inspectors themselves wouId be American, not I.A.E.A.
not_available With respect, Madam President, your side pushed the point, but we never conceded.
not_available With respect, your side has refused to negotiate the point in good faith.
not_available Without Americans on the groundSurely we're not going to let the nationaIity of a few hundred
not_available verification has no teeth.
not_available So only the United States can be trusted, Mr.
not_available Secretary? ÃÂ¤his is the message that you send to the rest of the world.
not_available Then you wonder why we don't want to negotiate
not_available Farhad.
not_available Madam President, please excuse my brother's passion.
not_available He only wants what is best for our country.
not_available I understand, but we need to resolve this issue before we can move forward.
not_available And ideally, before the press conference, which gives us less than an hour.
not_available Madam President, what would your Congress say if my Revolutionary Guard were stationed on your soil? lt's the same with my National Assembly.
not_available Even if I agreed to this, they would not ratify it.
not_available After all, l'm not a king.
not_available Nor l a queen.
not_available Too bad for both of us.
not_available l'd like to adjourn and discuss this issue with our respective teams.
not_available Of course.
not_available You are aware he was a salesman before entering poIitics? Household appliances.
not_available You want to bet he sold a lot of refrigerators? 
not_available Find a way to give him what he wants.
not_available Madam President.
not_available You heard me.
not_available ÃÂ¤ry to make the inspections work.
not_available This man is a onceina
not_available lifetime leader.
not_available And he's already suspended his support for terrorist organizations, and, privately, he's advocating for a two
not_available state solution.
not_available Now, how much farther can we expect him to stick his neck out? 
not_available Right this way.
not_available ÃÂey, come here.
not_available Did you name him yet? Bear.
not_available Bear.
not_available ÃÂ¤here she is.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available l heard that you and Grandpa were hanging out with the bears.
not_available Then we had ice cream, but I didn't Iike mine, so Grandpa gave me his.
not_available That's nice.
not_available Here, I got her.
not_available ÃÂ¤hanks for watching her, Jack.
not_available Of course.
not_available Here.
not_available Listen, l've been thinking a lot about what we talked about.
not_available l made up my mind.
not_available l want to move back to Los Angeles with you.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available l got a friend who's got a private security firm.
not_available He said he'd give me some consulting work.
not_available He's also got a place I can rent.
not_available Dad, l don't know what to say.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh! You don't have to say anything.
not_available Just give me a ride to the airport tonight.
not_available Wait.
not_available You're coming with us tonight? 
not_available If it's okay.
not_available Stephen, he's coming with us tonight.
not_available l've just got a few more things to pack.
not_available I don't have very much.
not_available l could be at your hotel in about an hour.
not_available ÃÂ¤hat's perfect.
not_available We need to get back and finish packing ourselves.
not_available Would it be all right if l fly back to Los Angeles with you? Yay! Yay! 
not_available Come on.
not_available l'll walk you to the car.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yay.
not_available I got her.
not_available Okay.
not_available Goin' in the car 
not_available ÃÂ¤here.
not_available She all right? Get your belt done up.
not_available Dad, I am so glad that you're doing this.
not_available Me too.
not_available l love you.
not_available Love you.
not_available Okay, guys, l'll see you in an hour.
not_available See you.
not_available Bye, sweetheart.
not_available Bye.
not_available Good afternoon, everyone.
not_available Good afternoon.
not_available All right, just a few things before we get started here.
not_available Presidents ÃÂ¤aylor and Hassan will each make a statement after they've been introduced by the Secretary
not_available General.
not_available Q and A will follow, but I want you to keep your questions strictly on topic.
not_available For obvious reasons, we're all operating under heightened security measures.
not_available So unless you've been dying to know what a choke hold feels like, keep your credentials visible at alI times, all right? That's alI for now.
not_available Meredith Reed, press.
not_available Sir, briefcase on the table.
not_available It's invalid.
not_available Arms out, please.
not_available What? It can't be invalid.
not_available Can you double
not_available check? l did, ma'am.
not_available Your credentials have been revoked.
not_available Revoked my whom? 
not_available I don't have that information.
not_available Okay, this has to be some sort of mistake.
not_available You do remember me? I've been here every day.
not_available Please step aside, ma'am.
not_available l just talked to Secretary of State Kanin.
not_available ÃÂe's agreed to I.A.E.A.
not_available inspectors.
not_available That's good news.
not_available There is a condition attached.
not_available They're insisting that the head of the verification team be an American.
not_available l think we can live with that.
not_available Don't you? You know where l stand.
not_available We've already surrendered too much in the name of peace.
not_available "Surrender" is a strong word, Farhad.
not_available And what have we surrendered really apart from our nuclear ambition? lsn't that enough? Spinning 6,000 centrifuges is good for political maneuvering, but it's helping to bankrupt our country.
not_available The truth is we are not the ones being so generous.
not_available President Taylor is lifting economic sanctions and offering an aid package worth billions of dollars.
not_available We got everything we wanted, Farhad.
not_available As long as it's not a trick.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm, uh, sorry to bother you with something so mundane, but I'm, uh, stuck outside.
not_available Stuck? 
not_available My press credentials have been revoked.
not_available l don't know what happened.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Will you, um
not_available Will you still have time for the interview later? Yes, after the press conference.
not_available l'm looking forward to it, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available So am I.
not_available Reinstate Miss Reed's clearance.
not_available l was only
not_available Just do it.
not_available Omar, people are starting to taIk about you and this reporter.
not_available And saying what? Miss Reed is a journalist, and she is profiling me for her newspaper.
not_available But you have feelings for her.
not_available I'm friendly with her.
not_available Think whatever you like.
not_available ÃÂ¤his woman poses no threat to me or the peace process.
not_available Not here maybe, but back in our country you'll be torn apart.
not_available The mullahs will say that you have been corrupted by the West.
not_available What do you say, Farhad? Have I? Have I been corrupted by the West? You know I don't believe that.
not_available But you are married.
not_available Dalia hasn't been a wife to me for a long time.
not_available ÃÂ¤hat's no excuse to be reckless.
not_available I've done nothing reckless.
not_available l've done nothing reckless.
not_available Just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now.
not_available l'll see to it.
not_available Victor.
not_available What are you doing here? How the hell did you find me? 
not_available l was always resourceful, Jack.
not_available That's what you liked about me.
not_available Get in here.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available What happened? l need help.
not_available You need an ambulance.
not_available No.
not_available No, don't call.
not_available That's what he's waiting for.
not_available He's listening to the emergency channels.
not_available Who? Just listen to me, Jack.
not_available I have information.
not_available Best thing l can do for you, Victor, is get you an ambulance.
not_available l'm out.
not_available l don't work for the government anymore.
not_available Oh, this you're gonna want to hear.
not_available Why? Why? Because you're the guy who always does the right thing.
not_available There's a big hit going down.
not_available On who? President ÃÂassan at the U.N.
not_available He's getting taken out.
not_available When? Today.
not_available Before he can sign this thing with Taylor.
not_available You see? l told you you'd be interested.
not_available ÃÂow do you know this? I'm the one that got the hitter into the country.
not_available I've been setting him up with what he needs.
not_available And then he tried to take you out.
not_available Look, Jack, you're the onIy one at C.ÃÂ¤.U.
not_available I ever did business with.
not_available l need you to call them, vouch for me, so I can cut a deal.
not_available Come on, Jack
not_available Keep your seat.
not_available l swear, this is real.
not_available Someone is trying to make sure that this peace agreement does not happen.
not_available l'm not doing anything until you give me your weapon.
not_available You better not be screwing with me.
not_available l'm not.
not_available I swear l'm not.
not_available Who's the hitter? What's his name? Who's the hitter? I don't know his name.
not_available ÃÂe's Russian or something.
not_available Not good enough.
not_available Who is the hitter? l know how to find him and stop him before he makes the hit.
not_available But l'm not saying another word until I make my deal.
not_available You're lucky l'm retired.
not_available This is Cole Ortiz.
not_available Move Singer's team to the northeast quadrant and tell him, from now on, l want updates every quarter hour.
not_available Get back to me with confirmations.
not_available ÃÂastings wants you to expand the patrol perimeter around the U.N.
not_available another quarter mile.
not_available l'm glad that's what he wants, but I barely have enough men to cover the perimeter now.
not_available l'll see if l can get N.Y.P.D.
not_available to help you cover.
not_available Uh, Dana.
not_available My sister, she said she left you a couple messages
not_available something about bridesmaids' dresses.
not_available l told her there was probably something wrong with your voice mail.
not_available l got her messages.
not_available l just haven't had a chance.
not_available These double shifts are just
not_available I revised the patrol protocols at the U.N.
not_available l thought you might like to take a look at it before I distributed it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, l do.
not_available I will call your sister back.
not_available I promise.
not_available ÃÂ¤hanks.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What is the problem? 
not_available Percussive maintenance? ÃÂ¤hat's what my network apps professor called it when I hit my computer.
not_available Can l help? l just got the revised attendee list for the press conference.
not_available l can't get the facial recognition done in time.
not_available Oh, you're running each person through individually.
not_available You can do them in a batch.
not_available Not if the data's in different formats.
not_available Well, that used to be true, but here.
not_available Like l said, there's no reason to be shy about asking for help.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available You'll catch up.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available How's Kim? Did you tell her about L.A.? Yeah, but l can't go into that right now.
not_available I need to speak to the director.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings is on the phone, and he really doesn't like to be interrupted.
not_available ÃÂ¤ell him it's regarding a plot to assassinate President Hassan.
not_available See if that gets his attention.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available All right, now give me an overlay on the U.N.
not_available view from the west.
not_available Now overlay the distribution of security teams, please.
not_available That looks good.
not_available Anything else, sir? Now give me a comp with incident reports and satellite imaging.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Gary, hold on for a second.
not_available Jack Bauer's on line three.
not_available ÃÂe says he needs to talk to you.
not_available Bauer? lt's about a plot against President Hassan.
not_available l thought you'd want to take the call.
not_available Sir, can I send those incident reports? Gary, I'll call you back.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, this is Brian Hastings.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, l'm with an informant that I used to run who's claiming he's got intel on an assassination attempt on President Hassan.
not_available He says it's going to take place today.
not_available We've received several threats in regard to the conference.
not_available l can only imagine.
not_available My informant's name is Victor Aruz.
not_available I used him in the Salazar op.
not_available You should be able to pull his file.
not_available Pull it up.
not_available ÃÂe's been shot in the arm
not_available he claims by the assassin.
not_available Look, l don't think this is something you should take lightly.
not_available And what does Mr.
not_available Aruz want in return for his information? C.T.U.
not_available protection and immunity.
not_available That's a lot to ask, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Have you pulled his file yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, I know this son ofa bitch, and my instinct is telling me you need to pay attention to this.
not_available l need more than your instinct, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available isn't the organization you knew.
not_available Okay, fine, but understand this.
not_available lf anything happens to President Hassan, l will be obligated to call President Taylor and tell her that l tried to provide you with this inteI, and you ignored it.
not_available What is taking so long for the file? Sorry.
not_available I'm still searching through the archives.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, I need your answer now.
not_available Are you bringing Aruz in or not? 
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available l'll put you on speaker.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Mr.
not_available Aruz, I'm gonna need some other details to corroborate your story.
not_available ÃÂ¤he hitter took out two of my guys
not_available Manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez.
not_available Check with the cops.
not_available We will.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, where are you? 
not_available 1 145 West 1 8th.
not_available l'll send a chopper to pick you up.
not_available ÃÂ¤he closest helipad to you is the 1 Can you get him there, Mr.
not_available Bauer? Yeah.
not_available l'll have a team there in 20 minutes.
not_available Make sure you don't use official channels.
not_available We believe the assassin is monitoring emergency bandwidth.
not_available Got it.
not_available Gather Comm and ÃÂ¤actical.
not_available Tell them we've got a situation.
not_available Let's go.
not_available There you are.
not_available Now, that doesn't suck.
not_available Arlo.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hastings called an emergency briefing.
not_available And if he ever catches you doing that, you're gonna be out of a job.
not_available Be worth it.
not_available I think this might be love.
not_available Now.
not_available ÃÂ¤his is C.ÃÂ¤.U.
not_available transferring control of drones A
not_available 31 and 32 to H.S.
not_available aerial command.
not_available Yeah, roger that.
not_available Off
not_available load confirmed.
not_available All right, we've got a situation.
not_available Cole, l need you to scramble a chopper for a pickup.
not_available l haven't finished distributing the new patrol parameters.
not_available This is a priority.
not_available Who am l picking up? Someone who claims to have intel about a threat to President Hassan.
not_available How good is the intel? 
not_available Well, according to Jack Bauer, very.
not_available Jack Bauer? 
not_available He's delivering the informant.
not_available Who is Jack Bauer? Location's downtown.
not_available Chloe's sending you the coordinates.
not_available Take a small team with you.
not_available Torres's people are free.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available l'll need a second team to secure the landing.
not_available One team will be enough.
not_available We'll use a drone to protect the ground operation.
not_available Arlo, scramble a drone alongside the chopper.
not_available Full
not_available spectrum coverage of the landing zone as well as the air corridor.
not_available Done.
not_available You're third floor.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dispatch, this is Unit 2354.
not_available Go ahead, 2354.
not_available Got a plate match on a stolen vehicle.
not_available Make, model and tag.
not_available Gray Pontiac.
not_available Plate: SarahNovemberEchoonefiveCharlie
not_available five.
not_available Got bullet holes in the windshield and body.
not_available That's him.
not_available Roger that.
not_available What's your location? Vehicle's parked on 18th, just west of Ninth Avenue.
not_available We'll take care of it.
not_available Will you? Or am l going to have to step in? Now would be the time to tell me.
not_available Aruz is a dead man, sir.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Good.
not_available l spoke to the ambassador.
not_available You did? ÃÂ¤hank you.
not_available Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available President Hassan accepted our counterproposals on inspections.
not_available That is great news.
not_available By the end of this next session, we may have a signed agreement.
not_available lt's an extraordinary accomplishment, Allison.
not_available ls something wrong? l was thinking about ÃÂenry.
not_available Achieving a comprehensive peace agreement with the Islamic Republic was something that he and l talked about years ago.
not_available l wish that he were here to share the moment.
not_available You're surprised? Considering his behavior during the divorce, yes, I am surprised.
not_available ÃÂe went out of his way to hurt you, especially in the press.
not_available He was angry, Ethan.
not_available l sent our daughter to prison.
not_available You refused to cover up a murder.
not_available Olivia was responsible for what happened
not_available no one else.
not_available Still, if the situation had been reversed, l might've felt the same way as Henry.
not_available Sorry if I'm interrupting.
not_available I just talked to Brian ÃÂastings at C.ÃÂ¤.U.
not_available What's going on, Rob? They have someone who claims he's got information about an assassination plot on Hassan.
not_available ÃÂow real is the threat? Real enough to loop you in.
not_available ÃÂ¤his informant came to them through Jack Bauer.
not_available I thought that Jack was out ofall of this.
not_available How did he get involved? As far as l can tell, this informant came to him.
not_available We'll know more once the informant signs an immunity deal, provided you authorize it.
not_available ÃÂow secure is the venue for the press conference? Very.
not_available I raised the alert level.
not_available We need to inform ÃÂassan about the threat, ideally, before the conference gets started.
not_available We can't tell ÃÂassan, certainly not before the press conference.
not_available Why not? 
not_available He might scuttle everything out of concern for his own safety.
not_available Hassan's a big boy.
not_available He's used to taking risks or he wouldn't be here.
not_available You know that.
not_available Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew about this and didn't tell him, then all the trust we've built up over the last year goes out the window.
not_available And then he'll pull out of talks, and, frankly, I wouldn't blame him.
not_available l'll think about it.
not_available Thank you both.
not_available Madam President, I'm telling you, holding this back from Hassan could be disastrous.
not_available l said I'd think about it, Rob.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ethan? Listen.
not_available Sorry if I went after you a little hard in there.
not_available l was just making my point.
not_available No need to apologize, Rob.
not_available l recommended you to the president because you're not afraid to speak up.
not_available She needs that.
not_available Yeah, well, still, I know I can get carried away.
not_available I
not_available Don't worry, kid.
not_available I ain't dead yet.
not_available I can handle myself, even up against you.
not_available Hey, sweetheart, it's me.
not_available Hey, we're almost finished packing.
not_available Are you on your way? Something came up.
not_available I'm gonna be a little late.
not_available ÃÂow late? l think I should meet you at the airport.
not_available ls everything okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you sure? Kim, l promise, everything's fine.
not_available Well, ÃÂ¤eri is so excited that you're coming back with us.
not_available Just, uh, let me know when you're on your way.
not_available Okay, thanks, sweetheart.
not_available Keep your eyes open.
not_available ÃÂ¤he precinct's two blocks away.
not_available Let's cut through here.
not_available Come on.
not_available ÃÂ¤he F.A.A.'s cleared a route and informed all relevant agencies that we will be in the air.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Aruz's file
not_available it was in a proprietary database.
not_available That's why it took so long.
not_available Still, that shouldn't have thrown you.
not_available You've been here a month.
not_available Almost a month, and I've had to relearn the interface on every major system here.
not_available Everything's changed.
not_available You're having trouble adapting.
not_available I understand.
not_available But I don't think it's a question ofyour intelligence.
not_available Uh, thanks.
not_available l think it's ambivalence.
not_available Ambivalence? l know the only reason you took this job was because your husband was downsized.
not_available Am l wrong? No.
not_available I mean, yes.
not_available Please, just give me a little more time to get up to speed here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, I need this job.
not_available Fair enough, but I'm all about efficiency.
not_available So if your performance doesn't improve, you may want to rethink working here.
not_available Now, I trust this has been clarifying.
not_available Sure.
not_available If you really wanted to be more efficient, why don't youjust say, if I don't catch up soon, I'm going to be fired? 
not_available Your flight path is a straight shot southwest over the river, and the 1 2th Precinct has confirmed that their helipad is clear and operational.
not_available Comm net and satellite coverage ofyour flight, both legs, and fulltime aerial from the drone
not_available Why are you looking at me like that? Like what? Look, l just want to make sure nothing's wrong.
not_available Nothing's wrong, like I said.
not_available Just be careful, okay? I will be.
not_available You ready?
