
not_available What happened to David Palmer wasn't supposed to happen.
not_available He put himself in harm's way, and he got involved with something that he shouldn't have.
not_available You know who killed David? He works for me.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available This entire day has been one giant lie! What you've done makes me sick! Martha, enough! I need you to swear to me that you will do as I ask for the country.
not_available I hate you.
not_available The situation with Martha is taken care of.
not_available There are too many loose ends lying around.
not_available We cannot afford to have her pull on one and unravel everything.
not_available She won't.
not_available I have the recording.
not_available Have you destroyed it? No, sir, I have not.
not_available You and I have been in this from the beginning.
not_available Destroying that recording protects both of us.
not_available I've got O'Brian.
not_available Where is she? She's working out of Bill Buchanan's house.
not_available Did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer? 'Cause she thinks Jack is innocent, that President Logan framed Bauer.
not_available This is Karen Hayes
not_available Miles traced Chloe to your house.
not_available You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out of there.
not_available Karen, why are you warning us? Because I may have made a mistake earlier.
not_available Chloe, if they find you here, you'll be arrested.
not_available You have to go now.
not_available Not yet.
not_available It's over, Christopher! Turn around! Give me the recording.
not_available I don't have it.
not_available Where is it?! Henderson wasn't lying.
not_available He doesn't have the recording.
not_available There must've been some kind of a hand
not_available off.
not_available He stopped and rendezvoused with another car.
not_available Can you track that vehicle? 
not_available We're tracking it now.
not_available It headed back to Van Nuys looks like the civilian side of the airfield
not_available pulled onto the tarmac; whoever it was got out and got directly onto the plane.
not_available It is a chartered diplomatic flight.
not_available Jack, we've tried everything we can.
not_available There's no way to delay it.
not_available Okay, call me when you've got them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bill, are you out? The field team's almost there.
not_available Chloe's packing the comm.
not_available gear she needs to stay in touch with Jack.
not_available Where is Jack? 
not_available Van Nuys Airport.
not_available He stowed away on a diplomatic flight that just took off.
not_available What? Why? He's trying to find a recording that implicates President Logan.
not_available And someone on that flight has it? Yes, and we don't know who.
not_available That's what Chloe's been trying to find out.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Yeah? Field team's a block away from Buchanan's.
not_available I'll set up here for the remote debrief of O'Brian.
not_available No.
not_available Put it in the Situation Room.
not_available Oh, I thought you wanted 
not_available I want it in the Situation Room.
not_available Go.
not_available Bill, the field team's gonna be there any second.
not_available Get Chloe out of there now.
not_available How close are they? One block.
not_available All right, I'm gonna have to run interference.
not_available It's more important that she gets away.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll bring you in.
not_available You'll be treated as a suspect.
not_available We never talked.
not_available Understood.
not_available They're here.
not_available Out the back.
not_available Bill, wait.
not_available Have Chloe call me on a dry channel.
not_available Either onefive or two
not_available seven.
not_available Dry channel, onefive or two
not_available seven.
not_available Got it.
not_available There's a gate in back.
not_available Follow the path between the houses to the alley, turn right and go to Ventura Boulevard.
not_available What about the curfew? There's a hotel on the boulevard, the Miramont.
not_available You should be able to make it without being spotted.
not_available What about you? 
not_available I'll make sure you're not followed.
not_available I'll be at CTU, probably in Holding.
not_available Why in Holding? 
not_available Karen's gonna place me under arrest.
not_available If you need anything, contact her.
not_available Why is she 
not_available Chloe, please, just go.
not_available Who is it? Homeland Security.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, we need you to open the door.
not_available We're under order from Karen Hayes.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available What, uh, what's going on? Please step aside, sir.
not_available We need to search the house.
not_available No, I'm not stepping aside.
not_available Do you have a warrant? Where's Chloe O'Brian? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Sir, don't make us use force
not_available we know she's been here.
not_available Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Where is she? I don't know where Chloe O'Brian is.
not_available She's not here.
not_available Sir? This is a recent file from Comm.
not_available Only O'Brian could access it.
not_available Talk to us, sir.
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available I'll talk to Karen Hayes.
not_available Papazian? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Papazian, we are on site
not_available it appears Chloe O'Brian was here, but she is gone.
not_available Is Bill Buchanan there? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We lost O'Brian.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available Put him on the phone, please.
not_available Hello? Don't play games with me, Bill.
not_available Just give me O'Brian's location, or I will make it very bad for you.
not_available From what I understand, Miles, she got out of CTU right under your nose.
not_available You're the one who ought to be concerned, not me.
not_available Bill, this is Karen Hayes.
not_available Tell us what you know now.
not_available Stop wasting our time.
not_available I'm not saying any more.
not_available This is Ed.
not_available Ed, bring Buchanan in.
not_available Set up a grid search for Chloe.
not_available She's probably got a car, which means she's about 15 miles out.
not_available Copy that.
not_available But the agents on site are trained for interrogation.
not_available Why are you bringing him in? 
not_available Because I want to run this, Miles.
not_available But now it's us 
not_available who are wasting time here.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I will make him talk.
not_available I'll be in my office.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I'm set up at the Miramont Hotel.
not_available Make sure no one looks for me here.
not_available I'll take care of that.
not_available Tell me what else you need.
not_available Jack's on diplomatic flight 520.
not_available Pull up the manifest.
not_available Got it.
not_available Flight 520 to Frankfurt.
not_available Okay, put everything you've got from that flight under the shared volume so I can get to it.
not_available Crew, passengers, cargo, everything.
not_available Done.
not_available FLIGHT PLAN Okay, I see it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, are you okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Did you get what I need? I've got the manifest
not_available it's gonna take time to find a link with Henderson.
not_available What about the air marshal? That I'll have in a couple of minutes.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available What's happening at CTU? They're still under orders from the president to stop you, 
not_available but Karen Hayes is backing us.
not_available Openly? No, but she's letting me help you.
not_available If there's proof against Logan, she wants it found.
not_available The proof is on this plane.
not_available Check the flight manifest, figure out which passenger has a connection to Henderson and get back to me 
not_available with the air marshal's seat number.
not_available I will.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available I was just asking.
not_available You don't have to go all feminist on me.
not_available Did you see that? We better get used to it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, I found the air marshal his name is George Avila.
not_available He's sitting in 7A.
not_available Anyone sitting next to him? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Get back to me when you've got the connection to Henderson.
not_available Got it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is that seat taken? No.
not_available Thanks.
not_available The stewardess said I could change seats I was next to the galley, it's kind of noisy.
not_available I'm trying to get some rest.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Okay, the man you're looking for is in seat 12D.
not_available His name is Hans Meyer.
not_available He's with the German government.
not_available He's been connected to Omicron since the mid
not_available 1990s.
not_available He's worked directly with Henderson.
not_available That's it.
not_available Okay, I've got it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Meyer? Yes? My name is George Avila.
not_available I'm the air marshal on this flight.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available It's nothing serious.
not_available We found something that we think is yours.
not_available It should have been in the baggage compartment.
not_available We'd just like you to come back to the galley and identify it for us so we can properly stow it.
not_available Please, sir.
not_available We'd really appreciate it.
not_available If you have any carry
not_available on bags, you should bring them with you.
not_available I don't.
not_available Very well.
not_available What makes you think it was mine? Ticket stub.
not_available They have taken away all my medication.
not_available I need to get to it.
not_available I'm sorry, ma'am.
not_available They won't let me give that to you.
not_available What do they think I'm going to do? Kill myself? Over that son of a bitch?! I just called the president of the United States a son of a bitch.
not_available No reaction? He must have some kind of law on the books against that, or am I immune, just like he is? Do you have a first name, Agent Adams? It's Justin, ma'am.
not_available You don't have much of a personality, do you, Justin? This is Novick.
not_available It's Martha.
not_available Are you still in the retreat? Yes.
not_available I'm just down the hall from your room.
not_available I need you to come here right away.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available They've cut me off from my medication.
not_available You haven't been cut off.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hill said you had enough in your system right now.
not_available You need to wait a few hours.
not_available I don't want to wait a few hours, Mike.
not_available I need something now.
not_available What's going on, Mrs.
not_available Logan? I don't need counseling, Mike.
not_available I just want a damn pill.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Thank you, Agent.
not_available You're dismissed.
not_available We've been through some tough times before, Martha.
not_available Just follow the doctor's orders for now.
not_available This is more than just a tough time, Mike.
not_available None of this is going to go away.
not_available I just have to live with it.
not_available What do you mean, "It's not going to go away"? What are you talking about? I I shouldn't have said that.
not_available Martha, it's me.
not_available Say what needs to be said.
not_available What needs to be said I can't say to you.
not_available Why not? Listen, Mike, I just I just need to get some sleep.
not_available I'm just My nerves are shot from today.
not_available I just need something to calm me down.
not_available I just need to get to my medication.
not_available The president doesn't want you to leave the room.
not_available Then you can bring it here.
not_available I just want to take a couple of pills.
not_available I need to sleep.
not_available You can watch me take them.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Yes? Have they found Bauer yet? No, they haven't.
not_available That's not good.
not_available I know that's not good.
not_available I'm putting pressure everywhere I can.
not_available I don't think I have to tell you how disastrous it would be if Bauer gets his hands on that recording.
not_available That's exactly right.
not_available You don't have to tell me.
not_available I know.
not_available When I find him, I will call you.
not_available Is there anything else? Good.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? What is it, Mike? There's something I think I should call to your attention.
not_available Your wife is in a very agitated state.
not_available I don't know how to proceed.
not_available Proceed with what? She wants me to bring her medication against doctor's orders.
not_available That's all I need right now is to deal with her! No more pills.
not_available And she shouldn't be wasting your time with this anyway! Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Is there something going on that I should know about? Why? What did she say? She needs more medication to calm herself down.
not_available Something's clearly bothering her, but she didn't want to talk about it.
not_available I don't see where any of this becomes your business, Mike.
not_available I'll tell you where, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I'm your Chief of Staff.
not_available If there's something going on that I don't know about that involves national security, it is my business.
not_available This isn't national security, Mike.
not_available It's our marriage.
not_available I think both of us realized today, at this point, our relationship is nothing more than a facade, and one that we're going to have to keep up for as long as I'm president.
not_available I think that she's reacting to that, Mike.
not_available I see.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available Mike? Give her what she wants.
not_available Lord knows, she's in a lot of pain.
not_available Where are you hiding it? Hiding what? What do you want? What the hell is this? I know who you are.
not_available I know your connection with Omicron.
not_available I know your history with Henderson.
not_available He asked you to take something out of the country for him.
not_available Where is it? Christopher Henderson? I have not seen him in months.
not_available Don't you lie to me! I'm not lying, I swear! I know Henderson, but I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Did you check your luggage? Yes.
not_available Find it.
not_available Move! What are you doing? Nothing.
not_available Homework? Homework, yeah.
not_available I didn't know they had Wi
not_available Fi in here.
not_available Could you leave me alone? I can't talk right now.
not_available You're a little, freaked out because of the curfew thing.
not_available Join the club.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available When you come up for air, I'm buying.
not_available Airport Customs.
not_available This is Chloe O' Brian from CTU Los Angeles.
not_available I need to talk to somebody in passenger clearing.
not_available I'll need verification.
not_available Agency ID: CTU 99A
not_available 12.
not_available The captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign, as we are expecting some turbulence.
not_available Please return to your seat and make sure your seat belt is securely fastened.
not_available The passenger in 12D must be in the forward lavatory.
not_available You should get him out.
not_available The captain said it's going to shake pretty hard.
not_available There's nobody in those.
not_available I just checked.
not_available Then where is this guy? I don't know.
not_available Maybe he changed seats.
not_available Call the captain, and tell him the air Marshal's down, and a passenger's missing! What's going on here?! Please be seated, sir.
not_available Now, sir! Yeah? 
not_available Captain, this is Dan.
not_available The air marshal's been assaulted.
not_available What? Assaulted? What's going on back there? I don't know, sir, but he's been knocked out, and a passenger's missing.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Secure the cabin.
not_available Keep the passengers under control.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available There's a problem in the cabin.
not_available Make sure our door is secure.
not_available It is.
not_available What kind of problem? The air marshal's been knocked out.
not_available Call L.A.
not_available Center, get vectors for an emergency return.
not_available Mr.
not_available Avila, what happened? The man seated next to me, where is he? I didn't see him.
not_available We got to find him.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What? He's got my gun.
not_available Mike, come in.
not_available So, do you have something for me? This is just enough for a couple of days.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hill's going to come in 
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available I'm going to get ready for bed now.
not_available Is there something else? Yes, there is.
not_available Earlier you said something to the effect that I didn't know everything that was going on.
not_available I was confused.
not_available I wanted my pills.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Are you calling me a liar? I just spoke with the president.
not_available And I got the same feeling from him I get from you.
not_available Which is? That you're both covering something up.
not_available You know, Mike, I'm the one around here who's supposed to be paranoid, not you.
not_available I know you, Martha.
not_available And I know the president.
not_available He said this was all about marital difficulties.
not_available I think there's something else.
not_available What is it? Don't shut me out.
not_available Maybe I can help you.
not_available There is something else, Mike, but it's between me and Charles.
not_available If that changes, I promise I'll let you know.
not_available I don't know what you think Henderson gave me.
not_available I saw no one.
not_available I was picked up at the Consulate and brought directly here.
not_available There are witnesses, you can ask them.
not_available Is this your only piece of luggage? 
not_available Yes.
not_available If you're lying to me, I'll find out.
not_available I am not lying.
not_available Please.
not_available If there is someone on this plane that has something you want, it is not me.
not_available Jack, I don't think Hans Meyer is our guy.
not_available Why not? 
not_available The timeline doesn't match.
not_available He's been in customs for the last three hours clearing himself onto the flight.
not_available The plane's turning.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available It means they know I'm on board.
not_available Chloe, keep looking.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are you sure he's down there? There's nowhere else he could be.
not_available Tell the pilot he can do it.
not_available But there's a passenger down there with him.
not_available He'll die.
not_available There's over 50 passengers up here.
not_available Call him now.
not_available Do it.
not_available Captain, the air marshal says the baggage area is secure, and that you should begin.
not_available Air's coming in.
not_available It's not coming in, it's going out.
not_available What do you mean? They're depressurizing this area.
not_available What's going to happen to us? If we don't get into the main cabin, we're going to lose consciousness.
not_available Jack, what's going on in the plane? Security net just issued a bulletin.
not_available Chloe, I need you to patch me through to the pilot.
not_available I don't know if I can do that.
not_available Chloe, they're depressurizing this area.
not_available We're going to lose consciousness.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Yeah, Chloe.
not_available Jack needs us to patch him into the pilot of the flight.
not_available Can you get through on a CTU sub
not_available channel? I'll try.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll stay on the line.
not_available Air control operator 44.
not_available Yes, I need you to patch me through to the pilot of diplomatic flight fivetwo
not_available zero out of Van Nuys.
not_available Hey, what do you got? A little voice
not_available over IP going on there? Please leave me alone.
not_available No, seriously, I can help.
not_available I know a way for you to get some free bandwidth.
not_available Really? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Nice piece.
not_available Never seen one of these before.
not_available What is that? It's a CTU Series four.
not_available Chloe, they've opened the line to the pilot.
not_available I'll patch him through.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, Jack, I'm putting you on with the pilot.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available This is Captain Stan Cotter.
not_available Who am I speaking to? Captain, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm with the counterterrorist unit in Los Angeles.
not_available I'm the man in your baggage hold.
not_available What do you think you're doing? I'll explain everything in a moment, but you're going to have to restore air pressure to this area.
not_available Sir, I remind you, I am a federal agent.
not_available What kind of a federal agent knocks out an air marshal? I don't believe you.
not_available Sir, I was patched through to you by a CTU sub
not_available channel.
not_available I couldn't have done that unless I had clearance.
not_available All I know is, you have a gun and you have breached airplane security.
not_available Captain, this is a matter of national security.
not_available Now open the damn hatch! What do you think? He couldn't have patched in through CTU if he was hostile.
not_available There's no point in taking a chance.
not_available In a couple of minutes he'll pass out.
not_available From there, the air marshal can handle it.
not_available Captain, we are running out of air down here.
not_available Captain, I know you can hear me.
not_available There is a man on board your plane that is a danger to you.
not_available That's why I am here.
not_available Open the hatch! I can't do that.
not_available Okay, you son of a bitch.
not_available What the hell was that? 
not_available The aileron conduit's been breached.
not_available What?! What the hell do you think you're doing? You're going to kill everybody on this plane.
not_available That's up to you.
not_available Open the hatch.
not_available I'm not letting you up here.
not_available Then you'll be responsible for everything that happens.
not_available All right, all right, all right.
not_available Sue, I'm going to stabilize the pressure and I'm letting him up.
not_available I want you to unlock the hatch.
not_available The cockpit's secure.
not_available He can't get in here.
not_available Yes, Captain.
not_available What do you think you're doing? The captain ordered me to open the hatch.
not_available Both of you, turn around and grab the wall.
not_available Now! You in the baggage hold.
not_available Do it.
not_available Now.
not_available Close it.
not_available Lock it.
not_available Take me to the forward galley now.
not_available Get back to your seats.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Sit down! He has a gun! Everybody just stay in your seats.
not_available Face forward.
not_available Put your hands on your head.
not_available Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt.
not_available If you don't, people will start to die.
not_available Get the captain on the phone now.
not_available Sir, he's in the main cabin.
not_available He has a gun.
not_available Get the first
not_available class passengers, move them into the main cabin.
not_available Everyone to the main cabin.
not_available Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available I want to assure you I have no intention of hurting any of your passengers.
not_available I need to find something on the plane.
not_available It's a matter of national security.
not_available What do you want, Bauer? I want you to remain in a holding pattern so I can search your passengers.
not_available If you're really a federal agent, then you know I have to land this plane.
not_available Sir, that won't give me enough time.
not_available That's not my problem.
not_available I have a gun.
not_available Your air marshal is down.
not_available Captain, it is your problem.
not_available You need to remain in a holding pattern, do you understand me? You do what you have to do, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available My job is to land this airplane.
not_available And that is what I am going to do.
not_available Captain? Captain That's all we have on Flight 520, sir.
not_available Okay, look, I want updates on the situation on a minute by minute basis if necessary.
not_available Yes sir.
not_available Yes.
not_available I just got word from the FAA about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight that left Van Nuys a half hour ago.
not_available So what? Jack Bauer is the hijacker.
not_available What is he doing on that flight? Looking for the recording that implicates me in David Palmer's death.
not_available Henderson handed it off to somebody before he was arrested and Jack must know that it's on board.
not_available Then you shouldn't be wasting your time talking to me.
not_available Order the plane down, and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.
not_available Wait, what are you saying? That he hijacked the plane? Not exactly.
not_available He has control of the cabin.
not_available The pilot is landing the plane.
not_available What about that recording? He's still looking for it, but there's no guarantee he'll find it before the plane lands.
not_available And after that, it's all over.
not_available The president will have his people arrest Jack at the airport and isolate him.
not_available What are we supposed to do? Just keep helping Jack.
not_available Chloe, I need to see that evidence.
not_available Call me if you need anything from here.
not_available Fine.
not_available Give me a second.
not_available What's Bauer doing on Flight 520? You have no idea what you're dealing with, you little ass
not_available kisser.
not_available You don't talk to my people like that, Bill.
not_available Take him to Holding.
not_available It's no wonder CTU fell apart under that guy.
not_available Miles, I know you're trying to help, but I'll take it from here, okay? Western Operations.
not_available This is Miles Papazian, Homeland Security, Los Angeles.
not_available Pass code 21 double six.
not_available Put me through to Mike Novick.
not_available One moment, please.
not_available Yes, Miles.
not_available What is it? I need your input, sir, because I'm having a problem with Karen Hayes.
not_available I'd like to preface what I'm about to tell you by saying that I don't wish to be second
not_available guessing I don't have time for prefaces.
not_available Karen Hayes was called in to replace Bill Buchanan.
not_available She was hand
not_available chosen by the vice president to take that post.
not_available I understand that, sir.
not_available Are you saying you feel she's unfit to do the job? Four hours ago, she relieved Bill Buchanan for ineffectual leadership.
not_available He's been working covertly with Chloe O'Brian to aid Jack Bauer, a federal fugitive.
not_available Which means Buchanan needs to be dealt with appropriately.
not_available What has Karen done? She sent in a TAC team to pick them both up, but by the time they got there, O'Brian was gone.
not_available But instead of having the team do the interrogation of Buchanan onsite, Karen wasted 20 minutes by bringing him in to CTU.
not_available Maybe she felt the interrogation would be more effective with CTU resources.
not_available But, sir, she isn't even using rudimentary CTU resources.
not_available She wants to do a soft Q and A by herself.
not_available Any leads we may have had on O'Brian have dried up.
not_available Wait a second, Miles.
not_available I'm not going to pass judgment on Karen Hayes at this point.
not_available She's not interrogating a terrorist.
not_available She's dealing with a high
not_available ranking federal employee.
not_available Sometimes finesse and diplomacy are better than coercion.
not_available Your concern is duly noted, Miles.
not_available If you'll excuse me, I need to see the president.
not_available Karen.
not_available Shut up, Bill.
not_available We're offline.
not_available Now we can talk.
not_available Look, you can continue this charade of me being under arrest if you want to, but Jack needs our help.
not_available And he's getting it, but make no mistake, I am still in charge of this facility, and until I see that evidence, I must remain skeptical.
not_available Have you talked to Chloe? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What's Jack's status? He's searching the cabin for the evidence, but the pilot is going to land that plane.
not_available How much time does Jack have? To search over 50 passengers? That's impossible.
not_available Yes.
not_available The president and Mike Novick want an update on the hijacking of flight 520.
not_available Put them through.
not_available Go ahead, sir.
not_available Ms.
not_available Hayes, this is the president.
not_available Talk to me about 520.
not_available We know that Bauer's involved, but we don't know why.
not_available Isn't it obvious? Bauer is a fugitive and he's looking for safe passage out of the country.
not_available Well, that's certainly a possibility, sir.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available This man is desperate.
not_available He will say or do anything.
not_available He's not to be trusted.
not_available We need to take him down now, dead or alive.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Look.
not_available You call the pilot and you tell him that I don't care if Bauer is making threats or not, that plane has to land immediately.
not_available And when it lands, I want my Secret Service detail to take him into custody, is that clear? Ms.
not_available Hayes? Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The president has had knowledge of everything that's happened today.
not_available He wants that plane down before Jack finds the evidence.
not_available We have to buy him more time.
not_available I don't have the authority to keep that plane from landing.
not_available Sir.
not_available It still doesn't make sense to me.
not_available What? 
not_available Jack Bauer has been on the right side of everything that's happened today, up until now.
not_available Well, right now, he is hijacking a plane.
not_available This man is not stupid.
not_available He's appeared to do the right thing, but right now, he's backed into a corner, and he's desperate.
not_available Do you really believe that, sir? I absolutely do.
not_available Bauer's lied to us all day.
not_available He's played us all for fools.
not_available Flight Operations.
not_available This is Chloe O'Brian again.
not_available Yes, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available The copilot, Don Faganson, didn't check in when he boarded Flight 520.
not_available Mr.
not_available Faganson didn't board.
not_available Why not? He was replaced at the last minute.
not_available By whom? Scott Evans, the new copilot.
not_available Here are your things, go back to your seat.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, it's the copilot, Scott Evans.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available He used to fly for Hatton Air.
not_available It's a private charter company that worked exclusively for Omicron.
not_available Evans was assigned to Henderson's group.
not_available He flew him around for over a year.
not_available Okay, I need you to patch me through to the captain on a discreet channel so Evans can't hear me.
not_available Sit down! Now! Everybody stay in your seats and no one will get hurt! Are you okay? I'm fine.
not_available Incoming com on 139 Go ahead.
not_available Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.
not_available The person that I'm looking for, the man with the evidence that I need, is sitting next to you.
not_available He's your copilot, Scott Evans.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available Sir, my sources have i formed me that Evans was a last
not_available second replacement.
not_available Can you explain to me why you're not flying with your regular copilot, Don Faganson? Captain, Scott Evans has been connected to a known terrorist.
not_available You need to open the door.
not_available This conversation is over.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What did he want? He's desperate.
not_available Wants us to land.
not_available This is messed up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bad luck for you, huh? Why? Well, wasn't Don supposed to have your seat tonight? Yeah.
not_available What happened to him? I don't know.
not_available I got the call, so I'm here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available What's wrong? Could you, uh Could you take the stick for a second? You okay? Yeah.
not_available I just got a cramp in my leg.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Those are a bitch.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm the only one who can fly this plane.
not_available Now, you don't strike me as a man who's willing to die for Christopher Henderson.
not_available Give me the recording.
not_available Do it.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get back in your seat.
not_available You're going to land this plane or I'm going to put a bullet in your head.
not_available Yeah, Jack.
not_available Advise CTU I have the recording.
not_available I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.
not_available Got it.
not_available Yes.
not_available Charles.
not_available If I'm going to live with this thing, then you're going to have to help me.
not_available Help you do what, Martha? Understand.
not_available I I know you're a good man, and that deep down, you do what's best for this country.
not_available Of course I do.
not_available Then why why didn't you come to me? I'd have been there for you.
not_available I could have talked you through it.
not_available For God's sake, Martha, for the last three years, you've been one click away from a nervous breakdown every single day, and I'm gonna come to you for advice? 
not_available I have to take another call.
not_available No.
not_available Charles, no, no.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available Yes.
not_available Bauer's got the evidence.
not_available He is in control of the plane.
not_available How do you know that? We just picked up a call from Chloe O'Brian to Karen Hayes.
not_available What do we do? You are going to have to shoot down that plane, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available What? 
not_available It's the only option we've got.
not_available Otherwise, you go to prison for treason and murder.
