not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Have you secured the canister? I'm afraid not, ma'am.
not_available Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter.
not_available I was told that the area was locked down.
not_available What happened? He had help from Tony Almeida.
not_available Almeida? He was working for us.
not_available It only appeared that way.
not_available Apparently, he was pursuing his own agenda, trying to get his hands on the canister.
not_available We're all regrouping to develop leads.
not_available I may have one.
not_available As Hodges was taken into custody he yelled at me about some larger group that would continue on after his arrest.
not_available If that's the case, Madam President, we need to talk to him.
not_available I need you to call the Attorney General and draft a witness protection agreement forJonas Hodges.
not_available There's no other way he'll talk.
not_available This man murdered your son not to mention hundreds of innocent civilians.
not_available Is there anything else that I can do for you? Other than killJonas Hodges? No.
not_available I didn't mean that.
not_available You know, you're right.
not_available We shouldn't be talking about this over the phone.
not_available How soon can you be at the White House? How's 15 minutes sound? 
not_available Good.
not_available Plan was to launch simultaneous attacks early next year, multiple cities so the public would finally see that the government can't protect them.
not_available They'd demand drastic measures, and we'd step in.
not_available We were gonna supply the enemies that wanna destroy this country
not_available Muhammad this, Ahmed that.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges, I need the names of the people you are working with.
not_available I don't have
not_available I want the names! I don't know any! 
not_available Another attack today is all we need to push this thing right over the edge.
not_available This is no time to pull back.
not_available I say we take that canister and finish thejob off today.
not_available I'll contact the group.
not_available The attack will be attributed to this man: Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available We're talking about launching a new operation in the next few hours with only one canister.
not_available The plan for this operation was already in place.
not_available We'd just be accelerating the timetable.
not_available Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon, and the group is well rid of him.
not_available But in his lunacy, he did us a favor.
not_available I say we take it.
not_available Hamid! 
not_available Keep your mouth shut, and no one gets hurt.
not_available You understand? 
not_available Yes! 
not_available The following takes place between 4:00 a.m.
not_available And 5:00 a.m.
not_available How much more time do you need? The material's almost finished downloading.
not_available The financial records are in place.
not_available I'm gonna need about another 15 minutes to alter the time stamps.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm gonna take this off.
not_available You yell for help, you and your brother die.
not_available Understand? Who are you people? Putting jihadi propaganda on my computer.
not_available These weaponsYou're
not_available You're trying to make me look like a terrorist.
not_available Why are you doing this? Listen to me, Jibraan.
not_available There's only one thing you need to know.
not_available If you don't do exactly as I say you're gonna watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes.
not_available And then, I'm gonna kill you.
not_available Hmm? However if you cooperate there's a good chance the two of you will live through this.
not_available What do you want me to do? Well, first off you're gonna read this statement in front of a camera.
not_available And you're gonna read it like you mean it.
not_available No, this is insane.
not_available I can't read this.
not_available I'm not going to do this.
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available See, that sounds to me like you think you have a choice.
not_available Please, this is not right.
not_available You can't do this to us.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine.
not_available Okay, okay! Please, please, don't hurt him! I'll do whatever you say.
not_available Okay? 
not_available I'll give you five minutes to look that over.
not_available They're working on it.
not_available Just finished the first sweep with the C.T.U.
not_available Servers.
not_available There's been no chatter, no activity at all.
not_available You updated the watch list? Yes.
not_available Everyone on that list is already under surveillance by law enforcement.
not_available If one of them was going to do something, we would know about it.
not_available Yeah, well, we're gonna have to widen our perimeter.
not_available To include what? Run a check on every Muslim in the Washington, D.C.
not_available Area.
not_available Target anyone who's working in a sensitive government position or in a place that might get hit.
not_available Then I want you to start pulling the files on every political activist working in the Muslim community.
not_available Also, I want you to contact I.N.S.
not_available I want a list of every recent immigrant from an Islamic country.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Has anybody heard of racial profiling? Janis, not now.
not_available No, she's right.
not_available You're right.
not_available This is racial profiling, and I don't like it any more than you do.
not_available But Hodges told me specifically that he was gonna utilize Muslim extremists in an effort to off
not_available load the blame for this attack.
not_available I need to know who he's working with, and we're running out of time.
not_available I don't know a better way of doing this.
not_available So, if you do, please tell me now.
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Chloe.
not_available LI need you to run down the listUh
not_available L
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I forgot what I was saying.
not_available I.N.S.
not_available Records, Jack? Yeah.
not_available Run those down first, and then work backwards.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is the second time he's done this.
not_available He keeps forgetting things.
not_available He looks like hell.
not_available He's doing pretty well, considering.
not_available Considering? Considering what? He didn't tell you? Tell me what? If there's something wrong with Jack, tell me now.
not_available He's sick, Chloe.
not_available He was infected with the prion variant.
not_available How? 
not_available He was trying to recover the bioweapon canisters, and one of them ruptured.
not_available He was exposed.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm sorry, Chloe.
not_available He probably didn't want you to worry.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Frank.
not_available Come here a sec.
not_available Why didn't you tell me you were sick? It doesn't matter.
not_available It doesn't matter? I'm your friend.
not_available We need to stay focused on finding Tony.
not_available Jack, you should be in the hospital.
not_available There's no treatment for this.
not_available There's no cure.
not_available So you're telling me you're dying.
not_available Yes.
not_available How long? A day.
not_available Maybe two.
not_available I've been taking this antiseizure medicine to keep me on my feet.
not_available It's been working so far.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Chloe, it's all right.
not_available I've accepted it.
not_available And I need you to accept it too.
not_available Whatever time I've got left, I want it to matter.
not_available We need to find Tony put an end to this.
not_available Chloe.
not_available I can't do this without you.
not_available Please, I need you to go back to work.
not_available Okay.
not_available We strike this blow for our brothers and sisters who have died at the hands of this corrupt nation.
not_available The hour is here, and we are ready for the war that is to come.
not_available Our fighters will not rest until America lies crippled and dying her streets running with blood, her people begging for mercy.
not_available There will be none.
not_available Only our vengeance.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Police.
not_available Why don't you close down the computer and get out of sight.
not_available Take everything down, and watch the brother.
not_available You're coming with me.
not_available What's happening? The two police officers outside
not_available I want you to find out what they want and convince them that everything's okay in here.
not_available Jibraan don't try to warn them.
not_available D.C.
not_available P.D.
not_available Open the door, please.
not_available Yes? "Jibrain" AlZarian? Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available Uh, we got a call from one of your neighbors.
not_available They said they heard some yelling coming from your apartment saw some people they didn't recognize enter the premises thought there might be some trouble.
not_available No.
not_available Everything is fine.
not_available Those were friends of mine.
not_available And what about the yelling? We got into an argument, and they were drinking a little too much.
not_available Uh, it was nothing.
not_available Where are your friends now, sir? Um, no.
not_available They got too loud, so I asked them to leave.
not_available They won't be back.
not_available Yes, I'm very sorry for the noise.
not_available Uh, it won't happen again.
not_available L
not_available I promise.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just keep it down from now on.
not_available I will.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available You too.
not_available All right.
not_available We're clear.
not_available You did good, Jibraan.
not_available Now we have to finish reading the statement before we take off.
not_available Where are we going? Don't worry about that.
not_available You just keep doing as we say and you and your brother are gonna make it through this.
not_available All right? Set him up.
not_available And there will be none.
not_available Only our vengeance.
not_available And this is only the beginning.
not_available We will strike again and again in the name of all that is great and righteous.
not_available I think I've got something.
not_available Agent Walker.
not_available What is it? One of the filters flagged this a few minutes ago.
not_available I just finished vetting it.
not_available These are multiple deposits over a period of six months.
not_available They're from an overseas Muslim relief organization called The Islamic League for World Peace.
not_available A total of two million dollars to the Washington Continental Bank.
not_available Every penny of it was withdrawn within 30 minutes.
not_available What name's on the account? 
not_available Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available He's 27 years old, moved here from Pakistan on a student visa four years ago.
not_available This is his personal Web account.
not_available These are some of the sites he's been looking at recently.
not_available We got an address on him? 
not_available No.
not_available This address is false.
not_available It doesn't exist.
not_available His visa expired.
not_available He's here illegally, and he probably doesn't want to be found.
not_available He does have a personal reference on his I.N.S.
not_available Form.
not_available Who? Muhtadi Gohar.
not_available He lives at the G Street mosque in Georgetown.
not_available He's the imam there.
not_available He might be able to help us find Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available We need to talk to him.
not_available Put out an A.P.B.
not_available On Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available Run it through the interagency database, see what else you can find.
not_available Fax everything over to the car.
not_available Great work.
not_available Jack, wait.
not_available You sure you're up for this? I have to see this through.
not_available Please.
not_available I can help.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come in.
not_available Ma'am, Mr.
not_available Collier to see you.
not_available Thank you, Agent Pierce.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available I appreciate you coming, Martin.
not_available It's been a long time.
not_available You look good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, Olivia, I know why you asked me here, but I have to tell you having me dig up dirt on Noah Daniels is one thing.
not_available This is a whole different animal.
not_available I'm aware of that, Martin.
not_available I want this to happen.
not_available I want this person taken care of.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available It's Jonas Hodges.
not_available Starkwood.
not_available Yes.
not_available What in God's name do you have against him? I don't know how much of this will get out but Hodges was behind everything that happened today from the planes going down to the attack on the White House.
not_available What? 
not_available It's true.
not_available He's also responsible for the death of my brother.
not_available I thought your brother killed himself.
not_available He was murdered, and Hodges was responsible.
not_available Okay.
not_available But why? It's complicated, Martin, and I don't have time to go into it.
not_available All you need to know is Hodges worked a deal.
not_available Witness protection.
not_available My mother approved it, and he's going free.
not_available Unless someone intervenes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can I give you a little advice? What? 
not_available This is big game.
not_available Walk away.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Once this happens, once it goes through, you can never go back.
not_available You will live with it for the rest of your life.
not_available I don't need a lecture on conscience from you, of all people.
not_available Oh.
not_available I have thought this through.
not_available What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this.
not_available He has to pay for what he did.
not_available So, uh, where's Hodges now? In F.B.I.
not_available Custody.
not_available Downtown bureau.
not_available Deal's been signed.
not_available He's being released into witness protection within the hour.
not_available Here's his itinerary.
not_available When he walks out that door, we lose him.
not_available He disappears forever.
not_available This has gotta happen fast.
not_available Martin.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll make a call.
not_available I'll get you contact information, a price and instructions on how to transfer the funds.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You'll hear from me soon.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges, this is U.S.
not_available Marshal Sullivan.
not_available I'm placing you in his custody.
not_available He'll take you to witness protection.
not_available Thank you for your hospitality, young lady.
not_available This dossier outlines your new identity your new place of residence
not_available all the information you're going to need to make this transition.
not_available "Robert Tippet." That's my new name.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sounds like a dog breed.
not_available Our first stop is the WitSec facility in Colorado.
not_available We'll put the finishing touches on your new biography, fabricate your new I.
not_available D get you into counseling.
not_available Counseling? It helps entrants deal with their new circumstances.
not_available Son, you know who I am.
not_available Do I impress you as someone who needs therapy to cope with new circumstances? The service is available if you want it, sir courtesy of the American taxpayer.
not_available You think I'm getting off easy, don't you? 
not_available I don't think anything.
not_available I can smell attitude, son and you're giving it off pretty thick.
not_available I've lost everything
not_available my company, my family and most importantly, my name.
not_available Do you know how much blood and sweat went into making that name mean something? We leave for Andrews Air Force Base in 30 minutes.
not_available I suggest you get ready.
not_available Jack? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What are you doing? We don't even know they've done anything yet.
not_available They could be innocent.
not_available Innocent? You heard Hodges.
not_available They're gonna use sleeper cells to carry out these attacks.
not_available AlZarian might not have been knowingly complicit about everything that happened today, but innocent? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes? This is Agent Walker with F.B.I.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gohar? Yes.
not_available We're sorry to bother you at such a late hour, but we need your help.
not_available My help? 
not_available To stop a potential terrorist attack.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gohar? I know you.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Of course.
not_available I watched your testimony on television.
not_available Sir, can we talk to you inside? Please.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available We're looking for a man who worships here.
not_available We believe he may be helping to plan another attack that might be happening soon, in D.C.
not_available I knew the blame would eventually fall on us.
not_available His name is Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available Do you know him? And why do you think he's a terrorist? He fits a specific profile.
not_available You mean he is a Muslim.
not_available He's a Pakistani national his visa lapsed a year ago, and he has no legal address.
not_available He listed you as a personal reference on his I.N.S.
not_available Form.
not_available Where someone worships is private information, protected by law! Right now, finding Al
not_available Zarian is the only way we're gonna prevent an attack against civilians.
not_available So I ask you again, sir, do you know him? Look at the photo! Yes.
not_available I know him, but he is not a terrorist.
not_available What makes you so sure? Jibraan has come to me many times for spiritual advice.
not_available I know the man.
not_available He is not violent, and he is not an extremist.
not_available We have evidence that indicates otherwise.
not_available I would like to see this evidence.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available We did not come here to debate this with you! Where does he live? 
not_available I don't know where he lives.
not_available Where does he work? 
not_available I don't know that either.
not_available And I don't believe you! But you expect me to believe you? I watched your hearing at the Senate.
not_available I know what you have done.
not_available So, tell me, why should I believe anything you say to me? First, because you don't have a choice.
not_available Second, because I am telling you the truth.
not_available The truth is that you come into a house of worship with information you should not have an outrageous accusation, no legal warrant and threaten me.
not_available I have not threatened you.
not_available Not yet.
not_available But we both know where this is going.
not_available If you're so sure he's innocent why are you afraid to tell us where he is? 
not_available Jack.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available I told you.
not_available I don't know.
not_available But even if I did, I would say nothing.
not_available I will not help you arrest an innocent man.
not_available This is Agent Walker.
not_available It's Janis.
not_available A D.C.
not_available P.D.
not_available Officer recognized Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian from a domestic disturbance call he took 15 minutes ago.
not_available The address is 2700 East Brook, Apartment 3.
not_available All right.
not_available Good.
not_available Coordinate with D.C.
not_available P.D.
not_available Set up an envelope and put the building under surveillance.
not_available We'll be there in 10 minutes.
not_available We have an address on Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available Let's go, Jack.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Why? 
not_available I said turn around.
not_available Put your hands up, now! 
not_available Jack.
not_available What are you doing, Jack? I'm not letting him call Al
not_available Zarian before we get there.
not_available He's coming with us.
not_available You have no right.
not_available I have done nothing wrong.
not_available Shut up! And there will be none.
not_available Only our vengeance.
not_available And this is only the beginning.
not_available We will strike again and again in the name of all that is great and righteous.
not_available All right.
not_available Fine.
not_available The hour is here, and we are ready
not_available Station team's ready and waiting on us.
not_available This'll be uploaded in two minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available who have died at the hands of this corrupt nation.
not_available Our fighters will not rest until America lies crippled
not_available Jibraan.
not_available We're getting ready to move out.
not_available I'm gonna need you to talk to your brother tell him what we discussed.
not_available Go ahead and wake him up.
not_available Please, I can't do this.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available And you will.
not_available How do I know you won't kill Hamid anyway? Because we need him to tell the police that his brother's a terrorist.
not_available Believe me you're saving his life by doing this.
not_available Now come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, hey, hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hamid.
not_available Hamid.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available Jibraan, what is this? Sorry we had to do it this way but you're not gonna be hurt anymore, okay? "We"? Who's "we"? What's happening? 
not_available I explain everything to you, okay? Who's he? Uh, he's a friend.
not_available Your friend? I know all your friends.
not_available I never seen him before.
not_available That's because I have kept him from you.
not_available What are you talking about? I have to tell you something.
not_available I'm not the person you think I am.
not_available What? 
not_available I hate what this country has done to our people and I'm working with these men.
not_available They are going to help me strike back against the evil that has been done to us.
not_available Strike back? I can't say any more than that.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available This country brought us in, gave us a home.
not_available That's what you always said.
not_available Yeah, that was a lie.
not_available I have been protecting you from this rage I have always felt inside.
not_available But now it is time for you to know the truth.
not_available It was the Americans who killed our parents, Hamid.
not_available I'm going to make them pay.
not_available What have you done to my brother? You've poisoned his mind.
not_available This isn't my brother.
not_available They have not done anything to me, okay? It is very important 
not_available you accept what I am saying to you.
not_available Why are you telling me this? When they ask you why I did what I did I want you to tell them.
not_available Okay? No one will blame you for anything.
not_available You have done nothing wrong.
not_available I know this is very, uh, difficult for you to understand but over time, you will see.
not_available I love you, Hamid.
not_available Hey.
not_available You said today was a bad day to be a Muslim.
not_available Well, it's an even worse day to be your brother.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available The staging area's ready.
not_available Stay here and finish up.
not_available Understood.
not_available Jibraan, don't do this.
not_available Everything set? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Was the brother convinced? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available But even if he wasn't, once the attack happens, he will be.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hello? Hello? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Martin Collier said you'd be expecting my call.
not_available He gave me the target's itinerary.
not_available I'm set to go.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available So the terms are acceptable.
not_available They are.
not_available I just need you to transfer the funds.
not_available What's the account number? 
not_available International banking code is Victor6Bravo1Bravo
not_available 1.
not_available Account number 059907 After the funds have been transferred, I'll proceed.
not_available There'll be no need for us to have any further contact.
not_available All right, but what are you going to
not_available Hello? 
not_available Yes? 
not_available Excuse me, Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available I thought you should know your father has asked to see you.
not_available My father's here? 
not_available In light of the potential bioweapon attack the president ordered him moved to the White House for his safety.
not_available Thank you, Aaron.
not_available I just have something to take care of.
not_available Tell them I'll be right there.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available No.
not_available You've reached Martin Collier.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.
not_available I spoke to the contact, but I couldn't go through with it.
not_available I decided to take your advice and walk away.
not_available Please call me as soon as you can.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available I found something weird about these hits on Jibraan Al
not_available Zarian.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available You know how I said that the two million dollars was deposited into his account over a period of six months? 
not_available That wasn't right.
not_available They were backdated.
not_available What do you mean? One of the trace algorithms caught a discrepancy.
not_available All that money was really just deposited 30 minutes ago.
not_available What about the extremist Web sites he was visiting? Same thing with the time stamps.
not_available The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.
not_available Are you absolutely positive? 
not_available It looks that way.
not_available Jibraan could be innocent.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available What's going on, Jack? 
not_available Chloe found evidence thatJibraan is being set up.
not_available He's been framed.
not_available Why would Almeida frame an innocent man? Because they wouldn't want to risk the attack not being carried out properly.
not_available How could I be so stupid? An innocent man is so much easier to control.
not_available All they needed was a Muslim.
not_available They could create whatever background they wanted.
not_available Give me your hands.
not_available I am surprised.
not_available Why? You were right.
not_available Not aboutJibraan.
not_available My experience with the authorities, the police is that they will go to any lengths not to admit they were wrong.
not_available Even at the expense of an innocent man's life.
not_available At least you didn't do that.
not_available Please know that I forgive you.
not_available I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
not_available Then I hope you can at least forgive yourself.
not_available I gave up on that a long time ago.
not_available It's never too late to turn towards God, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Mmm.
not_available That's enough? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You don't need to stay with me, Ally.
not_available They know where to find me if they need me.
not_available I thought it was important for you to hear what's going on.
not_available Hmm.
not_available And for you to understand why I did what I did.
not_available You're the president, sweetheart.
not_available You don't owe me an explanation.
not_available There's my girl.
not_available Hi, Dad.
not_available Livy, you can squeeze a bit harder.
not_available I won't break.
not_available Oh! I might.
not_available I'm sorry I couldn't come to the hospital.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available You're a godsend being here, helping your mom.
not_available Just knowing you two are speaking again let alone working together, that's enough.
not_available Henry, I'm not sure that our détente is holding at the moment.
not_available Olivia.
not_available Your mother told me about the deal she made with Jonas Hodges.
not_available And I know you understandably have serious concerns about that.
not_available Well, I've had some time to think
not_available to put myself in Mom's position to be objective and pragmatic the way a good leader should be.

not_available And the picture.
not_available You like your job, Mr.

not_available You strike me as someone who wouldn't be totally satisfied ferrying prisoners around.
not_available I don't plan on doing this my entire life.
not_available Good to hear that.
not_available Maybe you and I can do some work together someday.
not_available Sir? I don't intend to be Mr.

not_available How can you be sure? 
not_available 'Cause that's what I would have done.
not_available Agent, it is imperative that we take this hostile alive, right now.

not_available Maybe you should be in charge.
not_available I am.
not_available Jack was infected with the bioweapon
not_available the same one that they are gonna use in this attack.
not_available Then he should be in the hospital.
not_available There is no treatment.
not_available He probably has less than a day to live.
not_available So, if he is strong enough, trust me, he is the best person for this job.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't realize.
not_available Agent Walker.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Please, Mr.
not_available Bauer, do what you can to save Hamid.
