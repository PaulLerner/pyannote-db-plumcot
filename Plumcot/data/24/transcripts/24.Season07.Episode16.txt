not_available Previously on 24.
not_available No! 
not_available Sir, it's Senator Mayer.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Are you telling me thatJack Bauer just killed a United States senator? How could you have let this happen? Mr.
not_available Kanin, you are not gonna lay this one at my feet.
not_available What is it, Ethan? What's wrong? Madam President, I'm afraid I have no choice but to resign as your chief of staff You're taking this too far.
not_available Where's Jack? 
not_available We don't have him.
not_available The man who framed Jack for Burnett's murder was John Quinn, a Starkwood contractor.
not_available Jack went to Mayer to get the evidence to prove it.
not_available Starkwood was involved with everything that's happened today.
not_available They helped Juma and his men bring down those planes and attack the White House.
not_available In exchange, they were allowed to develop and manufacture a W.M.D.
not_available In Sangala.
not_available The text message I got off their agent's cell phone said " Port of Alexandria, Lot C, 10:15 p.m." Go red! Go red! 
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage! 
not_available Get that truck outta here, now! Tony! The truck
not_available I'm going after it! Cover me now! I'm in possession of a biological weapon interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.
not_available What's your status? The package is secure.
not_available We're inbound.
not_available What about Bauer? 
not_available He's at the scene, sir, but he sought cover nearby.
not_available We have to assume that he contacted the authorities so we better be on an accelerated timetable.
not_available Get over here.
not_available Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon.
not_available They airlifted the freight right outta here.
not_available They were headed due west from my current position.
not_available Jack, I can't assault a private compound unless I have proof that a weapon exists.
not_available Where's the C.D.C.
not_available They're scrambling a team right now.
not_available Send 'em to me.
not_available You'll have all the proof you need.
not_available Jack, what happened? 
not_available I was exposed.
not_available The following takes place between 11:00 p.m.
not_available And 12:00 a.m.
not_available We're ready for, you, sir.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, Dr.
not_available Macer, C.D.C.
not_available We need you to get undressed.
not_available You're the one that talked to Agent Moss? He brought me up to speed.
not_available Said you had some information about the bioweapon.
not_available All I know is that it was developed in Sangala.
not_available According to rumors from the village that it was tested on all the victims suffered from dementia and paralysis.
not_available Check neurological vectors and pathogens.
not_available How much was released? I'm not exactly sure.
not_available The weapon was stored in a pressurized canister.
not_available It was breached for maybe two minutes before I could seal it off.
not_available This is not a reaction.
not_available I've had these scars.
not_available This is a full
not_available spectrum antibiotic.
not_available It should counteract a wide range of known pathogens.
not_available Step inside, sir.
not_available Raise your arms, close your eyes.
not_available Janis, where are we? Metro closed down a six
not_available mile stretch of Highway 236.
not_available The C.D.C.
not_available First responders are on site.
not_available What the hell's going on? One of the bioweapon canisters was breached.
not_available Jack may have been exposed.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Starkwood took the canisters.
not_available They're probably flying 'em back to their main compound in Virginia 
not_available along with Tony Almeida.
not_available Almeida? He was working with Jack.
not_available We think he might have been taken captive.
not_available Hang on one second.
not_available I need you to put together a briefing packet on Starkwood.
not_available I want every division caught up to speed on what we might be dealing with.
not_available Planning to move on Starkwood? That place is enormous.
not_available It's practically a military base.
not_available We're not gonna do anything until we have concrete evidence on the bioweapon from C.D.C.
not_available Then I'll inform the president, and she'll decide how to proceed.
not_available Wait till I say! Easy! Easy! Almeida's not going to talk.
not_available He's not the type.
not_available He's the brave type.
not_available "Know the psychology of your subject." That's in our manual.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges.
not_available We isolated the damaged canister.
not_available We got lucky.
not_available They know we have the weapons.
not_available That's not so lucky.
not_available How fast can you have them ready? 
not_available It's gonna take me at least two hours.
not_available Too long, Tom.
not_available Sir, we don't know what the government knows.
not_available They're coming.
not_available And they'll be coming with everything they've got.
not_available And the only thing that's gonna stop them is getting these weapons ready to deploy.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll do my best.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Okay, let's go! 
not_available What does the F.B.I.
not_available Know? I'm not gonna ask you again.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're a good man, Tony.
not_available I know your profile.
not_available You've had some hard breaks.
not_available I don't want to see you hurt.
not_available So you just tell me what the F.B.I.
not_available Knows about what we're doin' here.
not_available And I can't say you'll walk away smiling.
not_available That would be unrealistic.
not_available But you'll be alive.
not_available You hear me? But I don't know anything, Mr.
not_available Hodges.
not_available I'm giving you a way out, Tony.
not_available Sir.
not_available May I speak to you for a moment? 
not_available Not now, Greg.
not_available Please, sir.
not_available Just for a moment.
not_available What is it? This was supposed to be a covert operation.
not_available That is not the case anymore.
not_available The government knows that we have these weapons and they're not just gonna sit on that information.
not_available What are you suggesting, Greg? Maybe we should destroy the evidence while we still have some time.
not_available I can't believe that I'm hearing this from you.
not_available I'm just trying to help, sir.
not_available I care about this company as much as you do.
not_available Oh, I doubt that.
not_available We've invested a lot of blood and treasure to get these weapons and I'm not gonna give them up.
not_available Think about what you're risking, sir
not_available everything.
not_available Everything you built.
not_available You say you're trying to help.
not_available You know what I think? I think you're worried about your own ass.
not_available Get him out of here and do what you have to do.
not_available Think about what I said, young man.
not_available You're a little nervous, Greg.
not_available We'll, I've got a news flash.
not_available We're all nervous.
not_available Keep your doubts to yourself.
not_available I'm not gonna tell you again.
not_available We're gonna need more blood and saliva samples, and I'd like to collect a spinal fluid specimen.
not_available Until we know what we're dealing with, we need to keep you under quarantine.
not_available How long till you know whether or not I've been infected? We should have the preliminary results in the next 15 minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Macer.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available We've detected trace amounts of an airborne pathogen.
not_available It's concentrated near the truck.
not_available We're also picking it up from the surrounding environments in much lower concentrations.
not_available Can you identify it? 
not_available No.
not_available But we're analyzing a sample now.
not_available These levels shouldn't present any danger to the nearby population but I still want atmospheric monitors set up.
not_available It's a good thing you sealed off the canister, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available You saved a lot of lives.
not_available You're gonna have to transport me back to F.B.I.
not_available I'm still material evidence in an ongoing terrorist threat.
not_available Those were our orders.
not_available We can run our tests from there.
not_available Okay.
not_available BobJustman's been associate counsel for the past three years.
not_available He and Ethan worked very closely together.
not_available He's certainly qualified to be chief of staff.
not_available But? After what's happened today, I think you should be looking outside your administration.
not_available An insider has a leg up.
not_available Chief of staff has a steep learning curve.
not_available I think you're underestimating the value of a fresh perspective.
not_available You have someone in mind.
not_available I do.
not_available Rick Berman.
not_available Would Rick even consider leaving the private sector? He's made his fortune.
not_available I think he'd jump at the chance to serve his country.
not_available Let's sit down with him.
not_available Great.
not_available But keep Bob on the list.
not_available I still have a good feeling about him.
not_available I'll start to set up meetings tomorrow.
not_available Livy, it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement.
not_available In the meantime, I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff.
not_available I'd like that to be you.
not_available Um
not_available Madam President? 
not_available Yes? Tim Woods is here to see you.
not_available Just give me a minute, please, and then send him in.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Livy, I need someone I can trust especially after everything that's happened today.
not_available You're not going to say no to your mother, are you? Of
not_available Of course not.
not_available Good.
not_available Madam President, I have Larry Moss at F.B.I.
not_available Calling for you.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available I don't know the specifics but he says it involves an imminent homeland threat.
not_available Put him through.
not_available It's all right, Tim.
not_available I've made Olivia acting chief of staff.
not_available Agent Moss, you're on with the president.
not_available Madam President, we have a situation developing.
not_available First of all, you need to know thatJack Bauer did not kill Ryan Burnett nor Senator Blaine Mayer.
not_available He was framed for their murders.
not_available I knew it.
not_available Who framed him? Our operational theory is that he was set up by Starkwood.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Why would Starkwood frameJack? To cover up the fact that they helped Juma stage the terrorist attacks today.
not_available What? 
not_available Ma'am, we have evidence that Starkwood provided Juma with technological support and intelligence.
not_available In return, Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala as a base to operate without having to worry about any oversight.
not_available A base for what? 
not_available To manufacture weapons of mass destruction.
not_available Specifically, biological weapons.
not_available What kind of bioweapons are you talking about? We're not sure, but it could be some kind of neurological pathogen.
not_available C.D.C.
not_available Obtained a sample.
not_available They're analyzing it now.
not_available Agent Moss, you said there was an imminent threat? Yes.
not_available A large shipment of bioweapons was delivered to Starkwood.
not_available We believe they're in possession of them now.
not_available Are you saying these weapons are on U.S.
not_available Soil? We suspect they're at the Starkwood headquarters in Virginia.
not_available You're not suggesting Starkwood intends to use those weapons to attack this country? We don't know.
not_available But given their actions today we need to move on Starkwood immediately.
not_available Madam President? Assemble the cabinet and theJoint Chiefs.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Jack was right about Starkwood.
not_available You find evidence that they've been supporting Juma? Yeah.
not_available Did you find out why? What could Starkwood possibly get from Juma? The infrastructure to develop and test biological weapons.
not_available We think they're holding 'em somewhere on the Starkwood compound.
not_available Okay.
not_available Where's Jack? He's on his way over here.
not_available What, Larry? Larry? He managed to secure the weapons but then, uh, Starkwood got 'em back.
not_available And when that happened, um Jack was exposed.
not_available He may have been infected.
not_available He's being placed under quarantine.
not_available Listen, he's on his way here, and we need to find out everything that he learned about these weapons and I think you should be the one who debriefs him.
not_available And I owe you an apology.
not_available I was wrong not to trust you.
not_available L
not_available I let my prejudice about Bauer get in the way.
not_available But, Renee, you should have kept me in the loop.
not_available You should have trusted me.
not_available I know.
not_available I should have.
not_available When are we moving on Starkwood? Aaron.
not_available Uh
not_available I'll check in with you guys later, okay? Thank you.
not_available May I speak with you for a moment? 
not_available Of course.
not_available I heard you finished your debrief and were on your way out.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Well, I need you to stay.
not_available Ma'am? 
not_available I've been appointed acting chief of staff.
not_available The Secret Service is going to assign an agent to handle my security detail.
not_available I'd like that to be you.
not_available Well, I'm truly flattered, ma'am, but as you know, I'm retired.
not_available I can have you reinstated.
not_available There are plenty of fine agents on the roster.
not_available But I don't want them.
not_available I want you.
not_available I can't go into the details now, but the threat to this country isn't over.
not_available We're in the middle of a crisis, and I need people around me I can trust.
not_available I trust you, Aaron.
not_available I can't say that about a lot of people.
not_available I'm running into a meeting with the president.
not_available I'll assume your answer is yes.
not_available Gentlemen, ladies, please take your seats.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Here's the packet.
not_available Now those of you who haven't had a chance to finish your briefing packets, please keep reading.
not_available As we've all just learned, this day is not over.
not_available Our national security is still being threatened and we are here to consider our options.
not_available Mr.
not_available Woods.
not_available Your briefing materials include F.B.I.
not_available Intelligence about a cache of biological weapons on Starkwood's main compound in Northern Virginia.
not_available This is a recent satellite view of the compound.
not_available Over three square miles, 259 structures.
not_available The weapons could be hidden anywhere on the facility.
not_available What kind ofbioweapons are we talking about? This is Ben Landry.
not_available He's director of C.D.C.
not_available He's here to answer any questions you may have in regards to the pathogen.
not_available Ben? I've just received a preliminary report from our agents in the field.
not_available They've identified the pathogen as a prion variant indigenous to the East Congo.
not_available It's a form of Creutzfeldt
not_available Jacob disease.
not_available It attacks the brain and the nervous system causes dementia, physical deterioration ultimately death.
not_available Now, standard C.J.D.
not_available Kills within several months, but this strain kills more quickly.
not_available How long? 
not_available A day.
not_available Maybe two.
not_available There's no treatment for this disease.
not_available There's no cure.
not_available If dispersed over a populated area, the results would be catastrophic.
not_available But it goes without saying we cannot allow a private military force, these killers to possess weapons of mass destruction.
not_available We need to find these weapons and arrest those bastards in Starkwood who are responsible for bringing 'em here.
not_available Uh, Madam President.
not_available Given the size of the compound, it would take a considerable force to locate these weapons.
not_available Not to mention the fact that there are God forbid they decide to resist.
not_available We could have a small war in our own backyard.
not_available I share those concerns, Madam President.
not_available We also have to consider the possibility that Starkwood might use these biological weapons against our own forces.
not_available What about an air strike? A facility that large would require multiple bombing runs.
not_available We'd be looking at massive casualties on the Starkwood base with no guarantee of destroying the bioweapons.
not_available For all we know, they've been buried underground or in fortified facilities.
not_available There's also a risk that hitting these weapons with insufficient force could release the bio
not_available agent into the atmosphere.
not_available We can'tjust ignore the law here.
not_available All these scenarios would be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.
not_available I mean, we can't deploy military personnel in a law enforcement capacity not without congressional approval.
not_available Now, what I'm hearing is that there are no good options.
not_available I don't accept that.
not_available Until we find a way to contain this threat we are risking another attack on this country and that is an option I won't consider.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges wants to know if you've given any thought to his offer.
not_available Why this loyalty to a government that screwed you over? I don't get it.
not_available Just tell us what the F.B.I.
not_available Knows, and you can walk.
not_available For the record, I bet Mr.
not_available Hodges a pair of Redskin tickets you wouldn't talk.
not_available Looks like I'm gonna be sitting on the 50
not_available yard line.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, what the hell's going on? 
not_available I need your help.
not_available My help? We need to stop this.
not_available It's gone too far.
not_available Look, I'm not goin' anywhere till you tell me why you're doin' this.
not_available I'm not spending the rest of my life in prison becauseJonas Hodges has lost his mind.
not_available You know where the weapons are? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then you better tell me right now.
not_available I want immunity.
not_available I can't promise you anything.
not_available We can call the F.B.I.
not_available And negotiate a deal.
not_available Immunity in exchange for your help in recovering the weapons.
not_available That's the best I can do.
not_available I can set up a secure landline in my office.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're pulling up to F.B.I.
not_available We have to put you in an isolation suit to transfer you to the quarantine area.
not_available I understand.
not_available How are you feeling? No different.
not_available We have the results of Mr.
not_available Bauer's blood work.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Open it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Larry wanted me to tell you that C.D.C.
not_available Arrived with Jack Bauer.
not_available I'll meet them down in quarantine.
not_available He's not in quarantine.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available They just cleared security.
not_available He's on his way up.
not_available Jack.
not_available Are you okay? My blood work came in positive.
not_available I'm infected.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, there's a room for you to change in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's fine.
not_available But he's not in quarantine.
not_available We've learned the disease isn't contagious.
not_available It was engineered that way to prevent blowback on the people deploying it.
not_available Okay, but there has to be something that you can do to help him.
not_available There's no cure.
not_available But he's patient zero.
not_available Whatever we learn from the pathogen will come from the tests we still need to run.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is Macer.
not_available He's stable for the moment.
not_available Yeah? Jack, um
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available You can tell me that Agent Moss followed up on Starkwood.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Larry debriefed the White House and we're waiting on the president to decide on a course of action.
not_available Good.
not_available Any word on Tony? Sorry.
not_available We don't know anything yet.
not_available I need to debrief you on the canisters that you saw.
not_available You okay with that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've read the statement from the port authority cop.
not_available He said that you risked the mission to save his life.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Uh, it's the lab.
not_available It's probably Hodges.
not_available I should talk to him.
not_available Put it on speaker.
not_available Seaton.
not_available Where the hell have you been? I've been trying to reach you.
not_available I was, uh, checking on Almeida.
not_available Did Stokes get him to talk? 
not_available He's still working on that, sir.
not_available I told him to put Almeida down if he didn't start talking.
not_available I think we should give him a few more minutes, sir.
not_available We're busting our asses to get these weapons ready before the government makes their move.
not_available I want all hands on deck.
not_available We'll be there soon, sir.
not_available See that you are, Greg.
not_available Call F.B.I.
not_available I need to set up the secure landline, make sure nobody's listening.
not_available All right.
not_available Well, do it.
not_available I never thoughtJonas would take it this far.
not_available I mean, the man's a patriot.
not_available He founded Starkwood to protect this country.
not_available Yeah? Well, why's he attacking it? It's complicated.
not_available I don't understand it myself.
not_available I should have done more to stop this.
not_available I should have called F.B.I.
not_available Months ago.
not_available Well, you're doin' the right thing now.
not_available I pulled together everything we have on Starkwood.
not_available Structural specs, aerial maps, topography, company rosters
not_available the whole works.
not_available All right.
not_available Upload it onto the interagency servers.
not_available Let's get everybody on the same page.
not_available That's good work, Janis.
not_available Renee.
not_available I heard aboutJack.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm still debriefing him, but I brought a full description of the canisters.
not_available Good.
not_available Get this out to the field agents.
not_available How's he doin'? Hard to tell.
not_available Larry, so many people have died today.
not_available We cannot let their deaths be for nothing.
not_available We won't.
not_available Larry? I've got Tony Almeida on the phone.
not_available Almeida? 
not_available He says he's calling from inside Starkwood.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Go ahead, Tony.
not_available Who am I talking to? 
not_available It's Larry Moss.
not_available What's going on? I'm on the Starkwood compound.
not_available I was being held by a man named Jonas Hodges but I was released by one of his executives
not_available a man named Greg Seaton.
not_available He wants to cut a deal.
not_available He wants immunity.
not_available What's he offering in return? 
not_available He knows where the weapons are being held.
not_available All right, Tony, I gotta run this by the president.
not_available Wait, Larry.
not_available Do you know what happened toJack? He's here.
not_available He's in medical.
not_available Was he hit? 
not_available No.
not_available One of the canisters was breached.
not_available He's been infected.
not_available Tony, I gotta call the White House.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Janis, set up a secure connection in the conference room with Almeida and the White House for signature.
not_available And get me the president on the phone.
not_available What is this? 
not_available Footage recovered from Sangala.
not_available It was smuggled out of the remains of a biological weapons lab about 45 minutes ago.
not_available It's a confirmation thatJuma was experimenting with biological weapons on the local population.
not_available These poor people were suffering from the effects of the weaponized prion variant.
not_available And that's what we allowed Starkwood to bring into this country.
not_available We didn't allow this.
not_available Starkwood is a monster we created, Olivia.
not_available We have been feeding it for years.
not_available We gave them military contracts.
not_available We relied on their paid mercenaries instead of our own soldiers outsourced intelligence gathering operations.
not_available My God, we even passed a law so that they could build a military base You fought against all that.
not_available You've been trying to limit Starkwood's power ever since you took office.
not_available I didn't do enough fast enough.
not_available And now it may be too late.
not_available Madam President, Tim Woods and Admiral Smith are here to see you.
not_available Send them in.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President, Larry Moss at F.B.I.
not_available Is calling in.
not_available He says it's urgent.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Agent Moss, the president's here.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Madam President, we've been contacted by someone inside Starkwood.
not_available Ma'am, it's Tony Almeida.
not_available Almeida? He's been working with Jack Bauer to recover these weapons.
not_available He was taken captive, but then released by someone on the inside.
not_available His name is Greg Seaton.
not_available He's part ofJonas Hodges's inner circle.
not_available Ma'am, he says he's willing to tell us where the weapons are in exchange for immunity.
not_available I've already started mobilizing for a targeted raid.
not_available We can catch 'em by surprise and lock down these weapons.
not_available But I'm gonna need you to sign an immunity agreement for this man.
not_available How confident are you of Seaton's intel? We believe it's genuine, ma'am.
not_available Madam President, we may not get a chance like this again.
not_available Admiral Smith? 
not_available I concur.
not_available But I would suggest we supplement the F.B.I.
not_available With a SEAL squad.
not_available They're ready to move on my order.
not_available The Attorney General will raise hell about us involving the military in this operation.
not_available We'll deal with him later.
not_available Agent Moss, you have my direct authorization to move on Starkwood.
not_available How soon can you be ready? We've already drafted an executive pardon and set it up via WebEx.
not_available You'll be able to give a secure digital signature, and we're good to go.
not_available We have the document set up at your assistant's computer.
not_available Agent Moss, the president is prepared to sign.
not_available Go ahead, ma'am.
not_available All right, it's done.
not_available Did you get a signature? 
not_available Yeah, we're good.
not_available When can you be at Starkwood? 
not_available We can be there in 10 minutes.
not_available Agent Moss, thank you, and good luck.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Madam President, we may have just caught a lucky break.
not_available Until this plays out, I want everyone to keep looking for other options.
not_available All right, Mr.
not_available Seaton, go ahead.
not_available The weapons are in a warehouse on the northeast quadrant of the compound.
not_available 3244.23 North Mr.
not_available Seaton, it would help to have someone on the ground doing recon.
not_available Can you get Tony to that warehouse? 
not_available I think so.
not_available See if you can get ahold of a hand radio.
not_available We'll be on 480 kilohertz.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll be there.
not_available We land here, we'll be within 50 yards of the warehouse.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Support teams here and here, shore us up.
not_available Coordinate with the navy.
not_available Get moving.
not_available I'll meet you upstairs.
not_available Let's move.
not_available You're mobilizing.
not_available What's going on? We got a call from Tony.
not_available He's working with an informant inside Starkwood.
not_available We got a location on the weapon.
not_available We're getting ready to stage a raid on the compound.
not_available I want to go.
