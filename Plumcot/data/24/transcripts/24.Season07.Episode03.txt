not_available Previously on 24.
not_available What the hell is this? All our screens for the eastern quadrant are locked.
not_available I took out your control units.
not_available I want you to see what we can do.
not_available Get ready to make the course change.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, this is Northeast Three Control.
not_available Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.
not_available We have a new runway assignment for you.
not_available Sid, there's another plane landing on 4 Right.
not_available It crosses 31 Left.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, pull up.
not_available That was just a warning shot.
not_available Whatever we do next, it'll be the real thing.
not_available Get the module ready.
not_available As promised.
not_available GeneralJuma will be pleased.
not_available Perhaps now would be a good time to make your demands known to President Taylor.
not_available Make the preparations.
not_available Your government is about to pay a very steep price for interfering in our affairs.
not_available They assumed my son killed himself.
not_available They didn't look deeply enough at anything.
not_available The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.
not_available You're not going anywhere till I get the truth.
not_available Sir.
not_available You know who murdered my son.
not_available He killed himself.
not_available I'm gonna find out what you're hiding.
not_available And when I do, God help you.
not_available You're right.
not_available He's not one of ours.
not_available We'll follow him, see if he leads us to Almeida.
not_available Dornan! 
not_available That's not the right move.
not_available You can't bring anyone else into this.
not_available What the hell's goin' on? We're following up on a lead, and I will fill you in if and when we find something.
not_available I do not like this.
not_available I just flat
not_available out lied to my boss.
not_available I told you I would help you find Tony Almeida, but you're gonna have to let me do it my way.
not_available Tony! Stop! The device is gone.
not_available The locator files have been deleted.
not_available Where is it? What the hell happened to you? 
not_available The following takes place between 10:00 a.m.
not_available And 11:00 a.m.
not_available Where's Almeida now? 
not_available He's in transit to F.B.I.
not_available Headquarters.
not_available He'll be formally interrogated there.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.
not_available Lfhe doesn't have the C.I.P.
not_available Device, who does? 
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Has learned that Almeida handed off the device to someone else.
not_available They don't know who.
not_available I may have an answer to that question, Madam President.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available Almeida's working for theJuma regime.
not_available Approximately five minutes ago, an audio message was routed to the State Department subnet.
not_available It's from Colonel Iké Dubaku.
not_available He's Juma's right
not_available hand man.
not_available He's known as the Butcher of Sangala.
not_available Over 300,000 people were murdered.
not_available I know who he is.
not_available What did the message say? Think you should hear it yourself.
not_available President Taylor, this is Colonel Iké Dubaku.
not_available As you have no doubt confirmed the near collision atJ.F.K.
not_available International was no accident.
not_available We have the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available We have the capability to kill tens of thousands of Americans and we are prepared to do so.
not_available We demand the complete and immediate withdrawal of the U.S.
not_available Naval strike force to a position west of the 23rd meridian by this time tomorrow.
not_available In order to meet this timeline we require satellite confirmation within three hours that the carrier air wing is in full retreat.
not_available Don't sacrifice your fellow countrymen Madam President.
not_available Allow the people of Sangala to determine their own destiny.
not_available Stand your forces down.
not_available Voiceprint's an 89% match.
not_available It's Dubaku.
not_available There's little doubt.
not_available Looks like your suspicions were correct, Madam President.
not_available This is about Africa.
not_available My God.
not_available Dubaku should have been tried for war crimes years ago.
not_available Now he's giving us ultimatums.
not_available We cannot let this monster hold our country hostage.
not_available Where do we stand on the planes? There's still 2,500 planes in the air.
not_available We have got to shore up the firewall so that the C.I.P.
not_available Device will be rendered useless.
not_available We now think we can reengineer the code in six days.
not_available Six days? We don't have the luxury of six hours.
not_available I'm sorry, Madam President, but there's no way we can rebuild the firewall in that time frame.
not_available I want you to instigate a series of restricted alerts.
not_available Keep it to first responders only.
not_available We want people to be ready in case we're attacked again 
not_available but we don't want to start a panic.
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available And gentlemen, Almeida is our only lead.
not_available Make sure the F.B.I.
not_available Is aware of the demands.
not_available They need to work Almeida from the Africa side 
not_available and they need to know we don't have a lot of time.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Come on.
not_available Keep your head down.
not_available Get him ready for questioning.
not_available I want an explanation.
not_available You went after that shooter without backup or authorization, and then refused to tell me why.
not_available Now, I wanna know.
not_available Look, we didn't know who might be listening.
not_available Someone in this office is helping Almeida.
not_available What? The F.B.I.
not_available Has been compromised, Larry.
not_available There's a leak.
not_available Based on what? Excuse me! This is private.
not_available Tony knew we were going to Schector's office before we even got there.
not_available That's how he managed to get a sniper in position.
not_available The tip had to come from your office.
not_available And whoever it was helped Schector's assassin get out of the building.
not_available He's right, Larry.
not_available That's why we couldn't tell you.
not_available You had a full perimeter, right? Covered every exit? How else do you think he got out of there? All right.
not_available Assuming this is true, you got any idea who it could be? No.
not_available We didn't see it.
not_available But we know that it went down.
not_available It could be anyone in the Bureau.
not_available You need to tighten your circle around Tony.
not_available You can't let any information that he gives you get back to the people he's working with otherwise you will never get that C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll limit access to Level Four clearance and above.
not_available HaveJanis run the security protocols.
not_available See if she can track down this lead.
not_available It's Moss.
not_available Sir, I have the White House calling.
not_available Yeah, I'll
not_available I'll take it in my office.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's the White House.
not_available From now on, keep me in the loop.
not_available And he doesn't do a damn thing without telling me.
not_available We had to tell him.
not_available We had no choice.
not_available You trust him? No question.
not_available There's no one I trust more.
not_available Where are they gonna hold Tony? I am gonna have to lift up your shirt.
not_available Is that comfortable for you? Take that as a yes.
not_available Is he hooked up? 
not_available Yeah, we're ready to go.
not_available Janis, I'll run this session.
not_available I want you to handle something else.
not_available What else? 
not_available Plugging a security leak.
not_available What? We think someone in this office has been helping Almeida.
not_available They've kicked this up to Level Four clearance.
not_available I want you to vet all communication and information flow.
not_available Red tag every data point that has to do with Almeida.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, do we have any idea who it is? 
not_available No, we don't.
not_available I'm hoping you can help us find out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, there's a 0.2 deviation on the blood pressure monitor and you're gonna have to compensate for that.
not_available Thanks, Janis.
not_available Sorry about your friend, Jack.
not_available I know you were hoping he wasn't capable of doing something like this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, what's going on? Why are we in Level Four lockdown? 
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Just do your job.
not_available How am I supposed to do my job when I can't get through to half the server nodes in the building? You're sifting through the evidence gathered at Almeida's arrest site.
not_available That does not require Level Four clearance.
not_available You have everything you need to do your work.
not_available Please.
not_available Nichols.
not_available It's confirmed.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Has Almeida.
not_available Then we should move on.
not_available There's nothing we can do.
not_available No.
not_available We have assets inside the Bureau.
not_available We use them to help get him out.
not_available No, it's too risky.
not_available We'd be jeopardizing the entire mission.
not_available Almeida's not that important.
not_available What about the next operation? Tony's prepped.
not_available He's ready to go.
not_available You'll just have to find someone else.
not_available I realize you and Tony are friends.
not_available I don't like throwing him to the wolves any more than you do.
not_available But he knew what he was getting into.
not_available I just spoke with Juma.
not_available The American troops are still in position near our country.
not_available TellJuma to be patient.
not_available President Taylor just received your demands.
not_available Then perhaps it is time for a more forceful demonstration.
not_available If it comes to that, we'll be ready.
not_available For now, let's give the White House a little more time to respond.
not_available For now.
not_available Agent Walker.
not_available Almeida's working for theJuma regime.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available The president just received a set of demands.
not_available They're from Colonel Iké Dubaku.
not_available Dubaku? Looks like he contracted Almeida to build the C.I.P.
not_available Module.
not_available And now, he's using it to blackmail the White House.
not_available How? Excuse me? 
not_available How is he gonna blackmail the White House? By insisting we stand down the invasion force off the coast of Sangala.
not_available If the president doesn't comply with his demands Dubaku is gonna start killing Americans.
not_available I can get you your C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available Just let me talk to him.
not_available I know him.
not_available I know how he thinks.
not_available We have a history.
not_available I can use it against him.
not_available He's gotten us this far, Larry.
not_available It makes sense.
not_available You're running out of time.
not_available You don't have a better option.
not_available Give us the room.
not_available I watched you die in my arms.
not_available You want to explain to me how you're still alive? 
not_available Didn't think so.
not_available Why don't I tell you what I know.
not_available I know that you're working for theJuma regime.
not_available The White House just got their demands and you have to know that I will never let that happen.
not_available So why don't you save yourself some time and some pain and tell me where the C.I.P.
not_available Device is.
not_available I can't tell you that, Jack.
not_available Damn it, Tony.
not_available You are not just facing charges for domestic terrorism.
not_available You are gonna face international charges for aiding and abetting a genocide.
not_available They will give you the death penalty.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just work with me on this.
not_available I could help you cut a deal.
not_available I can maybe even get you immunity.
not_available You're wasting your breath, Jack.
not_available If I were you I'd tell the president to withdraw those troops, because Dubaku's serious.
not_available He's ready to take thousands of American lives unless his demands are met.
not_available Why the hell are you doing this? Juma wanted the C.I.P.
not_available Module, and he was willing to pay for it.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available Don't act so surprised.
not_available Money is the only reason I have left for doin' anything.
not_available The government took care of that.
not_available The government did not kill Michelle.
not_available Charles Logan did.
not_available Charles Logan is a product of his environment.
not_available The government poisons everything in its path.
not_available You know that better than me, Jack.
not_available Look what they did to you.
not_available Damn it, Tony! We are not talking about me! Oh, we're not? You're asking me why I'm doing this.
not_available I could ask you the same question.
not_available Here you are, working for the same people who wanna put you in prison.
not_available The same people who killed everything you love and left you with nothing.
not_available Your daughter wants nothing to do with you, Teri's dead
not_available Shut up.
not_available Audrey Raines, MilesI said shut up! No, Jack! No! You need to hear this! You need to start living in the real world! Because every second you help the government, you're spittin' on Teri's grave! Get up! 
not_available He's losing it.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Tell me where the device is! 
not_available So help me God, I will kill you, and you will stay dead this time.
not_available Where is the device? 
not_available This is your last chance.
not_available Where is it? Where is it? 
not_available Deep Sky.
not_available What did you just say? 
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Give him a few more seconds.
not_available Few more seconds, he'll be dead.
not_available Deep Sky.
not_available Jack, let him go! Get him out ofhere! 
not_available Get him out of here, now! 
not_available I need a medic in here to check him out.
not_available Keep an eye on him.
not_available You got it.
not_available Deep Sky.
not_available Hello.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I was told to call you.
not_available By whom? Tony Almeida.
not_available He gave me this old C.T.U.
not_available Emergency phone code
not_available Deep Sky.
not_available It's Bill, Jack.
not_available Bill, what the hell's going on? Where is Tony? 
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Headquarters.
not_available He's been arrested.
not_available Arrested? He orchestrated a terrorist attack on the United States today.
not_available I was interrogating him.
not_available How'd you get involved in this? 
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Brought me in to help track him down.
not_available We need to talk, Jack.
not_available I'll call you back on a secure V.P.N.
not_available Line.
not_available What the hell is going on? 
not_available I need 10 minutes to set up the V.P.N.
not_available Line.
not_available I don't have 10 minutes! 
not_available Ten minutes, Jack.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available LfTony's been arrested, it's over.
not_available Are you gonna tellJack everything? We wanna get Tony back undercover, we'll need his help.
not_available I don't thinkJack's in a very helpful frame of mind.
not_available He's our only hope.
not_available Hello, Henry.
not_available Ethan.
not_available I got your message about Sangala.
not_available Where's Allison? 
not_available She's in her office.
not_available Henry
not_available The president is in an impossible situation right now.
not_available She needs your support, but you can't give it to her if you keep going off on these paranoid fantasies about Roger.
not_available I know about Samantha Roth.
not_available I know you accosted her in her office.
not_available She's hiding something about my son's murder.
not_available Roger wasn't murdered.
not_available He committed suicide.
not_available The coroner's office made that determination, and the F.B.I.
not_available Confirmed it.
not_available They didn't look hard enough.
not_available Ethan, I know my son.
not_available He did not kill himself.
not_available He wasn't depressed.
not_available He had no reason.
not_available What if he did have a reason? 
not_available I would have known.
not_available Not if he didn't tell you.
not_available Not if he was too ashamed to tell you or the president.
not_available What are you talking about? Roger was about to be investigated by the S.E.C.
not_available For insider trading.
not_available He'd used information he could only have gotten through his access to the president.
not_available Before the S.E.C.
not_available Opened the investigation, he killed himself.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available It's all in here in the S.E.C.
not_available Case file.
not_available Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this? Frank Boylan agreed to bury the case as a political favor to the president.
not_available My wife knew about this, and she didn't tell me? She wanted to.
not_available But she also wanted to protect your memory of your son.
not_available You were in so much pain
not_available Damn it, Ethan, he was my son.
not_available I deserved the truth.
not_available And keeping it from you was a terrible mistake.
not_available I realize that now.
not_available But the president and I both thought you were moving on with your life.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available The president wants to see you.
not_available Does she know you're telling me this now? No.
not_available And I think it best we keep it that way at least till this crisis is resolved.
not_available I felt I had to tell him, sir.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Madam President, you wanted to see me? Admiral Smith laid out the timeline for withdrawing our forces.
not_available He's saying to meet Dubaku's demands we need to order the pullback by 1:00 p.m.
not_available That's not much time.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available Well, maybe this man Almeida will tell us where to find the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available No.
not_available Tim Woods just heard from the Bureau.
not_available So far, Almeida's refusing to cooperate.
not_available Well, maybe he's just positioning for a deal.
not_available Tim doesn't think so.
not_available He said we shouldn't count on Almeida to talk.
not_available I see.
not_available So unless I order our forces to stand down I'll be condemning innocent Americans to death.
not_available And if we capitulate thousands of Sangalans will be slaughtered.
not_available How did this happen, Ethan? How could we have been so caught off guard? And now, to have to decide between two impossible choices.
not_available Well, at least one of those choices does stand a good chance of preserving American lives.
not_available You mean withdrawal.
not_available We are nearing the time where we may have to consider it.
not_available We're not there yet, Ethan.
not_available I can't discuss this not until we have explored every possible option.
not_available Tell the F.B.I.
not_available To keep working on Almeida.
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, I've got the secure line.
not_available All right.
not_available Dial the number.
not_available Bill, stop screwin' around.
not_available Tell me what the hell is going on.
not_available Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.
not_available He's working deep cover.
not_available He's working with me.
not_available We have proof that he tried to bring down two commercial airliners.
not_available You don't know the whole story.
not_available It's part of an ongoing operation.
not_available Operation? What kind of an operation puts hundreds if not thousands of lives in danger? Jack, please.
not_available You need to listen.
not_available Our government is corrupted.
not_available There are people on the inside who are actively aiding Dubaku and theJuma regime.
not_available Point is, Tony was supposed to be near the C.I.P.
not_available Module the whole time.
not_available With him in custody, we've lost our ability to control it and to attack this conspiracy.
not_available Who's a part of the conspiracy? Give me names.
not_available We don't know the extent of it, but we have reason to believe that members of the president's inner council are on payroll.
not_available Who's shepherding the investigation? Which agency? That's just it, Jack.
not_available There's no shepherd.
not_available There's no agency.
not_available This corruption runs deep and wide.
not_available We're working outside the government.
not_available That's why we have to get Tony back undercover.
not_available He's at F.B.I.
not_available Headquarters, Bill.
not_available I never said it was gonna be easy.
not_available But we have to try.
not_available Chloe's already into their system.
not_available Chloe's working on this? 
not_available Hi, Jack.
not_available It's good to hear your voice.
not_available Yeah, you too.
not_available I saw the hearings on C
not_available SPAN.
not_available I can't believe what the senator said to you.
not_available You looked good, though.
not_available Jack, we need your help to get Tony out of there.
not_available There's an agent at the F.B.I.
not_available Renee Walker.
not_available She could help.
not_available No, the F.B.I.
not_available Been compromised.
not_available Somebody in the Bureau is aiding Dubaku.
not_available You don't understand, Bill.
not_available I trust her.
not_available If you think you need to use her to get Tony out of F.B.I.
not_available Headquarters, then do it.
not_available But you'll be making her a target.
not_available No, you're right.
not_available You're right.
not_available We'll do it your way.
not_available I can get to Tony myself.
not_available But Chloe's gonna have to get us out of the building.
not_available We're already on it.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you're ready.
not_available I'm on my way, Chloe.
not_available Hey, Sean, you know those datamining plug
not_available ins we downloaded last week? Where did we file those? Where did we file those? Uh, yeah.
not_available File folder A
not_available 76.
not_available Do you need help with something? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? You seem confused.
not_available I just don't like havin' to dance around this Level Four lockdown.
not_available Oh.
not_available I thought you'd welcome the opportunity to complain about something.
not_available Hello? Mr.
not_available Taylor, it's Samantha.
not_available I was going to call you.
not_available I owe you an apology, Sam.
not_available I was wrong to confront you like that.
not_available Uh, no, you weren't.
not_available I wasn't completely honest with you.
not_available What do you mean? Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available He was murdered.
not_available I need to see you, alone.
not_available Will you meet me? Of course.
not_available Where's the C.I.P.
not_available Device, Tony? Who'd you give it to? The people you're taking money from
not_available thought you'd might like to see some of their handiwork.
not_available You know how many people they've killed since they went back into Sangala? Huh? Most of them women and children.
not_available Tony.
not_available You really want this on your conscience? My conscience is clear.
not_available And nothing you can say or do will change that.
not_available So why don't you do the smart thing and tell President Taylor to stand down the strike force.
not_available Because unless she does, planes will be falling from the sky.
not_available And then you'll have a whole new batch of photos to look at.
not_available Only this time they'll be of dead Americans.
not_available Larry, we need to talk.
not_available Almeida's not gonna break.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available He's a trained C.T.U.
not_available Agent.
not_available He's conducted interrogations just like this one.
not_available There's nothing you can say to him that he hasn't said himself a hundred times.
not_available So what are you suggesting? We give up? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm suggesting we might need a more forceful approach.
not_available You mean torture.
not_available There are methods of coercion we haven't even considered.
not_available Pharmaceuticals
not_available I can't believe you want to have this conversation.
not_available You're not hearing the argument.
not_available The argument is crazy.
not_available It's illegal, and it's over.
not_available As a matter of fact, I want Bauer out of here.
not_available He's a wild card.
not_available He's dangerous.
not_available I want him out of the building.
not_available Go.
not_available Process him out.
not_available I will continue here.
not_available Go, go, now.
not_available Renee, I was just about to call you.
not_available I may have found the leak.
not_available Someone did a runaround on the Level Four lockdown.
not_available They circumvented the security fence and they hacked into the F.A.A.
not_available Database.
not_available F.A.A.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Positive.
not_available I don't know what they were doing in there but they had to navigate some very sophisticated tagger software.
not_available When was this? 
not_available Just a few minutes ago.
not_available Any idea who it was? 
not_available No, but I might be able to pull a user I.D.
not_available Out of the terminal.
not_available Okay.
not_available Which terminal? 
not_available Mainframe room, terminal three.
not_available Check it out.
not_available Let me know what you find.
not_available Okay.
not_available Agent Teller.
not_available I need you to prepare a debriefing packet forJack Bauer.
not_available And bring me his personal effects.
not_available I'll bring 'em right to you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll be in my office.
not_available What are you doin'? What's the matter? S
not_available You just stay where you are.
not_available Janis, stop it.
not_available Would you just talk to me? I know you've been helping Tony Almeida.
not_available What? Are you crazy? No.
not_available You broke into the F.A.A.
not_available Database.
not_available That's your server I.D.
not_available Yeah, it's my server I.D., but I'm not helping the terrorists.
not_available You wanna know why I was in there? I'll tell you.
not_available I was worried.
not_available My wife is on one of those planes up there.
not_available I had to see if her flight had been grounded yet.
not_available You expect me to believe that? Why are you sneaking around? 
not_available Because of the Level Four lockdown.
not_available It cut me out of the F.A.A.
not_available Database.
not_available I couldn't monitor her flight.
not_available Look.
not_available See for yourself.
not_available Flight 112 out of Las Vegas.
not_available Christina Hillinger.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just stay there.
not_available God, Sean! You scared the hell out of me! Why wouldn't you just tell me that? 'Cause what I was doin' was borderline illegal.
not_available I didn't wanna get you in trouble.
not_available Plus, you looked like you had enough on your plate.
not_available Damn it, I told Renee I'd found a security leak.
not_available Is that what's going on around here? There's a security leak? Don't worry about it.
not_available Go back to your station.
not_available Keep this to yourself, and I will clean up your mess.
not_available Go.
