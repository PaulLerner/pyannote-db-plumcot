not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Mr.
not_available Burnett, you are a traitor and a terrorist.
not_available Where's the target? Where's the target? Take Mr.
not_available Bauer away.
not_available He's under arrest.
not_available Have you learned anything else about the attack? Renee Walker followed a lead on her own.
not_available Got a visual on a heavily armed commando unit led byJuma himself.
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available Renee Walker says the target is the White House.
not_available Condition red.
not_available Secure the president.
not_available There's no safe path out.
not_available We need to secure her in the first floor lockdown.
not_available Hostage rescue teams are moving into place.
not_available They'll be prepared to storm the building as soon as the order's given.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, terrorists are in control of the White House.
not_available Until you can provide me with more intel on what's going on in there you are instructed to refrain from launching any action.
not_available President Taylor's locked in the safe room.
not_available What is it I can do for you? 
not_available I need you to find me another way in.
not_available Well, I'm looking at the White House manifest.
not_available And according to this, Olivia Taylor is presently in the building with you.
not_available Now, you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get the president to open that door.
not_available President Taylor.
not_available God, no.
not_available If you don't open the door 
not_available I'm gonna cut out your daughter's eyes one by one.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Madam President, I can't
not_available No! Open the door.
not_available Open the door! I can't! Do you have children, Jack? 
not_available I have a daughter.
not_available Could you do what you're asking me to do
not_available just stand by and watch her butchered? No, ma'am, but I am not the president of the United States.
not_available Well, I am the president, and I am ordering you to open that door.
not_available All right, General, you've got me now.
not_available There's no reason to hold anyone else.
not_available Let them go.
not_available The following takes place between 8:00 p.m.
not_available And 9:00 p.m.
not_available Now, what we do know is that the president was in the building when the attack took place and she may have been taken hostage along with numerous other White House personnel.
not_available Vice President Hayworth was not in the building and we're told he was moved to a secure location.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Has cordoned off a nineblock perimeter
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available [TVShuts Off 
not_available That was Agent Moss.
not_available What does he have to say? 
not_available He's still requesting that you authorize a rescue operation.
not_available Does he have any more intel about what the hell's going on in there? No, sir.
not_available He deployed two units with deep
not_available band parabolics.
not_available All they were able to get was static.
not_available They thinkJuma's using jamming equipment.
not_available They've also got spotters at every possible angle around the building but they haven't been able to see inside.
not_available So we still don't know whetherJuma has the president or whether the president is locked inside the safe room.
not_available No, sir, we don't.
not_available I will not authorize any action until I know the status of the president.
not_available Relay that to Agent Moss.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mom, I know that I hurt you.
not_available I'm so sorry for cutting you out of my life.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available You were right to fire me off the campaign.
not_available I felt so betrayed, I turned my back on you.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available It all seems so stupid now.
not_available I hope you can forgive me.
not_available Oh, darling, I forgave you a long time ago.
not_available Livy, you have to listen to me.
not_available We really are gonna be okay.
not_available Just keep your eyes open and be ready.
not_available Abo.
not_available No, no! Leave her alone! 
not_available Get up.
not_available Get away from her! Get back! I said leave her alone, please! 
not_available Livy, it's okay, darling.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Please, please
not_available Bill, we need to make a move to try to save the president.
not_available How? 
not_available In the lockdown room there were five canisters of CH4.
not_available Before we surrendered ourselves over toJuma, I opened the valves.
not_available Within the next few minutes, that room is gonna be saturated with natural gas.
not_available It's gonna take one spark to set it off.
not_available I think the explosion's gonna be large enough to take out most ofJuma's men.
not_available That's when you can make your move.
not_available How do we set it off? I'll make a run for the lockdown room, try and draw their fire.
not_available All we need is one stray bullet.
not_available It's a suicide play, Jack.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Just make sure you can get to the president and get her out ofhere.
not_available She knows about the plan.
not_available She'll be ready.
not_available What are you planning? Are you going to do something? When it happens, you'll know about it, Senator.
not_available If you're planning something, I want to know what it is.
not_available Senator, shut up.
not_available Read this statement.
not_available It is a confession of your crimes against my country.
not_available The atrocities that you have committed will now be seen by the whole world.
not_available I'll read your statement, General.
not_available But I need you to release the other hostages.
not_available You got what you came for.
not_available You have the president of the United States.
not_available As a sign of good faith I will release one of the hostages.
not_available You.
not_available Stand up.
not_available Quiet! Do you want me to release any more hostages, President Taylor? You son of a bitch.
not_available You will read the statement or I will do the same thing to everyone here starting with your daughter.
not_available General, the uplink is complete.
not_available All right.
not_available The world is waiting, Madam President.
not_available This is the president of the United States.
not_available Six hours ago, I ordered our armed forces to invade Sangala without warning and without provocation.
not_available This attack was a criminal act motivated solely by America's desire to exert its power and influence.
not_available Tell me you're shutting this down.
not_available We can't, sir.
not_available It's a live feed straight to the Internet.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Shut it down! 
not_available It's going out on multiple servers, sir.
not_available It would take hours just to trace them.
not_available This is Derek Watts.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Sir, it's Agent Moss on teleconference.
not_available Put him on.
not_available Sir, are you gettin' this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So is the rest of the damn world.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, I believeJuma came here to humiliate the president and stage a public execution.
not_available Now, we have a rescue operation in place.
not_available All we need is your authorization.
not_available You don't know whatJuma's intentions are.
not_available This could be a prelude to a set of demands.
not_available There are no demands here, sir.
not_available This is about revenge.
not_available Juma knows he'll never get out of the White House alive.
not_available You're speculating, Agent Moss.
not_available My advisers are telling me the most prudent course of action is to try to initiate communication with Juma.
not_available We've been trying to do that.
not_available He hasn't responded.
not_available Juma has no desire to negotiate anything.
not_available He is going to kill the president.
not_available Sir, we have a tactical plan in place.
not_available It's a two
not_available pronged assault and we're confident that it stands a good chance of catching Juma off guard.
not_available But we're losing time.
not_available We have to initiate now.
not_available I cannot authorize any action that might result in the president's death.
not_available Keep trying to open dialogue with Juma.
not_available Hold your position till you're told otherwise.
not_available I will keep this feed open.
not_available General Juma has demonstrated that even a tyrant state like the U.S.
not_available Be ready.
not_available Jack, listen to me.
not_available Juma's not solely coordinating this attack.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I heard him talking on a sat phone.
not_available He's coordinating with someone on the outside.
not_available They were giving him real
not_available time intel.
not_available You think it's someone in the White House? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But even if we takeJuma down, the president may still be in danger.
not_available You're the only one I know who can do this, Jack.
not_available Find out whoJuma's working with.
not_available No
not_available Sit back down! 
not_available Agent Moss, a device has been detonated in the West Wing.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, there's been an explosion at the White House.
not_available An explosion? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The president's Internet feed has gone dark.
not_available We saw that.
not_available What's happened? 
not_available I don't know, sir.
not_available But we're going in under my authority.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available That is not your decision.
not_available All teams, attack plan delta.
not_available Agent Moss, you're under orders! Agent Moss! 
not_available Code green! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
not_available They're coming in! Pierce, get to the president! Madam President, are you okay? We need to get out of here right now.
not_available Both of you, come with me.
not_available This way.
not_available Three down.
not_available Madam President, get down.
not_available Stay low till I know we're clear.
not_available Ngozi.
not_available Kill the hostages.
not_available The president is mine.
not_available Udo.
not_available Udo! No, no, no, no! Don't move! Don't you move! 
not_available Clear! We're clear! 
not_available Secret Service! I have the president! Aaron Pierce, Secret Service.
not_available Let's go, ma'am.
not_available Mom.
not_available Madam President, this way! We have the president.
not_available The president is secure.
not_available Repeat: We have the president.
not_available This way, ma'am.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Move out! 
not_available Move in medical teams! Renee, we gotta get the president outta here now! This way, ma'am.
not_available It's all right, darling.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go! Madam President.
not_available We're still sweeping the West Wing but we do believe all the hostiles have been accounted for.
not_available Now, you and your daughter will stay here until we finish securing the building.
not_available I understand.
not_available Now, once we get the "all clear" we're going to move you to Andrews Air Force Base.
not_available No.
not_available I'm staying right here.
not_available Ma'am, it's for your own safety.
not_available Do what's necessary to make sure this building's safe because I'm not going anywhere.
not_available The American people need to know that the president is in the White House.
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available How many people did we lose? It's too early to tell.
not_available Medical teams are on their way to treat the wounded.
not_available We're going to set up a triage unit in the East Wing.
not_available All right.
not_available I'd like to speak to the vice president as soon as possible.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available And I need to know how my husband's doing.
not_available Would you please contact Dr.
not_available Lee Schulman at West Arlington Hospital? 
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How's Agent Pierce? They said he's gonna be okay.
not_available What about you? I'm not sure.
not_available I still can't believe this happened.
not_available I thought they were gonna kill all of us.
not_available I was so scared.
not_available It's over and we're safe
not_available thanks to a lot of brave people.
not_available Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available The vice president is on a secure line.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Did you mean what you said about putting the past behind us? Of course I meant it.
not_available I don't ever want to lose you again.
not_available You won't.
not_available The president's safe, Jack.
not_available She's in the residence.
not_available She's secure.
not_available I'm so sorry, Jack.
not_available I know that he was your friend.
not_available It was supposed to be me.
not_available I was supposed to set off the explosion so that he could secure the president.
not_available He died protecting his country.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This isn't over yet.
not_available Agent Moss? 
not_available Juma and his men were not working alone.
not_available What are you talking about? When I was in the lockdown with the president Bill said he heard Juma talking on a sat phone.
not_available Said he was getting real
not_available time intel from someone on the outside.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available The point is, I don't think this threat is over and I don't think the president is safe.
not_available You sure Buchanan heard this right? He wouldn't have told me unless he was sure.
not_available And right now, the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.
not_available He knew about the attack on the White House, and chances are he's gonna know whoJuma was talking to.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, I'll talk to him.
not_available No.
not_available The president already offered him immunity.
not_available He turned it down.
not_available He's not gonna tell you anything.
not_available But he will talk to me.
not_available Why is that, Jack? 'Cause you tortured him? I don't need to touch him.
not_available I just need him to think I'm there to finish what I started.
not_available And I promise you, he will tell us everything we need to know.
not_available Larry, please.
not_available The last thing Bill asked for before he died was for me to follow this through.
not_available I owe him that.
not_available Look, I give you my word, I will not touch Burnett.
not_available Jack, look.
not_available I understand about your friend.
not_available I do.
not_available But I got standing orders from the president to take you into custody.
not_available I gotta get you back to F.B.I.
not_available But I promise you, I'll look into this.
not_available Agent Powell, handcuff Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Take him down to staging area "B." 
not_available Sir, put your hands on top of your head.
not_available Larry.
not_available You're gonna tell me he's right about this, I don't wanna hear it.
not_available Yes.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available You're not listening to what he's saying.
not_available When are you gonna stop defending this guy? 
not_available I'm not defending him.
not_available I'm defending a good idea.
not_available I just said I will look into this.
not_available Now do your job.
not_available Finish locking down the building.
not_available Agent Reynolds.
not_available I need to speak with the president.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available She's in a secure location.
not_available You'll need to go through Ethan Kanin.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available He just arrived.
not_available He's on his way to see the president.
not_available Thanks.
not_available The president's in the residence with her daughter.
not_available They've both been checked over, and they're in good condition.
not_available Thank God.
not_available We got lights up.
not_available I want a conference with the SecDef and Joint Chiefs as soon as possible.
not_available We're routing all White House communications to the residence 
not_available and we're setting up a temporary command post.
not_available Good.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin, I need to speak with you.
not_available I'm on my way to see the president.
not_available Yes, I know, sir.
not_available But it's extremely urgent.
not_available It'll only take a few moments.
not_available All right.
not_available What is it, Agent Walker? Some new intel has just come to our attention, and we need to act on it immediately.
not_available I tried to reach the president, but I couldn't get through.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available Sir, the threat to the president may not be over.
not_available We have reason to believe that GeneralJuma was not acting alone.
not_available Before Bill Buchanan died, he saw GeneralJuma communicating with someone on a sat phone.
not_available At this point, we can confirm that F.B.I.
not_available Agents entered the White House moments ago and there were reports of sustained gunfire.
not_available It appears that authorities are now in control of the West Wing.
not_available We are expecting word from our F.B.I.
not_available Sources 
not_available As to the status of the hostages.
not_available While there has been no official comment
not_available So what have we got? The president's alive.
not_available Are you sure? Well, we've been monitoring interagency servers.
not_available Word just went out.
not_available Juma's dead.
not_available Taylor survived.
not_available What happened, do you think? We don't know any details yet, but we'll keep monitoring.
not_available Well, you gotta admire the damn bitch.
not_available She doesn't give up easily.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available We, uh just didn't have enough control over the situation.
not_available Greg, you look tense.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Have a drink.
not_available Relax.
not_available Juma held up his part of the bargain.
not_available We're getting what we wanted.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, everything's still on track.
not_available Where are the weapons now? Uh, shipment should be ready for pickup in the next couple of hours.
not_available Good.
not_available Get Chapman on the phone.
not_available I wanna nail down some targets.
not_available Sir, the chopper you requested is on its way.
not_available It'll be here in 10 minutes.
not_available All right.
not_available You'll be escorting Mr.
not_available Bauer back to F.B.I.
not_available Hold him in the command center.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It's Larry Moss.
not_available This is Ethan Kanin.
not_available I understand you're taking Jack Bauer back to F.B.I.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available He's gonna be debriefed and remanded into federal custody.
not_available I want you to put that on hold.
not_available Sir? 
not_available I just spoke with Agent Walker.
not_available She told meJuma may have been working with someone on the outside and that there may be an ongoing threat to the president.
not_available Yes, that's true.
not_available I want you to send Jack Bauer to question Ryan Burnett.
not_available Agent Moss? 
not_available Sir, I think that's a mistake.
not_available Yes, Agent Walker shared your concerns with me, and I've given this some thought.
not_available If Burnett does know whoJuma was working with Bauer's approach may be our best chance to get that information.
not_available With respect, sir, Bauer almost killed this man.
not_available I was there, Agent Moss.
not_available But this will be a controlled interrogation.
not_available We're gonna play on Burnett's fears.
not_available Bauer's presence alone should be enough to intimidate him into talking.
not_available Sir, Bauer is a wild card.
not_available We have no idea what he'll do 
not_available when he gets in that room with Burnett.
not_available I realize there's a risk.
not_available That's why you're gonna do this under my authority and my authority alone.
not_available You're not taking this to the president? 
not_available No.
not_available If something does go wrong, I want to make sure the president is protected.
not_available With respect, sir, I think you're not telling the president 'cause you know she'd never allow this.
not_available You've made your objections clear, Agent Moss.
not_available I'm not going to debate this with you.
not_available I want you to take Bauer to question Burnett.
not_available That's a direct order.
not_available Do you understand? I understand.
not_available And I'm counting on you to supervise every second of that interrogation.
not_available I'll expect a full report as soon as you're done.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I want to speak personally to the families of everyone we lost tonight so keep me informed as they're notified.
not_available Absolutely, Madam President.
not_available And the minute Angela Nelson gets here, send her straight up to me.
not_available We need to start working on the
not_available the speech to the country.
not_available Of course, Madam President.
not_available Patrick.
not_available You have just been through a terrible ordeal.
not_available Are you sure you're okay? I'll be fine.
not_available It helps to focus on work.
not_available I understand.
not_available Thank you, Patrick.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Thank God you're all right.
not_available How you feeling? Like I just woke up from a nightmare.
not_available It was unbelievable, Ethan.
not_available I can't even imagine it.
not_available How's Olivia? She's shaken up, but she's
not_available she's gonna be okay.
not_available I'm glad to hear it.
not_available We lost some good people tonight, Ethan.
not_available We're gonna need all the help we can get.
not_available I'm thinking about bringing Olivia on as a special adviser.
not_available Madam President, I can understand your not wanting to be separated from your daughter after what's happened
not_available Especially after what's happened, we need people who can do the job.
not_available I'm not disputing Olivia's competence.
not_available But she's also a political liability.
not_available Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign.
not_available Leaking damaging personal information about your opponent to the press? Olivia knows what she did was wrong.
not_available She almost cost you the election.
not_available She's changed.
not_available We talked about it, Ethan.
not_available She is accepting full responsibility.
not_available She has learned from her mistakes.
not_available I'm willing to put the past behind us so we can move ahead.
not_available I still think it's a mistake.
not_available I don't care what you think! I am so sorry, Ethan.
not_available You know I don't mean that.
not_available But I've made up my mind.
not_available I want Olivia to join my administration and I want it to come from you.
not_available Me? 
not_available Your offering her this position would be a good way to extend an olive branch.
not_available I need the two of you to make peace.
not_available All right, Madam President.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Thank you, Ethan.
not_available I understand Agent Walker was trying to reach me? That's right.
not_available But I spoke to her.
not_available What did she want? Just some procedural matters, Madam President.
not_available I took care of'em.
not_available Larry, you wanted to see me? I just got off the phone with Ethan Kanin.
not_available I didn't want to go behind your back, but you didn't leave me any choice.
not_available I didn't leave you aHow about you choose to follow orders? 
not_available I'm sorry, Larry.
not_available No, I don't think you are.
not_available Larry, I have seen Jack do some terrible things today.
not_available Things that l
not_available I still can't justify.
not_available But he has been right every time.
not_available And you know what? I can't help but think if we had just stayed out of his way none of this would have happened.
not_available Look, I am sorry that I went behind your back but l
not_available I promise you, this play with Burnett will go down just the wayJack says.
not_available If you think you're goin' with Bauer, you are out of your mind.
not_available You may have gotten a White House order, but I am still runnin' this operation.
not_available I'll take Bauer to see Burnett.
not_available You're goin' back to F.B.I.
not_available I want you to clean out your office and hand in your badge.
not_available I'm suspending you indefinitely.
not_available Hey, I know that you're upset, Larry, but this isn't over.
not_available You're gonna need me.
not_available What I need are people that I can trust.
not_available I thought that was you.
not_available You may think you've got what you wanted, gettin' Renee to go behind my back but Ethan Kanin ordered me to let you question Burnett.
not_available I'm gonna be watchin' you every second you're in there.
not_available You do one thing I don't like, you're finished.
not_available Understand me? Understood.
not_available You should leave Renee out of this.
not_available She was just doing what she thought was right.
not_available Yeah? Well, she may lose her job over it.
not_available She's the best agent you've got.
not_available She circumvented my authority.
not_available I can't just ignore that.
not_available I've known this woman for nine years, and I've never seen her do the kind of things she's done in the last nine hours.
not_available We've narrowed the list down to They're all within How many people? 
not_available 10,000 to 15,000 in each target zone.
not_available And our kill ratio would be what? Well, we've chosen these areas for maximum population density so the ratio could be as high as 80%.
not_available Let's hope we never have to find out.
not_available Get these coordinates down to the boys in tac ops.
not_available Have them start programming them in.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We just intercepted a flash memo from the F.B.I.
not_available Jack Bauer's on his way to Kennedy Memorial Hospital to question Burnett.
not_available Bauer was arrested.
not_available How is this possible? There was an executive order from the White House giving Bauer access to Burnett.
not_available Bauer will finish what he started.
not_available Burnett will tell him everything.
not_available No, he won't, sir.
not_available I've already sent somebody to the hospital to deal with Burnett.
not_available He can take care of Bauer at the same time.
not_available Who'd you send? 
not_available Quinn.
not_available Oh.
not_available Quinn's good.
not_available Bauer's good too.
not_available Agent Moss, we've locked down the entire floor.
not_available We equipped Burnett's room with two cameras and audio surveillance.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Down the hall.
not_available He's gonna be a moment.
not_available Doctor has to revive him.
not_available Why? What happened? He was given a heavy sedative.
not_available He was in pretty bad shape when he got here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Wyndam, Special Agent Larry Moss, Jack Bauer.
not_available I understand you're here to interrogate my patient.
not_available That's right.
not_available He's still recovering from his last interrogation.
not_available So if you're here to brutalize him again, I won't be party to it.
not_available Your patient was involved in a terrorist attack against the White House in an effort to kill the president of the United States.
not_available And I believe the people he's working with wanna try it again.
not_available So if you've got a problem with this
not_available We won't harm him, Doctor.
not_available This'll be a controlled interrogation.
not_available Please, we need your cooperation.
not_available It's gonna take him a couple of minutes to come out of it.

not_available Do you have a wife, Robert? No, she passed away.
not_available Children? Grandchildren? 
not_available No.
not_available What about this man? Does he have family? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Lots of grandkids.
not_available Make a hell of a noise when they visit.
not_available I'll get a crash cart.
not_available We need a crash cart now! 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Where's that crash cart? 
not_available Still on it! 
not_available I got the cart! 
not_available Charge to 200.
not_available Clear.
not_available How's your arm? I should be back on my feet in a couple of hours.
not_available And you, ma'am? Oh, it's nothing a little aspirin won't take care of.
not_available I want to thank you for what you did.
not_available You took a bullet for me.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available There is no need to thank me, ma'am.
not_available Right.
not_available You werejust doing yourjob.
not_available Only in this case, it wasn't really your job since you retired four years ago.
not_available Yes, ma'am, that's true.
not_available Do you mind if I ask you why? Did it have to do with Martha Logan? Martha and I were close.
not_available It must've been hard for you, what happened to her.
not_available I'd prefer not to talk about it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't have to apologize.
not_available Well, I hope you won't be a stranger, Agent Pierce.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And, um, it's Aaron.
not_available Okay, Aaron.
not_available You get some rest.
not_available I'd like to head back to the residence now, if that's okay.
not_available Olivia.
not_available I was just coming to see you.
not_available I'm glad you're all right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Do you have a moment to talk? Sure.
not_available The blunt fact of the matter is this administration has just suffered some terrible losses, and we need help.
not_available The president and I would like you to consider coming on board as special adviser to the president.
not_available L
not_available I have to say, I'm a little surprised.
not_available Surprised? 
not_available Well, that you'd sign off on this.
not_available Your mother said she's ready to put the past behind her and so am I.
not_available I overstepped my bounds during the campaign, and I was wrong.
not_available I'm glad you see it that way.
not_available But it's not the past that concerns me, Ethan.
not_available It's what's happening right now and what's been happening ever since my mother took office.
not_available Excuse me? Do you think any of this would have happened if my mother had a chief adviser who knew what the hell was going on in her administration? What are you talking about? Her government was corrupted on every level and it all happened right under your nose.
not_available Even you have to admit it's an unconscionable failure on your part.
not_available Frankly, I'm surprised you haven't tendered your resignation.
not_available You have no right to speak to me that way.
not_available You don't know what you're talking about.
not_available You don't have the facts.
not_available I intend to get the facts.
not_available I'm going to find out exactly who failed my mother and I am going to make sure that that person never is in a position to do it again.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Okay, let's go.
not_available I'll be watching.
not_available You lay one finger on him, it's over.
not_available Right.
not_available He's comin' around.
not_available Good.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Remember me? Oh, my God.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? I've just come from the White House.
not_available Juma's attack failed.
not_available He's dead, and so are his men.
not_available A lot of innocent people died today.
not_available Good people, including a friend of mine
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available You might have met him.
not_available You stay the hell away from me.
not_available And I wanna talk to a lawyer right now.
not_available You hear me? I wanna talk to a lawyer! Somebody get me the hell out of here! You're not goin' anywhere.
not_available It's just you and me, pal.
not_available Did you really think you were gonna get away with it? Somebody, please help me! 
not_available You're wasting your breath.
not_available They're not comin'for you.
not_available Please don't hurt me.
not_available I'll tell you anything you want.
not_available Do you hear that? I'm
not_available I'm ready to talk.
not_available I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
not_available JustJust get him out ofhere! I'm ready to talk! 
not_available They're done talking to you.
not_available That's why they sent me.
not_available Please, you can't do this! You have no right! This isn't legal! 
not_available What happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Looks like we lost the sound feed.
not_available Give me a second.
not_available There are no laws in here, Mr.
not_available Burnett.
not_available You aided and abetted terrorists who then tried to kill the president of the United States.
not_available Now you have to answer for that.
not_available The rules don't apply to you anymore.
not_available No, please, please! You can't let him touch me! Please, you can't let him do this! 
not_available Shut up! 
not_available It could be a glitch in the trunk line.
not_available Damn it! Fix the thing! 
not_available I'm trying, sir.
not_available Bauer? 
not_available He jammed the electronic bolt.
not_available Is there another way in? 
not_available No.
not_available Jack? Jack? Damn it, Bauer, open the door! 
not_available Have security lock down the hospital.
not_available I want a high priority A.P.B.
not_available Issued forJack Bauer.
not_available All agencies.
not_available Security alert.
not_available White male wearing dark suit
not_available It's done.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's done.
not_available Burnett's dead.
not_available And Bauer? They'll think he killed Burnett.
not_available So nobody will know that we were involved.
not_available Good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now we're having some fun.
not_available Agent Moss.
not_available Larry, it's Jack.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I didn't kill Burnett.
not_available I'm being set up.
not_available Set up? A man released some kind of nerve agent into the room.
not_available It immobilized me.
not_available He came through the ceiling and killed Burnett.
not_available I swear to you, I'm not lying.
not_available I watched him do it.
not_available Get back in here.
not_available We'll work this out.
not_available I can't.
not_available You know that.
not_available You can if you're innocent.
not_available Look, there is a reason why they wanted me framed and didn't kill me.
not_available They're trying to keep you distracted by dealing with me so they can finish what they started.
not_available Don't let 'em get away with this.
not_available This threat is not over.
not_available Jack? Jack? Damn it!
