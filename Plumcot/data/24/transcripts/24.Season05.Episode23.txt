
not_available You're a traitor to this country, and a disgrace to your office.
not_available Logan wants me dead because I know too much.
not_available Logan isn't worth protecting.
not_available Aaron? 
not_available Ma'am, please stay where you are.
not_available Bierko's escaped.
not_available What? How long ago? 
not_available Davis, Karen Hayes.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Our lead car got taken out by an IED.
not_available I overheard Bierko talking to his men.
not_available He said they're not finished.
not_available I'm certain he said something about a nerve gas canister.
not_available Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas.
not_available Trust me, he's not gonna help us.
not_available He will if we offer him a deal.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available To disappear.
not_available Just like you did, so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese.
not_available Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate 
not_available this deal is off.
not_available Bierko's gonna release the gas soon.
not_available We need to know where.
not_available It's a Russian submarine.
not_available What is the armament package on a Russian Delta IV class sub? They carry multiple warheads.
not_available One could take out several city blocks.
not_available We believe the Natalia has been targeted for a terrorist attack.
not_available The terrorists are after your missiles.
not_available Secure your vessel.
not_available Lock down your weapon systems immediately.
not_available That way.
not_available We have control of the weapons system.
not_available I've flushed the Sentox.
not_available The atmospheric readings are all normal.
not_available It's safe to breathe.
not_available The coordinates for the targets, upload them into the missiles.
not_available Begin the launch countdown.
not_available Remove your masks.
not_available We are close to finishing what we started today.
not_available I have identified 12 high
not_available value targets.
not_available Financial centres, transportation hubs, high
not_available population density areas.
not_available The Americans will wake up this morning to discover how steep a price they've paid for their alliance with Moscow.
not_available And what we're about to accomplish today will be remembered by our countrymen forever.
not_available Ms Raines.
not_available Admiral Kirkland.
not_available You're reporting some type of emergency at the Port of Los Angeles? In anticipation of today's treaty, the Russian submarine Natalia is docked here for inspection by the navy.
not_available What? We haven't received a distress signal from the crew.
not_available Because they're dead, all of them, including the Russian crew.
not_available We believe the terrorists flooded the sub's ventilation system with Sentox nerve gas.
not_available My God.
not_available I don't mean to preempt your protocols, but how long will it take you to scramble a flight of F18s? You want me to sink the submarine? They have 12 multiple
not_available warhead missiles, which they will use against civilian targets unless we stop them first.
not_available I'll need this confirmed.
not_available 
not_available Our ground team can confirm.
not_available Now I need to know precisely how long it will take to scramble these fighters.
not_available I'm sending you the estimated approach vectors and ETA for my F
not_available 18s.
not_available I can have my fighterjets there within 22
not_available 25 minutes.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available According to our simulation, Bierko will have his missiles in the air in less than 20 minutes.
not_available I'm scrambling the jets now.
not_available It seems as if this will be up to your team on the ground.
not_available We have visual contact with the sub.
not_available Hatches are still closed.
not_available Ship's been locked down.
not_available One hostile topside, standing guard.
not_available Chloe's simulation has Bierko firing the missiles in less than 20 minutes.
not_available Sooner than that if he's already started programming targets.
not_available The navy can't intercept in time.
not_available I just got off the phone with Admiral Kirkland.
not_available He's scrambling F
not_available 18s, but they won't be in the air in time to destroy the sub.
not_available How far out are reinforcements? 
not_available Too far.
not_available Additional teams won't arrive until after the launch.
not_available 
not_available Then we have to take out Bierko ourselves.
not_available That's not a real option.
not_available There are only four entry points, presumably locked down and defended.
not_available Bill's right.
not_available You don't have the manpower or resources to get on that sub.
not_available We might.
not_available Somebody just launched a signal tube off the starboard side.
not_available What's a signal tube? A radio beacon crewmen can send to the surface in an emergency.
not_available If there are friendlies inside, they can help us board.
not_available Scan all emergency frequencies.
not_available On it.
not_available Standing by.
not_available Jack, just so we're straight We stop Bierko, my wife and I disappear for good, with your help, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available One other thing.
not_available If I'm going on that sub, I need a firearm.
not_available I'll cover you.
not_available That's what I'm worried about.
not_available I don't go in undefended against hostiles.
not_available I still consider you a hostile.
not_available I don't get a gun, I don't go in.
not_available You were right.
not_available A survivor is sending a distress signal.
not_available Can we receive here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Patch him through.
not_available I repeat.
not_available This is Petty Officer Tim Rooney on Natalia K
not_available 524, Code Seven.
not_available SOS.
not_available We are under attack.
not_available Petty Officer Rooney, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm with the Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available What the hell's going on, sir? Everyone's dead.
not_available People are in the control room trying to operate the launch system.
not_available Who are they? 
not_available Russian separatists.
not_available They were responsible for the attacks earlier today.
not_available Does the navy know? 
not_available They sent fighters, but they won't be in time.
not_available So what do we do? Did anyone else from your crew survive? 
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available Where are you? Uh, lower level, auxiliary engineering.
not_available I was doing an inventory when the alarms went off.
not_available The atmospheric gauges redlined.
not_available It's a sealed compartment.
not_available I shut it down.
not_available The men that attacked the ship, were they wearing gas masks? Yes, but they took 'em off a few minutes ago.
not_available Good.
not_available That means they flushed the Sentox out of the air system.
not_available You should be able to move around freely.
not_available Hold on one second.
not_available Chloe, get me the nearest entry point to Petty Officer Rooney's current position.
not_available The closest hatch is the forward escape hatch.
not_available Petty Officer, do you have a firearm? No, the armoury's on the other side of the ship.
not_available You need to find something to use as a weapon.
not_available I have a utility tool.
not_available It has a knife on it.
not_available That'll work.
not_available Go to the upper level.
not_available Let me know when you get there.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Find the forward escape hatch and let us in.
not_available There's a man there, guarding it.
not_available Then you're gonna have to kill him.
not_available Officer Rooney? I'm an engineer.
not_available I'm not trained for that.
not_available The men on the Natalia plan to use its missiles on civilians, unless we stop them.
not_available Make your way to the upper level.
not_available Do it now.
not_available We are running out of time.
not_available 
not_available I'll contact you when I get there.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We need to get closer to the sub.
not_available Are you ready? I know you've got Malina's.
not_available 45 in that bag.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're generating a list of potential targets, but we have no idea what Bierko plans to hit.
not_available Are we evacuating? 
not_available We don't have time.
not_available The missiles will strike before we can mobilise anyone to the safe zones.
not_available How could this happen? How could these people even access the submarine? The sub was attacked while it was being serviced at a civilian port, not on a naval base, where security would have been more substantial.
not_available There has to be a way to destroy that sub before Bierko can launch.
not_available F
not_available 18s are scrambling as we speak.
not_available But according to the latest estimates, they won't get there on time.
not_available Yes? I'm still waiting to talk to Mike.
not_available He's in a crisis meeting.
not_available There's no telling how long he'll be.
not_available Then I should get off the ranch on my own.
not_available No.
not_available Without Mike's help, you'll be seen.
not_available Charles can't find out you're still alive.
not_available I'll call you when I get ahold of Mike.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack, the missiles will launch in less than ten minutes.
not_available Copy that.
not_available How long to cancel the launch sequence? I won't know until I see how their targeting software's configured.
not_available The petty officer is back on.
not_available Patch him through.
not_available Petty Officer Rooney, you're on with Jack Bauer.
not_available What's your position, son? 
not_available I'm 30 feet forward of the hatch.
not_available Have you got a visual of the hostile guarding the hatch? Yeah, he's still there.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available You need to kill him without alerting the others.
not_available Are you righthanded or lefthanded? 
not_available Right.
not_available Approach him from behind.
not_available When you're within 18 inches, put your left hand on his mouth, pull his head back onto your chest, exposing his neck, 
not_available then take your right hand and slit his throat.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You need to cut deep to sever the vocal cords and the carotid artery.
not_available I
not_available I don't I don't know if I can do this.
not_available You don't have a choice, son.
not_available You need to focus on the objective.
not_available You cannot afford to think about this, son.
not_available You need to do it.
not_available There's less than nine minutes till the launch.
not_available Petty Officer Rooney? Petty Officer Rooney? OK, I can do this.
not_available I have to do this.
not_available Cut him deep and cut him fast.
not_available Agent McCullough, cover us.
not_available We're moving in on the tower.
not_available Go.
not_available Petty Officer Rooney, what is your status? My status is, uh He's dead.
not_available Did anyone hear you? 
not_available No, no one's coming.
not_available Good.
not_available Open the hatch.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll take out the guard.
not_available Let's go.
not_available The guard is down.
not_available We're going in.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available The sub's missile hatch has just opened.
not_available I see them.
not_available What does that mean in terms of our timeframe? You have less than seven minutes.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm OK.
not_available Which way's the control room? 
not_available You lead, we'll follow.
not_available OK.
not_available The control room's down that hall.
not_available I'll need your help drawing the hostiles out.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Is there another way into the control room? I can go down one level and come up behind them.
not_available OK.
not_available When you get there, create a diversion.
not_available Something loud, just get them out of there.
not_available Then lay low and stay there.
not_available Do not engage them, do you understand? 
not_available Yeah, I can do that.
not_available Go.
not_available With the last three missiles, overlap these population centres in San Francisco.
not_available Looking up GPS coordinates, sir.
not_available Keep working.
not_available Did you hear that? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Down there.
not_available Come with me, both of you.
not_available The control room's right behind us.
not_available I have a visual on one hostile.
not_available Agent McCullough, I'm moving into position.
not_available When he's directly above me, signal me with the mirror.
not_available Jack, the missiles are armed.
not_available Three minutes till launch.
not_available We're all clear.
not_available I have to manually reverse all these codes.
not_available Do you have enough time? I'll do my best.
not_available I don't wanna be in here any more than you if the F
not_available 18s take out the sub.
not_available We'll keep Bierko and his men out so you can finish this.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Agent McCullough's down.
not_available Bierko and one hostile remaining.
not_available Henderson, what is your status? 
not_available I need more time.
not_available Hold 'em off.
not_available Jack? Hang on, Jack.
not_available Aaargh! I'm almost there, Jack.
not_available A few more seconds.
not_available Ten seconds.
not_available It's done.
not_available Launch sequence is cancelled.
not_available I repeat.
not_available Launch sequence is cancelled.
not_available Audrey, recall the F
not_available 18s.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Bierko's dead.
not_available Submarine is secure.
not_available Jack, are you OK? 
not_available Bill, I'm fine.
not_available I'm getting feedback.
not_available Take me off the com.
not_available OK, Jack.
not_available Hold it, Jack! Now lower your arms, real slow, and turn around.
not_available You were never really gonna let me go, were you? No.
not_available Good for you, Jack.
not_available You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer, Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler.
not_available They were friends of mine.
not_available That's the way it works.
not_available Hands above your head! 
not_available Identify yourself! Jack Bauer, with the Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.
not_available All the hostiles are dead.
not_available Holster your weapons! Sir, you need to contact Bill Buchanan immediately.
not_available OK.
not_available Lieutenant, I need access to a vehicle.
not_available Petty Officer, get me a vehicle, now! Thank you.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The navy's running cleanup and security on the sub.
not_available Yeah, they're here now.
not_available Christopher Henderson's dead.
not_available What? What happened? He fired on me.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available Are you coming back to CTU? 
not_available Yeah, I'll be there soon.
not_available All right, we'll see you then.
not_available Chloe, the navy needs access to our logs so they can use them for their report.
not_available Can you pick up? What codes do they need? 
not_available They don't.
not_available Get somewhere private.
not_available I'll have to get that from my screen.
not_available Let me get back to my station.
not_available I'm here.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I'm not coming back.
not_available I'm going after Logan.
not_available What do you mean? I'll fill you in later.
not_available Now I need you to walk me through modifying some field communications equipment.
not_available That's not exactly my area.
not_available Then get some help.
not_available Chloe, are you with me on this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll give you a list.
not_available OK.
not_available The missiles no longer pose a threat? Yes, Mr President.
not_available We have complete control of the boat.
not_available And Vladimir Bierko and all his known associates are dead or in custody.
not_available So, then, it's all over, Mike? 
not_available It's all over.
not_available I'll make a statement before I go back to Washington.
not_available About the successful resolution of the crisis.
not_available Yes, and about David Palmer.
not_available Sir? His cask is being flown to Arlington for burial.
not_available I'd like to say a few words at the airfield.
not_available And then I'll fly back to Washington.
not_available I'll get to work on it right away.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks, Mike for everything.
not_available It's been a hell of a day.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It has.
not_available Mike? 
not_available You need to come with me.
not_available Come with you? Please.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Mrs Logan, have you been? 
not_available No, I I've never been more sober.
not_available Or more sane.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available My husband.
not_available What about him? I know you've been troubled by Charles's actions today.
not_available You know that something is terribly, terribly wrong.
not_available You just can't put your finger on it.
not_available OK.
not_available Tell me what this is about.
not_available No, I'll show you.
not_available It'll explain everything.
not_available Please come.
not_available The mission to retake the submarine has been successful.
not_available So I understand.
not_available You'll also be interested to know Christopher Henderson was killed during the operation.
not_available You're certain of this? 
not_available CTU has confirmed the information.
not_available That's excellent.
not_available But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that's the end of our problems.
not_available There's still Bauer to deal with.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Mr Bauer will be taken care of.
not_available Good.
not_available Mike, over here.
not_available Aaron, what happened to you? Agent Adams tried to kill me, on the president's orders.
not_available That doesn't make any sense.
not_available Where's Agent Adams? Mike, we need your help.
not_available My God.
not_available What the hell's going on here? The president had something to do with this? Everything.
not_available He was involved with everything that happened today.
not_available Supplying the terrorists with the nerve gas, the murder of David Palmer.
not_available And Walt Cummings? 
not_available Walt was just their scapegoat.
not_available He didn't commit suicide.
not_available He was murdered by a man who works for Charles.
not_available Charles told me to be quiet for the good of the country.
not_available Keep my mouth shut.
not_available I can't do that, not any more.
not_available Do you have proof? Jack Bauer was in possession of a recording that implicated the president.
not_available That's why Logan was willing to go so far as to shoot a plane full of people down.
not_available Because Jack was on it.
not_available Where is this recording? 
not_available It's been destroyed.
not_available I didn't want to believe it either, Mike, but it's the truth, so help me God.
not_available All right.
not_available If this is true, we need to find another way to make a case against the president.
not_available You're right, but first we have to get Aaron off the ranch.
not_available There can't be a record of it.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available We need to move fast.
not_available I know the man at the western gate well.
not_available They won't inspect the vehicle if I'm driving.
not_available Hide in the back, out of sight.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available Aaron.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available I'll go somewhere your husband's people can't find me.
not_available Will you let me know that you're all right? It's probably safer if we don't have any contact.
not_available Goodbye, Aaron.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mike Novick.
not_available Mike, it's Jack Bauer.
not_available I know this is an unusual request, but I'm looking for Aaron Pierce.
not_available I can't reach him on his cell.
not_available It's Jack Bauer.
not_available He's trying to find you.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available Aaron's with me right now, Jack.
not_available Hold on.
not_available It's all right, Jack.
not_available You can speak freely in front of Mike.
not_available He knows what I know.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available A few miles from the ranch.
not_available What happened? The president tried to have me killed, but Mrs Logan saved my life.
not_available We decided to bring Mike into this.
not_available I'm still trying to process it.
not_available It's a real mess.
not_available I'm calling Aaron because I need his help.
not_available I need yours too.
not_available Help with what? 
not_available Bringing President Logan to justice.
not_available Aaron said the recording implicating him was destroyed.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Without it, you can't mount a case.
not_available I can if I can get a direct confession from Logan.
not_available Someone inside CTU is setting up a digital uplink.
not_available If I can get Logan to acknowledge everything he's done, that's all we need.
not_available Jack, if you intend to physically coerce the president We need to do this now.
not_available The longer we wait, the more vulnerable we are.
not_available Logan tried to take me out, like he did Aaron.
not_available He was responsible for David Palmer's assassination and a terrorist attack on US soil.
not_available He cannot be allowed to remain in office, not for one more day.
not_available How long till you get here? 
not_available 20 minutes.
not_available That's too late.
not_available Logan will be gone.
not_available He's leaving for Washington then.
not_available Then you have to delay him.
not_available I'm not sure I can.
not_available Mike, just tell me you'll try.
not_available All right, but get here as fast as you can.
not_available OK, thank you.
not_available You understand? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll go as soon as I finish our debrief with the navy.
not_available Very good, Ms Hayes.
not_available Homeland's ordered me to Washington as soon as I've filed the Bierko case.
not_available The request came from the White House.
not_available Logan's looking for an excuse to clean house.
not_available I'm sure I'll be next.
not_available Come in.
not_available Yes? Do you have something? 
not_available I need an authorisation code.
not_available For what? Access to a high
not_available clearance workstation.
not_available You already have access.
not_available It's for some new personnel.
not_available What? Morris? You're bringing Morris back? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Why, Chloe? I'm still trying to salvage something from the recording.
not_available If anyone can do it, it's Morris.
not_available I didn't think he was on the government payroll now.
not_available He's not.
not_available What's he doing? He's selling women's shoes in Beverly Hills.
not_available What? 
not_available Is this ajoke? No.
not_available I wouldn't have brought him in if there was anyone else.
not_available Please, Mr Buchanan.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bill 
not_available It'll be all right.
not_available Who is this guy? 
not_available Morris O'Brian.
not_available Chloe's ex
not_available husband.
not_available Not like that.
not_available The beauty of the beast is, if you leave these fields blank, it'll prompt you for a code.
not_available Ba
not_available bing! See that? You just saved 60 seconds.
not_available Two of those a day, an extra cigarette break, or whatever it is you do to take the edge off.
not_available Morris! What are you doing? 
not_available Making your people more efficient.
not_available You picked the most attractive one.
not_available Wrong.
not_available You're the most attractive one.
not_available Here's your clearance.
not_available Surprised you got Buchanan to sign me off.
not_available This is a really good opportunity for you.
not_available Why not surprise me and not screw it up? OK, I'll pretend this requires all my attention, when we both know I could do it in my sleep.
not_available Sit down.
not_available So, where is this recording? Nothing, forget it, it's fried.
not_available I'm missing something.
not_available You wanted me to salvage a recording.
not_available That was an excuse.
not_available I need some com unit modifications, a certified audio transfer rate of 6.8.
not_available I can only get to 6.5.
not_available Can you do that without talking? I could, but it would be a terrible waste of my charm.
not_available OK, I'm not listening any more.
not_available Call me when you're done.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Behind me you can see preparations as the casket bearing the body of David Palmer is expected shortly, to be met Come in.
not_available Is Aaron safe? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I can't believe Charles is gonna do this.
not_available With David's blood on his hands, he has the audacity to eulogise him in front of the world.
not_available Mrs Logan, I said there was no way to make a case against your husband.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available Jack Bauer, a former CTU agent, contacted Aaron and me.
not_available He's on his way here now.
not_available What for? 
not_available To confront your husband directly.
not_available Confront him? Will he hurt him? Jack Bauer will do whatever it takes to compel your husband to confess the truth.
not_available He's the only one I know who can do this.
not_available When will he be here? 
not_available 15 minutes.
not_available Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately.
not_available I tried to delay him, but he wouldn't change his schedule.
not_available That's why I'm coming to you.
not_available I need you to keep him here.
not_available Martha.
not_available If you want your husband brought to justice, this is our only chance.
not_available You have to find a way to stall him.
not_available Aaron, it's good to see you.
not_available Was Mike able to delay the president? He's trying, but he had to ask Mrs Logan for some help.
not_available The first lady knows what we intend to do? 
not_available She does.
not_available Aaron, can she be trusted? 
not_available She is with us, Jack, 100 per cent.
not_available Can you access the Secret Service deployment grid? I have.
not_available Security's been beefed up around the main building 
not_available you won't get him alone there.
not_available Is Marine One taking him? 
not_available No, this was last minute.
not_available They're moving him by reduced attachment in a navy helicopter.
not_available That's where this must happen.
not_available I need to get on that chopper.
not_available I don't see how that's possible.
not_available Get me as close to it as you can.
not_available We'll figure it out from there.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I agree.
not_available Wayne Palmer should be at the airfield, but if you can't find him, I'm not gonna wait for him.
not_available Will you be leaving soon? 
not_available Yes, I'm leaving now.
not_available All right, sir.
not_available Have a copy of my speech on the chopper.
not_available I'll work on it on the flight over.
not_available I'll be out of your way in a second.
not_available I saw on your schedule that you're meeting David Palmer's casket at the airfield.
not_available If you came to judge me, I don't have time No, that's not it.
not_available I I've had time to reflect and I I think I owe you an apology.
not_available All right.
not_available I said some horrible things to you.
not_available I've had horrible things said to me before.
not_available And by you.
not_available But there was one thing you said that I can't get over.
not_available What? 
not_available That I broke your heart.
not_available And that you hated me.
not_available Well, I wish I could take those words back.
not_available All I can ask now is that you forgive me.
not_available Please, Charles.
not_available I don't know how to respond, Marty.
not_available I I never expected you to say anything like this.
not_available I mean it, Charles, I I mean it.
