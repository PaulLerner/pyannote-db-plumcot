
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available How much of the virus was released? Enough to kill everyone in the building Did you plant any other vials? My assignment was the hotel So there are others.
not_available Yes, eleven Alvers planted a vial containing the cordilla virus in the ventilation system It went off as Gael was trying to disarm it No one can be allowed to leave the building We have to impose a total quarantine If these people realize what's going on, there will be widespread panic.
not_available They are lying to us.
not_available It's inside the building.
not_available Keep away from the doors.
not_available Stay back.
not_available If you try to leave, I will shoot you No, you won't He knows who you are, Jack Who knows who I am? Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer.
not_available That's what he said If you go against him, you're a dead man.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Hello Jack.
not_available I knew you were better than Amador, but you are not better than me.
not_available I need you to put me in touch with a friend of yours.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the man in possession of the Cordilla virus has demanded to speak with you.
not_available You are no longer in control of your country, and if you do not use the full power of your office to execute my wishes the virus will be released, and it will be impossible to stop.
not_available The following takes place between 5:00 am and 6:00 am.
not_available Everybody, stay calm.
not_available Stay calm and quiet Look, outside! I want to make one thing clear right now No one leaves this building until further notice In a moment, I will get on the intercom and explain why I need absolute quiet and absolute cooperation.
not_available It reaches the entire hotel? Yes This is federal agent Michelle Dessler In order to survive what's happened, you will need to listen carefully, and follow my instructions.
not_available As most of you already know, an infectious substance has been released in the building and the hotel has been quarantined.
not_available Anyone attempting to leave will be stopped by any means necessary.
not_available If you are in your room, stay there.
not_available If you are anywhere else, return to your room immediately.
not_available Medical assistance will arrive shortly, and be given to anyone who requires it.
not_available The first priority is to go back to your room and stay there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ok, folks, you heard the announcement.
not_available Let's make our way back to the elevators.
not_available The elevators are back in operation.
not_available This way, people.
not_available In an orderly fashion, please.
not_available Make your way to the elevators.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Danny? Danny, oh, no Oh, oh, God Who did this? Who killed him? You? You are a federal agent.
not_available You were supposed to protect him Get your hands off me You are going to have to calm down.
not_available I am sorry, but this is just going to make things worse.
not_available You were supposed to protect him Yes, this is Bauer Agent Bauer, Please hold for the president.
not_available Jack Mr.
not_available President The man I spoke to,the one who controls this virus Why did he use you to get to me? I wish I could answer that, sir.
not_available He says he knows me, but right now we haven't been able to ascertain a positive identification.
not_available The only thing I can tell you for certain is that within the last hour, he was in Los Angeles.
not_available Jack.
not_available He made it clear that he intends to use the threat of releasing this virus to control me and through me the entire apparatus of our national government.
not_available Obviously, we can't let that happen.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available Find him, Jack We are doing everything we can.
not_available I will keep in touch Thank you With Amador dead, we've got two leads left.
not_available First, whoever this guy is, he says he knows me.
not_available Second, he knows Alvers.
not_available The guy who planted the virus at the hotel? That's right.
not_available I want you to call Tony.
not_available Tell him to get Alvers to give us a physical description as detailed as possible then I want to cross check with the personnel in my service file.
not_available Bauer says he doesn't know who this man is.
not_available But he knows Bauer.
not_available Apparently.
not_available David, how is that possible? I don't know, Wayne, all I know is, they're doing everything they can to find this man Did he give Bauer any indication of what he wants? No.
not_available But he controls enough of the virus to wipe out a significant portion of this country's population.
not_available So, whatever he wants, we don't have much choice but to give it to him At least for now.
not_available Make sure all the exits are sealed off.
not_available I just checked a few minutes ago.
not_available Well, check again.
not_available You don't have to keep me busy, agent Dessler.
not_available I am not going to panic.
not_available I know you won't.
not_available I appreciate all the help you have given me.
not_available I'd just like to know the truth.
not_available Is everyone in this hotel going to die? Not everyone.
not_available A few will be immune to the virus.
not_available But most of us.
not_available What are the chances of survival? I don't know.
not_available I will let you know as soon as I do.
not_available Thank you Dessler Hey, it's me The perimeters are set.
not_available Good.
not_available Things are under control right now, but a panic is still possible as more people start showing symptoms.
not_available Yeah, we have to be ready for that especially since the incubation period of the virus is so much shorter than we thought it was.
not_available How are you doing? I am fine so far.
not_available I just¡­ What? Things go crazy.
not_available I had to shoot a man He was trying to get out of the hotel.
not_available He is dead.
not_available Michelle, you did what you had to do, the only thing you could have done.
not_available You need to stay focused, all right? I know, I am All right, there's something we need you to do.
not_available We need you to find out if Alvers ever saw the man that hired him.
not_available We need a description as detailed as possible.
not_available I am on it.
not_available I will call you right back.
not_available Come on, everyone, move it I am bleeding You don't look too bad so far.
not_available We had a deal I told you what I knew.
not_available You'd kill me when I start showing symptoms.
not_available You haven't told us everything you know.
not_available What are you talking about? The man you work for, what's his name? He's never told me his name.
not_available I am dying, I have nothing to gain by lying about it.
not_available When was the last time you saw him? Three hours ago, at a Go parlor in Chinatown.
not_available Tony, I am with Alvers.
not_available We are ready, go ahead.
not_available I want a description.
not_available Mid 30s, Caucasian, about six
not_available one, black hair, brown eyes, lean, no facial hair.
not_available He speaks with a British accent.
not_available You got that? Yeah, we got it.
not_available How long is this going to take? Once the parameters are in, not long.
not_available I just need to cross reference it with personnel that Jack has worked with in the past.
not_available All right, Jack, we uploading the photos for the suspects.
not_available You should have a visual Copy that.
not_available No¡­ No¡­No¡­ He is not there Are you sure? Of course I am sure.
not_available Tony Yeah, I heard We are going to have to widen the search parameters.
not_available The accent might be a mislead.
not_available Maybe he is not even British.
not_available If we drop that parameter, the database will increase by a factor of almost 50.
not_available That's 750 possibilities.
not_available And a fair number of those are missing reliable visuals.
not_available In other words, no head shots.
not_available Tony Yeah, Jack What are the parameters for the search outsisde of accent and appearance? As wide as we could make them.
not_available All living males Change that Change living? Yeah, change it to presumed dead Copy that No¡­ No¡­ There.
not_available That's him Tony, Tony, that's him Jack, you know this guy? My god Jack? Yeah, I know him His name is Stephen Saunders British intelligence lent him to CTU for a mission in Kosovo The one that target Victory Drazen Yeah I was the only one to get out, five other died including Saunders At least that's what I thought I was obviously wrong Tony, I am going to have to get back to you I need a few minutes to think this through Jack, hurry.
not_available Son of a bitch The situation at the hotel seems to be under control.
not_available Now SWAT is in place.
not_available NHS is there, and will start the testing procedures soon.
not_available Any sense that the press has picked up on this? No, David, not so far.
not_available But they are bound to before long.
not_available Containing the virus is crucial, but containing the story that it was released in the hotel is just as important.
not_available If the story breaks, we'll need a plausible cover.
not_available I will work up some scenarios.
not_available Don't use the term ¡°Cordilla Virus¡±.
not_available People have never heard of it, and the unknown creates more fear.
not_available Say it's similar to Legionaire's Disease.
not_available People are familiar with that, and they know it was handled successfully.
not_available Ok Mr.
not_available O'Laughlin.
not_available Mr.
not_available President Please Thank you Thank you very much Mr.
not_available Palmer What's homeland security's assessment? Sir, we believe the threat level should be raised to red.
not_available Do it.
not_available What about domestic air travel? It is our suggestion that flights be grounded and airports be closed.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, if your concern is to avoid panic, stopping air traffic might have the opposite effect.
not_available That's better than allowing a widespread release of the virus.
not_available If you shut down those airports, you won't be able to explain it away with Legionnaire's Disease.
not_available We are talking about security issues, Mr.
not_available President, we are not talking about public relations.
not_available And how the public relates to this is a security issue.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we'd also advocate shutting down interstate rail and bus traffic in the interest of Listen.
not_available Whoever has these vials could already be in their cars.
not_available Now, we can't shut down every single highway.
not_available Mr.
not_available President Gentleman Alert the airlines to a possible nationwide shutdown, but wait for my authorization.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I have a call on one.
not_available One moment, please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Laughlin.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available It's him Okay, that's it here we go, start the trace.
not_available Put the call through, please.
not_available Yes Sir, right away.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? Yes It's time for your first assignment, a very simple one, but one necessary to our future relationship.
not_available We don't have a relationship.
not_available No, you don't negotiate with terrorists.
not_available Well, I don't negotiate with heads of state, so just do as you are told.
not_available Across the street from your building is a mailbox.
not_available Have the secret service open it.
not_available Inside is a package wrapped in black paper.
not_available Have them bring it to you within 10 minutes.
not_available I am not doing anything until you tell me exactly who He didn't stay on long enough Probably knew we were going to try and trace the call.
not_available Send secret service to pick up the package.
not_available All right, David, but it's going to have to be screened for explosives and the virus.
not_available Then do it.
not_available Just make sure it's back here in 10 minutes.
not_available All right.
not_available His file is still inactive.
not_available There is no evidence that shows he surfaced after Kosovo.
not_available So, for the past 10 years, he has been letting everyone think he was dead.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available No, if he survived, he'd have been captured and sent to one of their prisons for years.
not_available Jack, if the mission had failed, maybe he was the reason.
not_available He could have betrayed the team, pretended to be killed, and gone over to the other side.
not_available You don't know Saunders.
not_available He was a patriot.
not_available Something else happened to him.
not_available Who're you calling? MI
not_available 6 Operations.
not_available This is Jack Bauer, I need to speak with Trevor Tomlinson, please One moment.
not_available Hello, Jack Trevor, has CTU brought you up to speed on Stephen Saunders? Yeah, we have got his file up now.
not_available There's no indication that he is still alive.
not_available Trust me, he is.
not_available You are going to want to do a complete forensic protocol search.
not_available That's being done as we speak.
not_available Do you think London would have any additional data? On something like this, no.
not_available It's local.
not_available Ok, one more thing.
not_available He's going to want to deal with people he knows, people he trusts.
not_available See if you can do a quick search on all his past contacts.
not_available Right.
not_available Most of them have gone dark or they are confirmed dead.
not_available Oh, here is something.
not_available A name: Diana White.
not_available Ran a high class escort service in Los Angels in the late 80s Catered to diplomats, embassy employees, that sort of thing.
not_available Apparently, she passed a great deal of intel to Saunders, and they became very close.
not_available Even lived together for a while Is she still living in Los Angels? Yes, but she's been inactive in intelligence circles for some time.
not_available Patch her file and every piece of information you are got on her through to my computer.
not_available Thank you I'd like to begin testing the hotel staff.
not_available It would be very helpful if you would go first.
not_available All right.
not_available Ok Name please? Michelle Dessler, CTU.
not_available Here you go.
not_available What's that? Ok, it's a nasal swab.
not_available Every bit as reliable as a blood test, and it can be analyzed much more quickly.
not_available How quickly? We should have the results in two hours.
not_available Thank You.
not_available Next.
not_available Right over there.
not_available Right over here, sir.
not_available Sir, step over here.
not_available It's alright, sir.
not_available There's nothing to be worried about This phone is what was in the package from Stephen Saunders.
not_available We scanned it.
not_available It's clean.
not_available Unfortunately, Mr.
not_available President, it's built with what's called a sub
not_available channel chip, designed to received a specific signal that can't be traced.
not_available I understand.
not_available Thank you, Aaron.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available So this is the way he intends to communicate from now on.
not_available And if we really can't trace the call We can't find him.
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available You are using your new phone.
not_available Consider it our private line.
not_available And, as you've no doubt been informed.
not_available Don't bother trying to trace my calls.
not_available What do you want? Within the next half hour, you'll hold a televised press conference.
not_available About what? The space program, the price of wheat, it's entirely up to you.
not_available But, at some point, you will use the phrase ¡°the sky is falling.¡± Use it however you like, Mr.
not_available President, but use it.
not_available He wants me to call a press conference About what, it doesn't matter.
not_available Just use the phrase ¡°the sky is falling¡± David, it's a signal of some sort.
not_available Maybe for an attack, maybe for a wave of attacks.
not_available Maybe it's just a signal to show that he is in control.
not_available Either way, you can't do it.
not_available You can't give him that kind of power.
not_available You saw what that virus does.
not_available I read the file, yeah A thousand people are dying as we speak, Wayne.
not_available Not just in a file, but in real life, right here in Los Angeles.
not_available And David, I realize that, but the problem But if I don't do what this man says, it will be millions.
not_available We have to buy some time and maybe CTU can find this maniac before things get out of hand.
not_available Call a press conference.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She's there.
not_available thank you.
not_available I will let him know.
not_available Diana White is at home.
not_available Have we got anything new on her? Just more on the list of clientele she handled.
not_available Foreign dignitaries, heads of state, even a high ranking member of the Vatican.
not_available Most with a net worth over $20 million.
not_available Well, her relations with Saunders make sense.
not_available She give him the names of her clients, he blackmails them for information by threatening to reveal who they are.
not_available You think that's how he got the money to finance his operation? I think that's how he financed part of it.
not_available You knew Saunders.
not_available You said he was a good soldier.
not_available What do you think happened? To be honest with you, I don't know.
not_available I still can't believe he survived the blast in Bosnia.
not_available They must have captured him.
not_available Otherwise, he would have resurfaced.
not_available They would have put him in prison, tortured him for God knows how many years.
not_available Now he's holding our government responsible.
not_available But he was a British agent He was on loan to us.
not_available It was a US operation.
not_available No, we left him behind.
not_available I left him behind.
not_available Look, I know you were studying this virus even before it surfaced.
not_available This isn't the same strain.
not_available All right, maybe not exactly the same strain, but related, right? So you must have been working on a cure, a vaccine, or something.
not_available Any research we have is based upon Look, I got a hotel full of people dying out there.
not_available One of them is my wife.
not_available So, don't tell me there is nothing you can do I wish there was.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available NHS.
not_available What did they say? Anyone infected.
not_available It's a 100% mortality rate.
not_available You know, today, when Michelle told Chappelle that I should stand down because of my wound I barely even spoke to her.
not_available Look, Tony.
not_available I can't tell you that I know what you are going through because I don't But if you need anything, I am here.
not_available Kim, would you excuse us? Of course, here's the file.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Have you cleaned those shared files with Division yet? No, I didn't get to it yet.
not_available I had to take care of something Yeah, I know what you were doing, Tony.
not_available You were calling about Michelle.
not_available She is my wife, Ryan.
not_available I understand that.
not_available But we're shorthanded as it is.
not_available We can't afford Look, I know how to do my job, all right? Yes, but you are not doing it.
not_available You have to move on.
not_available Move on? What are you acting like she is already dead? Yes, I am And so should you.
not_available We're at war.
not_available Tony.
not_available I need your full attention.
not_available If you can't give it to me, go home or maintain a vigil at the hotel.
not_available But if you stay here, I need you to focus.
not_available And the best way to do that is to assume the worst, and make it about getting revenge.
not_available Now, what's it going to be? Are you staying or not? What do you need? I have been hunting for any bank accounts Amador may have used over the past few months on the computer we confiscated at the Go club.
not_available If I can find something, maybe we can follow the money trail back to this Stephen Saunders.
not_available It's offshore or domestic? Both If I find anything suspicious, I will stream it to you.
not_available Coordinate with Division on a substrata overlay.
not_available All right you got it Thanks, Tony Yeah.
not_available Don't fire.
not_available I am a federal agent.
not_available So what? You are in my house.
not_available Don't shoot.
not_available I just want to show you my identification.
not_available What do you want? I need to talk to you about Stephen Saunders.
not_available Bastard.
not_available Put the gun down.
not_available You first.
not_available Ok I am gonna put my gun down.
not_available Just take it easy.
not_available Step out from behind there.
not_available Ok, I am coming out.
not_available Just take it easy.
not_available Stay calm I just want to talk to you.
not_available Now we can talk.
not_available Do you mind if I get dressed first? Go ahead Tell me about you and Saunders.
not_available Stephen always told me he'd protect me.
not_available I was young and stupid and I believed him.
not_available When the work turned ugly, he left me hanging.
not_available What kind of work? It's a figure of speech.
not_available We know you acquired intelligence for Stephen Saunders through your girls.
not_available I provided a service for wealthy men.
not_available How long do you think that would have lasted if I betrayed their confidences? So you're denying that you worked for him.
not_available Yes.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I don't care.
not_available You will.
not_available Come on.
not_available Chase, call Tomlinson.
not_available Tell him we are bringing Diana White in for questioning.
not_available I am not going anywhere without a lawyer.
not_available You are not under arrest.
not_available I am taking you in to MI
not_available 6, where you will be interrogated by an agent of a foreign government.
not_available Your constitutional rights no longer apply.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Have you seen Gael? He doesn't have much time left.
not_available So fast Is he in a lot of pain? Michelle, you know the pathology of this virus.
not_available I want to see him.
not_available I wouldn't advise that.
not_available If I have been infected, I have been infected.
not_available There's nothing anyone can do.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available Do me a favor Anything Contact my family, and tell them that I love them.
not_available Tell them that I have died quickly.
not_available No pain.
not_available Of course.
not_available Gael I was raised to believe suicide is a sin.
not_available No one could blame you, in this world or the next, for ending your suffering.
not_available Are you so sure about that? A few seconds more, that's all I needed.
not_available You know when I was trying to stop the cylinder from exploding I hesitated, just a moment, because I was afraid.
not_available Then I forced myself to move forward.
not_available If only I hadn't hesitated, this might not be happening to me, or to all those poor people upstairs.
not_available God.
not_available Gael, you did everything you could.
not_available I am proud to have worked with you.
not_available You're one of You are one of the bravest men I have ever known.
not_available And I will make sure that your wife and children know that.
not_available Homeland security has raised the threat level to red.
not_available Now, they are in constant contact with the FBI, set to move if ¡°the sky is falling¡± should trigger any kind of suspicious activity.
not_available Is the FAA set to ground flights and close the airports? David, I think that's an overreaction.
not_available That was not my question.
not_available Yes Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
not_available Please, be seated.
not_available Good morning.
not_available I know the hour is unusual, but so are the times in which we live.
not_available As a result of intelligence on terrorist activity gathered by the office of homeland security and other agencies, I am announcing that a threat level red exists throughout the United States.
not_available Therefore, I am ordering the grounding of all domestic and international air traffic, and the closing of airports.
not_available I am not taking this action because the sky is falling, but I'd rather be overprotective than underprepared.
not_available And as always, diligence and calm are your best weapons against the insidious nature of the enemy.
not_available And God willing, we and all those who love freedom will remain safe and secure.
not_available Thank you Mr.
not_available President, can I have a question, please? Excuse me, excuse me.
not_available This is not a Q and A session.
not_available The president has made a statement, and he has nothing more to add.
not_available Thank you very much One moment.
not_available Maybe a couple of questions.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Phil.
not_available Is the United States currently under attack? This is a preventive measure.
not_available What are you preventing, sir? And do you think the American public will accept the grounding of air traffic based on the rather vague justification you have just given? The exact nature of the threat is something I can't go into at this time.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available Trevor, this is my partner, Chase Edmunds.
not_available Chase Edmunds, Trevor Tomlinson And this is Ms.
not_available Diana White.
not_available Ms.
not_available White.
not_available We've done some additional checking.
not_available She is the registered owner of the address in Chinatown where Saunders was last seen.
not_available But I haven't seen him.
not_available You might want to think that through, Ms.
not_available White.
not_available Do you think he'd put himself on the line like this for you? We've begun vetting the raw data we collected on Saunders.
not_available You sent it off to London yet? No.
not_available It's still in our system downstairs.
not_available London wants us to get as far as we can before transmitting.
not_available Get down Chase, are you hit? I got it in the vest.
not_available Cover me.
not_available Trevor, the Saunders computer file.
not_available What server did you store it on? A5 We have got to get down to the computer room.
not_available Use the stairs.
not_available Go There's no way that Saunders took out this entire place just to kill Diana White.
not_available MI
not_available 6 has information in their systems that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.
not_available We need to get it.
not_available I'll get the door.
not_available Room is clear.
not_available Check him out.
not_available Chase What? We got a bomb How much time? None.
not_available You got to go now.
not_available Go now! Jack, I am not leaving you.
not_available Get out of here It's an order.
not_available Go now.
not_available I got it.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Almeida Tony, it's me Gael is dead He was suffering so badly.
not_available No one should have to go through what he did.
not_available Tony, there are children upstairs who are going to die in agony in front of their parents' eyes.
not_available Michelle, unfortunately, there's nothing we can do for them right now.
not_available Actually, there is.
not_available Field Ops has a supply of capsules.
not_available Those capsules are for field agents that are captured.
not_available Yeah, I know what they are for.
not_available They are for committing suicide to prevent torture, and that's exactly what they'd be used for here.
not_available We can make them available to anyone who's symptomatic.
not_available It will be their choice.
not_available You know I am not authorized to do that.
not_available I am not interested in what's authorized.
not_available Michelle, you are talking about mass suicide facilitated by an agency of the government.
not_available I am talking about common decency.
not_available If you could have seen Gael I am calling because¡­ if it was me if I am infected, You know what I want.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available Gael was the first to die because he was the first exposed, but others won't be far behind.
not_available I will see what I can do.
not_available Thank you Mr.
not_available Chappelle, line 2 Chappelle Ryan, it's Jack.
not_available Almost the entire MI
not_available 6 office has just been wiped out.
not_available What? They took out a woman that we believe had recent contact with Saunders.
not_available They also took out most of their personnel, including Tomlinson, which means that Saunders has a much larger organization in Los Angeles than we had thought.
not_available But it also makes them more visible, easier to find.
not_available Have you got anything yet? I don't know.
not_available I am trying to follow the money trail.
not_available I have narrowed it down to a few dozen offshore banks, but it's going to take some time.
not_available Ok, look, one of the things that Saunders was trying to destroy was all the information that MI
not_available 6 had gathered on him.
not_available I managed to retrieve the hard drive that has stored that information.
not_available I need you to call London, get their protocols and I want you to assemble a team that's ready to start striping data off of this thing as soon as I get back.
not_available All right, I will put Chloe on it right away.
not_available Ok The suicide capsules for the people down at the hotel.
not_available It's going to get pretty bad down there.
not_available It's against every regulation in the book.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do it.
not_available I've been trying to call Pack, but there's no answer.
not_available He's dead.
not_available So is Young.
not_available Taken out in the MI
not_available 6 operation.
not_available And Bauer? He and his partner got out before the explosion.
