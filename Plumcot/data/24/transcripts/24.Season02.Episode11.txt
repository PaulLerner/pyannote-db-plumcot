
not_available Mr President, the soldiers that attacked us at the crash site, they were Americans.
not_available Their commander is a Colonel Samuels.
not_available Whoever attacked us had access to our flight plan.
not_available The only way they could have gotten that information was from the inside.
not_available Roger, tell me everything you know about Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning.
not_available I don't know anything about him.
not_available I just spoke to Roger Stanton.
not_available He's hiding something from me.
not_available I'm going to arrest him.
not_available I wanted to warn you.
not_available They know about OPCOM.
not_available How? 
not_available I told them.
not_available This way I get him trusting me again.
not_available If she would have known anything, she would have told us.
not_available Kill her.
not_available You don't have to kill me.
not_available Can you identify any words that they said? Salat.
not_available It means "prayer".
not_available I want a list of every mosque in a 15
not_available mile radius.
not_available I don't know what Syed Ali looks like.
not_available I need you to identify him for me.
not_available Start a fire.
not_available You're crazy.
not_available Crazier than going to LA where a nuclear bomb might go off any minute? There's been an accident.
not_available We need an ambulance.
not_available Somebody hacked in.
not_available Who else had access to it? Marie? 
not_available I didn't expectyou to find anything.
not_available Hello.
not_available Marie, we have a problem.
not_available What is it? Basheer and Marko are dead.
not_available Omar has the van now.
not_available What do you need me to do? 
not_available They were supposed to pick up the trigger.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available At the place where Marko worked.
not_available In his locker.
not_available R &amp; J Lumber in Burbank.
not_available Is there a combination? 
not_available No.
not_available It requires a key.
not_available You must do whatever you can to gain access to this locker and bring the trigger to Omar.
not_available You want me to do this? Marie, our mission depends on you now.
not_available I'm counting on you.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available I know you will.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Marie, you should change your appearance.
not_available OK.
not_available At the mosque, all we need you to do is identify Syed Ali.
not_available Then we'll transfer you backto CTU.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know how difficult this must be for you.
not_available Do you? It would really help me out a lot if you could tell me what's going on.
not_available I'm not at liberty to tell you any more than I already have.
not_available Your people tookthe liberty of arresting my father.
not_available Syed Ali tookthe liberty of kidnapping me and killing Paul Koplin in front of me.
not_available I think I've earned the right to know what's going on.
not_available We believe Syed Ali is at the centre of a terrorist attack that's gonna take place in Los Angeles today.
not_available What kind of terrorist attack? A nuclear bomb.
not_available You're the only person we know of that's ever seen him.
not_available We need you to identify him for us.
not_available The reason why I'm taking you with me now is because we're running out of time.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available It's George.
not_available Baker should be on site any minute.
not_available I got a hard perimeter set up around the mosque.
not_available I'll get backto you as soon as we get there, George.
not_available Jack, there's something I gotta talkto you about.
not_available The Sheriffs Department at Newhall were transporting Kim and they got into an accident.
not_available What kind of accident? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She didn't get hurt.
not_available What the hell was she doing with them? Your people were supposed to pick her up.
not_available By the time our guys got to the station, they'd already moved her.
not_available I guess some local deputy was trying to be a big shot, claiming jurisdiction for a murder charge.
not_available Where is she now? She ran off after the accident.
not_available Maybe she was trying to avoid the local police or trying not to get brought backto LA.
not_available Dammit, George.
not_available You told me you would take care of this.
not_available You gave me your word.
not_available Please, please find my daughter.
not_available Jack, if it's any consolation, she is outside the projected blast radius.
not_available Just find her, George.
not_available What was that about? My daughter.
not_available Is she involved in this somehow? 
not_available No.
not_available She's in some kind of trouble, though.
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available I hope not.
not_available Yes, I'll tell him.
not_available The consensus at Justice is that the evidence against Stanton isn't actionable.
not_available How much more do they need? We've established a direct link between him and the mercenaries that shot down Bauer's plane.
not_available That connection is still circumstantial.
not_available He's been sabotaging our efforts to find the bomb all day.
not_available I cannot and I will not allow him to continue heading up NSA.
not_available I'm only saying it's going to take time to get a judge to issue a warrant.
not_available We don't have time, Mike.
not_available Then don't worry about a pretext.
not_available Take him out of play now and we'll deal with the legal ramifications tomorrow.
not_available Sherry was right.
not_available My own people working against me.
not_available Stanton won't be easy to break.
not_available Not in the time we have.
not_available We may need to expand the limits of howfar you've been willing to go in the past.
not_available What are you saying, Mike? Thatyou do whatever it takes to find out what Stanton knows about this bomb.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't disturb them right now.
not_available David only found out about Stanton because of me, and it makes no sense that he's keeping me out of the loop.
not_available I'm not sure whatyou think I can do about that.
not_available Why don'tyou just tell me what he's doing about Stanton? He hasn't let me in on ityet, so I don't know what's been decided.
not_available Can'tyou find out? Mrs Palmer, if the president wanted input from either of us, I'm sure he'd let us know.
not_available Lynne, you took credit for my work on David's speech, and that was OK, I was fine with that.
not_available But right now my only interest is to help David get through this day.
not_available I assume that's your priority as well? I'll see what I can do.
not_available Miss Warner.
not_available She stays with me.
not_available We're good to go.
not_available I've got 30 men ready to move on your order.
not_available How many people in the mosque? 
not_available 100 to 125, divided into target groups of 10.
not_available We're not going in, notyet.
not_available Sir? We go in hot and it'll give Syed Ali time to take his own life before Kate can identify him.
not_available What's the alternative? 
not_available We wait for the prayer service to end.
not_available He comes out, Kate identifies him, then we'll take him out surgically.
not_available Fast and alive.
not_available He's no good to us dead.
not_available What if someone spots us first? They phone Ali, we lose our surprise.
not_available Assuming he's even inside.
not_available We're working on a weak hunch.
not_available He might be at some other mosque.
not_available We're gonna have to take that chance.
not_available We're waiting this out.
not_available I could go in.
not_available See if he's inside.
not_available I'll wear a hijab, hide my face.
not_available He wouldn't see me.
not_available I don't feel comfortable putting you in that kind of a position.
not_available From whatyou've told me, we're all in a pretty bad position.
not_available If I could help, I'd really like the chance.
not_available You really think you can do this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Get me the schematics to the mosque.
not_available I'll look at the floor plan.
not_available Everything's in place, Mr President.
not_available Do it.
not_available Let's move.
not_available What's going on, Mike? Mr Stanton, by order of the president, I'm placing you under arrest for conspiracy to commit treason against the United States of America.
not_available What the hell are you talking about? Hands off.
not_available I demand to speakto the president.
not_available I'm sure you'll getyour chance, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come in.
not_available Sir, Mrs Palmer's been trying to reach you for the last half
not_available hour.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available She's on line seven waiting right now.
not_available I can put her off if you'd like.
not_available No, I'll take it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yes, Sherry.
not_available What is it? 
not_available David, thank God.
not_available I was just wondering whatyou'd decided to do about Roger.
not_available I'm having him questioned.
not_available Has he admitted to ordering Jack Bauer's plane shot down? Notyet.
not_available Then we don't know any more than we did an hour ago.
not_available What is your point, Sherry? My point is I think you should have waited for something more concrete.
not_available I don't run my decisions pastyou, Sherry, not any more.
not_available A large part of the intelligence you're basing your decisions on came from me.
not_available I think I've earned a seat at the table here.
not_available You're not a member of my staff.
not_available You're not a government employee.
not_available And you're not my wife.
not_available That was your decision, not mine.
not_available Sherry, whatever role you're playing here today is on my terms, my timetable.
not_available Continue doing whatyou're doing.
not_available I'll speakto you soon.
not_available But We need one person that we can coordinate with, not three.
not_available Yeah, we got that sorted out.
not_available You have him contact Jack Bauer.
not_available He's running point for us.
not_available Hey.
not_available FBI.
not_available They want a representative at the mosque, but they've got their wires crossed.
not_available Listen, what we were talking about before Yeah, I'm sorry.
not_available I shouldn't have putyou on the spot like that.
not_available No, actually, I'm glad you did.
not_available You are? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's been something hanging between us since you started here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, there has.
not_available I made a decision a while ago to try to keep personal and professional stuff separate.
not_available But now I Michelle Dessler.
not_available Tell Almeida Warner's getting agitated.
not_available OK, I'll tell him.
not_available There's a problem in room seven.
not_available Bob Warner? Yeah, he's getting violent.
not_available Getyour hands off of me! You can't keep me here! What's going on? 
not_available He asked for water.
not_available He bolted out the door.
not_available Why can't I see my lawyer? Sit him down.
not_available Calm down, Mr Warner! I won't calm down.
not_available I want someone to start listening to me.
not_available I need you to calm down! Whatever Reza told you, he's lying.
not_available You are not helping your case here.
not_available You understand me? You wanna have a conversation, or do you want me to lock you up for the night? Where are my daughters? Marie left here five minutes after Reza was taken to your office.
not_available What about Kate? What? Has something happened to Kate? She's with one of our agents.
not_available One of your agents? Why? You're gonna have to trust us, Mr Warner.
not_available She's gonna be fine, all right? Trust? This is where the men pray, in front, closest to the entrance.
not_available You walk by them as you pass through here down to the women's prayer area in the back.
not_available You've got one shot.
not_available Once you pass them, their backs'll be to you.
not_available Get a clean look at the whole room.
not_available If you spotAli, go past the women's prayer area here, up here to this fire
not_available exit door.
not_available We'll disable the alarm while you're inside.
not_available We'll be waiting for you in the alley.
not_available Are you clear? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are your men in place? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Kate, you sure about this? Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Take this.
not_available If Ali sees you, or you feel like you're in danger, press that.
not_available It'll send a distress signal to my walkie
not_available talkie and we'll be in immediately.
not_available Be careful.
not_available She's in.
not_available The prayers have already begun.
not_available I'm sorry I'm late.
not_available There was traffic.
not_available Have you prayed with us before? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's been a while, though.
not_available I've been away.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available You're all right.
not_available He's in there.
not_available Syed Ali.
not_available He's in there.
not_available Stanton's last call was to Virginia.
not_available He wasn't on long enough to get a complete number, but we know it's a Langley prefix.
not_available CIA.
not_available Sergeant.
not_available Sit down.
not_available We have it all, Roger.
not_available You reactivated OPCOM with an eyes
not_available only order.
not_available You used it to communicate with Colonel Samuels as recently as two hours ago.
not_available And we've connected Samuels directly to the mercenaries that tried to kill Jack Bauer.
not_available I don't know, Roger.
not_available It almost seems as if you wantthis bomb to go off today.
not_available But I'll tell you this: if people die, Roger, you'll be executed.
not_available And even if we find the bomb in time, you'll still get life without the possibility of parole.
not_available But all I want is to find the bomb in time.
not_available That's why I have a deal for you.
not_available You tell me everything I mean everything 
not_available and I'll bury this.
not_available You resign, due to health reasons.
not_available You'll collectyour pension.
not_available You'll retire in a nice house, somewhere in the country.
not_available You'll be given a written grant of immunity.
not_available And nobody will ever know anything about this.
not_available Do we have a deal? I don't know what you're talking about, Mr President.
not_available I've done nothing wrong.
not_available I don't know any more about the bomb than you do.
not_available I wantyou to cover these two back exits from the alley.
not_available We're looking for a Middle Eastern man, late 30s.
not_available Black shirt, silver buttons, black pants.
not_available Miss Warner and I will cover the main entrance.
not_available As soon as the crowd starts to leave the building, she'll identify Ali.
not_available I'll inform Agent Baker.
not_available He will give the go.
not_available No one moves before that happens.
not_available If you fire your weapon, shoot to wound only.
not_available We're looking at 19 minutes before the service is over.
not_available Is everybody clear? We cannot afford any mistakes here.
not_available OK.
not_available Let's go.
not_available There you are, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Control the focus with the centre dial here.
not_available Whatyou did for us in the mosque, I thought it was really courageous.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available I'm still shaking.
not_available You did great.
not_available The prayer service lets out in 17 minutes.
not_available You wanted to see me, sir? 
not_available Thanks for keeping this discreet.
not_available Of course.
not_available Ted, how long have you been with the Secret Service? Five and a half years, sir.
not_available I understand you have a background in Special Ops.
not_available Green Berets, sir.
not_available Unit seven out of Fort Myers, '87.
not_available Ever putyour training to use? 
not_available The Gulf, sir.
not_available Anywhere else? There were some other covert ops.
not_available Under the directorate at the CIA? It's all right, Ted.
not_available I'm not on a witch
not_available hunt here.
not_available But I do need you to answer the question.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available For the CIA.
not_available Good.
not_available You understand the gravity of today's situation? Of course, sir.
not_available I guess you've heard that Roger Stanton's no longer functioning as the head of NSA.
not_available I heard he was arrested.
not_available He was, under my authority.
not_available What I'm about to ask you to do falls outside the parameters of your Secret Service charge.
not_available You won't be able to tell anyone about this without my direct consent.
not_available Are you still with me, Ted? What would you like me to do, sir? Extract information from Roger Stanton.
not_available I see.
not_available If he resists, howfar am I permitted to go? Whatever you need to do.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Tony.
not_available Richards and Maccabee were shot.
not_available So was Reza Naiyeer.
not_available They're all dead.
not_available What? 
not_available A janitor found their bodies.
not_available I just got off the phone with the LAPD.
not_available Are there any suspects? Last time I talked to Maccabee, she said that Marie Warner had just got there.
not_available She wanted to talkto Reza.
not_available Marie Warner? She was there during the shootings? Security cameras show she was the only one to leave the building in the last 40 minutes.
not_available Bauer.
not_available It's Tony.
not_available How's it going over there? 
not_available We got about 10 minutes.
not_available Are you still with Kate Warner? 
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available I got some information, butyou need to keep this conversation one
not_available sided.
not_available Can you do that? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Richards and Maccabee have been shot and killed.
not_available So was Reza Naiyeer.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available We have strong evidence that Marie Warner was the shooter.
not_available Yeah, I understand.
not_available Has Kate Warner been contacted by anybody in the last half
not_available hour? No, she's been with me the entire time.
not_available Jack, I think you have to treat her as an unknown.
not_available For all we know, she's working with her sister.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Ali's men would've killed her if we hadn't shown up.
not_available If Kate's sister's part of this, or if she's one of the terrorists, I really don't think Kate knows about it.
not_available Jack, that's your call.
not_available I just wanted to give you the information.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Was thatyour office? Yeah.
not_available Are they still holding my dad? 
not_available Yes, your dad's safe.
not_available What about my sister? Is she OK? Has anyone heard from her? I don't think so.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Bill told me you're the guy in charge.
not_available I'm the foreman.
not_available I need a favour.
not_available I need to get something out of my boyfriend's locker.
not_available Your boyfriend? 
not_available Marko Ashami.
not_available You go out with Marko? 
not_available I did.
not_available We got into a fight last night.
not_available It's a long story, but the point of it is we're not going out any more.
not_available That why he didn't show up for worktoday? 
not_available I guess.
not_available It was a pretty bad fight.
not_available And he's got something in his locker that belongs to me.
not_available I can't go opening people's lockers.
not_available You'll have to work it out with Marko.
not_available I don't know how well you know Marko, but if I could've worked it out, I wouldn't be asking.
not_available Please.
not_available It's really important.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't.
not_available Can't or won't? I'd really show my appreciation.
not_available And I'd show it to you first.
not_available What do you mean? Is this your office? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Does it have a lock? Time is of the essence, Mr Stanton.
not_available Intensity and duration of the electrical current will increase substantially each time I repeat a question.
not_available Yes, I knowthe drill, Agent Simmons.
not_available What is your agenda, Mr Stanton, and who else is involved? Who else knew about the bomb, Mr Stanton? Who have you been working with? I don't know anything about the bomb.
not_available Who are you working with, Mr Stanton? Please, Mr Almeida, just tell me what is going on with my daughter Kate.
not_available I already told you, Mr Warner.
not_available She's fine.
not_available What is she doing with one of your agents? Reza Naiyeer is dead.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available We just found out.
not_available He and two of our agents were shot and killed atyour office.
not_available What about Marie? Is she OK? Please tell me Marie is OK.
not_available Look I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Mr Warner, but we believe Marie committed the murders.
not_available It's a trick.
not_available I know it's a trick.
not_available You're trying to trick me.
not_available Here they come.
not_available All teams, be alert.
not_available They're coming out now.
not_available Can you see him yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Is that him? It could be the one behind those three men.
not_available Just take your time, Kate.
not_available Be sure.
not_available I can't see his face.
not_available No, it's not him.
not_available I don't see him.
not_available I don't see him! Keep looking.
not_available He's gotta be in the crowd.
not_available There's the greeter.
not_available Normally he'd be the last one out.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Anything on the back exits? 
not_available Negative.
not_available No one's gone in or out.
not_available Dammit! Kate, you would tell me if you saw him, right? Of course I would.
not_available What do you mean? Why are you looking at me like that, as if I'm suspicious? I didn't see him! Just relax.
not_available He must have made you when you were inside the mosque.
not_available Agent Baker, he didn't come outside.
not_available Give the word to go.
not_available Secure the building.
not_available Open the gate.
not_available Go! Go! What's going on? 
not_available Federal agent.
not_available I've got a warrant.
not_available I am the imam here.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Calm down, sir.
not_available We're federal agents.
not_available We received positive identification of an international terrorist here.
not_available We need to find him now.
not_available Do you have a search warrant? Yes, I do, sir.
not_available Get back here.
not_available Keep her against the wall.
not_available Can you see anything? 
not_available Clear.
not_available Dammit! Put the blanket on him! The clothes match the description.
not_available Teams A and B maintain positions.
not_available We've gotAli.
not_available He's dead, Jack.
not_available Son of a bitch! Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available CTU.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Get Mason on the line.
not_available Ali has killed himself.
not_available I'm gonna have to get backto you.
not_available These clothes don't belong to this man.
not_available Look at the pants.
not_available They're three inches too short.
not_available Maintain secure exits.
not_available Ali is still in the building.
not_available Repeat: Ali is still in the building.
