
not_available Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.
not_available The recording of the phone call that you made between President Logan and Henderson is in a safety deposit box.
not_available Which bank? City Trust &amp; Savings in Agoura Hills.
not_available Jack knows there's no point in going public till he has that evidence in his hand.
not_available None of this should have happened.
not_available This whole thing was planned to make our country safer.
not_available and it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill David Palmer.
not_available We have to focus on stopping Bauer before he finds that recording.
not_available Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer.
not_available I want you to run point on this and I want you to make this CTU's top priority.
not_available Understood, sir.
not_available You know, if we really want to find Bauer, we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help, starting with Audrey Raines.
not_available Don't fill your father in on the particulars.
not_available Just set up the meeting.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording.
not_available I need to see you in person.
not_available Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles? All right, yes.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Jack, are you aware President Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest? The vice president's not the one who's behind this, is he? No.
not_available It's Logan.
not_available As soon as we have the evidence in hand, we're going to pass it off to Secretary of Defense Heller.
not_available It had to be done, sir.
not_available I decide what needs to be done, Mr.
not_available Henderson.
not_available I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.
not_available We have what we need.
not_available The instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building, you take him down.
not_available Kill the others and secure the recording.
not_available We got the evidence.
not_available Have you listened to it? Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan.
not_available We're talking about taking down the president of the United States.
not_available This checkpoint is just one Of many that have been in place for several hours now.
not_available Despite his announcement that Los Angeles is no longer under threat of attack, President Logan has ordered that martial law remain in effect.
not_available While the move has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil rights advocates, the president is defending his decision as a necessary precaution.
not_available He's citing the need 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's me.
not_available Is Bauer dead? Not yet, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You said your men had him.
not_available Bauer triggered the bank alarm.
not_available The authorities came before our men could get to him.
not_available Bauer used the cover Of the firefight to slip away.
not_available He has the recording? Yes, sir.
not_available That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death.
not_available Only if he gets it to someone who can do something about it.
not_available We'll have Bauer before that happens.
not_available How? Mr.
not_available President, you've established direct control over CTU, and CTU is heading up the search effort for Bauer.
not_available You're putting an awful lot Of faith in their ability.
not_available This city is locked down.
not_available CTU will find Bauer, and when they do, make sure you're the first to know so my men can intercept.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President? Karen Hayes at CTU.
not_available Put it through to my office.
not_available We're sifting satellite and Cal
not_available Trans video for Audrey Raines's vehicle.
not_available I've distributed her file photo to military checkpoints throughout the city.
not_available If she used her DOD Credentials at any of them, there should be a record.
not_available Well, I hope we're not wasting our resources on Raines when we don't even know she's helping Bauer.
not_available Karen, she dumped the tracker.
not_available There's a reason she doesn't want to be followed.
not_available Miss Hayes, the president's on line one.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Where are we, Ms.
not_available Hayes? Still running active manhunts on both Jack Bauer and Christopher Henderson.
not_available I told you to prioritize Bauer.
not_available I have, sir.
not_available I've allocated my resources accordingly.
not_available If David Palmer's killer is still at large when the morning news cycle begins, then all the success we've had handling these terrorists will be undermined.
not_available I will find Bauer, sir.
not_available You let me know the moment you do.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Bauer, right? Audrey Raines.
not_available She knows where he is, and those protocols aren't going to be enough to track her.
not_available You still think Chloe helped Audrey break surveillance? I'm sure of it.
not_available Remember, Audrey insisted Chloe be assigned to her.
not_available Then we need to confront Chloe.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available She'll just deny it.
not_available There's a way we can use her to find Bauer.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's him.
not_available Bill, over here.
not_available Jack.
not_available Bill Buchanan, Wayne Palmer.
not_available Sorry about your brother.
not_available What the hell's going on, Jack? The military authority, every law enforcement agency across this country 
not_available has a warrant for my arrest.
not_available What for? Killing David Palmer.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available We cleared you this morning.
not_available I'm being set up again, this time by President Logan.
not_available He was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.
not_available My God, you're serious.
not_available Logan's using the military to try and stop me from exposing him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, we have the evidence: a digital recording of a conversation made between President Logan and Christopher Henderson.
not_available I need to get the recording to Secretary Heller.
not_available He's gonna take it to the Attorney General, and they'll file for the warrant.
not_available But until then, Wayne's a target.
not_available I need you to take him somewhere safe.
not_available Of course I will.
not_available Where are you gonna meet Heller? 
not_available Van Nuys Airport.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, my father landed.
not_available Where are you? I just dropped Wayne Palmer off with Buchanan.
not_available I'm on my way to the airport now.
not_available All right, I'm on the north side Of the emergency runway at hangar 112.
not_available I'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available All right, hurry.
not_available Dad.
not_available Hi, sweetheart.
not_available Hi.
not_available Thank you so much for doing this.
not_available Well, I don't know what it is I'm doing, so don't thank me yet.
not_available These men in your security detail, do you trust them? With my life.
not_available Dad, I need to be sure	that they are loyal to you.
not_available What's going on? Dad, I will tell you, but only you.
not_available Stay here.
not_available You know I don't like to be kept in the dark.
not_available Tell me what this is all about.
not_available I promise, I will.
not_available I just need a minute.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? He's a fugitive.
not_available Every law enforcement agency in this state is looking for him.
not_available He's innocent.
not_available Then why don't you turn yourself in? Mr.
not_available Secretary, I swear to you, I had nothing to do with David Palmer's assassination.
not_available I'd like to believe you, Jack, but you're acting like a criminal.
not_available I don't have a choice; they're setting me up.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary, I only need you for a few minutes.
not_available I need to show you something, but privately, inside the building, please.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available It had to be done, sir.
not_available I decide what needs to be done, Mr.
not_available Henderson.
not_available I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.
not_available Palmer was nosing around.
not_available President Logan? And a man named Christopher Henderson.
not_available He'd have found out about your involvement.
not_available For God's sake, sir, he called your wife.
not_available I can handle my wife.
not_available Right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards.
not_available You're protected, sir.
not_available Every thread ends with Cummings.
not_available He thinks he's running this, and you need to keep playing it that way.
not_available I know my part, Mr.
not_available Henderson.
not_available You just do as you're told.
not_available President Logan supplied the terrorists with the Sentox nerve gas.
not_available What? His plan was to deploy the nerve gas en route to Moscow.
not_available That way, he could expose the terrorists and use them as an excuse to invoke the military terms of the agreement that he made earlier with Suvarov.
not_available This was all in an effort to gain control of the oil supply in Central Asia.
not_available David Palmer found out about it, and that's why they killed him.
not_available How do you know that recording hasn't been fabricated? I trust the source.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary, I promise you, this will stand up under scrutiny.
not_available I wish I could say I was surprised, but I'm not.
not_available I watched Charles Logan rise on the tide of his own ambition.
not_available I was terrified when he took the oath.
not_available Sir, I'm very sorry that I had to involve you, but I needed someone who had access to hand
not_available deliver this to the Attorney General.
not_available So you contacted me.
not_available You're the only one I could trust.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You need to go with your father.
not_available He'll need someone to corroborate the evidence to the Attorney General.
not_available What about you? I'm going to go dark until the Attorney General comes forward.
not_available I'll call Buchanan; I'll let him know what's happening.
not_available All right.
not_available Jack, everything's going to be okay now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go.
not_available Jack, one more thing.
not_available What, sir? Dad, what are you doing?! 
not_available Secure my daughter.
not_available You're playing a dangerous game here, Jack, and you're playing it wrong.
not_available Turning Logan's crime into a public spectacle will not bring back David Palmer.
not_available It'll tear this nation apart.
not_available You're not only destroying the president, you'll be destroying the presidency.
not_available The collateral damage of the truth will cripple this nation.
not_available So what are you going to do? Bury the evidence? No.
not_available You're coming with me, Audrey, and we'll use the evidence to get Logan to step down quietly.
not_available Once he's gone, we'll have a chance to set things right again.
not_available Doug, I'm trusting you to keep this item safe.
not_available She's coming with me.
not_available Dad, I can't.
not_available Then secure them both until you hear from me.
not_available Dad, please, no! Mr.
not_available Secretary, you can't make a deal with him! You can't trust him! Excuse me, do you know what's going on in the Situation Room? 
not_available It's some sort of briefing.
not_available No one told me.
not_available It's a Class 3.
not_available That's all I know.
not_available I'm a department head.
not_available I should be in all Class 3s.
not_available It's all I know.
not_available Shari, what was that briefing about? Just a protocol review.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Why not? 
not_available 'Cause you're a bad liar.
not_available Miles just gave me a load of work to do in the Archives Room so that I miss the briefing.
not_available Do you ever think there might be a reason he kept you out? He thinks I helped Audrey break her surveillance.
not_available Is that what it was about? I've already said too much.
not_available Please don't ask me any more questions.
not_available Come on, Shari, you owe me.
not_available I stuck my neck out for you with Miles.
not_available Tell me what happened in there.
not_available Miles found Audrey.
not_available He activated a transponder on her car.
not_available So they know where she is? We're running an operational support right now.
not_available That's what the briefing was about.
not_available They sent a TAC team ten minutes ago.
not_available Please don't tell anyone I said anything.
not_available Here she comes.
not_available Damn, she's good.
not_available She set up a proprietary com channel.
not_available How long will it take to track her call? Not long.
not_available Pick up.
not_available Somewhere in the Valley.
not_available Looks like a pay phone.
not_available I've got the receiving end narrowed down to a one
not_available mile radius.
not_available Why isn't Audrey picking up? Narrowing 
not_available Got it.
not_available Where? Van Nuys Airport the emergency runway adjacent to the main field.
not_available Move the TAC team out now.
not_available Van Nuys Airport.
not_available Miles is forwarding the coordinates.
not_available Yes Ma'am.
not_available Get me the president.
not_available You said they sent the TAC team ten minutes ago.
not_available Miles set me up, and you helped.
not_available You're working against us, Chloe.
not_available You have no idea what you've done.
not_available Miles said that 
not_available Miles is an idiot.
not_available If anyone should know that, it should be you.
not_available I can't believe you went along with him.
not_available Please come with us, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Where are we going? Let's go.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I need to remind you that we still don't have confirmation that Audrey Raines and Bauer are at the location.
not_available You'll find out soon enough.
not_available I'll have the military authority follow up on it.
not_available The military? Sir, I just dispatched my TAC team.
not_available Call them back.
not_available I don't understand Jack Bauer is a very sensitive problem.
not_available There are political ramifications.
not_available I've decided to handle him directly.
not_available And besides, you must have your hands full, transitioning CTU to Homeland Security.
not_available I'll recall my team, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Now the president wants oversight on the Bauer operation.
not_available He's the president.
not_available He can do what he wants.
not_available Yeah.
not_available CTU thinks they found Bauer.
not_available Where? Jack, what if my father's right? What if he can get Logan to step down quietly? Maybe that is the best thing for this country.
not_available These people brokered chemical weapons to terrorists.
not_available They've killed an ex
not_available president Of the United States.
not_available Logan's not going to make a deal with your father, and even if he did, he wouldn't keep it.
not_available Henderson wouldn't let him.
not_available The only thing your father's doing right now is making himself a target.
not_available You want to help him? Help me get the recording back before he speaks to Logan.
not_available Look, Mike, this isn't me being territorial, but if the president wants Jack Bauer, why doesn't he let us take care of it? Now, look, I've been on other things.
not_available Let me find out what's going on.
not_available I'll get back to you, Karen.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available Will be lifted within the next two hours, but the curfew will remain in effect Come in.
not_available That's only six hours from now.
not_available Okay.
not_available David Palmer's body's being flown back to DC at 7:00 a.m.
not_available The president and I both want to be there when the coffin's put onto the plane.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's up, Mike? I just got a call from Karen Hayes at CTU.
not_available Do you know about the president's decision to pull them off the acquisition of Jack Bauer? No, but what's the problem? The problem is it doesn't really make sense.
not_available Karen's teams are closer.
not_available They can do it more efficiently.
not_available Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them than with a group of military police he doesn't know.
not_available Well, Karen and her team have barely gotten CTU back on its feet.
not_available I'm sure the president just feels more confident with the military units already in place because of martial law.
not_available Well, the military has its hands full, Hal.
not_available What do you want me to say, Mike? It's the president's call.
not_available I can see it both ways.
not_available Yeah? D.O.D.
not_available Operations.
not_available Beth, it's Mike Novick.
not_available Put me through to General Warren, please.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This is Warren.
not_available Sir, I have Mike Novick on the line for you.
not_available Go ahead, Beth.
not_available You're connected.
not_available What is it, Mike? General, can you give me an update on your search for Jack Bauer? What are you talking about? The one the president ordered.
not_available We never received such a call from the president.
not_available I see.
not_available I
not_available I'm sorry to disturb you, General.
not_available Yes, Sir.
not_available You should try to get some rest, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available I should try to get some rest.
not_available What is it you want, Mike? I just got off the phone with General Warren, who's running military operations here in Los Angeles.
not_available Why would you be talking with him? Karen Hayes over at Homeland raised a few good points I thought I'd follow up on.
not_available What good points, Mike? She doesn't understand why she was taken out of the loop on this Jack Bauer situation.
not_available You know, I really don't care what Karen Hayes understands.
not_available She should be doing her job and not bothering my advisors, asking questions	hat diminish my authority.
not_available Be that as it may, I did follow up, and, uh, now, frankly, I'm a little mystified by some things.
not_available What things mystify you, Mike? Well, you told Homeland that you wanted the military to pick up Jack Bauer, but I just spoke with General Warren, and he's unaware of any such directive.
not_available Because I didn't go through General Warren.
not_available May I ask who you did go through? Mike, let's get one thing straight: I don't answer to you.
not_available Of course not, sir.
not_available However, I will tell you this: I have decided to use a covert task force to bring in Jack Bauer.
not_available The reason I'm doing that is because Bauer presents special circumstances.
not_available Special circumstances? I want this completely off the radar, Mike.
not_available The Chinese government may still believe that Jack Bauer is dead.
not_available If they find out that he's alive, they're going to blame us.
not_available They're going to, uh, accuse us of fabricating the story of his death.
not_available Wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller if we let Karen handle this? Her people already know about Bauer.
not_available They're working under a secretive mandate.
not_available You know what, Mike? I am tired of being second
not_available guessed.
not_available I've been dealing withwithwith wallto
not_available wall crises for the last 18 hours, and I think I've done a pretty damn good job of leading the country.
not_available Of course, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You came in here suggesting that I should get some rest.
not_available That's the one recommendation Of yours that I intend to take.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available We've traced the call, to a public phone at Van Nuys Airport.
not_available If Audrey Raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble.
not_available Miles, this situation is more complicated than you think.
not_available You have no idea what this is about.
not_available But you do.
not_available Yes.
not_available Then why didn't you tell me? Because I can't.
not_available You think the rules don't apply to you because you're smarter than the rest of us, but I have news for you.
not_available They do, and you're not.
not_available I won't miss you when you're gone.
not_available Miles.
not_available Don't touch me.
not_available What? Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.
not_available He's a Federal fugitive wanted for the murder of a former president, which means you're going to jail, O'Brian.
not_available For a long time.
not_available Miles.
not_available I don't think you're as big Of a jerk as you pretend to be.
not_available I need to speak to you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What are you doing, Chloe? You're supposed to be in custody.
not_available Miles let me out.
not_available You're a worse liar than I am.
not_available Shari, don't do that.
not_available You helped Audrey Raines break surveillance.
not_available Yes, I did it for a good reason.
not_available I can't get into it right now.
not_available Well, I don't really think you have a choice.
not_available Listen to me for a minute.
not_available Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.
not_available He knows who did it.
not_available He may need my help to prove it and I can't help him if I'm in custody.
not_available Then why don't you just tell Karen? Because she won't believe me.
not_available Nobody will, not without evidence.
not_available It's President Logan.
not_available What are you talking about? The evidence Jack is trying to get implicates Logan in the assassination of Palmer.
not_available That's ridiculous, Chloe.
not_available You know your sexual harassment charges against Miles? I know you were lying.
not_available You're sick and you need help, and if you try to stop me and it turns out I'm right about Jack, and I am, I will recommend you for a psychiatric evaluation.
not_available And you won't like that, trust me.
not_available You coming to bed soon? I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight.
not_available You should try.
not_available You okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available It's just It's been a challenging day.
not_available Come to bed.
not_available I will.
not_available Soon.
not_available I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr.
not_available President, but Secretary Heller is on the line.
not_available He insists on talking to you.
not_available Tell him I'll call him back tomorrow.
not_available He says it's urgent, sir.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Yes, James.
not_available Thanks for taking my call, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You said it was urgent.
not_available I need to see you, sir.
not_available See me about what? I'd rather speak to you in person.
not_available Fine, but I won't be back to Washington for a couple of days, so I'm in L.A., sir.
not_available I need to see you tonight.
not_available Tonight? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What is this about? I'll be there shortly and we can discuss it then.
not_available I don't like your tone, James.
not_available In case you've forgotten, you're addressing the President of the United States.
not_available I know who I'm addressing.
not_available And I think you know exactly what this is about.
not_available When will you be here? Five minutes.
not_available Fine.
not_available James Heller? What does he want? He's getting flak from the Joint Chiefs about my decision to maintain martial law.
not_available You would think that these people would show some allegiance.
not_available Can't James handle it himself? Apparently not.
not_available Come to bed when you're done.
not_available I will.
not_available Where are you? We're leaving now.
not_available How long will it take you to get there? Ten minutes.
not_available We may not have that much time.
not_available James Heller is on his way here.
not_available He insisted on seeing me right away.
not_available Jack got to him.
not_available What if Bauer's given him the recording? Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with him, and without it, whatever he knows or whatever he thinks he knows won't matter.
not_available You think Bauer still has it? 
not_available I'm sure of it.
not_available I'll hold Heller off as long as I can, but you phone me the second you have the evidence in hand.
not_available Right.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available What is Secretary Heller doing here? I don't know, ma'am.
not_available But you have an idea.
not_available My husband says it's about his order to maintain martial law, but I think it's something else.
not_available If you know what it is, will you please tell me? I can't.
not_available You can't? Or you won't? Please don't ask me anything more, Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available Whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us.
not_available I promise you.
not_available You can trust me.
not_available You know that.
not_available Not here.
not_available Just meet me in a couple of minutes.
not_available Where? Outside the south stable.
not_available James.
not_available Thank you, gentlemen.
not_available I hope this was important.
not_available I know what you did.
not_available I know what you're doing.
not_available And I'm here to put an end to it.
not_available You have to be a little more specific.
not_available You are responsible for the murder of David Palmer.
not_available That's outrageous.
not_available I heard a recording, a conversation between you and man named Christopher Henderson.
not_available When Palmer found out about your insane plan, Henderson had him killed.
not_available And you let it happen.
not_available Where is this recording? 
not_available It's in a safe place.
not_available I would like to hear it.
not_available Why? You know exactly what you said, and so do I.
not_available It's burnt into my memory.
not_available How dare you stand there and judge me? You have no idea.
not_available Until you sit in my chair, you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
not_available Your chair is not a throne, Charles.
not_available I'm protecting the interests Of our country.
not_available You mean oil.
not_available Yes.
not_available This country needs energy more than you or anybody in this gridlocked government cares to admit.
not_available We'll see how you judge me when the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel and the people who put me in office can't afford to heat their homes or run their cars.
not_available And you think that justifies the blood on your hands? What do you want? I want you to drop the trumped
not_available up charges against Jack Bauer.
not_available And leave my daughter alone.
not_available Anything else? Announce your resignation by tomorrow morning.
not_available Blame it on the crushing stress Of today's events, or blame it on whatever you want, just as long as you go public by the start of the morning news cycle.
not_available And then what? The recording will be kept under lock and key, and this will remain between us.
not_available Call in Vice President Gardner.
not_available I want to be here when you hand him your letter of resignation.
not_available Get in here.
not_available I can't contact Jack or Audrey.
not_available I haven't talked to them either.
not_available CTU might have them in custody.
not_available I need to tap into their current protocols.
not_available Where's your workstation? 
not_available Homeland changed my access code.
not_available I can create a workaround.
not_available If CTU has Jack, it's all my fault.
not_available I can get us out of here.
not_available Watch the door.
not_available He's got restraints in his pocket.
not_available Secure him.
not_available Wexler, status report.
not_available Mark, come in.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Slowly put the gun on the ground and kick it towards me.
not_available Do it! Put your hands where I can see them.
not_available Give me the recording.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Stand up.
not_available What did you do to my partner? 
not_available He's fine.
not_available Son of a bitch! Take cover behind the wheel! Now! Move! What the hell's going on?! 
not_available They've come for the recording! If you and I are gonna get through this alive, we need to work together.
not_available Give me my gun! I have her, Jack.
not_available Now don't make me kill her.
not_available There's been too much killing today already, so just throw out that recording.
not_available Let her go, Christopher.
not_available After I have the recording.
not_available Why are you doing this? Why are you protecting Logan? I'm protecting something much more important than Charles Logan.
not_available What? The integrity of our government.
not_available Our government has no integrity.
not_available Not when someone like Charles Logan occupies the Presidency.
not_available Christopher, you can make this right.
not_available You can help me stop him.
not_available Sorry, Jack.
not_available Now throw me the recording.
not_available I'll give you the recording if you let Audrey go.
not_available I wish I could believe that.
not_available I give you my word.

not_available Here she comes, Jack.
not_available Just walk out slow, or I'll kill you.

not_available Raines.
not_available What have you done to her? The left brachial artery.
not_available She has about three minutes before she bleeds to death.
not_available Now throw me that recording.
not_available Jack, don't.
not_available She's 15 seconds closer to dying, Jack.
not_available Give me the recording.
not_available Jack, don't do it.
not_available She's running out of time.
not_available Don't do it, Jack.

not_available Give me your arm.
not_available I need to move you.
not_available Come on.
not_available All it needs is your signature, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available James, we can find another way to handle this.
not_available There must be something I can give you, something that you want.
not_available You're giving me exactly what I want.
not_available You asked to see me, Mr.

not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have the recording.
not_available Really? I'll call you back after I've secured a vehicle.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his resignation.
not_available I wanted you here as a witness.
not_available What?! He came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks.
not_available I don't know how he can make such an accusation without any evidence.
not_available He orchestrated a conspiracy to let terrorists acquire stolen nerve gas.
not_available That's insane, James.
not_available He sanctioned the assassination Of David Palmer! And I have the evidence.
not_available Where? Show it to us.
not_available Who was on the phone? who made that call? I want your resignation on my desk by the morning.
not_available If any harm comes to my daughter 
not_available Gentlemen! Please escort Secretary Heller out of my home.
