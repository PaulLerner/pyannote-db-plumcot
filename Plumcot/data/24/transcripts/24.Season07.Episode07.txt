not_available Previously on 24.
not_available That was Bob Cornell at N.S.A.
not_available They've detected another firewall breach.
not_available There's been another attack? Not yet, but they believe the C.I.P.
not_available Device is being utilized.
not_available We have to assume Dubaku is initiating another attack.
not_available Madam President? 
not_available What is it, Tim? I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.
not_available It's from Colonel Dubaku.
not_available He's demanding to speak with you.
not_available The deadline for your forces to begin their withdrawal has passed.
not_available Go to the window.
not_available See what you have done.
not_available Comply with my demands within the hour, or 10,000 more Americans will die.
not_available She's on her way up.
not_available I'll call you when it's done.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor, are you okay? 
not_available Audio forensics cleaned up the recording.
not_available Walker is extraneous.
not_available Kill her before you get here.
not_available Larry, I don't think it's worth it.
not_available There's nothing here.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available HelpJanis coordinate with N.S.A.
not_available I'm sorry about Renee.
not_available She was a good agent.
not_available We don't know that she's dead yet! I've devoted my life to the Bureau and you just expect me to believe that the entire government's been corrupted? Not all of'em.
not_available But until we find out who, we can't trust anyone.
not_available The four of you really think you can stop this? We have to.
not_available It's as simple as that.
not_available Dubaku wants you and your wife.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available You are asking us to risk our lives 
not_available to be delivered into Dubaku's hands.
not_available Listen to him, Ule.
not_available But how can we trust this man? Because he has no reason to lie.
not_available How you doin', Tony? 
not_available All right.
not_available Where's Emerson? 
not_available He's dead.
not_available You want Matobo or not? You got what you came for.
not_available Now get the hell out of here.
not_available Did everything go smoothly? 
not_available We have the Matobos.
not_available That's what matters.
not_available I heard about the planes on the radio.
not_available The White House still has not complied.
not_available What do you intend to do? 
not_available Exactly what we promised.
not_available We're ready, sir.
not_available Where is the target located? 
not_available Kidron, Ohio.
not_available Population? 
not_available 30,000.
not_available Casualties will be high.
not_available Begin.
not_available The following takes place between 2:00 p.m.
not_available And 3:00 p.m.
not_available Larry.
not_available We think this is the truck the Matobos were abducted in.
not_available Where was this image taken? 
not_available Near Northwoods Airfield.
not_available Were you able to track it? 
not_available Not beyond this sector.
not_available But they were heading east on McKinley Avenue.
not_available All right.
not_available Make sure the vehicle I.D.
not_available Is disseminated to all search teams and local agencies.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Larry.
not_available I think I found something.
not_available I've been working N.S.A., trying to backtrace the C.I.P.
not_available Attack that took down the two planes and I found a code fragment which I think could be residue from the C.I.P.
not_available Intrusion.
not_available I'm running a pattern match right now.
not_available With any luck at all we may be able to anticipate where in the infrastructure they're targeting next.
not_available And I need Sean.
not_available Janis, I don't wanna waste personnel on a wild goose chase.
not_available Dubaku's threatened to kill 10,000 more Americans in the next 30 minutes.
not_available I understand that, and I will drop it the minute it feels cold.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm gonna brief the White House.
not_available Keep me in the loop.
not_available Sean.
not_available Are you sure he's up to running this operation? 
not_available Larry's fine.
not_available Is he? You're the one who told me about him and Renee.
not_available This has gotta be hitting him pretty hard.
not_available If I don't think Larry can do his job, I'll let you know, all right? In the meantime, I need you to open up a fresh socket.
not_available You've reached Agent Brian Gedge.
not_available Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you.
not_available Agent Gedge, I expected to hear from you by now.
not_available It's urgent that I speak with the first gentleman as soon as possible.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin? Call me back, Agent Gedge.
not_available This is extremely important.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Larry Moss with the F.B.I.
not_available Where are we, Larry? We've I.D.'d a vehicle that we believe was used in the Matobos' abduction.
not_available We're still tryin'to track it down.
not_available How long is that going to take? 
not_available Wish I could tell you, sir.
not_available I don't have a time frame.
not_available That's not good enough, Larry.
not_available Unless you get some results, we're gonna get hit again.
not_available A lot of people are gonna die if you don't find Dubaku.
not_available With all respect, sir, I don't need to be told what's at stake.
not_available We're giving everything we can.
not_available One of our agents has given her life.
not_available Yes, l
not_available I was told about that.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'll call you the minute we have something.
not_available We'll be waiting.
not_available The Matobos have been taken into a building.
not_available 546 Adams.
not_available Okay, pull up the stats on that address.
not_available On it.
not_available It's the Ritter Building.
not_available Four stories high.
not_available The building is two years old.
not_available Give me the security specs.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available We're comin'up on it.
not_available I'm gonna need your help.
not_available I see you've chosen a target.
not_available The Boyd Chemical plant near Kidron, Ohio.
not_available The C.I.P.
not_available Device has enabled us to take control of the main tank.
not_available We're about to cause the primary safety valves to fail.
not_available Do you remember the last time we saw each other, Ule? 
not_available It was at a state dinner in your residence.
not_available We shared an excellent bottle of wine.
not_available I offered my hand in friendship, and you slapped it away.
not_available You gave me an ultimatum
not_available to be the puppet for your military.
not_available You could have had a long and prosperous career as prime minister.
not_available But now you're going back to Sangala as a traitor to your people.
not_available I am prime minister.
not_available I was elected by the people.
not_available It's you and Juma who are the traitors.
not_available No.
not_available We brought order to Sangala.
not_available But you are trying to destroy everything that we have built.
not_available You will be taken back to Sangala, Ule.
not_available And you will give GeneralJuma the names of all your fellow traitors.
not_available I will never do that.
not_available Never.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Believe me, you will.
not_available Take them.
not_available Any response from the president? Not yet.
not_available But when she sees dead Americans lying in the street, she will be less stubborn.
not_available I'm inside, Jack, approaching the front desk.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Are the Matobos still on the third floor? Affirmative, Jack.
not_available They're being moved.
not_available I'm just not sure where yet.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Good afternoon.
not_available I'm Agent Walker with the F.B.I.
not_available I don't have an appointment, but I'm here to see Mr.
not_available Roane of Roane and Associates.
not_available I'll let them know you're here.
not_available Actually, I don't want to be announced.
not_available I'm here on official business.
not_available All right.
not_available So as far as you're concerned, I was never here.
not_available Understand? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Past security.
not_available Heading towards the elevator.
not_available We're on our way to the service entrance.
not_available Chloe, I'm on the third floor.
not_available Law firm is on your left.
not_available On your right is a suite of offices 
not_available where Matobo's being held.
not_available I see it.
not_available Stairwell's down the hallway to your left.
not_available Agent Walker, we're at the door.
not_available There's one guard outside the suite, probably armed.
not_available Bill, take the third floor.
not_available Wait for my signal.
not_available Go on.
not_available Chloe, we're on the fourth floor in what used to be the computer room.
not_available What now? In the center of the room, there are two removable panels.
not_available They should give you access to the crawl space.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Okay, we're clear.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're in.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I should never have allowed you to come with me.
not_available It was a mistake.
not_available It was not your decision, Ule.
not_available We will be all right.
not_available Jack Bauer will be here soon.
not_available Okay, we're at the heating unit.
not_available Okay, Jack, there's an air duct leading off that unit.
not_available Do you see it? Yeah.
not_available Follow that for about 30 yards until you see an electrical junction.
not_available Make a left, then another 20 yards, you'll come to the vent.
not_available This will give you a view of the entire floor.
not_available And the Matobos? They've been moved into an adjacent room just off the main area.
not_available Okay, copy that.
not_available Come on.
not_available The entire N.S.A.
not_available Has been combing the firewall searching for the next C.I.P.
not_available Device breach.
not_available If this were something, don't you think they'd already know about it? 
not_available I can live without your negativity today, Sean.
not_available There it is again
not_available that same code fragment.
not_available Kidron, Ohio.
not_available What's in Kidron, Ohio? Any sensitive installation? Something Dubaku might want to hit? I don't know.
not_available Homeland has a high
not_available value target database.
not_available I'm cross
not_available checking it now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nothing in Kidron itself.
not_available But in the neighboring county, there's
not_available Boyd Chemical.
not_available What do they make? Insecticide.
not_available Please get me that number.
not_available Hello? This is Janis Gold at F.B.I.
not_available I need to speak to your plant manager immediately, please.
not_available Ma'am, as I just stated, I'm with the F.B.I.
not_available Does that sound vaguely important to you? Now connect me toJohn Brunner.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Yeah, put her on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available This is John Brunner.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Brunner.
not_available This is Janis Gold, F.B.I., D.C.
not_available Bureau.
not_available What can I do for you? We've been tracking some possible breaches in the government firewall.
not_available The firewall's designed to protect installations like yours.
not_available I know what it does, honey.
not_available Um
not_available We have tracked and isolated one of these breaches in the Kidron area.
not_available I need to know, are you experiencing any problems right now? 
not_available As a matter of fact, we're dealing with one right now.
not_available What is it? Three of our safety valves just failed on the primary storage tank.
not_available We're having trouble resetting them.
not_available What's in the tank? Methyl isocyanate.
not_available It's a concentrated insecticide, highly toxic.
not_available Hey, what the hell is this all about? Mr.
not_available Brunner, I have reason to believe that this is a terrorist attack on your facility.
not_available A terrorist attack? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I need you to initiate on
not_available site emergency procedures and stay on this line.
not_available Shut down the tank.
not_available What's goin' on? 
not_available Do it.
not_available Do it.
not_available My authority.
not_available Damn.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's not responding.
not_available What do you mean? Try it again.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Pressure in the primary tank is rising.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brunner? We cannot shut down the primary tank, and the pressure is building.
not_available If we cannot stop this, we are looking at atmospheric release.
not_available Okay.
not_available Get Larry.
not_available Dubaku has targeted that facility.
not_available We need to alert the president.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brunner, you need to begin evacuating people right now.
not_available All right, Agent Moss.
not_available Keep me apprised.
not_available I'll speak to the president.
not_available I just received an interagency alert.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Just discovered Dubaku's next target.
not_available A chemical plant, yeah.
not_available I just got off the phone with Larry Moss.
not_available I need to brief the president.
not_available Has the first gentleman spoken with the president? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available I talked to Agent Gedge 40 minutes ago.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor is the only person who can talk the president into withdrawing our troops in Sangala and that is our best way to prevent this attack.
not_available I know we need him.
not_available I'm waiting for a callback.
not_available The middle section's still bothering me.
not_available Read it again.
not_available "Colonel Dubaku and theJuma regime "have killed countless thousands of their own people "and now hundreds of our fellow citizens.
not_available They deserve your prayers and your outrage." I think the word "outrage" might be too strong if you're trying to convey calm authority.
not_available Outrage is the only word to describe how I'm feeling and how every person in this country will be feeling.
not_available The American people deserve the truth.
not_available Dubaku's already killed 300 Americans.
not_available God knows what else he has planned.
not_available Come in.
not_available Could you excuse us, Angela? 
not_available What is it? The F.B.I.
not_available Believes they've detected where the next attack will take place.
not_available Dubaku's infiltrated a chemical plant just outside of Kidron, Ohio.
not_available He's causing pressure on the facility's primary tank to go critical.
not_available If the tank erupts, over 3,000 gallons of methyl isocyanate will be released into the atmosphere.
not_available Given prevailing winds a very large, very toxic cloud will sweep into town.
not_available Methyl isocyanate is a concentrated insecticide.
not_available Even brief exposure causes severe lung damage and chemical burns of the skin.
not_available What's our time frame? 
not_available The tank could rupture in less than 15 minutes.
not_available They've begun evacuating? We've already contacted emergency responders on the ground in Kidron.
not_available There's just not enough time to get everyone out.
not_available Kidron's population's just over 30,000.
not_available This projection says that we could lose over 50%? 
not_available Oh, dear Lord.
not_available Right now, our only chance of stopping this is finding Dubaku and the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Quietly.
not_available Jack, I just intercepted an F.B.I.
not_available Alert identifying Dubaku's next target
not_available a chemical plant near Kidron, Ohio.
not_available Twelve minutes from going critical.
not_available There are 30,000 people in that town, Jack.
not_available We have to hurry.
not_available We're moving as fast as we can.
not_available Get me the scope out of the bag.
not_available Everything looks good, sir.
not_available Would you like to see this? 
not_available I'm turning the scope over to night vision.
not_available I don't see Dubaku.
not_available I've got Nichols.
not_available Three men with automatic weapons.
not_available Three more over at the control station, most likely armed.
not_available Copy that.
not_available That's Dubaku.
not_available We got Dubaku.
not_available Chloe, are you seeing this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The control station looks like an SDART.
not_available It's a really powerful processor.
not_available It could be driving the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available Copy.
not_available N.S.A.
not_available Classified infrastructure team 
not_available is trying to plug the firewall breach.
not_available Any luck so far? None so far, but they're staying on it.
not_available They have less than 10 minutes.
not_available They're aware of that, sir.
not_available They're doin' what they can.
not_available Sir
not_available Not now.
not_available What's going on at the plant? I'm on with them now.
not_available Okay.
not_available John, did you try flashing the memory cards? 
not_available Three times, honey.
not_available We are not in control of the computer system.
not_available I've already told my people to get the hell out of here.
not_available Normally, I don't allow people to call me "honey," but we can discuss that later.
not_available Yeah, well, it sounds like you need to lighten up.
not_available Closed out, sir.
not_available I'm heading to the primary tank room.
not_available I'm gonna try to manually release some of the pressure.
not_available That's not gonna stop it.
not_available No.
not_available But it might buy us a few more minutes so people can evacuate.
not_available I got a thousand workers at this facility 
not_available and I am responsible for their safety.
not_available I need you to stay on the phone.
not_available I'm gonna need some help.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available What can I do? I don't have access to the override schematics.
not_available See if you can pull up the operating procedures to tank one.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available I got it.
not_available I got it right here.
not_available All right.
not_available Now look for the emergency valve release sequence.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh, valve release.
not_available I have it right here.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Now, what I need you to do is
not_available This
not_available Wait.
not_available This procedure is going to release the chemical right into the primary tank room where you are right now.
not_available I know that.
not_available I have respiratory gear on.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available Just give me the sequence.
not_available How long will that protect you? Don't worry about it, honey.
not_available Uh, okay.
not_available Are you looking at the routing board? I am.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Set the bus switches to this sequence from left to right.
not_available TwoTwoeighteightsevensevenfourfour
not_available three.
not_available Three.
not_available Done.
not_available The secondary flow valve should be behind you and to your right.
not_available I need you to turn that clockwise, please.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available L
not_available I got it! Okay.
not_available That's one valve down, three more to go.
not_available Pressure inside the tank is approaching 400 P.S.I.
not_available How long before the tank ruptures? 
not_available Seven minutes.
not_available We got a problem.
not_available What is it? An alert.
not_available This is our hidden surveillance camera on the roof.
not_available Almeida and Bauer.
not_available When was this taken? 
not_available Twenty minutes ago.
not_available I thought you killed Almeida and Bauer.
not_available Damn it! You said this location was kept secret from everyone! 
not_available It was.
not_available Then what are they doing here? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available How did they find us? 
not_available I don't know! 
not_available Disengage the C.I.P.
not_available Module.
not_available Begin the off
not_available load.
not_available What are you doing? We're almost there.
not_available We will continue this attack from another location.
not_available Let's finish this.
not_available We can handle them.
not_available We need to get out of here now.
not_available C.I.P.
not_available Module's disengaged.
not_available Starting off
not_available load.
not_available Hey, what the hell is that? What the hell is that? What's the matter? The firewall breach.
not_available Just closed.
not_available What? What are you talkin'about? No C.I.P.
not_available Intrusion.
not_available The firewall is secure.
not_available How? N.S.A.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Bring the C.I.P.
not_available Module.
not_available Get Matobo and his wife! Bill, we should go with the second option on the assault.
not_available Two
not_available prong attack.
not_available You and Tony come through the main entrance.
not_available We'll go in from here.
not_available Copy.
not_available Get me the C
not_available 4 out of the pack.
not_available Move.
not_available Move! 
not_available Get the C.I.P.
not_available Device! Clear! All clear over here! Do you have Dubaku? 
not_available Negative! Jack, I've got the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available It's been destroyed.
not_available Jack, it's Renee.
not_available The Matobos are safe.
not_available I'm taking them to the van.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I want you and Bill to do a sweep.
not_available See if you can find Dubaku.
not_available I'll cover the south side.
not_available John? John, are you still there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available The terrorists are out of the system.
not_available Please tell me what is happening right now.
not_available Automatic shutdown mode has kicked in.
not_available Pressure's dropping.
not_available I think we're gonna be all right.
not_available Okay, that's great.
not_available Now, you
not_available you've gotta get out of there right now.
not_available John? I can't make the door.
not_available I'm sending a rescue team.
not_available A rescue team is on its way, John.
not_available Please, stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Come on.
not_available Outside, everybody.
not_available Up there.
not_available See? Have they found Dubaku? 
not_available Still searching.
not_available First responders are five minutes away, Jack.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Get up.
not_available I said, get up! 
not_available They're coming.
not_available Please don't make me do this.
not_available I will go to your home, Michael.
not_available I will make your wife watch as I kill your daughter.
not_available Then I will kill her.
not_available So do as I ask.
not_available Save your family.
not_available Let me see your hands! 
not_available It's Latham.
not_available Where's Dubaku? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Cover! 
not_available Tony! Bill! You all right? Jack? Jack? Jack, can you hear me? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available We're okay.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Latham was wired with explosives.
not_available We still don't have Dubaku.
not_available What? The C.I.P.
not_available Device has been destroyed.
not_available I want you to stay with the Matobos.
not_available Make sure they're safe.
not_available Jack, the police are almost here.
not_available If you get arrested, this entire operation goes out the window.
not_available You have to get out of there.
not_available Copy that.
not_available He's gone.
not_available We need to get back to the safe house.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Sean, this says both N.S.A.
not_available And Homeland have no idea why the breach at the Kidron plant was stopped.
not_available They're still looking.
not_available We're working on it here also.
not_available Janis is coordinating with the digital forensics team that she sent over to the plant.
not_available This doesn't make any sense.
not_available Why
not_available Why would Dubaku suddenly stop an attack when he was minutes away from causing mass casualties? Maybe there was a malfunction in the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available No, no.
not_available I don't want maybes, all right? I want answers.
not_available We're doing everything we can.
not_available That's not good enough right now, is it? I don't know what else to tell you, sir.
not_available I know you're upset about Renee but getting angry at me's not gonna make it go any faster.
not_available If you think I'm yelling at you because of my history with Agent Walker, you are mistaken.
not_available There are thousands of lives at stake here.
not_available That's what concerns me.
not_available Sorry, sir.
not_available I want you and Janis to work with N.S.A.
not_available Find out where that C.I.P.
not_available Device was being used.
not_available We find the device, we find Dubaku.
not_available I appreciate the call.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Janis, Larry wants you to interface with N.S.A.
not_available See if you can backtrace that C.I.P.
not_available Code fragment to its source.
not_available I'll try.
not_available Who were you talking to? 
not_available Head of the response team at the plant.
not_available What did he say? Facility's clean.
not_available A trace amount of the chemical was released, but not enough to do any damage.
not_available And the site has been secured.
not_available That's good.
not_available What about the plant manager? 
not_available John Brunner.
not_available Is he okay? 
not_available No.
not_available Will you do me a favor? 
not_available It depends.
not_available I'd like to track down Mr.
not_available Brunner's family.
not_available I was the last one to speak with him, and I feel they should know how brave he was.
not_available I'll see what I can find.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Janis, before you start sending flowers you need to find out where that C.I.P.
not_available Device was being used.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Cleanup crews are already on site, and we're continuing our evacuation of a one
not_available mile radius around the chemical plant.
not_available Casualties? 
not_available There is, in fact, one casualty.
not_available The plant manager.
not_available Thirteen other workers are being treated for chemical burns and inhalation of toxic fumes.
not_available And there haven't been any other intrusions in the firewall? No, ma'am.
not_available It appears the crisis has been averted.
not_available Except that no one's been able to explain how the firewall break disengaged.
not_available Not yet.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Has no idea how it happened.
not_available It just happened.
not_available And that's not an explanation.
not_available Perhaps Dubaku was firing another warning shot.
not_available No.
not_available Dubaku's already downed two planes.
not_available He's not afraid to take more lives.
not_available In any event, we should be grateful.
not_available I'm not one to accept good news unless I know where it comes from.
not_available And until we have more answers, I want to maintain alert levels.
not_available Madam President? Yes? 
not_available I have Admiral Smith on the line.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Thank you, Tim.
not_available Admiral? I've been trying to reach Agent Gedge, and he hasn't picked up.
not_available Yes, I'm sure I have the right number.
not_available I just spoke to him over an hour ago.
not_available He said he was outside Samantha Roth's apartment, waiting for the first gentleman.
not_available Just find him.
not_available I don't care who you have to pull off shift.
not_available Still can't reach Gedge.
not_available Secret Service doesn't know where he is either.
not_available I need to tell the president.
not_available Maybe you should hold off.
not_available The domestic threat's been lifted for now and she's on the phone with Admiral Smith.
not_available I can't authorize the air strikes until our post
not_available invasion plans are in place.
not_available Finding a politically viable replacementUntil that happens 
not_available you need to keep your forces at full readiness.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available TheJoint Chiefs are getting impatient.
not_available Madam President, we need to talk about your husband.
not_available His theory about your son's death
not_available He hasn't let it go.
not_available What are you talking about? He's been harassing Roger's girlfriend accusing her of complicity in the death of Roger.
not_available Henry and I went over it again and again with the F.B.
not_available I and he swore to me he was past all that.
not_available Well, he's found a private investigator who's feeding his conspiracy theory, taking advantage of him.
not_available Please get Henry on the phone.
not_available I'm afraid I can't do that.
not_available Henry's unreachable.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Agent Gedge hasn't been answering his phone.
not_available I probably should've told you before, but
not_available You're telling me my husband's gone missing? Secret Service has put out an A.P.B.
not_available They're going to Ms.
not_available Roth's apartment.
not_available Whatever's going on, we'll find out soon enough.
not_available This is a priority order, code charlie zero charlie.
not_available We need an immediate 20 on Agent Gedge.
not_available All available field agents proceed to his last known location: 
not_available 404 Wilkinson Drive.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Shut up! You haven't killed anybody yet.
not_available You don't need to do this.
not_available Gedge's plan to frame me is already blown.
not_available If you kill me, they'll know it was murder and they'll trace it back to you.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Where's Agent Gedge? I can't reach him.
not_available Gedge is dead.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Everything was going according to plan.
not_available But something went wrong.
not_available Taylor killed Gedge.
not_available I don't know how.
not_available Where's Mr.
not_available Taylor now? 
not_available He's right here.
not_available Don't kill him.
not_available Bring him to me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Prime Minister Matobo, ma'am, please come with me.
not_available Chloe, pull up the Ritter Building on a satellite grid.
not_available Look for any sign of Dubaku leaving the site.
not_available We've got to find him.
not_available It's gonna take me 20 minutes to task the satellite.
not_available Then don't waste time talking about it.
not_available Pull up satellite traffic cams, street corners, Metro stations.
not_available What's the priority? I can only do one thing at a time.
not_available Satellite.
not_available Fine.
not_available Bill, we need to rethink this.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available You were set up to surveil an undercover operation.
not_available Your cover's been blown.
not_available The police are after us.
not_available We are not equipped to look for one man in a city of millions.
not_available We need additional resources.
not_available What are you suggesting? 
not_available It's time to contact outside agencies.
not_available The government? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I thought you said the government couldn't be trusted.
not_available Right now, we don't have a choice.
not_available They can't be trusted.
not_available We can't trust anybody.
not_available That's why we're workin'on the outside.
not_available President Taylor can be trusted.
not_available I'm not questioning that, Prime Minister.
not_available It's the people around her who can't be trusted.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, Jack's right.
not_available We need help.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available We can limit the flow of information.
not_available Prime Minister Matobo can get us past the president's outer circle.
not_available That way, we could at least explain to her why and what we're doing.
not_available I think Jack's right.
not_available We left a lot of clues in that building.
not_available We're vulnerable.
not_available We can't do this on our own anymore.
not_available Am I supposed to remain in hiding with you? Pretend that my wife and I are still being held hostage or dead? I need to return to the White House and help the president save what's left of my country.
not_available Let my husband do this.
not_available Let him call President Taylor.
not_available She will listen to him.
not_available Bill, you wanna find Dubaku, make the call.
not_available All right.
not_available Get me the White House.
not_available Representatives from Boyd Chemical have assured local authorities that the immediate crisis has passed.
not_available However, this has done little to calm the nerves of the citizens of Kidron, Ohio many of whom have taken shelter in neighboring communities.
not_available Again, we have confirmed one fatality inside the plant itself.
not_available Thirteen others, all Boyd employees are being treated at local medical centers
not_available Madam President? 
not_available Yes? I have Prime Minister Matobo calling for you.
not_available Matobo? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available You're tracing it? 
not_available We tried, Madam President, but it's a secure line.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Prime Minister? 
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Thank God, my wife and I are both fine.
not_available We were rescued.
not_available By whom? Where are you? In a safe place.
not_available Madam President, you need to listen to me.
not_available The people who rescued us, they have acquired the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available It's been destroyed, and your country is no longer under immediate threat.
not_available Who are these people? And tell me how this happened.
not_available I will tell you everything in person, but this must happen privately.
not_available I must speak to you alone.
not_available Why alone? They will bring me to you, Madam President.
not_available We will arrive in 10 minutes.
not_available I'll be waiting for you.
not_available They tried to trace the call, but the line held.
not_available Ethan, I need to see you right now.
not_available Be right there.
not_available Yes, Madam President? I just spoke to Prime Minister Matobo.
not_available What? 
not_available He's safe.
not_available How? What happened? 
not_available He'll let us know when he gets here.
not_available He's on his way now.
not_available He wants a private meeting.
not_available Bring him in through the south entrance and keep this to as few people as possible.
not_available All right.
not_available Jack, I've mapped a route for you to the White House.
not_available It's mostly side streets, but there'll be fewer traffic cams.
not_available Very good.
not_available Send it to my phone.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Let's go.
not_available As soon as we set the vehicle in front of the building 
not_available Agent Walker will move Mr.
not_available Matobo.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm not goin'.
not_available What are you talking about? If the government gets their hands on Tony, they'll arrest him.
not_available I already told you.
not_available I did some pretty bad things before I teamed up with Bill.
not_available Tony, take it from me.
not_available You need to deal with the consequences.
not_available And, believe me, I will.
not_available But not yet.
not_available Not till we get Dubaku.
not_available Look, I'm working on a lead.
not_available I got a guy in Emerson's crew, might have some intel that we can use.
not_available Let him do this, Jack.
not_available He's the reason we got this far.
not_available Fine.
not_available But you give me your word, as soon as this is over, you turn yourself in.
not_available We'll stand behind you.
not_available All right.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Good luck, and be careful.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I was on my way to work, so I thought I'd stop in and see you.
not_available I tried calling you earlier.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've been busy.
not_available Are you all right? You look exhausted.
not_available Yeah, it's just been a long day.
not_available Well, I hope you're still coming over for dinner.
not_available I'm making lasagna.
not_available And my sister promises not to give you any more dirty looks.
not_available You haven't forgotten, have you? 
not_available No.
not_available No, it's just that I got some business to attend to.
not_available Samuel, you work too much.
not_available Every time you come into the diner, you're always on the phone.
not_available I have to, Marika, so that one day I can finally take you away from that awful place that you work in.
not_available Well, we met in that awful place.
not_available Don't forget that.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Have you got Mr.
not_available Taylor? Yes.
not_available I'm about three minutes away.
not_available There's a Korean grocer opposite my building.
not_available One of my men will meet you out back.
not_available Bring Taylor inside.
not_available What are you gonna do to him? Just make sure you weren't followed.
