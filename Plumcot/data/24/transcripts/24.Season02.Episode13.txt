
not_available Jack Bauer's interrogating Syed Ali as we speak.
not_available We'll be informed of his progress on a minuteby
not_available minute basis, but nothing yet.
not_available We're certain he knows the location of the bomb? 
not_available Jack Bauer is.
not_available Make sure he has all the resources he needs.
not_available They will kill your family if you don't tell me where the bomb is.
not_available Where's the bomb? Tell me where the bomb is! 
not_available Kill him.
not_available No! No! I will tell you! Hold on! 
not_available It's Jack.
not_available What do you have? The bomb's at Norton Airfield.
not_available They're gonna fly it over the city.
not_available Your meeting's changed.
not_available Now it's with me.
not_available So you're confirming that Roger Stanton is involved? He knew about this bomb? Roger's more involved than David could possibly know.
not_available I think you orchestrated all of this.
not_available You have your own and not the president's best interest at heart.
not_available I got into a car accident.
not_available I started running.
not_available Before I knew it, I had no idea where I was.
not_available I wanna get backto the highway and get outta here.
not_available The highway's a couple of miles that way.
not_available But the way there is not safe at night.
not_available My place is a half
not_available mile that way.
not_available I can put a roof over your head for the night.
not_available They've found Reza, haven't they? They know what's happened.
not_available Tell me, please, what happened? You wouldn't understand, Kate.
not_available People have to die for things to change.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, this is Tony.
not_available You're about ten minutes from the airport? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You got a tail number on the aircraftyet? 
not_available Notyet.
not_available You'll link up with the assault team.
not_available They're starting to lockthe grounds down.
not_available OK, that sounds good.
not_available Tony, have you contacted Kim yet? No, I haven't.
not_available I called the sheriffs station.
not_available They sent out search teams.
not_available I don't know why she hasn't contacted us.
not_available She can't go backto LA, and the LAPD's looking for a murder suspect.
not_available She's not gonna reach out to us.
not_available We've gotta find her.
not_available Understand? 
not_available I'm putting every resource on it.
not_available Do everything you have to.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How much further is it? 
not_available Not much.
not_available Ow.
not_available Ow! Dammit.
not_available Here, let me see that.
not_available We really ought to getyou to a doctor.
not_available No, I told you, it's not safe for me in LA.
not_available Because people there think you did something you didn't do? Yeah, that's right.
not_available You don't believe me.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available You don't wanna go backto LA.
not_available That's good enough for me.
not_available There it is.
not_available Ready to tell me everything I need to know? Continue.
not_available We knew about the bomb weeks ago.
not_available Thank you, Simmons.
not_available What do you mean, "knew"? We let it in the country.
not_available Tracked it all the way.
not_available We allowed it to sneakthrough customs, and we allowed the Second Wave terrorist cell to operate unimpeded.
not_available God, Roger.
not_available A nuclear bomb? There's no chance that this bomb is ever gonna go off.
not_available There never was.
not_available We had a Special Ops team following it every step of the way.
not_available Colonel Samuels' team.
not_available The mission was to take the bomb out of play at the last possible moment.
not_available What are you trying to do? Start a war with the Middle East? 
not_available No.
not_available Then what? Your defence policy is too passive.
not_available You need more resources.
not_available You're trying to hijack my presidency.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I'd like to give it some balls.
not_available You're gonna call your Special Ops team.
not_available Tell them to secure the bomb.
not_available Now! They went darkthree hours ago.
not_available Not accepting any new incoming communications till the mission's complete.
not_available And where were they? Where were they? Norton Airfield Los Angeles.
not_available The shower's in there.
not_available You're welcome to use it.
not_available Try not to stay in there too long.
not_available There's not a lot of hot water.
not_available There's some towels in there, and I'll try and getyou some clean clothes.
not_available The door has a lock.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I just got off the phone with Division.
not_available Syed Ali named three more Second Wave terrorists in the LA area.
not_available I want two transport teams assigned to each one.
not_available Pick 'em up now.
not_available OK.
not_available Hey, guys, heads up.
not_available They just received a second confirmation from NSA in Oregon.
not_available The location of the bomb is indeed Norton Airfield.
not_available Jack Bauer's en route.
not_available I want every available field agent over there now.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available There's a new wrinkle, Jack.
not_available Howfar are you from the airport? 
not_available A couple of minutes.
not_available What kind of a wrinkle? There's a hostile US paramilitary unit standing between you and the bomb.
not_available A Coral Snake team headed up by Colonel Ron Samuels.
not_available It's the same unit that took out our plane.
not_available What is going on? Why is a US military unit aiding these terrorists? As far as we know, they're not.
not_available The best we can make out, they wanna be the ones to secure the bomb.
not_available They'll treat anybody who stands in their way as an adversary.
not_available Order Colonel Samuels to tell his team to stand down.
not_available They went darkthree hours ago.
not_available They're a rogue unit, acting on their own authority.
not_available How do I find them? 
not_available I wish I could narrow it down.
not_available Just somewhere at the airport.
not_available I'm trying to get manpower up from Camp Pendleton.
not_available This is bad, George.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available Our best bet is still you getting past them to the bomb.
not_available Yes, I understand.
not_available What's happening? I don't know yet.
not_available CTU hasn't been able to locate your sister.
not_available As soon as they do, they'll contact me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available This is gonna take longer than I thought.
not_available Omar! Dispatch, this is 4827 Kate You've seen terrible things today, but I need you a little longer, in case we find your sister.
not_available Are you OK with that? 
not_available Agent Baker.
not_available Jack.
not_available Take Miss Warner to the secured area, make sure she's comfortable.
not_available You'll need this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Steve Goodrich.
not_available I'm heading up the assault team on
not_available site.
not_available I was told you have further intel on the group? These are individual military records of every soldier under Samuels' command.
not_available What's our profile with them? 
not_available They're gonna treat us like hostiles.
not_available That doesn't make sense.
not_available No, but that's the situation.
not_available Is your team ready? 
not_available Inside.
not_available We got airport schematics.
not_available Good.
not_available Everybody gather round! We are going to be engaging hostiles in a large uncontrolled area.
not_available I want everyone wearing ID tags, no exceptions.
not_available Anybody wants to leave this area, check with me first.
not_available Who's got the schematics? 
not_available Here, sir.
not_available Here's the situation: there is a nuclear warhead somewhere on
not_available site.
not_available There's an armed Delta team surrounding it.
not_available I want three sub
not_available units.
not_available Unit one makes the first sweep.
not_available Unit two coordinates air tactical.
not_available Unit three will await my command as soon as I've got a 20 on the bomb.
not_available Understand? Yes, sir.
not_available Good luck, gentlemen.
not_available Lieutenant, set up your teams.
not_available Gentlemen, team A, B.
not_available Column of two on me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Bauer's set up the staging area at the airfiield.
not_available OK.
not_available Tony, we got a little problem.
not_available What's up? Brad Hammond from Division is on his way.
not_available They want to shut us down and run everything.
not_available We're up and running now.
not_available Not 100%.
not_available We're still having intermittent packet loss.
not_available Division's uncomfortable with us running this operation out of a compromised location.
not_available We don't have the time to give these idiots the grand tour.
not_available We're closing in on this.
not_available They're on their way, so we just gotta deal with it.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you feeling? 
not_available A lot better.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available So why is it thatyou live up here like this? I don't know.
not_available I guess I just got sick of the whole LA scene.
not_available It's not like I hate anyone there.
not_available There's just too many people.
not_available Don't have that problem up here, huh? No, it's just the opposite.
not_available So, why don'tyou move to a small town? Why do you have to be by yourself? I don't know.
not_available So, tell me again why you can't go backto LA.
not_available If I told you, you wouldn't believe me, so What? My father works for the government.
not_available A counter
not_available terrorist unit.
not_available He said that someone's gonna detonate a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today.
not_available What's so funny? I knew it.
not_available I've been telling people that this is gonna happen for over a year.
not_available No one would listen to me.
not_available So, you knew about these terrorists? Not these ones specifically, butyeah.
not_available Read the foreign papers.
not_available Look over the fence.
not_available The whole world hates America.
not_available I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We're far enough away.
not_available We won't get hurt.
not_available No one's far enough away.
not_available What about the fallout? No one can predict where the wind's gonna take it.
not_available I'm gonna show you something, butyou can't tell anyone.
not_available What is it? After we eat.
not_available Where are we on locating the Coral Snake commandos? Bauer and his teams are looking for them.
not_available CTU is updating us every ten minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available This cannot possibly have a good outcome.
not_available We've got two highly trained American military groups about to face off.
not_available CTU has a formable presence.
not_available If the commandos are there, CTU should be able to control the situation.
not_available Mr President, we've got something new.
not_available What? Our com team discovered a covert link between Stanton and Bruce Gluck.
not_available The Michigan senator? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It looks like they were working together.
not_available How would you like to proceed? Sherry knows Gluck and his key staffers.
not_available They worked closely together during the primaries.
not_available Bring her in.
not_available Here? Into the OC? Yes.
not_available She'll need access to our secure databases.
not_available Sir, I feel I must 
not_available I don't wanna argue about this.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Why's it taking so long to get this number? Barely anything here.
not_available There's something 
not_available We need this, Randy.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available They're sending Division to do an evaluation.
not_available Why are they doing this now? We're operational, getting results.
not_available Why don't they leave us alone? They will.
not_available This is just Chapelle's way of doing stuff over there.
not_available What about George? When they get a look at the shape he's in, they're probably gonna yank him.
not_available I'm keeping an eye on him, all right? Just get everyone to Norton.
not_available What have we got? Military
not_available issue combat boots.
not_available Five sets, all leading in here, less than an hour old.
not_available Anything coming out? 
not_available Still in there.
not_available Have your team ready to move on my signal.
not_available It's definitely Colonel Samuels' men.
not_available If these guys are dead, who's tracking the bomb? This is Baker.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're moving into position now.
not_available This bank was knocked out, but we didn't lose any data.
not_available The same data is mirrored at Division.
not_available We don't need to risk running these operations from a jury
not_available rigged system.
not_available You can't run a mission on data alone.
not_available My team has more experience implementing than anyone at Division.
not_available I don't thinkthat's true, but the point is moot.
not_available Start to ship some of your people to our offices.
not_available And waste an hour on transporting and set up, with a nuclear bomb ticking away? I was wondering if this place had a director.
not_available Brad, good to see you.
not_available George.
not_available I heard you're not feeling well.
not_available I imagine you've heard all kinds of things today.
not_available But a bad day for me is better than a good day for anybody on your side of the freeway.
not_available That right? 
not_available We're not shutting down.
not_available We got way too many active protocols in play here.
not_available Your systems failed their checks this morning.
not_available This morning.
not_available Everything's fine now.
not_available Eileen, show Brad here how our systems are exceeding all of their time horizons.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Think you can do that at Division? Don't believe everything you hear, Brad.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Come on.
not_available What is it? You'll see.
not_available I'm not sure, Lonnie.
not_available Come on, don't be scared.
not_available Come on.
not_available Watch your head over here.
not_available It's a bomb shelter.
not_available Short of a direct hit, you could survive down here for a pretty long time.
not_available You did all this yourself? 
not_available It took me two years.
not_available After I dug it out, it wasn't too bad.
not_available Hey, check it out.
not_available I'm kind of a coffee junkie.
not_available I could pretty much handle anything, but I gotta have my java.
not_available These beans are from Argentina.
not_available Here, smell this.
not_available Wow.
not_available That's great.
not_available The best.
not_available Mm, that's my favourite smell.
not_available Hey! Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Kim! What's wrong? I just got a little claustrophobic down there, that's all.
not_available You're shaking.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available I don't think I should be here, Lonnie.
not_available Why not? I don't know you, and you live here by yourself with a bomb shelter with guns Think about it, Kim.
not_available It's gonna be people like me who'll survive today if whatyou say is true.
not_available Sorry, I didn't mean to hurtyour feelings.
not_available You didn't.
not_available A lot has happened to me today, and with the bomb in LA, I just think I need to go to my Aunt Carol's to be with family.
not_available Whatever, Kim.
not_available If you gotta go, go.
not_available The green card will give you access to the system rooms, and the red card will getyou into the network.
not_available Thank you, Lynne.
not_available I'm sorry you weren't able to gain access to the OC earlier.
not_available What made the president change his mind? I'll let the president fill you in.
not_available I'd like to make it clear that you are not to interface directly with the personnel once inside the OC.
not_available Please see me if you need anything.
not_available You want me to run everything by you? 
not_available I'm familiar with the internal politics.
not_available I'd be able 
not_available You'll be able to do what, Lynne? I'm trying to maintain some form of protocol.
not_available No, you're trying to position yourself between me and David's inner circle because you don't trust me.
not_available Instead of talking about protocols, just say what's on your mind.
not_available You don't want me here.
not_available Mrs Palmer 
not_available No, you don't me here.
not_available So let's just quit playing games.
not_available How dare you speakto me like this.
not_available I was appointed by the president because of my qualifications in foreign policy.
not_available I don't know what makes you think you can lecture me.
not_available Fine.
not_available You don't wanna play games? I don't like you.
not_available And I don't like you being here.
not_available Now we're communicating.
not_available All right.
not_available You should have everything you need here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll get it backto you.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Stay close to me.
not_available It's a 15
not_available minute walkto the highway.
not_available What was that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's Mike Kramer, the park ranger.
not_available He's probably looking for you.
not_available The police probably called him.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available They're gonna send me backto LA.
not_available Lonnie.
not_available Hey, Mike.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Following up on a missing person's call.
not_available Seen anyone tonight? 
not_available No.
not_available Who are you looking for? A teenage girl.
not_available She ran away from a car accident.
not_available Why would they be looking out here? 
not_available Cos she was in custody.
not_available In custody? For what? 
not_available Kidnapping and murder.
not_available Wow.
not_available You got company? 
not_available What? No, no.
not_available Doug came by earlier.
not_available I haven't cleaned up yet.
not_available Doug O'Keefe from the fire district? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I heard he was still mad after last week.
not_available It was just a card game.
not_available You emptied his wallet.
not_available Keep your eyes open, OK? 
not_available I will.
not_available I'll see ya, pal.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He's gone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Kidnapping? Murder? I didn't do it, I swear.
not_available Can we hang out here for a few more minutes, till he clears the area? Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
not_available Hey, Lonnie? I'm really lucky thatyou were here.
not_available You've been a really good friend.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Find out about Glock's relationship with Stanton.
not_available I'm interested in any meetings that both Rayburn and Stanton attended.
not_available Fine.
not_available I know exactly who to call.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll have Lynne setyou up with a work space.
not_available That's great.
not_available Lynne's been quite helpful.
not_available I 
not_available I wanna thank you, David.
not_available For what? I know how difficult it is to get clearance in here, and I'm certain your advisors don't want me Sherry, stop distilling everything down to politics.
not_available We have a need for information.
not_available Hopefully you can fill it.
not_available And I will Mr President.
not_available Sherry, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to sound rude.
not_available I really do appreciate whatyou're doing.
not_available That's why you're here.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Yes, Mike.
not_available I just got off with CTU Los Angeles.
not_available Jack Bauer found the Coral Snake commandos.
not_available So it's over? 
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available All six members of the team had been killed before Bauer got there.
not_available What about the bomb? Roger, your men are all dead, and there's no sign of the bomb.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available Your insane plan backfired.
not_available Those men were our last chance to find the bomb, and nowthey're dead.
not_available My God.
not_available You're misguided, butyou are not crazy.
not_available You do not want this bomb to go off! Of course not.
not_available Then tell me, who else could have known about this? No one.
not_available They were on their own.
not_available Somebody killed six highly trained commandos.
not_available That's not the work of a bunch of suicide bombers! Six commandos? 
not_available That's right.
not_available There were seven.
not_available What's the word at the airport? 
not_available There's too many places it could be.
not_available Got it.
not_available It's either N34G5, or it's N34G6.
not_available Michelle.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available N34G5.
not_available It's registered in California, and it's at Norton Airport, hangar MD7.
not_available Get Bauer.
not_available Down the runway to here, then to these hangars all down here.
not_available Bauer.
not_available It's Tony.
not_available We got a tail number on that plane.
not_available N as in "November", three, four, G as in "golf", five.
not_available The FAA has got it spotted in hangar M as in "mama", D as in "delta", seven.
not_available OK.
not_available We got it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hangar MD7 at the other end of the airport.
not_available The third hangar from the end.
not_available There it is! Go, go! He's trying to make a run for the north runway.
not_available Send a team over to cut him off! Pull up alongside of him! Dammit! The pilot has been hit! The pilot has been hit! Putyour hands in the air! Putyour hands up! Putyour hands above your head! Keep your hands up! He's got it in the plane! Get the nuke emergency team here now! You're clear until the threat passes.
not_available When it does, we're gonna re
not_available evaluate.
not_available Fine.
not_available See somebody about that cough.
not_available You don't look so good.
not_available Appreciate your concern, Brad.
not_available Lonnie, what are you doing? What are you listening to? Police band.
not_available I'm just scanning to see if there's anything aboutyour APB.
not_available I'd hate to getyou out there and then find out there's a roadblock and a bunch of cop cars.
not_available Find anything? 
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available Good.
not_available Looks like you're not gonna make the Ten Most Wanted.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What? Wait, wait.
not_available It can't be.
not_available What is it? What's wrong? 
not_available It happened.
not_available What? The bomb went off? All the LA stations went to static.
not_available Ventura County's talking about a flash.
not_available Nowthey're gone.
not_available I don't see anything.
not_available Here, here.
not_available Listen for yourself.
not_available This station, nothing.
not_available This one, nothing.
not_available This one, nothing.
not_available They're all dead.
not_available I gotta get to my dad.
not_available No, we can't stay up here.
not_available The radiation.
not_available We gotta get down below.
not_available No! We gotta go now, before it's too late.
not_available Come on.
not_available OK.
not_available This is Paul Tate live from the Skywatch.
not_available A beautiful night in Los Angeles as we near the nine o'clock hour.
not_available Traffiic is light in both directions.
not_available Try the internal.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available It's no good, either.
not_available It's no good.
not_available This trigger's been set to permanent default.
not_available We can try the internal configuration.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available They wiped out the configurations.
not_available Can you disarm it? 
not_available It doesn't look good.
not_available Team A, this is Bauer.
not_available I wantyou to start to clear the north runway.
not_available I repeat: clear the north runway.
not_available What do you mean? If we can't diffuse it, I've gotta get it as far away from LA as possible.
not_available Yes, that's affirmative.
not_available Roger that.
not_available What's happening? Timing mechanism.
not_available They must've given it an expedite command.
not_available When it's tampered with, the countdown speeds up.
not_available Hold on, hold on, hold on.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Don't touch that.
not_available It'll detonate.
not_available What just happened? Nothing.
not_available This isn't a bomb.
not_available It's been rigged to look like one.
not_available And the radiation reading? 
not_available Probably the box.
not_available There was a bomb in here recently, but it's gone now.
not_available The reading's picking up some plutonium residue.
not_available All teams, we do not have the bomb.
not_available This is a decoy.
not_available I repeat: we do not have the bomb.
not_available This is a decoy.
not_available We are still looking for the nuclear device.
not_available There's no bomb at the airport, Roger.
not_available If there's something thatyou haven't told me that could save lives tell me now.
not_available Please, Roger.
not_available Ask Sherry.
not_available What did you say? Sherry is the one you wanna talkto.
