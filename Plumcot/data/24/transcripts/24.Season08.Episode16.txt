not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Hassan isn't happy about Î¤aylor's response to the ultimatum.
not_available If he wants to take it up with President Taylor, he can do it when he's
not_available Put your gun down.
not_available Omar, what are you doing? 
not_available Mr.
not_available President
not_available My life for tens of thousands? I couldn't live with that.
not_available What if they blew up the bomb anyway? At least l've tried to stop the attack.
not_available We've got less than five minutes.
not_available We gotta move.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you can't trust him! 
not_available Don't move! Hands where we can see them! ls he still alive? Yes, ma'am.
not_available Where is President Îassan? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Don't lie to me! They have Hassan.
not_available We have the bomb.
not_available Î¤he bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd.
not_available We know that President Îassan was handed over approximately 1 0 minutes ago.
not_available We have an ambush point yet? Yes.
not_available lntersection of 1 61 st and Amsterdam.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available is following you.
not_available Can you find me an exit? Î¤here's one between 1 58th and 1 59th
not_available parking garage.
not_available Damn it, they've made us.
not_available He's breaking left.
not_available I repeat: He's breaking left.
not_available I've got him.
not_available He's going back into the garage.
not_available Îe's coming straight at me! Damn it! You know where to go.
not_available Îave you got Îassan? No.
not_available The driver managed to transfer Îassan to another vehicle before l could get to him.
not_available Someone inside C.Î¤.U.'s gotta be tipping them off.
not_available lt's only a matter of time before this gets traced back to me.
not_available l need to get the hell out of here while I still can.
not_available The following takes place between 7:00 a.m.
not_available and 8:00 a.m.
not_available Excuse me, Ms.
not_available Walsh.
not_available l need to see your passkey.
not_available What's this about? lt's a new protocol because of the E.M.P.
not_available attack.
not_available Nobody gets in or out without personally being cleared by Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available l can't let you through.
not_available You haven't been coded out.
not_available Well, l'm not leaving.
not_available I'm just going to my car.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available You'll have to talk to Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Îastings is in the middle of a crisis.
not_available It'll just be a couple of minutes.
not_available No one will even know I was gone.
not_available Look, l just wanna go get my migraine meds.
not_available Please don't make me beg.
not_available All right, I'll tell you what.
not_available l'll have one of my men run out to your car, grab your medication.
not_available Give me your keys.
not_available You know, that's fine.
not_available Your men are busy enough.
not_available I'll talk to Hastings.
not_available You sure? Yep.
not_available Thank you, Jim.
not_available Only one car left the parking garage, one minute after the crash
not_available northeast exit.
not_available A blonde woman was driving.
not_available Hassan was probably in it.
not_available Can you track it? 
not_available No.
not_available It left the satellite grid.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Put out an A.P.B.
not_available on that car.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Scan the N.S.A.
not_available servers.
not_available See if they've picked up any chatter.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, the president's on line one.
not_available She'd like an update.
not_available Great.
not_available Î¤hank you.
not_available Madam President, Brian Hastings.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, l saw the crash.
not_available Please tell me President Hassan survived.
not_available Actually, we just learned that President Îassan was not in the vehicle.
not_available l don't understand.
not_available During the pursuit, we believe he was switched to another car.
not_available We're trying to track it now.
not_available Then he's still alive.
not_available lt appears so, ma'am.
not_available lf the terrorists wanted him dead, they would have killed him on sight.
not_available They must have another agenda.
not_available l don't even want to speculate on what that might be.
not_available We will keep you apprised, Madam President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What is happening? Is my father alive? We think so.
not_available But he's still in the hands of the terrorists.
not_available Now, C.Î¤.U.
not_available is searching for him now.
not_available Then there's still hope? Yes.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available But, Madam President, the Russian Foreign Minister is outside.
not_available He wants to speak with you.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available l can't imagine how hard this is for both of you.
not_available Please know that I'm committing every resource at my disposal to finding him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Novakovich, what can I do for you? Thank you for seeing me, Madam President.
not_available I know that you are very busy.
not_available lt's alI right.
not_available Please.
not_available Can l assume there is no change in the status of President Hassan? l'm afraid not.
not_available Then he is still being held by terrorists.
not_available For now, yes.
not_available Are you hopeful that C.T.U.
not_available can recover him? We're following a lead now.
not_available And, yes, we are very hopeful.
not_available What is the nature of the lead? l'd rather not get into specifics.
not_available You'll be told the second we know more.
not_available Oh.
not_available Madam President, l need to stress that if Hassan is not found, his government will be in disarray.
not_available Î¤he peace agreement will have no chance of success.
not_available l'm aware of that, but there'sthere's no point in speculating on the worst
not_available case scenario.
not_available We're not there yet.
not_available l just want to make our position clear.
not_available lf Îassan dies, there is no agreement.
not_available lf I didn't know better, l'd think you were hoping for that to happen.
not_available Madam President
not_available You believe this treaty weakens your influence in the region.
not_available Your country has been looking for any excuse to pull out.
not_available l realize you are under a great deal of pressure, but there is no reason for these baseless accusations.
not_available My country has been more than supportive.
not_available We are here, are we not? Perhaps l spoke too harshly.
not_available Ijust don't need you to remind me how perilous this situation is.
not_available l do appreciate your support, and I hope that I can count on it until we find President Hassan.
not_available Of course, Madam President.
not_available Chloe, can l talk to you for a second? We've got a problem.
not_available Jack thinks that someone inside of C.Î¤.U.
not_available is working for the terrorists.
not_available Why does he think that? They must have been warned that they were being followed.
not_available Î¤hat's why they transferred Hassan to a different car.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Î¤hat bothered me too.
not_available And then there was a satelIite gIitch that happened earlier.
not_available What glitch? The glitch that allowed the terrorists to get away.
not_available lt was a little too unlucky, especially for us.
not_available Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash.
not_available lf someone did call to tip him off, we can get the number off the memory.
not_available Jack's on his way back to C.T.U.
not_available now.
not_available He wants you to call him on a proprietary line so he can upload the data.
not_available All right.
not_available Go.
not_available I'm ready to receive.
not_available I'm calling Jack now.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available Renee filled me in.
not_available Good.
not_available l'm gonna upload the cell phone data to your station.
not_available What's your I.D.
not_available number? Chloe, it's encrypted.
not_available You're gonna have to work fast.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available l need to access your workstation.
not_available What for? l wanna make sure all the parameters reset properly after the E.M.P.
not_available Can't that wait? 
not_available No.
not_available lf the parameters are off, we could lose more data.
not_available Îow long? Couple of minutes.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, it's Chloe.
not_available I need to talk to you at my station.
not_available It's important.
not_available What is it, Chloe? 
not_available I'll explain when you get here.
not_available l'm on my way.
not_available Let me know when you're finished.
not_available All right, what is it? We think someone inside of C.Î¤.U.
not_available is working with the terrorists.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available They switched Hassan to a different car because they knew they were being followed.
not_available Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash.
not_available Chloe's decrypting the data right now.
not_available Who the hell is it? Î¤he data's coming in now.
not_available It'll take a second.
not_available Okay, there.
not_available Î¤hese are all the calls that Î¤arin made in the past hour.
not_available That's one of ours.
not_available It's one of the cell phones N.S.A.
not_available provided to us right after the E.M.P.
not_available hit.
not_available Who was issued that phone? They were logged in by hand.
not_available Hold on.
not_available lt's Dana's phone.
not_available Where is she? l checked with Hastings.
not_available He cleared me through, Jim.
not_available Îow's that migraine? Worse than ever, thanks to you.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available Just doing my job.
not_available Stay where you are and keep your hands where I can
not_available Shots fired! Security monitors, main screen.
not_available Main entrance! We need a medical team to the main entrance.
not_available What's going on? Why is there a 1 12 out on Dana? She's working with the terrorists.
not_available Just shot two security guards.
not_available She's trying to leave the building.
not_available What are you talking about? We traced a call from her cell phone to one of the terrorists.
not_available She's been working with them, Cole.
not_available What did you know about this? Nothing, sir! 
not_available She just entered the parking garage.
not_available She's heading for the north end of level two.
not_available She's going for her car.
not_available Cole.
not_available Cole! Notify Security.
not_available Lock down the exits.
not_available Get out of the car now! 
not_available Who are you, you lying bitch? Who are you? Cole, let her go! Cole, let her go.
not_available Let her go.
not_available Where's Îassan? 
not_available You're gonna talk to me one way or the other.
not_available l said, where are they taking Hassan? l wanna talk to Jack Bauer.
not_available You want answers, get Bauer.
not_available Get her out of here.
not_available lf her name's not Dana Walsh, then who is she? Îer real name's Jenny Scott.
not_available At least that's what she told me.
not_available l don't know what to believe anymore.
not_available But she said she did some bad things in her past.
not_available That's why she had to change her identity.
not_available What bad things? She was invoIved with a feIon.
not_available They committed some armed robberies.
not_available Someone got kilIed.
not_available Î¤hat's all l know, but it's not relevant to finding Hassan.
not_available You let me decide what is relevant and what is not.
not_available Why didn't you report this? I just found out about it a few hours ago.
not_available That is not an excuse.
not_available l know, sir.
not_available I guess I was just trying to protect her.
not_available l wasn't thinking straight.
not_available So when you and Danaor whatever her name is
not_available went AWOL, what was that about? lt's a long story, sir, and it won't help us find President Hassan.
not_available l'll make a full debrief once this is all over.
not_available But until it is, please, let me stay on duty.
not_available l know I screwed up, but l've been running Îassan's security for the last month.
not_available Give me a chance to make this right.
not_available Îastings.
not_available Sir, you wanted to be told when Bauer got here.
not_available Hejust arrived.
not_available Send him to Interrogation.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You get over to Debrief.
not_available Sir, you need me on this.
not_available l need people l can trust.
not_available You wanna make this right? Then start by getting down everything you know.
not_available Then we'll talk.
not_available What's happening? You were right.
not_available They had someone inside of C.T.U.
not_available Dana Walsh.
not_available She's an analyst.
not_available We checked the phone data you sent over.
not_available She's the one that called Tarin before he crashed.
not_available She must have warned him that he was being pursued.
not_available Anybody know who she really is? She's not saying anything until she talks to you.
not_available Me? Why? She won't say.
not_available Jack, are you up to speed? Yeah.
not_available Just spoke with Agent Ortiz.
not_available You know he was her fiancé.
not_available That would explain a few things.
not_available He doesn't know much, only that she had some kind of criminal past and altered her identity to infiltrate C.Î¤.U.
not_available not an easy task.
not_available Well, she obviously had help from someone.
not_available However she did this, we need to find out.
not_available You think Cole's clean? l think he's telling the truth.
not_available But after this, I'm not sure I trust my own opinion.
not_available l thought l knew Dana Walsh.
not_available Cole's clean.
not_available Why does she wanna talk to you, Jack? l don't know.
not_available I just met her today.
not_available But I think we should find out, don't you? Open up.
not_available You stand down for now.
not_available Just so we're clear, as far as l'm concerned, I kept up my end of our deal.
not_available Î¤he nuclear rods were recovered.
not_available The only reason I'm still here is because l gave President Taylor my word that l would protect President Hassan.
not_available l know.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Biometrics ready? Yes, sir.
not_available They said l was the only one you wanted to talk to.
not_available Why? Because you're the only one here who doesn't have his head up his ass.
not_available So let's not waste any time.
not_available You want President Hassan.
not_available I can get him for you.
not_available l know where they're taking him.
not_available I know what they're planning to do.
not_available What do you want? You know the drill.
not_available Full immunity.
not_available Clean record.
not_available And I wanna be compensated.
not_available Compensated? When you get these l.R.K.
not_available agents, you're gonna get your hands on their cash.
not_available l want my share.
not_available l lost a lot of money when this deal went south.
not_available You're telling me all this is about money? lsn't it always? lf I'm gonna take this to the president, l need proof that you know something worthwhile.
not_available Well, in about a half an hour, you will have all the proof you need: Îassan's head.
not_available You littIe bitch.
not_available Let me explain something to you.
not_available Damn it, Jack.
not_available The only reason you've got any leverage right now is because President Hassan is alive.
not_available So stop screwing with me! Î¤hey are going to force him to make a statement, and then they're going to kill him, live over the Internet.
not_available So I suggest we stop haggling and you start making this happen.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll take this to the president.
not_available But you better understand that if we don't recover President Hassan alive, you get nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available lt's why l asked for you, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available It's part of the deal.
not_available You're going to handle this operation.
not_available Hassan is heavily protected.
not_available I need someone with your experience running the show.
not_available There's been enough screw
not_available ups for one day.
not_available Don't you think? Earlier you said you lost a Iot of money because the deal went bad.
not_available Who was supposed to pay you? Î¤icktock, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available You're running out of time.
not_available So, what do the biometrics say? Autonomics are stable.
not_available No deception.
not_available l wouldn't put much faith in those readings.
not_available She's a sociopath.
not_available She cannot be trusted.
not_available Renee's right.
not_available This isn't just about the money for her.
not_available She's hiding something.
not_available But given the time frame that we have, we need to follow through with this.
not_available How do you wanna play it? We need to calI the president.
not_available Hassan is here.
not_available They're bringing him up.
not_available Samir, we should kill him now.
not_available The entire city is looking for him.
not_available lt's not enough to kill him.
not_available We need him to confess his crimes, renounce his lies.
not_available The longer we delay, the better the chance the Americans will find him and try to rescue him.
not_available Îe will never be rescued.
not_available He will die right here.
not_available Samir.
not_available Do you remember me? l was a young man when we met.
not_available You were a general in the Revolutionary Guard.
not_available l had the honor of briefing you on our operations in Abul Province.
not_available You were a great leader then.
not_available What happened? Why did you turn your back on our country? 
not_available lt is you
not_available you who has betrayed our country.
not_available No.
not_available l'm fighting to keep us strong.
not_available You have chosen to surrender to the West.
not_available lt's not surrender.
not_available lt's an honorable peace that will strengthen our country.
not_available l do remember you.
not_available Do you remember the campaign we fought to secure the perimeter of Abul? Yes, I do.
not_available The other generals said I was leading my men into defeat.
not_available But we fought four long days.
not_available l believed in my heart that victory was possible.
not_available And I was right.
not_available l'm not saying l'm never wrong.
not_available But l believe just as strongly in this peace agreement.
not_available All l'm asking is that you put your faith in me once again.
not_available l implore you to stop this madness.
not_available The next thing you say will be an apology to every citizen of the I.R.K.
not_available You will beg forgiveness for your treason.
not_available And you will renounce the peace agreement.
not_available That will never happen.
not_available l'll never do that.
not_available l will never do that.
not_available Oh, you wilI.
not_available Itjust depends on how long it takes and how much pain you can endure.
not_available Î¤his immunity agreement's made out to "Dana Walsh." But it's my understanding that's not her real name.
not_available The lawyers are aware of that, ma'am.
not_available Î¤hey say the agreement will hold.
not_available Too bad.
not_available I thought for a moment there we had a way out.
not_available l'll get these to C.T.U.
not_available right away.
not_available Thank you, Tim.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ethan.
not_available Still here, Madam President.
not_available Are you going to be all right? I'll let my doctors field that one.
not_available Î¤hey're running tests.
not_available Good.
not_available Madam President, what's the situation with Hassan? ls he safe? 
not_available They have him, Ethan.
not_available Î¤he I.R.K.
not_available agents have Hassan.
not_available Oh, dear God.
not_available They're gonna kill him.
not_available Not if C.T.U.
not_available can get there in time.
not_available There's a rescue operation under way.
not_available Î¤hey know where he is? They will shortly.
not_available The terrorists had someone working for them inside C.T.U.
not_available an analyst named Dana Walsh.
not_available l've agreed to a conditional immunity deal in exchange for her cooperation.
not_available Conditional on what? Omar Hassan's safe return.
not_available Ethan, there's a real possibility Hassan won't survive this.
not_available l hate to even think about it, but we have to be prepared.
not_available ls there any chance that the person who succeeds Hassan will be someone we can deal with? The l.R.K.
not_available constitution is vague when it comes to succession of power.
not_available Î¤here's no telling who'd take his place.
not_available Besides, Îassan barely was able to form a consensus in his own administration.
not_available lt took a man of his charisma and passion to achieve that.
not_available l'm sorry to be so negative, Madam President, but we have to be realistic.
not_available Without Hassan, there can be no peace.
not_available They're ready to start the briefing with Dana, or whatever her name is.
not_available Arlo? Yeah, I heard you.
not_available You work with someone for a year, you think you know them.
not_available How did we miss this? I knew there was something wrong with her.
not_available She was a little too perfect, but l never imagined she'd be a terrorist.
not_available Well, l should've seen it.
not_available She was acting weird all day.
not_available Maybe if l'd been looking in the right spot, like somewhere in the vicinity of her face, l might've noticed something useful.
not_available She played us.
not_available Get over it.
not_available Sit down.
not_available l'm only telling you this because you're going to find out soon enough.
not_available Dana's been given provisional immunity by the president.
not_available What? 
not_available She's providing us with intelligence as to the whereabouts of the people holding President Hassan.
not_available l don't care what she's providing.
not_available She's a traitor and a murderer.
not_available Cole.
not_available You can't let her walk, not her.
not_available Stop.
not_available l know you've been burned
not_available professionally, personally.
not_available Get over it.
not_available Jack Bauer's heading up the operation to rescue President Hassan.
not_available Îe wants you on his team.
not_available But Dana is briefing the group.
not_available Do you have a problem with that? No, sir.
not_available l'm fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Stand by outside the conference room.
not_available His name is Samir Mehran.
not_available Before the I.R.K.
not_available planted him here, he was a soldier with the Revolutionary Guard.
not_available Altogether, he has about six men left.
not_available You killed the rest.
not_available You're absolutely sure that's where they're holding Hassan? Yes.
not_available Î¤he entrance to the tenement is on Holland Avenue with exits to the rear and east side.
not_available He'll have at least a couple lookouts stationed.
not_available What's the apartment number? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What's the apartment number? 
not_available If I knew, I would tell you.
not_available Somewhere above the first floor.
not_available What makes you say that? Because the building is populated
not_available some families.
not_available Samir will want to use them as human shields in the event of a frontal attack.
not_available We got what we need.
not_available We have to move.
not_available Secure the prisoner.
not_available Take her to Holding.
not_available Îey.
not_available You all right? Yeah.
not_available l'm ready to go.
not_available Get your men and assemble them in the motor pool.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Just read the statement, Omar.
not_available Put an end to this.
not_available This is only going to get worse.
not_available Tell the people you've made a terrible mistake.
not_available Atone for your sins.
not_available You are wasting your time.
not_available l wilI never do what you ask.
not_available Read the statement, Omar, or I will start cutting pieces from your body.
not_available Whether l live or l die, this peace will happen somehow, and men like you will have no place to hide.
not_available This peace dies right here with you! You said the drug would break down his resistance.
not_available It should be working.
not_available Give him another injection.
not_available Any more could kill him.
not_available l don't care.
not_available Do it.
not_available Samir, we can't continue this forever.
not_available lf he won't read the statement, we must think of something else.
not_available He will break.
not_available I know it.
not_available He's stronger than we thought.
not_available We need to accept it.
not_available Stop.
not_available Prepare the Internet feed.
not_available What are you going to do? l will tell the world of his crimes and carry out his sentence.
not_available Madam President, I just got word from C.T.U.
not_available Their tactical team is approaching the staging area.
not_available They also have real
not_available time uplink.
not_available Dalia and Kayla Îassan have asked to speak with you.
not_available They're in the waiting area.
not_available l was told you found my husband.
not_available Îe's being held in an apartment building.
not_available C.Î¤.U.
not_available is preparing to go in after him.
not_available Do they know if he's still alive? 
not_available We believe that he is, but we can't be sure.
not_available We have our best men in the field, and they're going to do everything they can to save your husband's life.
not_available But you cannot guarantee that he will be saved.
not_available l'm afraid not.
not_available But l assure you, we're going to do everything we can.
not_available Î¤hank you, Madam President.
not_available Madam President, we need you in the Situation Room.
not_available We'll know something very soon.
not_available N.S.A.
not_available just red
not_available flagged a live feed going out on the Internet.
not_available lt's President Hassan.
not_available Put it through.
not_available President Îassan is a traitor to his country.
not_available His belief that we must capitulate to the infidels nearly condemned our people to a life of subjugation.
not_available What follows is a list of his crimes.
not_available You will see that he deserves the harshest punishment.
not_available Hassan has tortured and sent his bulldogs on other leaders of the societythe scholars
not_available Does the video give us any clue to Hassan's location in the building? Look at the shadows behind his head.
not_available The light coming from the left is natural light.
not_available It's a window.
not_available You sure that's daylight? Yes.
not_available Î¤he light temperature is 5,600 degrees Kelvin.
not_available That's the building where Dana said Hassan is being held.
not_available Based on the angle of the shadows, they're in an east
not_available facing apartment.
not_available By the height of the surrounding buildings, they're on the fourth floor.
not_available Sir, the drone is in position.
not_available There are two lookouts on the roof.
not_available Patch me through to Jack.
not_available lt's Bauer.
not_available Jack, we've got a good fix on Hassan's location.
not_available We think he's in an east
not_available facing apartment on the fourth floor.
not_available We also confirm two lookouts on the roof, both armed, north and south corner.
not_available Copy that.
not_available You need to hurry, Jack.
not_available The terrorist is running a live Internet feed.
not_available Îe's reading a list of Hassan's so
not_available called crimes.
not_available As soon as he's done, he's going to execute him.
not_available We're at the staging area.
