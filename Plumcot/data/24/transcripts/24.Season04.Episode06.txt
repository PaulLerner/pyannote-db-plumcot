not_available For God's sake, pull yourself together.
not_available You didn't have to kill her.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Because you didn't have the courage to kill her yourself.
not_available Courage? To poison a girl who did no harm to you at all? This is my husband Navi.
not_available This is Debbie's mother.
not_available Is she here? 
not_available We haven't seen her since yesterday.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available Follow her.
not_available Make sure she doesn't go to the police.
not_available You're out of here.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Driscoll doesn't know you were helping me.
not_available She doesn't? I'm the one that got you into this.
not_available I'm not gonna sell you out.
not_available Tell me what I need to know.
not_available Richard, your father was kidnapped by terrorists.
not_available Our analysis shows that you're hiding something that might help us find him.
not_available There are people on the outside looking for us.
not_available You cannot give up.
not_available I have to do something while I still can.
not_available This trial is gonna be a spectacle, broadcast all over the world.
not_available Designed to humiliate and degrade this country.
not_available There's a gas pipe.
not_available You've checked out the briefcase? 
not_available It's fine.
not_available I was afraid it might be damaged in the train crash.
not_available The case is very strong.
not_available Get them out! Now! Hurry! Open the door, now! I know you.
not_available She recognized me.
not_available She has to be killed.
not_available Erin, I'm on site.
not_available Jack, stand down.
not_available What are you talking about? The president wants to take out the building with a missile strike.
not_available With the secretary and his daughter inside? 
not_available <ix>Yes.</ix> <ix>I'm sorry.
not_available You're gonna have to clear the area.
not_available Jack, don't go in there alone.</ix> <ix>Jack, clear the area! The building is going to be destroyed.</ix> James Heller, you have been brought before this court of law to stand trial as a war criminal.
not_available We will prove to the people of the world that these crimes against humanity are the direct result of the policies initiated by you in your capacity.
not_available Since the true extent of your evil legacy is immeasurable, we have done our best to document the acts witnessed directly by the chosen followers.
not_available Under your orders, the death squads of America continue their imperialist crusade against the true believers.
not_available How long till we're ready to launch the missile? Command and control is locking on target now.
not_available <ix>Mr.
not_available President? Erin Driscoll on line three.</ix> Mr.
not_available President, I'm calling to ask you to abort the missile strike.
not_available Based on what? 
not_available We are attempting a rescue operation.
not_available I was told the marine strike force was ten to 20 minutes away.
not_available They are, sir.
not_available Jack Bauer went in by himself.
not_available A terrorist group is moments from executing the secretary of defense in front of the world.
not_available I cannot allow that to happen.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available But if Jack can effect a rescue before that? In that case, I'll abort the missile strike, but he's running out of time.
not_available How long does he have, sir? Seven minutes.
not_available Try and make a sound and I'll blow your head off.
not_available This is a map of the complex.
not_available Where are they holding the secretary of defense? I'm either gonna kill you now or you're gonna tell me where they're staging the trial.
not_available Point.
not_available Now.
not_available Where's the secretary? <ix>There is no place in this world</ix> <ix>where your evil has not scoured the sacred land of the true word.</ix> <ix>Your imperialist legacy has devoured the lives of the innocent.</ix> <ix>Jack?</ix> Yeah? <ix>Keeler won't call off the missile strike.</ix> 
not_available How much time do I have? Less than six minutes.
not_available Did you get a thermal read on how many hostiles? We estimate 16.
not_available Jack I'm not turning back, Erin.
not_available Understood.
not_available Good luck.
not_available <ix>..
not_available the injustices he has committed.</ix> <ix>Obedience is a master who engages the world</ix> Stop this.
not_available Please.
not_available Just stop this, please.
not_available You've got to stop this.
not_available My father hasn't done anything to hurt you.
not_available He's an innocent man.
not_available Please.
not_available <ix>Your ignorant followers obey</ix> 
not_available He's innocent.
not_available Please.
not_available <ix>..
not_available while the true believers wait patiently.</ix> Please, listen to me.
not_available Please.
not_available No, no, wait.
not_available Please.
not_available You've got to stop it.
not_available Listen! Audrey? Behind you.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Jack.
not_available Are you all right? Did they hurt you? 
not_available I'm OK.
not_available You've got to stop them.
not_available I will.
not_available Get my father first.
not_available Go.
not_available Take this.
not_available Press the button on the handle.
not_available You use that if you have to.
not_available I'll be back for you.
not_available I promise.
not_available Jack.
not_available Finally, we hold you responsible for blasphemy.
not_available For desecrating holy lands and shrines.
not_available <ix>And for spilling the blood of our brothers.</ix> <ix>James Heller, your guilt on these charges is not a matter of dispute.</ix> <ix>I have here a full confession which you have signed.</ix> So now it is time for your sentence to be read and for the execution of that sentence to be carried out.
not_available James Heller, before the eyes of God, I sentence you to death.
not_available Carried out immediately.
not_available Call off the missile.
not_available Abort.
not_available Please confirm.
not_available He's doing it.
not_available There's one in the pipe.
not_available We gotta get Audrey.
not_available Down the hall.
not_available It's been aborted.
not_available Where are the marines? They haven't crossed the perimeter.
not_available I'll get an ETA.
not_available We're clear.
not_available She was here.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Move, move! Take the two shooters at your 11 o'clock.
not_available You ready? Ready! 
not_available Go! Gimme a clip.
not_available Jack! It went off my vest.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Keep firing.
not_available I'm out! I'm out too.
not_available It's the marines.
not_available Stay down.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary, stay down.
not_available Just stay down until this area's secure.
not_available Jack! Stand down! 
not_available Step back or I'll kill her.
not_available Put your gun down now.
not_available Step back! I'll kill her! I will kill her! Do it! Do it! OK.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Audrey, stay calm.
not_available Just relax.
not_available This is over.
not_available You are surrounded.
not_available You're right.
not_available But first you'll watch her die.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The president sends his gratitude.
not_available I'm just glad you both are all right.
not_available It's a while since you been in the field.
not_available You haven't skipped a beat.
not_available Audrey and I owe you our lives.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I've arranged transportation back to CTU.
not_available I'd like you and Audrey to be debriefed there.
not_available As long as we don't lose time finding out who these terrorists are and where they're from.
not_available I'll set up a live feed with the office in Washington.
not_available You won't miss a step.
not_available Those soldiers are waiting to take us to CTU.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How is she? A doctor needs to check out these contusions and she's dehydrated.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We should go.
not_available Where? I'm taking you and your father back to CTU.
not_available When I was inside, I recognized one of the men.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I can't place him, but I know that I saw him before today.
not_available They're gonna correlate a photo file of the casualties.
not_available Then you can make your ID.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Bauer.
not_available <ix>Agent Bauer, this is CTU.
not_available I've got Paul Raines on the line.</ix> <ix>He'd like to speak with his wife.
not_available Is she with you?</ix> Hold on one second.
not_available It's Paul.
not_available He wants to speak with you.
not_available Paul.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available <ix>Thank God.</ix> 
not_available Where are you? As soon as I heard about you and your father I got on a plane.
not_available You're in LA? <ix>Yeah, I'm at CTU.</ix> Audrey? 
not_available <ix>Yeah?</ix> See you soon.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available We need to go.
not_available You all right? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available OK.
not_available Make sure Edgar gets this.
not_available Got it.
not_available Find anything? I'm trying to connect to the feed from the site.
not_available Division's using up our bandwidth.
not_available Tell them to multiplex.
not_available We need to go through the debris.
not_available Now Heller's safe, we're no longer in first position.
not_available Ms Driscoll? 
not_available I took care of it.
not_available What's that? A list of pass codes for the FBI fiber.
not_available You can use their feed.
not_available How did you get that? 
not_available I used to consult there.
not_available Still have friends.
not_available I saw the load on the routing table and knew we'd run into a traffic jam.
not_available Good.
not_available Install it.
not_available Start cataloguing whatever's there.
not_available Anything that flags, promote it up to me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, if you let me, Curtis, I could help you a whole lot more.
not_available I don't even know why you have a problem with me.
not_available Cos I'm ambitious? OK, I'm ambitious.
not_available Aren't you? I don't sleep with people to get ahead in my career.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available I slept with you because I was attracted to you.
not_available I still am.
not_available Deal with it.
not_available <ix>The White House has confirmed that the interrupted video transmission</ix> <ix>was caused by a raid mounted by the marines and the Counter Terrorist Unit</ix> <ix>who rescued secretary of defense James Heller moments ago.</ix> 
not_available Of course I'm watching.
not_available <ix>Things look good.</ix> God willing our good fortune will continue for the rest of the day.
not_available What are you talking about? It's over, they found Omar.
not_available The government stopped the trial.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Then how can you say this is good fortune? Everything is ruined.
not_available You made me kill someone I cared about over nothing.
not_available No, not for nothing, Behrooz.
not_available The trial was only our first step.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available There were certain things we kept from you.
not_available What things? 
not_available Please.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available You forced me to kill my girlfriend.
not_available You owe me an explanation.
not_available I don't owe you anything.
not_available See who it is.
not_available See who it is.
not_available It's Tariq.
not_available Why is he here? Tariq.
not_available Behrooz, you remember Tariq? 
not_available Of course he does.
not_available I just spoke with Marwan.
not_available He assured me everything is on schedule.
not_available Why are you here? Your mother told Marwan you took care of the American girl? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then you need help getting rid of the body.
not_available I don't need help.
not_available I can do it myself.
not_available I'm sure you can, but we can't afford any more mistakes.
not_available Show Tariq where the body is.
not_available Go.
not_available OK, Agent Manning, this is the last of the bodies.
not_available You should see them now.
not_available All right.
not_available Got it.
not_available What's next? <ix>Here's some of the terrorist gear we collected out of the warehouse.</ix> 
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Stop.
not_available Go back.
not_available You need me to retransmit? No.
not_available In front of you, gimme a shot of that briefcase.
not_available This? Yeah, can you open it? 
not_available It's empty.
not_available Are there any identifying marks on it? 
not_available Some kind of logo engraved near the lock.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Zoom in.
not_available Make sure that's on the next transport.
not_available <ix>Will do.</ix> Sarah, I need a corporate logo search.
not_available I may have a link between the crash and the abduction.
not_available I'll send it now.
not_available We'll pick this up later.
not_available The man I recognized at the warehouse? I want to make that ID.
not_available As soon as you've been checked out I'll get the photos.
not_available Excuse me, Ms Raines.
not_available This way, please.
not_available It's all right, go ahead.
not_available I need you to handle this.
not_available I need to trust you'll take care of it.
not_available OK.
not_available Good.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available I need your station.
not_available Have Driscoll send me a pass code for the outside feed.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Does he know? About you and Jack.
not_available How long have you known? 
not_available Not until today.
not_available I'm surprised I hadn't figured it out till now.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available Paul and I were over before I started seeing Jack.
not_available Paul doesn't think it's over.
not_available Last time I spoke with him, he thought he had a second chance.
not_available That's more about fixing his wounded pride than fixing this relationship.
not_available So, he doesn't know about it? Not yet.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Ms Raines? Right through here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No, not till I get back.
not_available You have a thread connecting the bombing to the abduction? Yeah.
not_available About an hour ago.
not_available NTSB reported that a passenger was killed.
not_available But not as the result of the crash.
not_available He was shot at close range.
not_available Who is he? 
not_available Still trying to find out.
not_available He had no ID and his face and prints don't show up on any database.
not_available But whoever killed him stole something he had chained to his wrists.
not_available I think it may have been this.
not_available A witness on the train saw a man with a briefcase handcuffed to him.
not_available Take a look at the damage.
not_available Could've been sustained during the crash.
not_available We recovered this where Heller was being held.
not_available What are you telling me, the train bombing was a cover for the theft of this briefcase? What was in it? 
not_available It was empty.
not_available But we traced the corporate logo on the briefcase to McLennen
not_available Forster.
not_available The defense contractor? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you contacted them? Just got off the phone to their CEO.
not_available He stonewalled.
not_available Said before he disclosed anything we'd need clearance from the Department of Defense.
not_available The secretary should be able to get us whatever clearances we need.
not_available Let's get a printout of all this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available <ix>Our top story, only moments ago a second broadcast</ix> <ix>showing secretary of defense James Heller was put on the Internet.</ix> <ix>This image was captured from that broadcast.
not_available The transmission then ceased.</ix> <ix>At this time we have no confirmed report on why</ix> The girls mother went home.
not_available Even if she calls the police it will be too late.
not_available I heard the news in the car.
not_available Everything was accomplished? Yes.
not_available The trial was cut short, but it served its purpose.
not_available When they search the warehouse, will they figure out what we're doing? Doesn't matter.
not_available It's too late for them to stop it.
not_available If everything is working on schedule, why do you look so troubled? Where's Behrooz? He went to bury the girl.
not_available But his car is still in the driveway.
not_available He didn't take it.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available He went with Tariq.
not_available Tariq was here? My God, he's going to kill my son.
not_available My God.
not_available He's going to kill our son.
not_available Yes.
not_available I told Marwan that Behrooz took care of the girl.
not_available Marwan must not have been satisfied.
not_available He must have decided that Behrooz was a liability.
not_available How could you let this happen? How could you let them kill our son? What could I do? What could I do? 
not_available He's our son! Our flesh and blood.
not_available Dina, listen to me.
not_available How could you let them kill our son? Behrooz stopped being our son a long time ago.
not_available How can you say that? 
not_available Because it's true.
not_available Living here has changed him.
not_available He's been like a stranger to us.
not_available He proved it to me today, that he no longer believes in our cause.
not_available Maybe he never did.
not_available Behrooz.
not_available Behrooz.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Secretary Heller would like to say a few words to you.
not_available I'm incredibly privileged to have the finest people in the world behind me 
not_available all of you.
not_available It's gonna take a lot more than a few words to express my feelings, but for now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
not_available Curtis Manning, head of tactical.
not_available Curtis.
not_available An honor, sir.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available Erin, my daughter and I owe you our lives.
not_available Sounds like you had to make some tough calls, but you made the right ones.
not_available I'll see to it that you get full recognition for a job exceptionally well done.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Now, before we start the debriefing, I'd like to visit with my son.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available We're actually holding Richard here, sir.
not_available Why's that? When we brought Richard in, we gave him a polygraph.
not_available It indicated that he was possibly withholding information from us.
not_available About my kidnapping? We have wildly different political views, but I can't believe that he was involved.
not_available We don't think he had knowing participation.
not_available We believe he shared knowledge of your whereabouts with someone and he refuses to divulge that information or their identity.
not_available And what are you doing about that? We discussed a number of options.
not_available You have to understand the circumstances.
not_available Stop BS
not_available ing me.
not_available What did you do to him? A technique that's noninvasive 
not_available sensory disorientation.
not_available You subjected my son to SDT? Yes, but it was stopped the moment you were rescued.
not_available Jack, did you know about this? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available I want to see my son now.
not_available Of course.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Erin, I realize you've been under pressure these past few hours, but you'd better have cause for this.
not_available Jack? I appreciate you not involving the secretary in our differences on this operation.
not_available We both did what we thought was right.
not_available I'd like to put the past behind us, Jack.
not_available I could use your help.
not_available What do you need? I'd like you to function in Ronnie's position as head of field ops until we avert this crisis.
not_available Whatever I can do to help.
not_available Let me make one thing clear.
not_available Ronnie was under my command and you will be too.
not_available Understood.
not_available The photos from the warehouse, are they ready for Audrey? I believe so.
not_available I'll have Edgar port them to a work station.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dad.
not_available They said you were OK.
not_available Audrey too.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I said some awful things before.
not_available I was afraid I'd never get a chance to apologize.
not_available I said some pretty harsh things myself.
not_available But no matter what was said, you're still my son and I will always love you.
not_available Me too, Dad.
not_available They said they were using some interrogation techniques.
not_available <ix>They were totally out of line.
not_available I'm gonna sue them blind.</ix> I think it'll be a little more effective if you let me deal with it.
not_available I promise you, if they were out of line, heads will roll.
not_available What do you mean, "if"? Why did they think you were holding something back from them? I don't know.
not_available If you know something that would shed some light You don't think I'd tell them if I thought it was relevant? So there is something? 
not_available Now you're giving me the third degree? Son, do you have any idea what your sister just went through? If you know anything that would help us find the people behind this, tell me now.
not_available Dad.
not_available I'm glad you're alive, I really am.
not_available But I am not going to tell these people things about my private life they don't need to know.
not_available That you don't <ix>think</ix> they need to know.
not_available Richard, these people were trying to save our lives.
not_available These people can't be trusted! What they did to me is proof.
not_available Agent Manning, could you come in here, please? Agent Manning, I am authorizing you to do whatever you feel is necessary 
not_available to get this information out of my son.
not_available Dad.
not_available I love you, son, but I have a duty to my country.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available Dad! Bring the shovels from the back.
not_available Come on.
not_available Help me.
not_available They said it was OK to come in.
not_available Hi, Paul.
not_available My God, I was so worried.
not_available Are you hurt? 
not_available Just cuts and scrapes.
not_available Nothing serious.
not_available Sure? 
not_available Yeah, really.
not_available I'm OK, Paul.
not_available They've OKed me for my debriefing.
not_available On the flight over, I couldn't stop thinking about us.
not_available How, when we separated, we said that we'd both take time to figure out what we wanted.
not_available Now I know.
not_available Paul 
not_available I want us to be together again.
not_available I'm ready to work at it.
not_available I'll make our marriage the first priority.
not_available Just give us a chance.
not_available I'm sorry, Paul.
not_available That's not what I want.
not_available Audrey.
not_available I am a fool for bringing this up.
not_available You can't make decisions when you're in this state.
not_available Paul.
not_available I'm seeing someone.
not_available Well, how long has this been going on? Six months.
not_available Do you love him, or 
not_available Yes.
not_available Audrey? I'm sorry, excuse me.
not_available I'll come back later.
not_available No, um Paul, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available You're the one that saved Audrey's life.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Those photos are ready for you to look at.
not_available OK.
not_available Paul, we'll talk later? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You all right? Yeah.
not_available You ready to go? Not yet.
not_available Now I am.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available You're certain you saw this guy before? Positive, and I could tell that he recognized me.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available That's all of them.
not_available He must've gotten out before the rescue.
not_available We should go through them again to be sure.
not_available I will, but there are only two men here that aren't Middle Eastern and neither were him.
not_available What? 
not_available I remember where I saw him before.
not_available Where? There was a Heritage Foundation dinner about two months ago at the Hyatt.
not_available Do you remember his name? 
not_available No, but maybe I can get the guest list.
not_available Driscoll wants you in a conference call that starts in a minute.
not_available OK.
not_available Get hold of the Hyatt hotel security department.
not_available Access their archival surveillance.
not_available Audrey'll give you a date.
not_available Set a parameter, keep Driscoll informed.
not_available Be right back.
not_available It's hot.
not_available Argh! You brought me here to kill me.
not_available Why? Why are you doing this? I did everything they told me to do.
not_available You know why.
not_available I took care of the girl.
not_available Marwan knows.
not_available It's not Marwan who wants you dead.
not_available Then who wants me dead? Who? Who wants me dead? I want to know! Tell me! Your father.
not_available No! No! It's not true! No! No! Dad! Please! No! Mr.
not_available Reiss, I'm Erin Driscoll, director of CTU, Los Angeles.
not_available My colleagues Curtis Manning and Sarah Gavin are present.
not_available Also Jack Bauer, advisor to Secretary Heller.
not_available <ix>I hope you understand McLennen
not_available Forster couldn't give you details about that case</ix> <ix>until we received permission from DOD.</ix> Understood, Mr.
not_available Reiss.
not_available May we begin? What was your courier transporting? <ix>It's a device we developed under the NRC's emergency management programme.</ix> <ix>It's a Dobsontype override.</ix> What exactly does this override do? <ix>It can remotely take control of a nuclear power facility.</ix> Under what circumstances would the override be used? <ix>The government wants to control a plant's nuclear pile</ix> <ix>in case of a disaster necessitating evacuation.</ix> A person with this program, could they do the opposite? Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown? <ix>Theoretically, but possession of the override isn't enough.</ix> <ix>There are safeguards.</ix> What safeguards? <ix>Anyone using the override would have to hack into the reactor's firewall.</ix> <ix>That would take massive computer power, which NRC could see coming a mile away.</ix> Is it possible NRC could miss this due to heavy traffic on the Internet? 
not_available <ix>I don't follow.</ix> Less than an hour ago millions of computers were streaming the trial of the secretary of defense.
not_available Is it possible that this trial was just some kind of a Trojan Horse to disguise a massive attack on a nuclear power plant's firewalls? <ix>It might be possible.</ix> How many nuclear plants in this country would be vulnerable? <ix>All of them.</ix> 
not_available How many is that? <ix>At this time the United States has 104 nuclear power plants online.</ix> Assume they've used this override to take over the plants.
not_available Get me NRC and find Heller.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Set up a briefing.
not_available Get me NRC.
not_available Pipe it through here.
not_available I want all personnel in the conference area.
not_available Edgar, can you monitor my allocation tables for a few minutes? Sure.
not_available <ix>Yes?</ix> 
not_available It's me.
not_available <ix>You're on a secure line?</ix> 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'd have checked in sooner.
not_available This was my first chance.
not_available <ix>All right.
not_available Go on.</ix> They found out about the override.
