
not_available I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response.
not_available Until you have the component I have no choice but to continue on our present path.
not_available The man with the component no longer works with the Chinese.
not_available He's offered to trade it back to us and I've authorised the exchange.
not_available Phillip Bauer is a sociopath.
not_available We can't trust he'll give us the component, whether we give him the boy or not.
not_available What are you asking me to do, Karen? 
not_available Whatever it takes to stop the exchange.
not_available It won't be long before they figure out how I located Jack.
not_available They already have.
not_available They're probably on their way to arrest me.
not_available They're here.
not_available Send the kid down now.
not_available Show the sub
not_available circuit board first.
not_available I need to verify it.
not_available There they are.
not_available They've got Josh.
not_available I don't have a clear shot without putting Josh at risk! Get down! Get me the names and locations of every offshore oil platform within a ten
not_available mile radius.
not_available My father didn't pick this location at random.
not_available Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases through the CNC servers.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Can someone please help me? Darling? Darling? Can you hear me? Can someone please help me?! Joshua.
not_available I don't wanna be here with you.
not_available We're not staying here.
not_available I don't wanna go anywhere with you! 
not_available Look, Josh I don't expect you to understand everything, not now anyway.
not_available Someday you will, and you'll thank me for it.
not_available In the meantime, you'll do as you're told.
not_available Is that clear? Good.
not_available The submarine is on schedule.
not_available How soon before they pick us up? Her vitals are strong.
not_available She's in no immediate danger.
not_available Why did she collapse? 
not_available Dehydration, exhaustion.
not_available She hasn't slept in 36 hours.
not_available He said I'm fine, Morris.
not_available It's not a big deal.
not_available You should be at your work station.
not_available No, I should be right here with you.
not_available You should be checking the EPA database to see what oil platforms Phillip Bauer owns.
not_available Other people can do that.
not_available If you really wanna make me feel better, then go find Phillip Bauer.
not_available Are you sure you're all right? OK, then.
not_available Morris, is Chloe all right? 
not_available The doctor says she's gonna be fine.
not_available Jack was right about his father.
not_available One of his companies owns a lease on an oil platform six miles offshore.
not_available He has the boy? 
not_available That platform's been decommissioned.
not_available OK, give me the wheel, Nadia.
not_available Let's try a thermal scan, see if we can pick up any signs of life.
not_available That's crowded for a decommissioned platform.
not_available Can you back
not_available time the satellite imagery a few minutes? There, that must be Josh Bauer arriving.
not_available That would be 20 minutes after he was taken.
not_available Timing works.
not_available Send a copy of this to my screen and forward it to the White House.
not_available Get me Tom Lennox, please.
not_available Right away.
not_available Dr Hastings here.
not_available This is Morris O'Brian.
not_available Have Chloe O'Brian's test results come in yet? You just left here a few minutes ago.
not_available We're still running those tests.
not_available Well, when do you expect the results? Soon.
not_available Can you call me when you get them? I'm afraid I can't, not without Ms O'Brian's permission.
not_available I'm her husband.
not_available Ex
not_available husband.
not_available I'm sorry, but I can only share information with Ms O'Brian's family.
not_available Fine.
not_available Reports indicate the Russians are setting up an offensive position.
not_available They could attack at a moment's notice.
not_available That's correct.
not_available Sir, CTU have just located Phillip Bauer and a dozen or so confederates on an oil
not_available drilling platform six miles off the coast of Los Angeles.
not_available And he has the subcircuit board? 
not_available We're assuming so, sir.
not_available Pass this on to Suvarov.
not_available It'll buy us more time.
not_available Meanwhile I want an assault team despatched to that oil rig.
not_available Mr Vice President, if I may? 
not_available Go ahead, Ethan.
not_available If the platform is well
not_available defended, an assault team might run into trouble.
not_available I recommend an air attack.
not_available Two navy F
not_available 18s could obliterate that platform and everyone on it.
not_available What about the subcircuit board? 
not_available If it's not destroyed, it'll sink.
not_available The saltwater will render it useless in minutes.
not_available Tom? We think Phillip Bauer's grandson is on that same platform.
not_available Now, he might well survive a surgical strike by an assault team, but there's no way he'd live through this proposed aerial attack.
not_available We are talking about an innocent 16year
not_available old boy here.
not_available None of us like this, but if the Russians attack our base, a lot of innocent young men are gonna die.
not_available And an air strike would be the most effective from a political point of view.
not_available It'll show the Russians that we're sparing no effort to destroy the sub
not_available circuit board.
not_available Send the F
not_available 18s immediately.
not_available Yes, sir, Mr Vice President.
not_available You'll be all right.
not_available You'll make it.
not_available Jack, I'm sorry.
not_available You were following your orders.
not_available Get the kid.
not_available Get the kid, Jack.
not_available I will.
not_available Did you find my father? 
not_available Yes, on an oil platform six miles offshore.
not_available Is Josh with him? Thermal scan shows three people arriving 
not_available so it's highly likely he was one of them.
not_available Nadia, I wanna lead the assault team.
not_available There's not gonna be an assault team.
not_available What? I just got notification that the White House has ordered air strike by navy F
not_available 18s.
not_available The vice president thinks an assault team will take too long.
not_available When will it happen? 
not_available Less than 30 minutes.
not_available Look, I need you and Bill to come back to CTU on Aerial One for an immediate debrief.
not_available Jack? Fine.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available CTU located my father and Josh on one of the offshore oil platforms.
not_available There's no assault.
not_available They've launched an air strike.
not_available No one on that platform will survive.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available Jack, don't even think about it.
not_available You wanna get yourself killed? You won't save Josh.
not_available I realise he's your nephew.
not_available I'm not gonna do it because of that.
not_available I'm gonna do it cos he's an innocent kid being written off as an acceptable loss.
not_available It's wrong.
not_available Nadia's ordered us back to CTU on Chopper One.
not_available I'm gonna take it.
not_available I'll fly.
not_available You prep the weapons.
not_available It's been a while, but I can get us to the platform.
not_available With luck, I might get us back.
not_available You don't need to do this, Bill.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I don't wanna live with this one, either.
not_available Let's get ready.
not_available You're gonna need that.
not_available We're commandeering your helicopter.
not_available Get out.
not_available Now! Matching target coordinates.
not_available We'll be in range in 22 minutes.
not_available Sir, significant numbers of Russian troops have assumed a flanking position along the eastern rim of our military base.
not_available What am I to take from that? A tactical advancement like that indicates imminent attack.
not_available All right, put him through.
not_available Sir.
not_available You got Suvarov? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr President, this is Vice President Daniels.
not_available Mr Vice President, the last time we spoke, you said an opportunity had presented itself.
not_available Unfortunately, that didn't work out.
not_available But there has been a significant new development, and I'm asking you to hold off on any military assault on our base.
not_available For what reason, sir? The Chinese agents who are in possession of the component are on an oil platform off our West Coast.
not_available We assume they are there waiting transport to China.
not_available I've ordered an air strike to destroy the platform before that rendezvous can happen.
not_available I realise that you have no reason to accept what I'm telling you not without proof, but I implore you Mr Vice President, I believe you.
not_available Moments ago, one of our listening posts intercepted a transmission to a Chinese submarine operating in the western Pacific.
not_available The point of origin is ten miles off your coast.
not_available And the contents suggest the submarine is en route to pick up the component.
not_available Then you know that I'm telling you the truth.
not_available You say you've launched an air strike? Yes, that's the only way we can make certain that the component's been destroyed.
not_available Sir, we're prepared to give you a real
not_available time uplink to our satellite feed of the assault.
not_available One moment, please, sir.
not_available How long until your fighters reach the target? Less then 20 minutes, sir.
not_available Very well.
not_available But be advised, nothing less than the complete destruction of this oil platform will give us the assurance we require.
not_available Understood.
not_available Stand by, the satellite feed will be there momentarily.
not_available I wish you luck, Mr Vice President.
not_available The coastguard and the navy are patrolling a five
not_available mile perimeter around the target.
not_available I want real
not_available time updates.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll keep you in the loop.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Jack commandeered the chopper.
not_available He requested an uplink to our satellite feed.
not_available What? He's on the way to the oil platform.
not_available He's with Bill Buchanan.
not_available Aerial One, confirm.
not_available Come in.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available We copy.
not_available Jack, I know you wanna save your nephew, but I can't authorise a suicide mission.
not_available We don't need authorisation, we need help.
not_available Those F
not_available 18s will be in striking range in 18 minutes.
not_available What if we find the component first? 
not_available The strike team's orders are noncontingent.
not_available All you'll do is get yourselves killed.
not_available It's Bill.
not_available I understand the pressure you're under, but believe me, this is the right call to make.
not_available You need a visual on the oil platform? Yes.
not_available We need to know how many hostiles and where they are.
not_available Uploading the latest satellite capture.
not_available You'll have it.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Send it to my PDA.
not_available PDA, got it.
not_available Thank you, Nadia.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available Bill, I need you to put your comm unit in.
not_available How should I make our approach, Jack? 
not_available Wind's heavy out of the west.
not_available If we fly into it and stay low, we should be able to catch them off
not_available guard.
not_available It won't buy us much time.
not_available Engage them from the air.
not_available I'll hold them off so you can land, then we'll move in.
not_available The target is locked and acquired.
not_available Josh, we leave in 15 minutes.
not_available Please, just let me go.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Why not? Because I can't! You have a lot to learn.
not_available Now it's my responsibility to teach you.
not_available First lesson is, pay attention.
not_available What is it? There's a helicopter approaching.
not_available We need to get to the boat and head west.
not_available There's a locator beacon on board.
not_available The submarine will pick us up.
not_available Here, take the component.
not_available I'll see about the helicopter.
not_available I'll join you shortly.
not_available Let's go, Josh.
not_available Once we hit the deck, we're gonna have to move hard.
not_available You ready to move up? Ready! Take it up! You're clear to land! Don't move! Where's the boy? Where's the boy?! 
not_available You're too late.
not_available You're too late.
not_available Take this.
not_available Get him up to the chopper.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Making sure Josh isn't here.
not_available We only have ten minutes.
not_available Get up! Get up! Go! Go! Come on, Josh, stop it! 
not_available I can't.
not_available Of course you can.
not_available All it takes is a little self
not_available control.
not_available You're behaving like a child.
not_available You have to learn to control your emotions.
not_available You must never let them control you, you understand? Good.
not_available Come on.
not_available Target will be in range in four minutes, 30 seconds.
not_available I'm not going with you.
not_available You're not gonna shoot me.
not_available Give me the gun.
not_available Now.
not_available No! As long as you're alive, me and my mom will never be safe.
not_available Josh, listen to me.
not_available I've always cared about you.
not_available No! You only care about yourself.
not_available That's not true.
not_available You're the reason I'm doing all this.
not_available Shut up! 
not_available I love you, Josh.
not_available Argh! Josh! It's all right.
not_available I've got him.
not_available You can lower that weapon.
not_available Josh.
not_available Lower your gun.
not_available I know how scared and angry you must feel right now.
not_available I know.
not_available I've been exactly where you are.
not_available I know exactly how you feel.
not_available But trust me, you do not wanna live with the pain of taking another person's life, even if you think they deserve it.
not_available In a few minutes, there's gonna be an F
not_available 18 air strike here.
not_available We need to get out of here.
not_available We need to get out of here now.
not_available Please.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Just give me the gun.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over.
not_available I need you to get up to the top of the platform and get in the chopper now.
not_available Go.
not_available Move! What about you? 
not_available I'll be right behind you.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Get up.
not_available Get up! It's over.
not_available Then finish it.
not_available No.
not_available You are gonna be held accountable for what you have done today.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You don't have time to carry me.
not_available Not if what you said about the air strike is true.
not_available And you don't wanna die, not here.
not_available Not with me.
not_available You're gonna get off easy.
not_available CTU, this is Aerial One.
not_available My count shows the strike in two minutes.
not_available Negative, you have 90 seconds before those F
not_available 18s are within striking range.
not_available You need to get off that platform now.
not_available Bill, confirm.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Where's Jack? 
not_available He's with my grandpa.
not_available Get in.
not_available Mr Vice President, target is in range.
not_available Strike team reports missile lock.
not_available Take it out.
not_available Echo 64 is clear to engage.
not_available Echo 64, you are clear to engage.
not_available Wait! We can't leave without my uncle.
not_available We're not leaving.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Jack, I'm coming to the south, level three.
not_available Copy that, Bill.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Bill, I see you.
not_available I'm on the southwest corner.
not_available Fox one.
not_available Fox two.
not_available Aerial One, please confirm.
not_available Bill, please confirm.
not_available Bill, this is Nadia.
not_available Do you copy? CTU, this is Aerial One.
not_available We copy.
not_available I've got Jack and his nephew, and Cheng in custody.
not_available We're heading back to CTU.
not_available We'll have a landing crew standing by, sir.
not_available The strike team reports multiple direct hits.
not_available Satellite recon is reporting target is completely destroyed.
not_available Good work.
not_available Mr President, you're seeing what we see? Yes, we are.
not_available We concur that the target has been eliminated.
not_available Then I trust you're satisfied that the component's been destroyed as well? I am.
not_available I'm ordering the full withdrawal of our troops from the eastern rim of your military base.
not_available Good, Mr President.
not_available You will excuse me if I wait until your troops are withdrawn before I order our squadrons in the air to stand down? Yes, of course.
not_available And Mr Vice President, I regret that the events of this day have brought us to such a dangerous and unfortunate situation, but when my country's security is threatened I understand, Mr President, all too well.
not_available Yes, I'm sure you do.
not_available My best wishes for the recovery of President Palmer.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Goodbye, Mr Vice President.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available He fell.
not_available Uncle Jack fell! All right, I'm going back.
not_available He's all right.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available Back to CTU.
not_available No, we can't.
not_available We have to go back for him.
not_available Jack's not ready to go back yet.
not_available Sir.
not_available You should know, sir, we've received confirmation that the Chinese have recalled their sub to its base at Ningpo.
not_available Tell Admiral Smith to shadow them.
not_available I want them to know we're aware of their activities.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And thank you, Ethan, for everything.
not_available Extend my gratitude to the Joint Chiefs.
not_available Congratulations, Mr Vice President.
not_available Sir, not to quash your flush of victory here, the actions of the Chinese cannot go unaddressed.
not_available We'll leave that for another day, Tom.
not_available Right now, I don't know about you, but I could use some sleep.
not_available There's just one other outstanding issue I would like to discuss with you, sir.
not_available Karen Hayes? She's about to be transferred into FBI custody.
not_available Now, in light of the recent terrorist attacks, the nuke in California, the plot against the president, I just think we need to preserve whatever fragile faith the American people might still have in this administration.
not_available Just let Karen and Bill resign with their reputations intact.
not_available All right, Tom.
not_available Take care of that for me.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Here's that tape recording you asked for.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available How you feeling? 
not_available Good.
not_available Jack got the boy out.
not_available They're both safe.
not_available What about the Russians? They backed off.
not_available They were satisfied the component was destroyed.
not_available Jack's father? 
not_available He was killed in the air strike.
not_available And Cheng is in custody.
not_available Good.
not_available Look I was talking to Dr Hastings.
not_available He says the test results are in, but he's not telling me anything.
not_available He insists I talk to you.
not_available Is it serious? Yeah.
not_available Bloody hell, Chloe.
not_available Whatever it is, I'll help you get through it.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available We're not together.
not_available Oh, sod that.
not_available Really, come on, when you collapsed, I thought something might really be wrong.
not_available I can't lose you, darling.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah, really.
not_available I love you.
not_available OK.
not_available That's good, cos I'm pregnant.
not_available You mean what? With child? That's usually how it works.
not_available Chloe 
not_available You know, this is a nice moment.
not_available Let's not ruin it by saying something stupid.
not_available Let's just go back to work.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Tom? 
not_available Karen.
not_available You've come to say goodbye? 
not_available Well, in a manner of speaking.
not_available You're free to go.
not_available The vice president is dropping all charges against you.
not_available What about Bill? 
not_available He's being pardoned as well.
not_available The vice president still expects your resignations, but you're free to go live your lives without fear of prosecution.
not_available Is that suitable? Yes, yes, yes, it is.
not_available All right.
not_available Well, good luck.
not_available I know you had a hand in this, Tom.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know, Karen, I actually think I'm gonna miss you.
not_available Really? I can answer that better after you've gone.
not_available There's your mother.
not_available You'll be debriefed at a federal detention facility.
not_available My people will not abandon me like you abandoned Jack Bauer.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available It's good to see you again, sir.
not_available Good work today.
not_available You should be proud.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That means a lot coming from you.
not_available Where's Jack? He fell from the chopper into the ocean during the extraction.
not_available He made it to shore.
not_available He's fine.
not_available Why didn't you pick him up? 
not_available He didn't want me to.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available We need to find him.
not_available We'll never find him.
not_available Not if he doesn't want us to.
not_available Let him go.
not_available Somehow itjust doesn't feel real.
not_available But I am grateful that she's alive.
not_available Let me know if I can do anything.
not_available Of course.
not_available Anything at all.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Now.
not_available Are you here to kill me? 
not_available Depends.
not_available Where is Audrey? I told you, you're not getting anywhere near her.
not_available You do not tell me what to do any more! Do you understand me? You do not tell me what to do.
not_available I just watched my father die, and I felt nothing.
not_available You know why? Yeah, you know why.
not_available Because that man was dead to me years ago.
not_available I admired you.
not_available I looked up to you like a father.
not_available You were the kind of man I wanted to be, and you took advantage of it! 
not_available Jack, listen to me.
not_available No! You are gonna listen to me.
not_available Earlier today, you said that I was cursed, that anyone I touched ended up dead or ruined.
not_available How dare you? How dare you? The only thing I did, the only thing I have ever done, is what you and people like you have asked of me.
not_available Why didn't you try to get me out of China? 
not_available I did try.
not_available Not hard enough! You had the political power.
not_available Was the timing not right? Was it a little too complicated? Or was I just an acceptable loss? 
not_available Jack, I understand your anger.
not_available Shut up! You don't understand a thing about me.
not_available But I know you.
not_available I know why you're angry at me, and it wasn't because Audrey went to China to save me.
not_available It was because when you told her not to, she did it anyway.
not_available You'll never understand that kind of commitment, that kind of loyalty.
not_available You're right, Jack.
not_available It wasn't fair of me to put all this on you, to blame you for what happened to Audrey.
not_available I know the sacrifices you've made.
not_available I know this country owes you more than it'll ever repay.
not_available I'm not interested in what you think this country owes me.
not_available I want my life back, and I want it now.
not_available Audrey's all I've got, and you can't stop me.
not_available In case you've forgotten, I'm very good at disappearing.
not_available And if you try sending someone after us, I'll kill 'em.
not_available Pretty good at that too.
not_available Simply getting your life back, Jack, isn't gonna change who you are.
not_available And you can't walk away from it.
not_available You know that.
not_available You've tried it.
not_available Sooner or later, you're gonna get back in the game, and my daughter's gonna pay the price, like your wife did.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Jack.
not_available I beg you, just stop for a moment and think.
not_available Think, Jack.
not_available You won't be able to take care of her the way you want to.
not_available Where is she? Take me to her now.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's me.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I know that I promised to take care of you, and protect you, but I'm at a crossroads.
not_available Right now, the best way the only way to do that is to let you go.
not_available I hope one day you can understand that.
not_available I hope one day you can forgive me.
not_available I love you with all my heart.
not_available I always will.
