not_available Previously on 24.
not_available We need to pick him off to try and save the president.
not_available I'll make a run for the lockdown room.
not_available There are five canisters of CH4.
not_available All we need is one stray bullet.
not_available A suicide play, Jack.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available Don't you move! We have the president.
not_available The president is secure.
not_available I'm so sorry, Jack.
not_available I know that he was your friend.
not_available It was supposed to be me.
not_available Juma and his men were not working alone.
not_available Right now the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.
not_available He knew about the attack on the White House and chances are he's gonna know whoJuma was talking to.
not_available I'm thinking about bringing Olivia on as a special adviser.
not_available Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign.
not_available Leaking damaging personal information about your opponent to the press? 
not_available She's changed.
not_available It's not the past that concerns me.
not_available Do you think any of this would have happened if my mother had a chief adviser who knew what the hell was going on in her administration? I just got off the phone with Ethan Kanin.
not_available He's ordering me to let Bauer interrogate Burnett.
not_available Look, I didn't want to go behind your back, but you didn't leave me any choice.
not_available I want you to clean out your office and hand in your badge.
not_available I'm suspending you.
not_available Jack Bauer's on his way to Kennedy Memorial Hospital.
not_available Burnett will tell him everything.
not_available I've already sent somebody to the hospital to deal with Burnett.
not_available He can take care of Bauer at the same time.
not_available You lay one finger on him, it's over.
not_available Right.
not_available Juma's attack failed.
not_available He's dead, and so are his men.
not_available Somebody get me the hell out of here.
not_available You're not goin' anywhere.
not_available What happened? What's goin' on? 
not_available Damn it, Bauer, open the door! I want a high
not_available priority A.P.B.
not_available Issued forJack Bauer.
not_available Larry, it's Jack.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm being set up.
not_available Don't let 'em get away with this.
not_available This threat is not over.
not_available The following takes place between 9:00 p.m.
not_available And 10:00 p.m.
not_available I dropped my wife off here five hours ago and now no one can tell me where she is.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Brian, the White House has been attacked.
not_available We're in the midst of an urgent protocol.
not_available Exactly.
not_available That's why I'd like to know if my wife is all right.
not_available She is.
not_available She's fine.
not_available Where is she? Tell me.
not_available She's in a holding room on the third floor.
not_available What? She's been arrested.
not_available That's absurd.
not_available What's she charged with? I want to see her.
not_available I've already told you more than I should have.
not_available When Agent Moss returns, he'll tell you everything you need to know.
not_available In the meanwhile, I'm going to have to ask you to wait in the conference room.
not_available Okay? Please.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please escort him to the conference room.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Janis, Larry's calling for you.
not_available He says it's urgent.
not_available What line? 
not_available Three.
not_available You sign here verifying you understand the terms of your suspension and again here.
not_available Agent Walker? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available Larry, it's Janis.
not_available Ryan Burnett is dead.
not_available How? Bauer was interrogating him when it happened, and we're responsible.
not_available You're saying that Bauer killed Burnett? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available He escaped before I could get to him.
not_available He called me said he was being set up but he wouldn't come in.
not_available I lost him, Janis.
not_available I lost him, and it's on me to find him.
not_available Just tell me what you need.
not_available I already sent out a priority all
not_available agency A.P.B.
not_available I need you to follow up on that.
not_available I'm comin' back to the office right now.
not_available I'll coordinate a search operation from there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Open an all
not_available agency channel with flags for immediate action on Jack Bauer.
not_available I'll make sure the local police departments are linked in.
not_available On it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Janis, what did Larry say? Jack get anything out of Burnett? You're suspended.
not_available I cannot discuss this with you.
not_available Janis, this was my case.
not_available Tell me ifJack got anything out of Burnett.
not_available Burnett is dead.
not_available Well, tell me what happened.
not_available Bauer was there, and now he's missing.
not_available Janis, the channel's open.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's all I know, honestly.
not_available So please let me get back to work, okay? Please attach Jack Bauer's profile to the A.P.B.
not_available Gotcha.
not_available Walker.
not_available Renee, it's Jack.
not_available Don't hang up the phone, please.
not_available Whatever they told you, I did not kill Burnett.
not_available Renee? 
not_available Yeah? Bill was right.
not_available There are still very powerful people involved in this conspiracy that were not named on Dubaku's drive.
not_available They're trying to cover their tracks.
not_available They killed Burnett, and they're framing me for it.
not_available Even if I wanted to help you, Jack Larry has every law enforcement agency within a hundred miles looking for you 
not_available and I have been suspended.
not_available All I want you to do is make an I.D.
not_available I got a frame grab from the hospital surveillance.
not_available I sent you a photo of the man who did kill Burnett.
not_available It's in your in box.
not_available Renee, this man is the only connection I have to whoever else is involved in this thing.
not_available Please, I need your help.
not_available Look, I know you don't agree with some of the things I did today, but I'm telling you the truth.
not_available Renee? You know what? Forget it.
not_available I'm s
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I'll call you back at this number.
not_available Metro Police, this is the F.B.I.
not_available Reporting.
not_available We have a suspect, Jack Bauer, that's escaped custody.
not_available All available units, please respond.
not_available G16, G17 responding.
not_available Yes, Quinn? Bauer got away from the F.B.I.
not_available How? 
not_available Bauer's an extremely impressive operative.
not_available You don't have to tell me that.
not_available But the F.B.I.
not_available Has launched a major effort to apprehend him.
not_available He won't be able to avoid them for long.
not_available Well, we'll see, won't we? 
not_available Monitor the situation, keep me apprised.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available If Bauer connects us toJuma, it could seriously impede this operation.
not_available Yes, it could.
not_available Is the shipment on time? Yes.
not_available Due into port in the next hour.
not_available Then I don't foresee a problem.
not_available Once the weapons are deployed, then it doesn't matter what Mr.
not_available Bauer or anyone else knows.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Seaton I get no pleasure from the knowledge that people will die at our hands.
not_available One single soulthe loss of one soul
not_available is tragic to me let alone the numbers we're talking about.
not_available But do not forget that every war worth fighting involves collateral damage and what we're doing is fundamentally and absolutely necessary and I know you understand that.
not_available Of course.
not_available Wake up our colleagues and have them assembled in one hour.
not_available And tell them to pack their pajamas and their toothbrushes.
not_available It's gonna be a long night.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I have an I.D.
not_available Who is it? John Quinn
not_available black ops combat vet, served tours all over the world.
not_available Now he works for Starkwood.
not_available The defense consultants? Uh, yeah.
not_available They started out as consultants.
not_available But over the past few years, while you were out of the country the Pentagon outsourced billions of dollars in contracts to them.
not_available What kind of contracts? Manpower.
not_available Starkwood's basically a private army.
not_available They recruit ex
not_available soldiers and SWAT team members from around the world then they hire them back to the military as security teams.
not_available We're talking thousands of men deployed here and abroad.
not_available Starkwood work with Juma? Well, if they did, it wasn't on the books.
not_available But you know, if anyone knows, it's Senator Mayer.
not_available Why Mayer? After he dismantled C.T.U., he launched several other investigations.
not_available One of them's been looking at Starkwood.
not_available What were they accused of? 
not_available The hearings are classified but supposedly Mayer has enough to put them out of business.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna need to talk to him.
not_available See if you can access the C.I.R.G.
not_available Iogs.
not_available They should have a location on him.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll send you Mayer's location as soon as I have it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Agent Walker still here? 
not_available She was just in her office.
not_available But there's somebody waiting to see you in the conference room.
not_available They need to
not_available Just have a few more forms to fill out, then I'm taking off.
not_available Did you hear what happened at the hospital? After everything thatJack's done today do you really believe that he murdered Burnett? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available L
not_available I don't care.
not_available He's a federal fugitive and needs to be found.
not_available But you think it's possible that he did this? 'Cause I'm not sure that I do.
not_available It's been a long day.
not_available Go home.
not_available Get some sleep.
not_available Call you in the morning.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me, Larry.
not_available Morris O'Brian is waiting in the conference room.
not_available He wants to know why his wife is in holding.
not_available Renee talked to Bauer.
not_available How do you know? Access her phone log for the last 15 minutes.
not_available And get into her workstation to find out what she's been doin'.
not_available All right.
not_available Want to catch Bauer, she's our best shot.
not_available Okay.
not_available We've received confirmation that President Taylor will be making a statement to the country shortly.
not_available She is expected to address the attack on the White House that ended an hour ago in a startling rescue.
not_available Now, based on the few details we have we do know the rescue resulted in the death of General Juma and all ofhis forces.
not_available Angela, how much lead time does the media need once I'm finished with my revisions? The major outlets will put us on immediately.
not_available I'll be done shortly.
not_available Thank you, Angela.
not_available I have a thought about the speech, if you'd like to hear it.
not_available Of course.
not_available Right now, your main thrust is reassurance.
not_available The attacks are behind us.
not_available Everything's going to be back to normal.
not_available But I think you're missing an opportunity here.
not_available To do what? 
not_available Claim victory.
not_available To say thatJuma's death means standing up to tyranny works and that your decision to send troops into Sangala was the right one.
not_available I'm not sure that this is the appropriate time to sound triumphant, Livy.
not_available A lot of lives were lost today.
not_available And by addressing those deaths, you give them meaning.
not_available Those people are heroes who died in a war that was worth fighting.
not_available Let's work it in.
not_available Come in.
not_available Madam President, I have some troubling news.
not_available May I speak with you alone? You may speak freely in front of Olivia.
not_available Just after the attack on the White House Jack Bauer came forward with a disturbing claim.
not_available He said there were people still at large who were involved in the conspiracy
not_available persons unknown who had helped Juma plan and execute the attacks.
not_available Did Bauer have any evidence of this? 
not_available Nothing concrete.
not_available But he promoted the notion that Ryan Burnett was our best chance of identifying these people and Bauer asked to be allowed to question him.
not_available This was supposed to be a controlled situation
not_available a ploy to intimidate Burnett into giving up intel.
not_available So I granted Bauer's request.
not_available It was a terrible mistake.
not_available What happened, Ethan? 
not_available Burnett is dead.
not_available My God.
not_available The evidence suggests that
not_available that he was killed by Bauer.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available His claim of another party being involved in the attacks 
not_available appeared to have been a fabrication.
not_available A fabrication.
not_available It may have something to do with Bill Buchanan's death.
not_available No one knows.
not_available But Madam President, I take full responsibility.
not_available I was trying to insulate you to provide you with deniability in case anything went wrong.
not_available Or was it because you thought the president would say no? Olivia.
not_available Where is Bauer now? 
not_available At large.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Is devoting its full resources to the manhunt.
not_available Let me know the minute they find him.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President I'm sorry.
not_available Looks like everything.
not_available She's on the move.
not_available Where's Bauer? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Don't you lie to me.
not_available We traced two calls from your cell to a phone that was reported stolen.
not_available And we know you accessed a classified government database and sent someone's name and address to Bauer.
not_available Renee, that makes you an accessory after the fact.
not_available Now tell me where he is.
not_available I can't.
not_available Damn it! I still don't believe that he did this.
not_available Then explain to me why he's not turning himself in and letting us help him find this mysterious third party.
not_available Because he was framed, and he doesn't trust our ability to work through it.
not_available And you know, after what we've put him through, how can you blame him? You're actually willing to sacrifice everything to protect him.
not_available OnceJack finds the evidence, he will call us.
not_available You know, Janis is decrypting what you sent.
not_available It's not gonna take her a long time.
not_available We are going to find him.
not_available Renee, tell me whose information you sent.
not_available I'll let the A.G.
not_available Know that you're cooperating.
not_available I'm sorry, Larry.
not_available Put her in holding.
not_available Mirandize her.
not_available Night, Senator.
not_available I'll see you in the morning.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Keep your hands where I can see them, Senator.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available I know what you did to Ryan Burnett.
not_available I'm not gonna let you butcher me like you did him.
not_available You want me dead, Bauer, you'll have to kill me where I stand.
not_available If I wanted to kill you, Senator, you'd be dead already.
not_available Now take a seat.
not_available You're a real enigma, Bauer.
not_available An hour after you save the president from terrorists you murder a federal witness in cold blood.
not_available I didn't kill Burnett.
not_available This man did.
not_available Do you know who he is? 
not_available No.
not_available His name is John Quinn.
not_available He works for Starkwood.
not_available What in the world does Starkwood have to do with this? I don't know yet, but I do know they sent someone to kill Burnett and frame me to cover up their involvement in everything that's happened today including the attack on the White House.
not_available That's a hell of a theory, Bauer.
not_available But you'll have to spin a better story than that if you expect it to get you off the hook.
not_available Senator, I did not come here to clear my name.
not_available I'm trying to understand the connection between Juma and Starkwood.
not_available There isn't one.
not_available I've spent the better part of six months investigating Starkwood.
not_available If there was a connection toJuma or Sangala, I would know it.
not_available I want to see every file you have concerning that investigation.
not_available Look
not_available Starkwood has let their security teams run amok all over the world, with no oversight.
not_available They've bribed their way into large contracts.
not_available They've tried to influence foreign policy to their own benefit.
not_available All good reasons why this country should not be outsourcing its military operations to private corporations.
not_available And I am going to shut them down.
not_available But there is nothing to remotely suggest they'd be involved in terrorist attacks on their own country
not_available for any amount of money.
not_available Maybe they have different reasons for helping Juma.
not_available Like what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Sir, I believe this country is still under attack, and there has to be a reason.
not_available And I'm supposed to believe this coming from a man who's holding me hostage? I need access to those files.
not_available And if the connection between Juma and Starkwood isn't there will you turn yourself in then? Just open the files, sir.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, the president will be making a brief statement.
not_available Good luck, Mom.
not_available I'm sure you'll understand based on the events of today, there will be no opportunity for follow
not_available up questions.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available My fellow Americans John Adams, the first president to take up residence in the White House once prayed for heaven to bestow its blessings on this place.
not_available Tonight, those blessings have seen us through a brutal attack by a desperate tyrant.
not_available We have lost friends and loved ones here but we have prevailed.
not_available I have commanded law enforcement agencies emergency services and first responders to keep their deployment levels at maximum
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin, Ken Dellao, CNB.
not_available I'm wondering if you can confirm some information I received a short time ago.
not_available Ken, this is clearly not the time.
not_available I'mI'm gonna be reporting in this evening's broadcast that a rogue ex
not_available federal agent named Jack Bauer is the prime suspect in the murder of Ryan Burnett.
not_available and cannot forget today's events.
not_available The lives we lostWhere'd you get this? So it's true then? 
not_available I'm not confirming anything.
not_available I'll also be reporting that you authorized Bauer's release from custody and arranged for his access to the victim.
not_available .
not_available Fathers, mothers, daughters and sons brothers and sisters, but they have not taken our spirit.
not_available Make no mistake, today's attacks were intended to crush our resolve
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin? 
not_available I said no comment.
not_available But America is not so easily broken.
not_available Our military action in Sangala has been a success.
not_available At this hour, our forces have taken control of Sangala City.
not_available We have won.
not_available I see you're back to your old tactics.
not_available What? You leaked the story of Burnett's murder and my involvement to the press.
not_available Ethan, I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available all our men and women, to the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
not_available Olivia, don't bother denying it.
not_available I can count on one hand the number of people who knew I had authorized Bauer's release.
not_available So another one of your errors in judgment bites you on the ass and you think you can lay the blame on me.
not_available Do you realize what you've done? In trying to hurt me you'll have caused tremendous damage to your mother.
not_available The president has gone on record that torture is unacceptable under any circumstances.
not_available When this gets out, it'll look like Bauer was sent exactly for that.
not_available It'll be a political disaster.
not_available You've gone too far this time.
not_available I'm not listening to you anymore.
not_available I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
not_available Get your hands off me.
not_available As Americans, we should stand together, proud of what we have achieved.
not_available Thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of so many this place, our national home stands tall tonight and all our citizens can sleep soundly with the knowledge that the blessings of freedom continue to shine upon us all.
not_available No, there's been no sign of Bauer in the northeast sector so expand your cordon to the 25
not_available mile mark.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Will do.
not_available And be prepared to back up Metro.
not_available I'm directing them to begin random traffic stops citywide.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah? I isolated the data Renee uploaded to Bauer 
not_available but I can't get past the file header.
not_available What does that mean? She encrypted the name and address she used, and I can't seem to crack it.
not_available You can't? 
not_available She used her personal computer.
not_available This is very serious encryption.
not_available I mean, there are some high
not_available level people who can do it.
not_available Like who? Chloe O'Brian, but from what you've told me, she's too loyal to Bauer.
not_available Is her husband still here? 
not_available Yeah, he's waiting to see you.
not_available According to her file, he's a Level Six analyst too.
not_available I have no idea how much longer I'm gonna be here.
not_available Just do me a favor and give Prescott his baboo before you put him down.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Yeah, I'm gonna have to call you back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Brian, I'm Larry Moss.
not_available Yeah, I'd like to see my wife.
not_available All right.
not_available What the bloody hell are you holding her for? Obstruction, evidence tampering.
not_available I think you should be more concerned about what you can do to get her out.
not_available Sorry? 
not_available Help us find Jack Bauer.
not_available Last I heard from Chloe, Jack was working for the Bureau.
not_available That's you, if I'm not mistaken.
not_available He was, until he snapped and murdered a federal witness.
not_available Really? I find that hard to believe.
not_available All that's relevant here is that your wife is gonna be prosecuted for colluding with Bauer unless you help us find him.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Brian? A short time ago, one of our agents was in touch with Jack Bauer.
not_available She sent a name and address that we assume is his next destination.
not_available Unfortunately, it's encrypted with Blowfish 148.
not_available No one here knows how to crack that.
not_available Therefore, we need your help.
not_available Please.
not_available You have to understand something.
not_available Jack Bauer and my wife have a very long history.
not_available I consider him to be a friend.
not_available And he'll have his day in court.
not_available But the case against your wife is rock solid.
not_available I can't.
not_available We're talking about her serving a minimum sentence of 15 years.
not_available Your son will be 19 by the time she gets out of prison.
not_available I want guarantees of full immunity, no jail time expulsion of all charges from her record.
not_available You have my word.
not_available You are a witness to this agreement.
not_available Yes.
not_available Show me the file.
not_available Original informationThirty
not_available two.
not_available Native or modified data points? 
not_available Native.
not_available The designer of this algorithm built a back door into his code.
not_available Decryption's a piece of cake if you know the override codes.
not_available And you do? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Will this take long? 
not_available Course not.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Brian, can you tell me specifically when you'll have the file decrypted? Yes.
not_available Now.
not_available Your agent sentJack to 951 Deerbrook Avenue, Georgetown
not_available residence of Senator Blaine Mayer.
not_available Assemble the field teams.
not_available Tell them we have a probable location on Bauer.
not_available And get Metro P.D.
not_available On the way.
not_available No luck reaching Mayer on his cell or at the house.
not_available The phone company said the line was shorted out on site.
not_available Yeah, it's Bauer.
not_available Why is he doing this? Maybe because Mayer spent the last six months trying to send Bauer to prison for the rest of his life.
not_available All right, Metro P.D.
not_available Is closing in on Mayer's residence.
not_available I've authorized them to move in as soon as they're in position and at strength.
not_available I told them, and I'm telling you, it is impossible to overestimate Bauer.
not_available He has more training and more experience than anybody in this room, and that includes myself.
not_available Okay, let's move.
not_available Agent Moss will be running on
not_available point tactical with F.B.I.
not_available Teams on five.
not_available All units must register and log their comm through me and I will distribute recognition codes and credentials.
not_available I can't believe you.
not_available You're helping them catch Jack? 
not_available I did it for you.
not_available This is the last thing I would've wanted.
not_available How could you do this? 
not_available Let's see.
not_available For a start, I thought it might be nice to spare Prescott the inconvenience of having a convict for a mother.
not_available Jack saved your life.
not_available I don't deny that I owe him.
not_available But my child and my marriage comes first 
not_available and it should for you too.
not_available Chloe, love.
not_available You've helped Jack enough.
not_available You have.
not_available And you can't go deciding to make this sacrifice 
not_available on your own anymore.
not_available But he didn't do what they're saying he did.
not_available Then he can prove that when they take him into custody.
not_available If they give him the chance.
not_available At the hearing this morning, you said you had no regrets about what you've done but what I saw was a man full of regret.
not_available Of course I have regrets, Senator.
not_available I regret losing my family.
not_available My wife was murdered because I was responsible for protecting David Palmer during an assassination attempt.
not_available My daughter can't even look at me.
not_available Every day, I regret looking into the eyes of men, women and children knowing that any moment their lives might be deemed expendable in an effort to protect the greater good.
not_available I regret every decision or mistake I might have made that resulted in the loss of a single innocent life.
not_available But you know, what I regret the most is that this world even needs people like me.
not_available So you think I'm naive to believe we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard of conduct? Doesn't even matter what I think, Senator.
not_available You just need to understand, where I work things get a lot messier than where you work on the Hill.
not_available What you've lost, Mr.
not_available Bauer, is tragic.
not_available What you've been compelled to do in the name of saving innocent life is tragic.
not_available But sometimes we need to incur the most horrible losses in order to uphold the ideals that this country was founded on.
not_available How can we presume to lead the world unless we set an example? 
not_available You make it sound so simple.
not_available Well, maybe it's simpler than you think.
not_available Maybe all the things that you've seen and all the things that you've done have clouded your vision.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Tell me about this car accident.
not_available That has nothing to do with Juma.
not_available Who was the victim? 
not_available Source inside of Starkwood.
not_available A whistle
not_available blower.
not_available Unfortunately, he was also a drunk.
not_available He was killed when he wrecked his car on the way home from Atlantic City.
not_available Blood alcohol off the charts.
not_available Senator, this was no accident.
not_available Your informant was murdered by the same man who took Ryan Burnett out this evening.
not_available What does this mean, Bauer? 
not_available They were scared of what he had to say.
not_available What did your informant have on Starkwood? He made a lot of wild accusations, but not a single one of them panned out.
not_available Maybe you didn't dig deep enough.
not_available Senator, I need to know exactly what he told you.
not_available He alleged that Starkwood was blackmailing Pentagon officials that they were involved in assassination plots even that they were seeking to acquire their own W.M.
not_available D Specifically what? 
not_available Well, I don't remember, but I'm sure that his interview transcript should be there.
not_available Okay, I got it.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available That's it.
not_available What? 
not_available Your informant claims that Starkwood was trying to acquire a bioweapon.
not_available That's your connection toJuma.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available When Juma was in power, it was rumored that he was running an illegal weapons program.
not_available He was developing a bioweapon, but nobody could prove it.
not_available But the people that I knew in Sangala believed he was testing these weapons on his own population.
not_available He used a remote village, released some kind of pathogen.
not_available Everyone there was struck with dementia, paralysis, and eventually died.
not_available Why wasn't this pursued? 
not_available BecauseJuma destroyed all the evidence.
not_available He firebombed the village before anyone could get there.
not_available And U.N.
not_available Officials had a hard time believing thatJuma had the technology or expertise to develop such a weapon.
not_available But Starkwood, they had both
not_available the technology and the expertise.
not_available And what did Juma have to offer Starkwood? A safe haven to develop the weapon, and an endless supply of victims to test it on.
not_available Even if all this was true why in the world would Starkwood want a bioweapon? Senator, you've been trying to dismantle Starkwood for the last six months.
not_available Maybe they planned on fighting back.
not_available But regardless, if they have a weapon like this you better believe they intend to use it.
not_available Senator Mayer.
not_available It's Metro P.D.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold up.
not_available You're obviously onto something.
not_available They can help you find the evidence you need to prove your case.
not_available Right now, everyone thinks I killed Ryan Burnett.
not_available No one's gonna listen to me.
not_available I can protect you.
not_available I can order them to help us.
not_available Starkwood infiltrated the White House.
not_available As soon as they find out you're goin' after them for a bioweapon 
not_available they'll bury the evidence.
not_available Then we'll keep the circle small.
not_available I can make this happen.
not_available It's time for you to start trusting the institutions that you've sacrificed so much to protect.
not_available Trust isn't my greatest asset.
not_available Son, you have to start somewhere.
not_available Senator, it's Metro P.
not_available D! Do you really think you can do this? I know I can.
not_available Let 'em in.
not_available No! 
not_available You wanted to see me? Yes, Livy.
not_available Ethan's just come to me with something very disturbing.
not_available I assume it's about the press leak regarding Jack Bauer.
not_available Ethan seems to think you had something to do with it.
not_available I didn't.
not_available I already told him that.
not_available Well, given the past experience between the two of you, he's not convinced.
not_available And what do you think? I think I need to hear what you have to say.
not_available There's nothing she can say, Madam President.
not_available She was one of the few people who knew all the details.
not_available More people knew than you think.
not_available I just got off the phone with the White House segment producer at CNB.
not_available He won't give me the source's name, but he's willing to confirm that the leak came from someone inside the federal marshal's office.
not_available He'll guarantee it didn't come from the White House
not_available or from me.
not_available This is verifiable? Producer's name is Charlie Isakson.
not_available Here's his number.
not_available You can call him yourself, if you'd like.
not_available I offered Isakson some exclusive time with you if he killed the story, and he agreed.
not_available So as long as we get Bauer in custody we should be able to keep the fallout contained.
not_available Ethan, under the circumstances, I think it seems clear that you were mistaken.
not_available I'm satisfied.
not_available A re you? Yes, Madam President.
not_available I'm sorry, Olivia, if I misjudged the situation
not_available and you.
not_available I want to know if the F.B.I.'s any closer to finding Bauer.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available That's all.
not_available I'm sorry I put you on the spot like that.
not_available I understand.
not_available Ethan didn't give you much of a choice.
not_available I just hope they find Bauer before this gets any worse.
not_available You're dying.
not_available Just tell me where the weapons are coming in.
not_available When are they getting here? They're already here.
not_available Shut it off 
not_available Janis, it's Larry.
not_available We got here too late.
not_available Bauer murdered Senator Mayer.
not_available Escalate the search for him to region wide.
not_available I want reinforcements from every branch within 50 miles brought into this.
not_available Copy that.
not_available At this point, orders are to shoot on sight.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available Jack, I've been monitoring the F.B.I.
not_available Bandwidth.
not_available What the hell's goin' on? 
not_available Listen, I need your help.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Third Street and B.
not_available Okay, listen to me.
not_available I need you to meet me at the Port of Alexandria.
not_available I need you to bring your weapons and a surveillance package.
not_available Get there as soon as possible.
not_available Jack, wait.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I'm en route.
