
not_available The Russian people join you in mourning President Hassan.
not_available We both know the opposition that undid him had outside help.
not_available I just got off the phone with the Russian foreign minister.
not_available He said that he would be coming to the United Nations in five hours with the Russian premier to sign the treaty as scheduled.
not_available The credit for that is all yours.
not_available LOGAN: It's good to be back in the game.
not_available Elements inside the Russian government were behind both the assassination of President Hassan and the supply of nuclear material to his enemies.
not_available TAYLOR: The Russian government? The Russians inserted Dana Walsh at CTU months ago.
not_available She's their agent.
not_available If Bauer gets to her, this will all be finished.
not_available I want to know who killed Renee Walker.
not_available WALSH: Renee's dead? I'm sorry.
not_available You're sorry? I can give you the hitter.
not_available I want more than just names; I want proof! I have proof.
not_available An audio file.
not_available Film.
not_available Where? First I want my immunity deal back.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I won't give Dana Walsh immunity.
not_available I believe she knows the names of the people who facilitated the assassination of President Hassan, people working within the Russian government.
not_available TAYLOR: I won't allow it.
not_available You don't want to know the truth.
not_available What I want is to keep the Russians at the table.
not_available Allegations of this sort will drive them away.
not_available I've arranged a helicopter to fly you from CTU to McGuire Air Force Base.
not_available You're locking me down.
not_available I'm taking this helicopter.
not_available Tell your men to drop their weapons or you're gonna die.
not_available Out of the copter now! All security to the helipad.
not_available Security to the helipad now.
not_available Call the FAA, Air Force, say that we have a stolen helicopter that needs to be intercepted and forced down.
not_available WINNICK: Yes, ma'am.
not_available CHLOE (over comm): Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available What are you doing? Talk to me.
not_available Jack, talk to me.
not_available Can you hear me? Yeah, he can hear you.
not_available Comm's on, he's just not answering.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Air Force choppers are closing in on his position.
not_available PILOT: Mr.
not_available Bauer, you are ordered to turn the aircraft around and return to CTU.
not_available I repeat, turn the aircraft around now.
not_available Jack's descending.
not_available Air Force choppers are in pursuit.
not_available CHLOE: Jack, this is crazy.
not_available Come back to CTU.
not_available NYPD, this is Ranger One.
not_available Suspect just landed on the Cooper Building.
not_available We're gonna circle and maintain visual contact.
not_available DISPATCHER: Copy that.
not_available We're cordoning off a two
not_available block radius around the building.
not_available We have a visual on NYPD.
not_available Two units approaching the building.
not_available They're one block out.
not_available Suspect's on the fire escape.
not_available He's descending to ground level.
not_available We've lost him.
not_available Attempting to reacquire.
not_available Dispatch, this is unit 27.
not_available We're at the building, but we've lost the suspect.
not_available DISPATCHER: Copy.
not_available We'll widen the perimeter.
not_available What the hell is Jack doing? He's not letting this go, that's what he's doing.
not_available Dana told him she has proof about the Russians.
not_available He'll probably come after her.
not_available That's crazy.
not_available She's locked down.
not_available Jack knows he can't get to her.
not_available He'll either figure it out or he'll die trying.
not_available I want you in the field.
not_available Meet with NYPD and coordinate an interagency search.
not_available Bring in whoever you need.
not_available Yep.
not_available Arlo, use satellite and traffic cam.
not_available Maybe we can track him from here.
not_available On it.
not_available Keep me looped in on the search status.
not_available No, I don't want to be updated in ten minutes.
not_available I want a real
not_available time uplink.
not_available They still haven't been able to lock Jack down.
not_available They lost him.
not_available He landed the chopper and escaped on foot.
not_available NYPD is securing a perimeter.
not_available CTU is coordinating an interagency search.
not_available If Jack gets this evidence and exposes the Russians, the agreement is over.
not_available The peace agreement may not be the only casualty.
not_available Madam President, you covered up the Russians' involvement.
not_available That's grounds for impeachment.
not_available Possibly a criminal indictment.
not_available You crossed a line, Madam President.
not_available But it may not be too late to step back and limit the damage.
not_available How? Expose the Russians.
not_available Grant Dana Walsh immunity in exchange for evidence.
not_available We'll launch an investigation through transparent international channels.
not_available Which will effectively end the peace deal.
not_available But it will save your administration.
not_available There is still a chance CTU will find Jack.
not_available Even if they do, the evidence is still out there.
not_available Eventually, it will surface.
not_available Allison I know better than anyone how much this means to you.
not_available How much you've sacrificed personally to make it happen.
not_available Ethan, we are so close.
not_available And we will be again.
not_available If not during your administration, then during the next one.
not_available I wish I could believe that.
not_available Ethan, I want you to prepare a statement announcing our withdrawal from this accord.
not_available We have a a press conference in 40 minutes.
not_available I'll make the announcement then.
not_available As hard as this is, you're doing the right thing.
not_available Madam President.
not_available It's over, Charles.
not_available I've decided not to go through with the peace deal.
not_available Because of Bauer.
not_available Because the evidence implicating the Russiansevidence that I helped cover upis
not_available is potentially too lethal.
not_available I agree, Madam President.
not_available Doesn't sound like you have much of a choice.
not_available I'm surprised.
not_available I expected more of a fight from you.
not_available I'm nothing if not pragmatic.
not_available Although I am disappointed.
not_available I'm afraid you have to find some other way to repair your legacy.
not_available My own personal disappointment aside, it's a loss for the world.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Ethan's drafting my statement.
not_available I need to call Dalia Hassan.
not_available Hope that she'll forgive me for keeping the truth from her.
not_available Before you do, there is one thing you might consider.
not_available A way to preserve the peace deal.
not_available The peace deal is over.
not_available You said so yourself.
not_available I said it was over if the evidence comes out.
not_available Obviously, you can't grant Walsh immunity.
not_available The evidence would become public record.
not_available You need to control the evidence by keeping Walsh off the grid.
not_available Off the grid? Classify her as an enemy combatant and incarcerate her in a private facility.
not_available There is a private security firm I can recommend.
not_available They're effective and discreet.
not_available I have them standing by.
not_available Sounds like you've been giving this a lot of thought.
not_available Madam President, this evidence is hanging over your head.
not_available You need to deal with it.
not_available We can't keep Walsh locked up indefinitely.
not_available You wouldn't have to.
not_available Ms.
not_available Walsh may not give up the information willingly, but she will give it up.
not_available And once we have it, it won't matter what she claims.
not_available You're talking about using physical coercion.
not_available I know how deeply this offends your public and private sensibilities.
not_available It is repugnant, even immoral.
not_available But isn't morality relative, considering what's at stake here? You are still talking about torture.
not_available I'm talking about preserving a peace accord that is crucial to the security of this nation.
not_available And that can only happen if you acquire and control the evidence.
not_available Believe me, Madam President, I don't make these suggestions lightly.
not_available I appreciate the implications.
not_available I've tried to be as open and candid with you as I've been with anyone.
not_available And the truth is, I regret many of my own actions when I was president.
not_available But I've also had the time and the distance to see past them to a place of clear and deep understanding.
not_available What do you understand, Charles? Wielding the kind of power that I once had and you have now can change the world.
not_available But that often requires making impossible choices that challenge our most sacred ideals.
not_available If you're not willing to do that, you should take Ethan's advice and pull out now.
not_available This was taken eight minutes ago on the corner of 25th and Cleveland.
not_available Give Cole this information, have him redirect his search.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I have President Taylor calling for you.
not_available Put her through.
not_available OPERATOR (on phone): Madam President, Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Have you made any progress in finding Jack Bauer? Not yet.
not_available We're still searching.
not_available I think it's safe to assume he's on his way to CTU and that Dana Walsh is his target.
not_available That's, that's why I'm calling, Chloe.
not_available I want Walsh transferred to a safe house off
not_available site.
not_available Madam President, I've doubled the security around Dana Walsh.
not_available I'm confident this is the safest place for her to be.
not_available Your opinion notwithstanding, I'd feel more comfortable with her in a place where she can't be tracked.
not_available Agents from a private security firm are coming there to pick her up.
not_available A private security firm? You know as well as I do that Jack has contacts throughout the government, some of whom might be sympathetic to his situation.
not_available I'm not suggesting that you're one of those people, Chloe.
not_available I just, I just want to take every precaution.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I'm sending over the transfer order now.
not_available The agent in charge of the escort team is named Mark Bledsoe.
not_available Should be arriving there in a few minutes.
not_available Understood.
not_available Thank you, Chloe.
not_available I know this was difficult, Madam President, but you made the right call.
not_available These men of yours, I want them to use every method of noncoercive interrogation available to them.
not_available I've already given that standing order.
not_available No one wants this to get ugly.
not_available Oh, it's already ugly, Charles.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I don't need the chargers.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available Please, come back now.
not_available This has got to stop.
not_available I need you to get me access to Dana Walsh.
not_available The president said she's lying.
not_available No, it's the president who's lying.
not_available She's covering up the evidence to protect the peace agreement.
not_available Even if she is, she must have good reason.
not_available Besides, it's not your call, it's the president's.
not_available She's covering up evidence of a terrorist attack against this country.
not_available She no longer has the call.
not_available You don't want to go against me on this.
not_available Are you threatening me? Chloe, I'm trying to ask you for help.
not_available I need you to put me in a room with Dana Walsh.
not_available You're being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the city.
not_available You're not thinking clearly.
not_available Right now, I'm the only one who is.
not_available You can't just go against everyone.
not_available Please, just come in here, and we'll figure this out before you get yourself killed.
not_available You know what, forget it, Chloe.
not_available I'll figure out another way.
not_available Jack, wait.
not_available What? If you do get the evidence from Dana, what are you gonna do with it? I just want the people who are responsible for this to be held accountable.
not_available All I need to do is expose them.
not_available The president's having her transferred out of CTU.
not_available Why? I'm not sure.
not_available She hired a private security firm.
not_available Where are they taking her? I don't know.
not_available Find out.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Okay.
not_available I will.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yes? Jim, it's Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available From what I'm hearing, you got the whole damn city after you.
not_available Look, I need your help.
not_available I'm running out of places to go.
not_available Running out? I'd say gone.
not_available What'd you do this time, Jack? The less you know, the better.
not_available For who? 
not_available For both of us.
not_available Look.
not_available I'm gonna need weapons and equipment; I need it fast.
not_available Can you make that happen? I can make just about anything happen, Jack; You already know that.
not_available The problem is that you're a walking bull's
not_available eye.
not_available Last thing in the world I need is you on my doorstep.
not_available You wouldn't have a doorstep if it wasn't for me.
not_available I'm calling in a favor.
not_available I'm gonna tell you what I want, and I want it ready when I get there.
not_available You understand me? Well, I see you haven't lost your personal touch.
not_available I'm gonna need a comm unit, two MP5s, an assortment of assault rifles and body armor.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available I need to go to *** and Halstead.
not_available I also need a full surveillance package.
not_available I'll be there in ten minutes.
not_available Yeah? It's me.
not_available We're at CTU.
not_available You have Walsh? Not yet.
not_available I wanted to talk about something before we proceeded.
not_available Is there a problem? We put this team together on short notice, and we never had a chance to discuss what to do with the prisoner once we've extracted the information.
not_available Hand her back to CTU.
not_available Without the evidence, she has no teeth; she can't hurt us.
not_available Well, she can make accusations.
not_available Even without the evidence, something might stick.
not_available You can't afford that.
not_available What are you suggesting? We can make it look like the prisoner was killed while she was trying to escape.
not_available Wouldn't be difficult.
not_available I'm not sure we're willing to go down that path.
not_available You hired me to clean up this situation.
not_available In my professional opinion, that's what needs to happen.
not_available Talk it over with the client, but I need to know soon.
not_available Sir? Yes, okay, I'll let you know.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bledsoe? That's right.
not_available Chloe O'Brian, acting director of CTU.
not_available Heard you've had a rough day.
not_available Yeah, you could say that.
not_available I'll take you to Dana Walsh.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where exactly are you taking her? I can't disclose that information.
not_available The whole point of this exercise is to keep Walsh off the grid.
not_available Yes, but I'm responsible for this prisoner.
not_available You were given a presidential order to turn over the prisoner.
not_available Actually, I'm gonna need to see that order.
not_available You should've received it already.
not_available Well, we didn't.
not_available Like you said, we've had a rough day.
not_available We were hit by an EMP and most of our systems are still down.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian, we don't have a lot of time.
not_available Look, I can't let you take her unless I see the order.
not_available So, you can wait.
not_available Might take an hour, maybe more.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm sorry to be so bythe
not_available book.
not_available It's I was just promoted to this position, and I just want to make sure 
not_available that I dot all my I's and cross the T's.
not_available Right.
not_available Satisfied? Yeah, great.
not_available Good morning, Ms.
not_available Walsh.
not_available My name is Mark Bledsoe.
not_available The president's ordered your transfer to an off
not_available site facility.
not_available You've been designated an enemy combatant by special executive order.
not_available What do you mean off
not_available site facility? It's a secure location.
not_available Chloe, what the hell is going on? Where's Bauer? Where's my immunity deal? Just do what he says, Dana.
not_available We can do it the hard way or the easy way Your choice but you're leaving here with us.
not_available Chloe, don't let them do this.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Please, they're gonna kill me.
not_available Chloe Chloe, please.
not_available Chloe! Thank you for your cooperation.
not_available All right, let's get units on these two intersections.
not_available Have them run car checks on anyone passing through.
not_available I'll contact Transit Police, see about getting these subways locked down.
not_available Chloe, we're still in the middle of a grid search here.
not_available No sign of Jack.
not_available I just talked to him; He called me.
not_available What? 
not_available He wants me to help him get to Dana.
not_available What did you tell him? I told him that she's being transferred to an off
not_available site facility and that I would give him the address.
not_available And I almost did.
not_available But I can't.
not_available I'm under presidential orders.
not_available Besides, I don't think he's right.
not_available He's not thinking clearly.
not_available We have to find him before he gets himself killed.
not_available What if Jack is thinking clearly? If he's right, if the president's lying, and this conspiracy is real, we might be on the wrong side of this.
not_available Bottom line is, we were given orders to bring him in.
not_available That's what we're gonna do.
not_available All right.
not_available I need everyone's attention, please.
not_available We're mobilizing a sting operation in the field to be led by Agent Ortiz.
not_available The target is Jack Bauer.
not_available Let's get to work.
not_available Did you get what I need? Nice to see you again, too, Jack.
not_available Did you get it or not? Yeah, it's right over there.
not_available Everything you asked for right there.
not_available I've been checking the scanners.
not_available All the agencies are looking for you.
not_available But nobody will say what you did.
not_available It's not about what I did.
not_available They're afraid of what I'm gonna do.
not_available I don't know what they did to you, Jack, but it must have been pretty bad.
not_available I got to make a phone call.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available You find out where they're taking Dana? Jack, I want you to think about what you're doing.
not_available Just give me the address, Chloe.
not_available It's not too late to turn yourself in.
not_available Are you going to give me the address or not? Dana is being taken to a safe house in the Middle Village.
not_available It's an industrial laundry at 141 Juniper Valley Road.
not_available Okay, that's about ten minutes from here.
not_available I'll leave now.
not_available Call me when you arrive.
not_available I'm working on pulling up the interior specs.
not_available I'll be able to guide you in.
not_available Chloe, thanks.
not_available I know I've put you in a spot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available I need you to stay here.
not_available I might need you later.
not_available You can't come back here again.
not_available Besides that, we're even now.
not_available I'll let you know when we're even.
not_available Jim, please.
not_available I need your help, okay? Did O'Brian brief you? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We're drawing Bauer to this location where he thinks Dana Walsh is being held.
not_available It's an industrial laundry the DEA seized a year ago.
not_available CTU's been using it as a safe house, but there's no way Jack can know this.
not_available Understand, Bauer's a highly skilled operative.
not_available So we need to make everything as credible as possible.
not_available He'll be expecting sentries, so Beck, you're out front.
not_available Greer, you take the back.
not_available You two will be stationed inside.
not_available Everyone stays out of sight until Jack's between our choke points.
not_available We do the takedown when, and only when I give the order.
not_available We get this right, we take Jack by surprise before he has a chance to fight back.
not_available Gear up.
not_available Cole.
not_available Jack just called.
not_available He's ten minutes out.
not_available What's your status? We're on
not_available site and getting ready.
not_available Remember, nonlethal force.
not_available Look, I don't want anything to happen to Jack either, but I can't tell my men not to defend themselves if their lives are in danger.
not_available You know that.
not_available He's calling me when he arrives.
not_available I'll let you know when that happens.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go, guys, let's go.
not_available Madam President.
not_available I have a final draft of your statement.
not_available I think it best for now to cite President Hassan's death as the reason for your withdrawing.
not_available Then after the dust has settled, we can start prosecuting the Russians through back channels.
not_available Ethan, I've chosen not to withdraw from the peace agreement.
not_available And I'm keeping the press conference as scheduled.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Dana Walsh is being moved from CTU to a private detention facility.
not_available She'll be off the grid, out of Jack Bauer's reach.
not_available I've authorized a private interrogation team to acquire the evidence.
not_available Acquire the evidence? Once we have it, she'll be irrelevant.
not_available Keeping the truth from Jack Bauer is one thing But authorizing the illegal detention and torture of a prisoner? How far are you willing to go to protect this lie? As far as necessary to preserve this treaty.
not_available It's vital to the security of this nation.
not_available And what I am doing is for the greater good.
not_available This was Logan's idea, wasn't it? The decision was mine.
not_available And I stand behind it.
not_available Allison Please listen to what I'm saying.
not_available I think this is about more than the greater good.
not_available I think your presidency has cost you your marriage and your children.
not_available And you think that this treaty will somehow redeem that loss Ethan, that's enough.
not_available Allison, you've made this personal, and you've lost your way.
not_available I've known you long enough to see that.
not_available I implore you Take a step back and look at this clearly.
not_available I said that's enough.
not_available I've explained my reasons.
not_available I appreciate your objections, but the debate is over.
not_available So, let's move on.
not_available Madam President, unless you stop what's being done in your name, I can't be a part of this any longer.
not_available Don't worry, I'll I'll keep it to myself.
not_available Um, I'll cite my health as the reason for my resignation.
not_available After all, I'm here against doctor's orders.
not_available Ethan, please.
not_available We are almost there! You
not_available you can't just abandon me like this.
not_available I'm not abandoning you.
not_available I'm listening to my conscience.
not_available Anyway, you've got Charles Logan now.
not_available Only room for one of us.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Look at me.
not_available My hand is shaking.
not_available I would be concerned if it weren't.
not_available What you've agreed to take on is not something that could be treated lightly.
not_available I keep thinking that people will accuse me of grabbing for power.
not_available Exploiting my husband's death.
not_available Which couldn't be further from the truth.
not_available Still, some people may perceive it that way.
not_available Remember what father said? He said the best way to dispel public misperception is to address it directly.
not_available Good.
not_available I will take his advice.
not_available Jamot, will you excuse us? Of course.
not_available I just need to remind you that the other delegates are expecting you in 20 minutes.
not_available I'll be ready.
not_available Miss Kayla.
not_available Jamot.
not_available Mother, I'm sorry for being so selfish earlier.
not_available You were afraid.
not_available You lost your father today.
not_available And you were afraid of losing me as well.
not_available I still am.
not_available This peace agreement Father died for How can so many people be so violently against it? Some people are so invested in their fear and hatred that peace is the most threatening thing they can imagine.
not_available Chloe, you still there? CHLOE (over comm): Yes.
not_available I'm at the site.
not_available I only see one man out front.
not_available I found a schematic of the building.
not_available There's a side entrance to the north of the loading dock.
not_available I got it.
not_available It looks like it's out of the sentry's line of sight.
not_available According to the schematic, there's an enclosed room at the southwest corner of the building.
not_available That must be where they're keeping Dana.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Chloe, I got go.
not_available I'm moving in.
not_available Cole, he's going into the loading dock entrance heading towards the takedown point.
not_available COLE: I see him.
not_available Hopkins, Lee, Jack's moving into the building and headed toward your position.
not_available Stay sharp.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available I got a visual on the room.
not_available No hostiles in sight.
not_available I'm going to try and grab her.
not_available Be careful, Jack.
not_available Okay, copy that.
not_available Cole, he's almost at the takedown point.
not_available Copy that.
not_available On my way.
not_available Hopkins, we're moving in.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Put your weapons down! Put your weapons down now! I can't do that, Jack! Cole, tell them to put their weapons down or I will kill him! COLE: Put that gun down now! Put your weapons down now! Now! 
not_available Put 'em down! Put 'em down! Tell your men to get down.
not_available Do it.
not_available Get on the ground.
not_available Now! Cole, slowly advance towards me.
not_available Kick the guns over in my direction.
not_available Get out of my line of sight.
not_available How did you know? I know Chloe.
not_available You're gonna call CTU.
not_available You're gonna tell her that her plan worked, and you've got me locked down and ready for transport.
not_available Put it on speaker.
not_available CHLOE (on speakerphone): O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Cole.
not_available Cole, go ahead.
not_available What's happening? We've got Jack.
not_available He's locked down.
not_available Is he okay? He's fine.
not_available What about your men? They're all right.
not_available I know I should feel relieved, but I just feel worse.
not_available Like you said, Chloe, it's for his own good.
not_available I'll talk to him when he gets here.
not_available Lock your men down.
not_available What are you planning on doing? Lock 'em down! All right, Jack, what now? JACK: Follow me.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available You're why I'm here, Cole.
not_available I knew Chloe would send you.
not_available You're the only reason I risked it.
not_available What do you want with me? I need you to help me gain access to Dana Walsh.
not_available I know you well enough, Cole, that I know you don't want to be a part of this cover
not_available up.
not_available And right now President Taylor wants the peace agreement to move forward so badly, she's willing to lie about the Russian's involvement in today's terrorist attack, and I can't let that happen.
not_available How can you be sure the President is lying? Because she told me to my face! She said the agreement was more important than the Russians could have done today.
not_available Why the hell do you think she came down to CTU to talk to me? She didn't want me to get the evidence from Dana.
not_available She wanted to shut me up and lock me down Damn it, Cole, your hands aren't clean in this.
not_available You protected Dana while she was operating for the Russians.
not_available You lied for her, which enabled the Russians to provide nuclear materials to Hassan's opposition.
not_available They facilitated his assassination and what, you lost four of your men today, right? I am giving you an opportunity to make this right, to make the people that are responsible for everything that happened today accountable.
not_available You got a decision to make.
not_available Now, what if you're wrong? I'm not.
not_available Look, I can't do this on my own.
not_available Your call.
not_available Chloe says she's in a safe house a few miles from here.
not_available We'll notify CTU about your men within the next two hours.
not_available Right now it's imperative that they think I took you hostage.
not_available Get up! REPORTER: We've been hearing speculation that Dalia Hassan will be making her first official statement as the provisional head of state of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan.
not_available Earlier, we spoke to a UN official who confirmed that under the IRK's constitution, Mrs.
not_available Hassan would have the authority 
not_available to sign this treaty.
not_available Ethan! I, uh, I heard about your resignation.
not_available I'm glad to see you're putting your health first.
not_available We all just want you to get well.
not_available I'm leaving because of you.
not_available Because of what you've started here.
not_available You've deliberately played this out to maneuver the President into a corner.
not_available I brought the Russians back to the table.
not_available But you didn't tell her how you were doing it.
not_available She didn't ask.
not_available Because she knew it was best for her to preserve her own deniability.
not_available The President knows exactly what she's doing.
not_available She's smart.
not_available She's smarter than either of us ever gave her credit for.
not_available I see.
not_available So, uh, you just provided counsel.
not_available That's right.
not_available Well, let me counsel you.
not_available Stop this cover
not_available up before it's too late.
not_available This peace is no good.
not_available There's too much blood on this treaty for it ever to hold.
not_available We've both been in this game a long time, and we both know damn well that every treaty ever written had blood on it! Not like this.
not_available You got Allison so far into the woods, she'll never be able to find her way out.
not_available She wasn't like you.
not_available Wasn't like any politician I've ever known.
not_available That's right.
not_available She's finally got some teeth.
not_available You listen to me.
not_available If she suffers for this, I will come after you with everything I have.
not_available You're threatening me.
not_available I'm warning you, Charles.
not_available Do you need to sit down? I'm fine.
not_available Well, then, if you don't mind, Allison will be taking the podium any second now.
not_available Get some rest, Ethan.
not_available You need it.
not_available You told Bauer you have evidence.
not_available I need to know where it is.
not_available Come on, Miss Walsh.
not_available You know the deal.
not_available The sooner you tell me, the easier it'll go.
not_available Please, I have got nothing to tell you.
not_available There is no evidence.
not_available If that's the way you want to play it, fine.
not_available PRESS SECRETARY: Ladies and gentlemen, no questions will be taken until after this morning's address.
not_available Madam President, I want to thank you for your thoughts on my speech.
not_available They were very helpful.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available My husband would have been grateful for the support that you have given me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
not_available My fellow Americans and friends in foreign lands, I speak to you this morning with a heavy heart.
not_available The brutal and cowardly murder of President Omar Hassan was a blow to every civilized person in the world and a stark reminder that the pursuit of peace sometimes comes with a steep price.
not_available President Hassan understood that, yet still had the fortitude to pursue a better tomorrow against so many odds.
not_available I join with the American people in mourning him and every other innocent life that was lost during this crisis.
not_available But let it be known here and now their sacrifice will not have been in vain.
not_available Peace must and will prevail no matter the cost.
not_available No matter the cost, no matter the compromises.
not_available We have waited too long and worked too hard, to allow this opportunity to pass us by.
not_available And that is why in Omar Hassan's name, I am choosing to move forward with this historic summit.
not_available One that was made possible by the shared hopes and ideals of the IRK leadership, and will continue under its new leader A woman of unparalleled courage and grace, who has been chosen by her people to carry on the mantle of her late husband Dalia Hassan.
