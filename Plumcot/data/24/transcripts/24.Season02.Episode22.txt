
not_available There are cabinet members who question whether you're fit to continue as chief executive of this country.
not_available We are invoking the 25th Amendment.
not_available I intend to show your erratic and irrational behaviour since the start of this crisis.
not_available You see the results.
not_available The vote is againstyou.
not_available Please remove yourself from the decision
not_available making process.
not_available I swear that I willfaithfully execute the offiice of the President of the United States, so help me God.
not_available I got a message that the president called off the military offensive.
not_available Is it true? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You knew about it? 
not_available I did.
not_available Why keep my people processing intel on a scrapped operation? There's a strong possibility the White House will reinstate the attack.
not_available Dad? 
not_available Sweetheart.
not_available I've been trying to reach you.
not_available Are you at the sheriffs station? They're taking me to the Mathesons' house to pack up my things.
not_available Glad you're OK.
not_available Me too.
not_available Have you got the audio file? 
not_available No.
not_available Are you saying there's no audio file on that chip? If there were, they were destroyed.
not_available Michelle traced the sequence to a hacker named Alex Hewitt.
not_available He created the Cyprus audio file? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm checking up on a man who engineered the recording.
not_available Yes, sir, without a doubt.
not_available Alex? 
not_available Hewitt's not here.
not_available I'm not surprised.
not_available Checkthe garage, see if his car's still here.
not_available Even with the delay, we predict we have not lost the element of surprise.
not_available As you can see here, sir, the primary targets are still relatively unguarded.
not_available Resistance should be insignificant.
not_available When were these pictures taken? 
not_available Ten minutes ago, sir.
not_available Then we can proceed with the attack as planned.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available I need your key codes, sir.
not_available How much longer will Prescott detain me? Until after the press conference.
not_available In a couple of hours, he's going to announce the US response to the bomb, and his ascension to the office.
not_available Your key codes belong to President Prescott now.
not_available It's protocol.
not_available Confirmed.
not_available Know why Chappelle called this meeting? No, he just told everybody to save their work and get in here.
not_available This information is confidential.
not_available It'll stay inside until it's been made public, which should be in the next few hours.
not_available The cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment and removed David Palmer from office.
not_available Jim Prescott is nowthe president.
not_available Why? That isn't relevant to our charge.
not_available Yes, it is, Ryan.
not_available What's your problem, Almeida? We know Palmer was removed cos he didn't wanna go on with the bombings.
not_available That makes what Bauer's doing more relevant.
not_available Bauer has cried wolf twice already.
not_available He's come up with nothing.
not_available I have an order from District that disallows any further resources from being expended on him.
not_available Why is everybody so afraid to look at all the sides of this? What if Bauer's right? What if it was forged and we're about to bomb three innocent countries? Tony, let me first say thatyour office has done a remarkable job today.
not_available There is no way the people on the Hill are not going to reward every one of you for your role in averting disaster.
not_available What does that have to do with anything? 
not_available Let me finish.
not_available The success of this office today is due in large part to the technical team.
not_available The same team that has concluded that the Cyprus audio is an untreated, unforged original.
not_available There comes a time when you have to let go.
not_available Not every hunch works out.
not_available Bauer's chasing a ghost.
not_available I can't put it any simpler than that.
not_available That's all.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available I have to talkto one of Prescott's staff.
not_available If Jack comes in with the evidence, we need somebody in place to take it to.
not_available If Chappelle finds out you're doing an end run I know.
not_available I know.
not_available The car is gone.
not_available OK.
not_available What do you wanna do? 
not_available Kingsley took anything important.
not_available We gotta find Hewitt.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Stop right there! Sit down! 
not_available Let go of me! Don't move.
not_available Don't move! Who are you? Don't look at her, look at me! Who are you? 
not_available I'm nobody.
not_available He's my private bodyguard.
not_available Secret Service? 
not_available Ex.
not_available Mrs Palmer.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Stand up.
not_available Why? Stand up! 
not_available What are you gonna do to me? Turn around.
not_available I'm not carrying any weapons.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Why are you here? 
not_available Trying to help David.
not_available You're no longer part of his life.
not_available Don't believe everything you read.
not_available David's asked me to pool my resources to see if I can find out who's behind the bomb.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I don't care whatyou believe.
not_available Do you know who did this? Who ransacked this place? 
not_available You're here for the same reason I am.
not_available What reason would that be? 
not_available To find Alex Hewitt.
not_available Why? 
not_available You must know.
not_available You're here.
not_available Why don'tyou tell me? He created a recording that's about to start a war.
not_available How do you know about that? I don't like the way this conversation is going.
not_available How do you know about Cyprus audio? 
not_available How dare you talk down to me! I am not a politician.
not_available I will not debate this with you.
not_available Answer me.
not_available What do you know about the Cyprus recording? Every expert in the government with priority clearance has been working on it for six hours.
not_available I've got a lot of sources.
not_available What do you know aboutAlex Hewitt? 
not_available That he's a freelance audio technician.
not_available Who does he work for? 
not_available A man named Peter Kingsley.
not_available Why? Kingsley represents Caspian Sea oils interests that want the US at war with the Middle East.
not_available Kingsley hired Hewitt to fabricate the Cyprus recording.
not_available Mr Bauer, I've walked the corridors of power my entire life.
not_available You'd be surprised how much information you can get if you have something to trade.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Take a seat! Come out! Open the door slowly, I wanna see both your hands! Now! Now! Please don't hurt me! Get on the ground! 
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Get on the ground! Who are you? Mrs Palmer? 
not_available Alex.
not_available You said you would help me.
not_available Why does he have a gun? 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Go sit with her.
not_available I didn't do anything wrong.
not_available Move! 
not_available You said you'd Shut up.
not_available Don't say anything.
not_available He's a federal agent.
not_available Shut up.
not_available I am not talking to you! Shut up! 
not_available Don't say anything, Alex.
not_available Alex, don't say anything! You're gonna talkto me now.
not_available You took voice samples from three leaders and intercut them with Ali's for the audio? 
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available And Kingsley paid you.
not_available No! 
not_available You're a traitor.
not_available You know what they'll do to you? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available I didn't know, I swear.
not_available I told Mrs Palmer.
not_available She'll tell you.
not_available Forget about her.
not_available She can't help you.
not_available But if you tell me everything about the Cyprus audio, I'll do what I can.
not_available I won't say anything until I see a lawyer.
not_available I am your lawyer, son.
not_available Those people you worked for thought you'd die in the bomb.
not_available They're after you.
not_available If you wanna stay alive, start telling me everything.
not_available No, I only wanna talkto Mrs Palmer.
not_available Why her? How's she connected to this? How do you know her? I just met her today.
not_available She called, said she could help me.
not_available I know she's the president's ex
not_available wife.
not_available She's got connections high up.
not_available She can't help you now, Alex.
not_available I'm the only one who can help you now.
not_available I wanna to talkto her.
not_available OK.
not_available Let me see what I can do.
not_available Give me your keys.
not_available Why? 
not_available Give me your keys.
not_available Which one of these locks this door? 
not_available This one.
not_available Just step back.
not_available What did he say? 
not_available Why are you here? Please don't tell me it's to help the president.
not_available All right.
not_available I came here to protect myself.
not_available Alex was paid by Kingsley to record certain conversations.
not_available Some of those were with me, they incriminate me.
not_available You're collaborating with Peter Kingsley? He assured me that the bomb would never go off.
not_available What were you thinking? What the hell were you thinking? Who are you calling? 
not_available CTU.
not_available I'm a sworn federal agent.
not_available You just confessed to a federal crime.
not_available I suggestyou hang up that phone.
not_available I need to speakto Tony Almeida.
not_available I am the only one who can get Hewitt to cooperate.
not_available And for that, I'll want full immunity from prosecution.
not_available Now hang up the phone and I'll tell you everything.
not_available Jack, it's Tony, what's going on? 
not_available I'm gonna have to get backto you.
not_available Start.
not_available Start! 
not_available I wanted to bring down David's presidency.
not_available I was so angry with David for what he did to me.
not_available I worked tirelessly for years to put him into office.
not_available I sacrificed everything.
not_available My career, my family.
not_available David betrayed me.
not_available So you wanted revenge.
not_available What did Kingsley want? Money.
not_available A war in the Middle East would triple the value of his oil.
not_available You're here to ensure no one connects you to Kingsley.
not_available Yes, like I told you, I came to protect myself.
not_available Look, Mr Bauer, there's only one person you need to prosecute for this.
not_available And that person is sitting in that room there.
not_available I want full immunity.
not_available Otherwise, it's justyour word against mine.
not_available She'll talk with you.
not_available I know you're scared.
not_available You said I would be OK.
not_available I knowthere's been a little wrinkle, but we can fix that.
not_available What do you think, Aaron? You think I'm unfit to fulfil my duties as president? Sir, I'm under orders not to discuss this with you.
not_available Are you under orders not to listen? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Then I'll do all the talking.
not_available I assume you remember Jack Bauer.
not_available He believes the Cyprus recording, the single piece of evidence propelling us into this war, was fabricated.
not_available I've been removed from office because I believe in Bauer.
not_available If it wasn't for Jack, Los Angeles would be a killing field by now.
not_available Still, Prescott and the cabinet refuse to believe that he might be right.
not_available If Jack finds the evidence after the planes have dropped their payloads, then it'll be too late.
not_available We will be at war against three innocent countries.
not_available I'm sure if Jack Bauer finds evidence, Vice President Prescott I mean, the president, will recall the bombers.
not_available You're under orders not to speakto me.
not_available I'm doing my best, sir.
not_available Your best would be to help me.
not_available By doing what? I need to talkto Jack Bauer.
not_available Find out if he's secured the evidence.
not_available If I remember correctly, you have a son in the Navy.
not_available Yes, sir, I do.
not_available It's a fine thing to defend one's country.
not_available You should be proud.
not_available Let's make sure the cause he's fighting for is the just one.
not_available Get me a sat phone.
not_available I need a secure line.
not_available Put these in the overnight database.
not_available Chappelle's gonna need 'em for his briefing.
not_available Why are you giving this to me? This is your situation report.
not_available I'm on something else.
not_available What else? I don't have to explain myself to you, Carrie.
not_available Just do it.
not_available You do need to explain yourself cos I think you're going behind Chappelle's back, trying to help Jack Bauer.
not_available Do you really wanna do this, Carrie? Come after me? I've been letting you get away with a lot, but if you want the gloves to come off, fine.
not_available What's going on here? She's asking me to take on some of her workload.
not_available I just wanna know why.
not_available Why don'tyou wanna tell her? It's none of her business, Tony.
not_available Look, just tell her, so we can get backto work here.
not_available All right.
not_available District's asked me to step in as a liaison to facilitate the power shift.
not_available I'll be on the phone for the next two hours.
not_available Sounds like a promotion.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You think she believed me? 
not_available No.
not_available Go over it again.
not_available Look, I need you to find it fast, even if you need to pull agents who can help you.
not_available This needs to take first priority.
not_available Division's breathing down my neck for some reason.
not_available That's something I don't need.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available All right.
not_available Mr Chappelle.
not_available Yes, Carrie? In my opinion, Tony Almeida's not fit to run CTU.
not_available Why not? 
not_available He's got Michelle working off book.
not_available Doing what? 
not_available I can't say for sure.
not_available But I have a feeling the two of them are still trying to help Bauer.
not_available Thank you.
not_available lt'll be fine.
not_available Here you go, thanks.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available President still holding off on the attack? Things have gotten worse.
not_available It's not public, but Palmer's been pulled.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment because he wanted to wait for confirmation of the recording.
not_available Prescott's now president.
not_available I'll bring evidence proving the recording's been forged.
not_available Prescott won't listen to it? He won't wait for it.
not_available Get me that evidence quickly, and I'll call Prescott with it.
not_available Start by sending a chopper to the address you gave me.
not_available I got Hewitt.
not_available He definitely made the recording? 
not_available Yes, absolutely.
not_available Will he testify? We're working on it.
not_available If I go to Chappelle and request a chopper for you, he'll deny it.
not_available He's got orders from District.
not_available Deal with it, Tony.
not_available We got bombers in the air.
not_available Hewitt's our only chance of stopping this.
not_available I'll do my best.
not_available OK, thanks, Tony.
not_available I know, Alex.
not_available I understand your concern.
not_available But the fact remains, we both made a mistake.
not_available But we're lucky because they need us.
not_available Any deal I make will include you, and vice versa.
not_available Remember, we're in this together.
not_available Are you sure about this? Honey, I would never lie to you.
not_available Butyou have to remember this one thing.
not_available I am the only one looking after your interest.
not_available No one else.
not_available I know howthese things work.
not_available Just do as I say, and it'll all turn out well.
not_available What about him? Don't worry about him.
not_available I'll handle Agent Bauer.
not_available He won't be a problem.
not_available He's very low on the food chain.
not_available So, if I do this, you can keep me out of jail? Absolutely.
not_available You'll be granted full immunity just like I promised.
not_available OK? All right, Jack, this is how it's gonna work.
not_available He'll come in and testify.
not_available He can demonstrate the technology in a matter of minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available The chopper's on its way.
not_available You heard Chappelle.
not_available He won't let us have a chopper if he knows it's for Jack.
not_available But Jack's got Hewitt, who definitely made that recording.
not_available Chappelle can't ignore that.
not_available He can do whatever he wants.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available OK.
not_available Let me get backto you, Marc.
not_available What? 
not_available Jack Bauer just contacted us.
not_available Really? Where is he? 
not_available North Hollywood.
not_available What's he doing? He wants to bring in the guy who forged the Cyprus recording.
not_available Fine, let him.
not_available He's too far away.
not_available We need to send a chopper.
not_available We've been through this, Tony.
not_available I'm done with Bauer.
not_available He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere.
not_available We're onto other things.
not_available More important than the US launching military strikes based on false information? The thing is, Tony, you've been reassigned.
not_available Reassigned? Where? I'll letyou know in a few days.
not_available For now, you can go home.
not_available Ryan, you can't reassign me now.
not_available This recording is real.
not_available We are going to war.
not_available We need to prepare for domestic response.
not_available You have made yourself a liability I just can't afford.
not_available You've got 15 minutes to clean outyour desk and get out.
not_available What are you doing? They tookthe diskthat had my comb filter.
not_available I'll need to rebuild that file to demonstrate.
not_available OK, the tarball has to decompress.
not_available It'll take about 20 minutes.
not_available How's it gonna work? 
not_available I'll make a recording.
not_available Right on the spot, shift it around, reframe segments.
not_available It'll have the same specs as Cyprus.
not_available It'll blowtheir minds.
not_available Good.
not_available And then I'm free to go, right? That's what she said.
not_available Yes, you'll be fine, Alex.
not_available How come you're being so nice all of a sudden? What do you mean? Before, it was all my fault, you called me a traitor, and now everything's "Fine, Alex"? 
not_available You're gonna screw me.
not_available We won't screw you.
not_available You two made a deal, you're gonna hang me out.
not_available Alex, calm down.
not_available We can't hang you out.
not_available You have the proof.
not_available Withoutyou, there is no deal.
not_available Then I want it in writing.
not_available Why can't I have an attorney? 
not_available No time.
not_available There are bombers in the air to start a war.
not_available You'll have to trust me.
not_available Why should I trustyou? Why don'tyou have federal counsel meet us wherever we're going? Excuse me? 
not_available One phone call.
not_available That's right.
not_available We want federal counsel.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not trading with you, Alex.
not_available You're gonna do your demonstration, then I help you.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available That's it.
not_available I wanna talkto you in private.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I handled everything.
not_available What are you afraid of? I'm the one who can make this happen.
not_available I wanna talkto him alone.
not_available OK, all right, whatever you want.
not_available I'll be over here.
not_available What's going on? Is she trying to screw me? 
not_available No.
not_available She's trying to help you.
not_available Why? I mean, she doesn't even know me.
not_available Maybe because she thinks you got tricked into doing something you didn't fully understand.
not_available She wants to use her influence with the president to try and help you.
not_available Because she thinks I'm innocent? 
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available And I think she likes me.
not_available I think she does.
not_available Do you need any help? 
not_available No, it should only be one suitcase.
not_available Take your time.
not_available I'll be waiting in the car.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He just reassigned you? He didn't give any explanation? Chappelle doesn't want me in the job.
not_available He's got his own people, and I'm not one of them.
not_available What are you going to do? 
not_available Tony, it's Satcom.
not_available Almeida.
not_available This is David Palmer.
not_available Mr President, what can I do for you, sir? I need to speakto Bauer.
not_available Can you reach him? Can you hold on, sir? 
not_available For a moment.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack, it's Tony.
not_available I have President Palmer on the line.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Patch him through.
not_available How we doing on the chopper? 
not_available Working on it.
not_available Work faster.
not_available Here's the President.
not_available Mr President, I have Jack on the line.
not_available Jack, go ahead.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available I don't know if you've heard, but I've been unseated.
not_available Yes, I have.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Where are you on your investigation? I can tell you the Cyprus audio has been forged.
not_available I have the man who engineered it.
not_available I'm bringing him in soon.
not_available We'll patch him through to the White House, so he can testify.
not_available Meanwhile, CTU is trying to process everything they can on him.
not_available Mr President, there is something else though.
not_available What? Your ex
not_available wife, sir.
not_available Sherry, she's here with me.
not_available How did that happen? Jack? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You can't talk? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Don't trust her, Jack.
not_available Do you understand? Yes, Mr President.
not_available Let me talkto her.
not_available He wants to talk with you.
not_available David? What are you trying to do? 
not_available I'm just trying to help you.
not_available How can you help me? You shouldn't have lied to me.
not_available That's the problem, David.
not_available It's not always about the truth.
not_available And what's that supposed to mean? The truth is, the Cyprus recording was forged.
not_available You are right and they are wrong.
not_available The truth is, you're trying to prevent an unnecessary war, and Jack Bauer and I are the only ones who can help you.
not_available Stay out of his way, Sherry.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, David.
not_available Let me talkto Jack.
not_available Yes, Mr President? 
not_available I need this man to come forward now.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tony, you still there? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available How much time have we got? 
not_available Six minutes.
not_available Tony, can you hear me? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We need that chopper now.
not_available You'll have it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm gonna need your help.
not_available I'm still here at the Matheson house.
not_available Where is it, sir? 
not_available Where is what? Please, David, don't make me do this.
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available Place Pierce under arrest.
not_available Mike, don't.
not_available I coerced him into getting it for me.
not_available You didn't coerce anyone.
not_available Shame on you, for placing us both in this position.
not_available It should be you putting yourself on the line.
not_available Instead, Aaron did.
not_available I tried to be a friend to you, sir.
not_available I don't want a friend! I need someone to do the right thing.
not_available I'm sorry, Aaron.
not_available There's nothing to be sorry for, Mr President.
not_available Officer, is thatyou? Hello? 
not_available Dessler.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Rudin needs you.
not_available He's in Holding Room 2.
not_available Tell him to call me.
not_available The comm's out in that room.
not_available All right, I'm on my way.
not_available Where's Rudin? I got this.
not_available Go send that chopper to pick up Jack.
not_available When are your people getting here? 
not_available Soon.
not_available It's not just out of my own selfish desire that I'm trying to stay clean on all this.
not_available Really? It wouldn't be good for David's presidency if his ex
not_available wife was implicated in this bomb.
not_available So, now you care about his presidency? In light of what's happened today, my resentments seem obscenely petty.
not_available I don't know what I was thinking.
not_available There's something I haven't told you yet about Mr Palmer.
not_available Mr Palmer? 
not_available Yes, Mr Palmer.
not_available His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment less than an hour ago.
not_available What? 
not_available Prescott's president now.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You got whatyou wanted.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's Tony.
not_available The chopper's about to leave.
not_available ETA's about 20 minutes.
not_available So, Chappelle's on board with us? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available It's better if you don't know.
not_available You'll have to get the Attorney General involved.
not_available What for? 
not_available Mrs Palmer wants to cut a deal.
not_available A deal? 
not_available Hewitt's testimony incriminates her.
not_available I'll make sure it's in place.
not_available It has to go like clockwork.
not_available There's no margin for error.
not_available I know.
not_available What did you mean, "I want to cut a deal"? I explained to you thatAlex won't say anything without my permission.
not_available All I care about now is that he convinces Prescott and the Joint Chiefs that he forged the Cyprus audio.
not_available After that, you're free to try and cut a deal.
not_available That is not what we discussed.
not_available I'm sorry, that's the way it is.
not_available We'll see about that.
not_available Mrs Palmer, the conversations end here.
not_available You don't talkto him again, do you understand me? Don't try me, Mrs Palmer.
not_available Take a seat on the couch.
not_available Kim? You knowthis is all your fault, don'tya? Carla would probably still be alive if it wasn't for you.
not_available Probably.
not_available You think I wanted to hurt her? I didn't.
not_available I loved her.
not_available CTU.
not_available Dessler.
not_available This is Kim.
not_available I need to speakto my father.
not_available Kim, your Dad's not here right now.
not_available Please find him.
not_available It's an emergency.
not_available All right, hold on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's Michelle.
not_available Your daughter's on the line.
not_available OK, fine.
not_available Put her through.
not_available OK, Kim, go ahead.
not_available Dad.
not_available Sweetheart, what's wrong?
