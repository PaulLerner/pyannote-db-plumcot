
not_available This is Jenny's statement to the press about the CTU bombing.
not_available Any casualties? 
not_available Over a dozen so far.
not_available Those people are dead because of you.
not_available You're out, Eric.
not_available Effective immediately.
not_available You can't dismiss me now, sir.
not_available I need someone I can trust.
not_available Reza may be involved with a terrorist.
not_available He's been in contact with someone who finances terrorist operations.
not_available Trust me.
not_available He is not a terrorist.
not_available I wantyou to drop this nonsense and start treating Reza like a member of the family.
not_available How bad is she? 
not_available She needs surgery.
not_available We can't do that in the field.
not_available George, we can't keep her here.
not_available Everything on this nuke has been destroyed apart from the database Paula sent the NSA, 
not_available and they didn't get the code.
not_available Assign other IT people to retrieve it.
not_available We don't have time! 
not_available I wanna go with her.
not_available I have some questions first.
not_available We got out in time.
not_available She wasn't injured in the explosion.
not_available Her head injury most likely occurred before the blast.
not_available You don't think I did this? 
not_available I'm gonna let the police sort that out.
not_available Eddie said the job went off without a hitch.
not_available What happened between then and now? I killed them, for resisting arrest.
not_available I'll kill you, too, Joe.
not_available Whoever setyou up to do this job, Joe, they used you.
not_available The woman who gave me the plans to CTU, I only met her twice.
not_available I can't go backto jail.
not_available No! None of these girders are stable.
not_available I can't guarantee they're gonna hold.
not_available And nothing behind this corded area's safe.
not_available If I see anyone in here, I'll shut the building down.
not_available I don't care what the governor says.
not_available No, don't even try that.
not_available The switches were totally destroyed.
not_available See if you can set up a generator line to the A
not_available lsland.
not_available We gotta get her outta here.
not_available Progress here? We're trying to bring her round using stimulants and hydrating fluids.
not_available But it might make her more unstable.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available Wake her up.
not_available Where are you headed? 
not_available To follow up on a lead.
not_available There's an LA connection to Syed Ali.
not_available Well, look.
not_available Send somebody else.
not_available I need you here.
not_available To do what? Watch Paula die? We gotta get the encryption codes out of her or we lose everything.
not_available You got it covered.
not_available I'll follow up on this lead.
not_available No.
not_available You're gonna stay here, and that's an order.
not_available There's a Middle Eastern businessman in LA who's had contact with Syed Ali recently.
not_available Now, lvers and Nepel are dead.
not_available Who do you want me to send? Be reachable, all right? What are you looking at? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You putting bandaids on the network? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Mr Mason? It's Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack? What is it? 
not_available George, I got to Wald.
not_available I found out who commissioned him to take out CTU.
not_available Who? 
not_available It was Nina Myers.
not_available Nina? 
not_available She was his connection to CTU.
not_available It makes no sense.
not_available She's been in prison.
not_available He approached her before we took her down.
not_available She sold him schematics, gate information This has to be connected to the nuke.
not_available They bombed CTU to cripple our response capability? Yes, yes.
not_available I've already called Chappelle.
not_available You what?! 
not_available I couldn't find you, George.
not_available What did he say? 
not_available He agreed we need to talkto her.
not_available He's having her transferred over to CTU nowfor questioning.
not_available Debrief at Division.
not_available It's a total disaster here.
not_available What are you gonna do about Nina? 
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Don't just hand her over to the FBI.
not_available Forget it, Jack.
not_available You did a great job.
not_available OK? Go find yourself someplace safe.
not_available George Michelle, can you get somebody to set up an interrogation room? 
not_available We got somebody coming in.
not_available Who? 
not_available Nina Myers.
not_available The CTU agent that killed Jack's wife? I need as close to maximum security as I can get 
not_available and three armed agents standing by.
not_available We've reduced the likelihood on some of the targets.
not_available We're left with six probable sectors.
not_available The harbour, Port of Los Angeles.
not_available One of the busiest ports in the world.
not_available A strike there will knock out infrastructure Sorry to interrupt, Mr President, but the ambassador's about to land.
not_available Any communication while he was en route? Not since this morning, 
not_available when it was decided he'd come here.
not_available Is he alone? No, he's being accompanied by Farhad Salim, their ranking intelligence officer.
not_available Get me anything new we've learned about Second Wave since this morning.
not_available Oh, and Lynne.
not_available Is Roger here yet? 
not_available He's upstairs.
not_available They're bringing him up to speed on Rayburn's dismissal.
not_available Good.
not_available Dr Lazar to Radiology.
not_available Dr Lazar to Radiology.
not_available Everything's gonna be OK, Kim.
not_available Tell you what.
not_available You leave now, I'll tell the police that it was just a misunderstanding.
not_available If you don't, they're gonna arrestyou.
not_available Arrest me for what? 
not_available For kidnapping my daughter.
not_available Where is Carla? As soon as these officers talkto the doctor, it'll be pretty obvious that you hurt her.
not_available That's a lie and you know it.
not_available I would never hurt her.
not_available I've been protecting her from you.
not_available The only thing that can be proved, Kim, is thatyou took Megan without our permission.
not_available You beat up your wife.
not_available Who's gonna believe you? Carla will back me up.
not_available You knowthat.
not_available I mean, if you don't believe me you can give her a call.
not_available Wanna do that? Go ahead, Kim.
not_available Call her.
not_available You walk away, while you have the chance.
not_available Otherwise you're going to jail.
not_available Stay away from my family! Don't ever come to my house again.
not_available I wouldn't rule anything out, Mike.
not_available If you co
not_available opt local enforcement, the story could leak.
not_available And that's one of my biggest concerns here.
not_available You know what? Roger's walking in.
not_available I'll talkto you when you land.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Roger.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available Come into my office.
not_available Afternoon, everyone.
not_available Be with you shortly.
not_available Very good, sir.
not_available I can't tell you how disturbed I was with Eric's decision regarding the CTU.
not_available It's inexcusable.
not_available There'll be a full investigation, possible criminal charges.
not_available You know I hate to meddle in your rice bowl.
not_available But on a day like today, I couldn't wait for you to arrive.
not_available Say no more.
not_available Are you caught up on everything? Caught up.
not_available I'd like to talkto you about this meeting with the ambassador.
not_available What are your thoughts? 
not_available We have everything to lose, nothing to gain.
not_available What we have to gain is stopping the nuclear bomb.
not_available But this meeting benefits only the other side.
not_available He wants to be able to say to the world "Look, we tried to stop the bomb.<br>" It's a ploy to gain access to our intelligence, nothing more.
not_available You might be right.
not_available But I'm not as certain as you are.
not_available I'm gonna meet with him.
not_available Very good, sir.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available Not at this time.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Sir, off
not_available duty agents are finally arriving.
not_available And Division called.
not_available The chopper just lifted off, Nina Myers is on board.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's set up the mobile video unit for the interrogation.
not_available Lori, I need you to call downstairs.
not_available Get Bill.
not_available Have him bring up a video rack, OK? Jack? What the hell are you doing here? 
not_available I sentyou to Division.
not_available I wanna do the debrief here.
not_available Nina killed your wife.
not_available I don't wantyou anywhere near her.
not_available My goal is the same as yours, to stop this bomb.
not_available It makes sense to do the debrief here because there is no information on the Wald op at Division.
not_available Please.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me setyou up with Noel at tech support.
not_available What about lvers? 
not_available Dead.
not_available Clark? 
not_available Dead.
not_available We lost a lot of good people, Jack.
not_available I'll get started on the debrief.
not_available Hey.
not_available Do us both a favour.
not_available Finish, and go? Yeah.
not_available She's awake.
not_available You'd better move fast.
not_available I don't know how much time we have.
not_available Paula, it's George Mason.
not_available Can you hear me? 
not_available What happened? We had a big explosion.
not_available Do you remember the encryption codes? You're the only one who has 'em.
not_available Stay with us, Paula.
not_available Paula.
not_available You were transferring files out to NSA.
not_available Do you remember that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The transfer didn't complete.
not_available They didn't have the source decryption key.
not_available The source? 
not_available Yeah, the source key.
not_available That's right.
not_available Normally you send it in a separate packet, but the router was destroyed.
not_available Did you make a copy of the source key before you sent it? Yeah.
not_available What is it? Do you remember? 
not_available Subvolume.
not_available OK.
not_available Which volume? 
not_available Which volume? Which one? Paula? Stay with us.
not_available Which one? Paula, your disk is partitioned in over Etudes.
not_available Etudes.
not_available Hang in there, sweetie.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's it.
not_available Great.
not_available Hey, you did good.
not_available Whatyou just did is gonna save a lot of lives today.
not_available Let's get her to hospital now.
not_available Move! Let's go.
not_available She's in VTAC.
not_available Everybody ready? Charge.
not_available Full charge, 360.
not_available Clear.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Charging at 300.
not_available My charge.
not_available Your charge.
not_available Clear.
not_available No rhythm.
not_available Flatline.
not_available She's gone.
not_available I got it.
not_available You sure? Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available So, how d'you like the house? You knew about it? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Why do you think I insisted you go with him? Dad, it's not that I think Reza doesn't love Marie.
not_available But if he's doing things that are illegal 
not_available You don't knowthat.
not_available I know Ralph Burton found a transaction in the company records 
not_available that links him to a known terrorist.
not_available Ralph Burton is a PI.
not_available He could probably connect me to the Manson Family if he looked hard enough.
not_available Did they straighten out that lunch business? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Another crisis averted.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available Hello, sir.
not_available I'm Tony Almeida from Los Angeles CTU.
not_available This is Agent Richards.
not_available CTU.
not_available What what is CTU? Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available I'm looking for a Reza Naiyeer.
not_available What's this all about? 
not_available It's a government matter, ma'am.
not_available A government matter? 
not_available I just need to ask him a few questions.
not_available Mr Almeida, right? My daughter hired a private investigator to do a background check on Reza.
not_available It's all been cleared up.
not_available Actually, Dad, it hasn't all been cleared up.
not_available Can this wait? You see, today is my other daughter Marie's wedding.
not_available She's getting married to Reza.
not_available I'm sorry for the bad timing, Mr Warner.
not_available But no.
not_available This can't wait.
not_available I'm authorised to interrogate Mr Naiyeer.
not_available Are you gonna take me to him, or do I have to find him myself? Kate, go find Reza.
not_available What's going on here? 
not_available I'm part of an investigation involving national security.
not_available I'm hoping Mr Naiyeer can assist me.
not_available Hi, Kate.
not_available What's up? 
not_available There's a man here who needs to talkto you.
not_available Who is he? He's from the government.
not_available The government? A counterterrorism agency? What are you talking about? 
not_available That's all I know.
not_available What's this about, Kate? I don't know.
not_available Marie's in her room adjusting her dress.
not_available Just make sure she doesn't find out about this.
not_available Sure.
not_available Reza Naiyeer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm Agent Richards.
not_available Right this way.
not_available Oh! What is that? 
not_available Some lunch for you.
not_available Can you put it there? I wantyou to knowthat since your conversation with the prime minister, we have taken four suspected members of Second Wave into custody, and we have begun interrogations.
not_available What have you learned? 
not_available We are still questioning them.
not_available As a ranking security officer, I assure you, we are doing all we can to clamp down on this kind of activity.
not_available These satellite photos were taken over your country an hour ago.
not_available Doesn't look like too much of a clampdown to me.
not_available We don't have the resources thatyou do, and surely even you can't tell me thatyou are aware of every single active paramilitary compound in the US.
not_available If this bomb goes off, Mr President, and you don't believe that we did everything possible to stop it, there will be heavy repercussions for my country.
not_available You have already made it clear thatyou will have no choice but to retaliate against us.
not_available We want to help.
not_available What do you propose? 
not_available A mutual exchange of intelligence.
not_available What kind of exchange? We need access 
not_available to your files on Second Wave.
not_available Our files? Yes.
not_available Anything that pertains to suspected terrorism in our country.
not_available I'm not sure how much intel it's in our interest to share with you at this time.
not_available I understand your reservations, Mr President.
not_available But be assured, we want to prevent this incident.
not_available We are prepared for an exchange in both directions.
not_available We are willing to open up our files to you as well.
not_available I'll have to think about this, Mr Ambassador.
not_available Of course.
not_available We prepared a room for you.
not_available You'll have our answer shortly.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available Mr Ambassador.
not_available Mr Stanton.
not_available Right this way, sir.
not_available We can't give them this information, sir.
not_available Explain.
not_available What's the downside? We have agents in their country, right now.
not_available Those files would expose their identities.
not_available Fine.
not_available Go through the files, take out anything that would jeopardise our people.
not_available It's a dangerous precedent.
not_available We can't worry about precedent, not today.
not_available Not under the threat of nuclear attack.
not_available I guess my point is I don't trust the ambassador.
not_available And we can't ignore the possibility that his country is supporting Second Wave.
not_available Lynne, what do you think? I agree with Roger.
not_available I think it's too risky.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dad, it's me.
not_available Kim, are you all right? 
not_available I'm OK.
not_available What aboutyou? Were you at CTU when the bomb went off? 
not_available No, honey, I'm fine.
not_available Are you on your way to Aunt Carol's? 
not_available I haven't leftyet.
not_available What is going on? You sounded weird.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Go to Aunt Carol's.
not_available I can't.
not_available That's why I'm calling.
not_available Why? What's wrong? 
not_available It's Megan.
not_available Her dad freaked out and hit her.
not_available I'm at the hospital.
not_available Sweetheart, you're gonna have to let that go.
not_available It's not safe in Los Angeles today.
not_available Why not? Something bad's gonna happen.
not_available Just trust me.
not_available Dad, tell me.
not_available Sweetheart, there's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
not_available It might go off today.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll leave, but I No buts, Kim.
not_available Go.
not_available Now.
not_available Are you gonna meet me atAunt Carol's? As soon as I'm finished here at CTU.
not_available OK? 
not_available All right.
not_available Kim? Don't tell anybody about this, OK? We can't start a panic.
not_available OK.
not_available Call me as soon as you get there.
not_available OK.
not_available Dad, I love you.
not_available I love you too, sweetheart.
not_available Now go.
not_available OK.
not_available George wondered if there was anything I can do to help.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I could fill out that boilerplate stuff for you.
not_available Michelle, I know George wants me outta here.
not_available Take my advice.
not_available Don't get caught in the middle.
not_available Hello, Nina.
not_available So you weren't just working for the Drazens.
not_available Selling information to anybody who'd buy it.
not_available Presidential assassins, terrorists, didn't matter.
not_available What do you know about this nuclear bomb? Here are the terms, George.
not_available They're nonnegotiable.
not_available I'll give up my contacts, my background material, all my intel.
not_available I'll work with whoever you want, here or in the field.
not_available For that, I want a full presidential pardon, third party certification, guaranteed in writing.
not_available It's not gonna fly.
not_available Then take me back.
not_available You're not buying a used car here.
not_available You have to deal within the confines of reality.
not_available You're not gonna get anything unless you produce results.
not_available It's in my interest to produce results.
not_available Is this working? Then put me through to Chappelle at Division.
not_available Is she gonna help? Finish your debrief, and go.
not_available Ryan, it's me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available So, as chief financial officer, you oversee all the money that comes in and out of the company, right? Right.
not_available And in case you hadn't noticed, I'm getting married today, so if we could do this another time I'd appreciate it.
not_available Could you sit down, please? We're not done.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Why don'tyou tell me about Syed Ali? 
not_available I told you before, I do not know a Syed Ali.
not_available You don't? Then how do you explain the fact that his name is in your personal computer files? I don't know.
not_available You don't know.
not_available All right.
not_available Why don't we start again? Where's Marie? 
not_available Still in her room, working on the dress.
not_available How much longer is he gonna be with Reza? 
not_available Sorry, sir, I don't know.
not_available Dad, she's gonna find out the second she walks out of the room.
not_available Are we gonna be able to go through with this? What do you mean? 
not_available The wedding.
not_available Dad, it's in less than six hours.
not_available No one's cancelling anything.
not_available Just make sure Marie stays away from these people, OK? Roger, I wantyou to monitor howthey use our intel.
not_available I'm not comfortable with this.
not_available We've flagged the restricted topics, so It should be a one
not_available way dialogue.
not_available Mr President, it's Ryan Chappelle, Division Los Angeles.
not_available Yes, Ryan.
not_available I have an update on Nina Myers.
not_available She's demanding a full presidential pardon.
not_available Here's my debrief.
not_available It's finished.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I am supposed to getyou outta here.
not_available That's not gonna happen, is it? It's the first time I've seen her since Why are you doing this to yourself, Jack? Mason's right.
not_available You should get out of here.
not_available Michelle Dessler.
not_available Is Jack Bauer there? Hold on.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack.
not_available It's for you.
not_available Yeah? Jack Bauer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Hold one moment for the president.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Mr President.
not_available I want to thank you for your good workthis morning.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available There's something else, and I wantyou to hear it from me personally.
not_available About Nina Myers.
not_available I'm gonna have to grant her a shadow asylum.
not_available That sounds like a pardon, sir.
not_available It is.
not_available But only a couple of people will ever know about it.
not_available She'll be deported to another country.
not_available Jack, I know how difficult this must be for you to hear.
not_available It was a painful decision.
not_available But as you know, she has information that can help us find this bomb.
not_available I wish there was another way.
not_available So do l, sir.
not_available Let's just get through this day.
not_available Eventually we'll make it right.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, Jack.
not_available What is it? You're gonna let her go.
not_available Hello? 
not_available I've been trying to reach you.
not_available I had my cell off.
not_available We're recording.
not_available I need you.
not_available I really need you, too.
not_available Quit it, Miguel.
not_available I'm in trouble.
not_available What happened? Are you OK? No, no, no.
not_available It's not me, it's Megan.
not_available You have to come help me.
not_available Help you do what? What's goin' on? I can't explain it over the phone.
not_available Just get over here, please.
not_available I really need you.
not_available Kim, I have a whole studio full of people here.
not_available You just have to trust me.
not_available I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
not_available Miguel? OK.
not_available Where are you? President Palmer told me he had to take a deal with Nina.
not_available I want the case.
not_available I know how she thinks.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yes, and you know it.
not_available I'm not talking to you, Jack.
not_available Because you're not here right now.
not_available Good.
not_available Set up here, have it ready to go.
not_available OK.
not_available Did you find ityet? There's no plus
not_available five here.
not_available Try the DC lines in the phone circuits.
not_available Great, great.
not_available Skip the virus cycle.
not_available Just get these all online.
not_available I need Mason's log
not_available in sheets.
not_available I need to know everywhere he's been.
not_available You're not cleared for that.
not_available Then clear me for it.
not_available I'm right in the middle of this thing.
not_available What does it have to do with George? I need to make sure he's fit to run CTU.
not_available Fit? 
not_available I think something's happened to him.
not_available Believe it or not, I used to run this place.
not_available I know what I'm doing.
not_available I wanna help him.
not_available Please.
not_available Get me those log
not_available in sheets.
not_available Can you let me know when it's done, Cori? 
not_available I will.
not_available Hi, Cori.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm starved, but I don't want to eat anything.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because the dress fits perfectly right now.
not_available Marie Yeah? 
not_available There's been a problem.
not_available Of course there has.
not_available It's a wedding.
not_available It's about Reza.
not_available Oh.
not_available Is he backing out? What's going on? Where's Reza? He's in the dining room.
not_available Marie? Who are you? 
not_available I'm Agent Richards, CTU Los Angeles.
not_available Reza's in the room talking to another agent.
not_available What for? What does he want with Reza? Dad? Marie, um 
not_available I wanna see Reza.
not_available Sorry, ma'am.
not_available I can't letyou in.
not_available This is our house! I wantyou out of here, now! Kate, do you know what's going on? 
not_available Marie, come with me.
not_available Why? 
not_available Please.
not_available This whole thing started with me.
not_available Please try and understand.
not_available I saw something in the company books that didn't check out, so I hired a private investigator to check up on Reza.
not_available You what?! 
not_available He came across the name of a man Reza's had dealings with.
not_available A man involved in terrorist activities.
not_available What?! 
not_available I did it for you, Marie.
not_available To protectyou.
not_available Protect me? All this time, you've been checking up on Reza behind our backs? These people found out something about Reza, about his past.
not_available If he's keeping something from you, wouldn'tyou rather know? What business is it of yours? This is my life.
not_available How dare you interfere with it like this! It's my wedding day! Hiring a private investigator? That's insane, Kate.
not_available Insane.
not_available Marie, just calm down, OK? These men are gonna be outta here in a few minutes.
not_available All right? It's just a big misunderstanding.
not_available OK? Let's try to remember that we're a family.
not_available Not any more.
not_available I don't wantyou at the wedding.
not_available It is unacceptable that she did this without telling me.
not_available Marie, I'm sorry.
not_available It was wrong of me not to tell you first.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available Now get out of here.
not_available No.
not_available Marie.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Miguel, where's the car? 
not_available I let Rob take it.
not_available Why? 
not_available We need it.
not_available We'll take a cab.
not_available We can't.
not_available Kim, what's goin' on? 
not_available We need to get Megan out of here.
not_available What happened? Gary threw her to the ground.
not_available She hit her head.
not_available The doctors think there's evidence of other things, too.
not_available Did you talkto the police? 
not_available I can't.
not_available He threatened to arrest me for kidnapping if I said anything.
not_available Kidnapping? 
not_available I took her out of the house.
not_available I had to.
not_available She's safe as long as she's here at the hospital.
not_available You need to talkto Carla.
not_available It's too late for that.
not_available What do you mean? You knowthat building that blew up today? My father used to workthere.
not_available They go after terrorists.
not_available I talked to him a half
not_available hour ago.
