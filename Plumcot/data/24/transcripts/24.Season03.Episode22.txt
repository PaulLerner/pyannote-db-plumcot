
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available I just got off the phone with one of my sources over at Keeler's headquarters.
not_available Sherry was there meeting privately with Keeler.
not_available Meeting Keeler about what? He didn't know.
not_available David I came here because I can guarantee you a win in November.
not_available David Palmer is an accessory to murder.
not_available David lied to the Chief of Police last night in order to provide an alibi for me.
not_available Why are you lying to me? I screwed up earlier.
not_available The SAT transmission on my system was forged by my own people.
not_available Making a mistake is one thing.
not_available Covering it up is another.
not_available I can't let you stay in place.
not_available I am taking over command of CTU now.
not_available I made a mistake, Jack No, Tony You made two I am going to let you speak to your husband Tell him that you are ok and you are being treated well.
not_available Are you all right? I am fine Don't let them do this, don't let?? If Jane is not release when I order it, your wife dies.
not_available That's all you need to know.
not_available Are we clear? From this point on, I am assuming control of CTU.
not_available Tony Almeida has stepped down.
not_available We are taking Jane Saunders to Division.
not_available Here's the order.
not_available We are leaving right now.
not_available Ok Going out this way right here.
not_available Where are all the guards? We don't need those guards anymore.
not_available Jack, Tony locked me in here Saunders has Michelle, he's using her as leverage to get his daughter out.
not_available This is Almeida.
not_available We are out.
not_available I have got her I will give you further instructions in 20 minutes.
not_available Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida The following takes place between 10:00 am and 11:00 am.
not_available Excuse me Chloe, I want you to pull up all the surveillance tape from every exit in this building.
not_available I want you to focus on the last 10 minutes.
not_available Adam, have you linked up with traffic surveillance yet? I'm working on top chance.
not_available Jack, I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders out of the building without authorization.
not_available That's right 
not_available Why? Saunders has Michelle.
not_available He wants to trade her for his daughter.
not_available Jane Saunders is the only leverage we have.
not_available Trust me, Chase.
not_available I know that.
not_available I got him.
not_available He left the building 3 minutes ago, and drove off the premises 90 seconds later.
not_available Adam, he's in a silver SUV.
not_available Chase, I want you to prep the tactical team.
not_available Be ready to move as soon as I give you an order.
not_available All right.
not_available I got him, Jack He's on 5th about half a mile from here, heading east.
not_available I will call you from the car.
not_available Son of a bitch Are you ok? It's just traffic.
not_available You have been acting all wired since we left.
not_available Yeah, well, there's a lot going on right now.
not_available You never really explained why you wanted to transfer me to this division place.
not_available I told you.
not_available I know what you told me.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available Yeah, well, I don't have the time to explain it to you right now.
not_available Almeida got my daughter out of CTU.
not_available You need to be ready to move the moment I tell you.
not_available When are you calling Almeida with instructions? At least 700 people are dead or dying in the Chandler Plaza Hotel because Saunders released a weaponized virus into the ventilation system What the media is reporting is a cover story.
not_available They are deflecting the truth to avoid mass panic.
not_available You will be infected along with everyone else No matter what he's paying you, it's not worth losing your life Jack is in pursuit of Tony.
not_available Move out as soon as we get a location on Saunders.
not_available Understand? Good Kim 
not_available Yeah What are you doing? I am working with a team that's monitoring my father.
not_available I thought you were setting up a tactical unit.
not_available Yeah, I am We have to wait until we get a location on Saunders.
not_available Until then, we are pretty much on standby.
not_available All right 
not_available Listen Before I have to go back out there, I want to talk to you.
not_available About what? About us I need to know whether there's going to be an us.
not_available Look, I have been thinking about it a lot, and the baby changes everything.
not_available It doesn't change the way I feel about you.
not_available Look, let's forget about me for a second.
not_available You have a daughter and a job that won't let you be with her.
not_available Is that you talking, or your father? My dad would be the first one to admit it.
not_available He wasn't the greatest dad.
not_available And it wasn't because he didn't love me.
not_available I know he loved me.
not_available It was because of his job If I transferred out of Field Ops, would you consider staying with me? I want to stay with you, and I would raise a child with you, Chase.
not_available I just won't raise one for you Adam, is he still on 5th street? No, I lost him He must have turned between Jarvis and Hill.
not_available Widen the search I am Ok, Jack, I have got him He's going south on Vine, 2 blocks below Hill You can save some time by 
not_available Ok, I got it He's hit traffic at Fillmore.
not_available You might be able to intercept on Grant.
not_available Look, I know you are lying to me I know you are not taking me to division.
not_available You will be fine, Jane.
not_available All right? At least tell me where we are going Where are you taking me? Back to your father My father? Why? He's holding my wife hostage, and he will kill her if I don't take you back to him So, basically, you are kidnapping me.
not_available I am sorry After everything he's done, how can you be sure he'll do what he says? How do you know he won't kill your wife, anyway? I don't have a choice.
not_available I wish I did, but I don't Tony, put that gun on the dash Put that gun on the dash, now! Slowly get out of the car Jane, stay where you are, everything is going to be fine.
not_available Saunders has Michelle.
not_available I know He wants to make a trade, Michelle for his daughter I know.
not_available I can't let that happen Look, I almost lost her once today, Jack I am not losing her again.
not_available Tony, listen to me I understand exactly how you are feeling.
not_available I have been there.
not_available And you handled it just like me, you kept everyone outside of it.
not_available Tony, this is different.
not_available Millions of lives are at stake Oh, rules apply to other people But not to you, right, Jack? Tony, just calm down, ok? Come on You help me make this trade, I will turn myself in.
not_available Go to prison, whatever is gotta happen.
not_available I can't do it We need Jane to lure her father in.
not_available Even if it means Michelle's gotta die.
not_available Michelle doesn't have to die.
not_available We can string Saunders along.
not_available I need you to start working with me Chase has already got a strike team mobile.
not_available No, no, no, no Saunders sees I brought CTU into this, he kills Michelle He's not going to know we are there.
not_available Tony, where are you meeting him? Tony, you don't have a choice right now You've got to work with me on this Where is the meeting? Come on, where are you meeting him? He wants me to be at a public pay phone at the corner of Taylor and Vine in 5 minutes.
not_available He'll give me further instructions from there.
not_available Thank you You are doing the right thing The quarantined areas are circled in red Now, as far as we know, we have containment.
not_available We are still not certain? No.
not_available But we can't really be certain for hours.
not_available Maybe days.
not_available David, listen The press is breathing down Gerry's neck pretty hard.
not_available Now, he thinks we should release a statement.
not_available I already have.
not_available I have closed down public transportation and I have told the people to stay in their homes.
not_available We have F18s patrolling the skies.
not_available Yeah, but we haven't revealed the exact nature of this threat and the press is picking up on that.
not_available We have 10 million people spread out over 4000 square mile area.
not_available If even a small percentage decide to leave at the same time, it will ignite a public panic beyond anything we could control.
not_available The right thing to do is to withhold the truth until we are sure the virus is contained.
not_available I will tell Gerry to hold off on the press as long as he can.
not_available Mr.
not_available President Yes, Jeannie.
not_available Senator Keeler's here to see you Have him brought in Yes sir.
not_available Hello, John Mr.
not_available President Please take a seat Thank you.
not_available I will stand You can imaging my surprise when I was told that you wanted to see me.
not_available Are you withdrawing from the race? Mr.
not_available President, with respect to the death of Alan Milliken, I know you lied to the police.
not_available Excuse me? You obstructed the investigation of a capital crime.
not_available That's a baseless charge, John.
not_available Though I have come to expect this kind of recklessness from you No, sir, it's neither baseless nor reckless.
not_available This is a photograph of the nitroglycerine medicine that would have saved Milliken's life.
not_available If it hadn't been kept from him You told the police Sherry was with you at the time of Milliken's death.
not_available Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle prove otherwise.
not_available Now the last thing this country needs is to have its President dragged through the mud for complicity in a murder Why are you showing me this, John? What do you want? Your resignation.
not_available Not immediately, of course.
not_available But once this crisis you are dealing with is over, you can resign with whatever face saving reason you want to give.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available I am offering you the chance to leave office with honor to control how your legacy is written.
not_available It's a good deal, David You should take it He's going to call in one minute.
not_available I should go to the phone Ok, as soon as Saunders tells you where he wants he exchange to take place, you need to reject the location.
not_available We need to force him into picking a secondary location so Chase has time to embed his teams.
not_available If I don't show up where and when Saunders wants me to, he's going to kill Michelle.
not_available Not as long as we have his daughter.
not_available What if he doesn't go for it? Don't give him a choice.
not_available You have got some leverage here, Tony, use it.
not_available All right.
not_available I need to go.
not_available My father kidnapped his wife because of me? Something like that.
not_available And now you want to use me as bait to get to him.
not_available We are going to do whatever we have to to stop your father from releasing this virus.
not_available Stay here.
not_available We'll be right back Where are we meeting? First, let me speak with my daughter.
not_available No.
not_available You can talk to her when we make the exchange.
not_available All right.
not_available Bring her to an industrial pack 3 miles north of where you are, on Maltin Road.
not_available A car will be waiting at loading dock 22.
not_available Choose a new place.
not_available That doesn't work Make it work You have got 10 minutes to get to the industrial park or your wife will die.
not_available If we meet there, we all die.
not_available Really? CTU has redundant satellite surveillance of that area.
not_available They are dedicating all their resources to finding me right now If you want your daughter back safely, you pick a new spot.
not_available I am not negotiating terms, Mr.
not_available Almeida.
not_available I have planned too long and too hard for this day and I will do whatever it takes to make sure nothing interferes.
not_available Even even if it means sacrificing my daughter.
not_available You need to understand my commitment, Mr.
not_available Almeida What the hell are you doing? He wasn't going for it.
not_available He is testing you.
not_available He's heard what you had to say.
not_available He'll phone back.
not_available Now hang up the phone.
not_available How you know? Because right now he thinks I am going to kill his daughter.
not_available The only reason why he exposed himself is to make sure she's still safe.
not_available Maybe that's what you'd do, Jack But you are not Saunders.
not_available No matter how well you think you know this guy, you are not him.
not_available This isn't a game, Jack We are talking about my wife.
not_available Michelle's got a better chance of surviving if we control the ground where the exchange is supposed to take place.
not_available But protecting her is not your priority, is it? If she were to get killed, that would be an acceptable loss, wouldn't it? My god, Jack, Didn't you learn anything from what happened to Terry? Shut up, Tony Shut up Tony Just because you sacrificed your wife for this job doesn't mean I am going to sacrifice mine.
not_available I am here Make no mistake This is your first and your last accommodation.
not_available Just tell me where you want to make the exchange.
not_available Downtown, under the 6th street bridge.
not_available Under the 6th street bridge.
not_available Be there in 30 minutes But if I see that you have brought anyone else into this, I will kill your wife.
not_available You did great Tony Almeida's going to make the exchange, but until we get confirmation that Saunders is on site, we stay invisible.
not_available I will assign positions on the way out.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What is it? Satellite pictures of 6th street bridge.
not_available I asked for a real time feed, Kim We will have it, too, by the time we are on site.
not_available What about air support? We are coordinating with the Marines.
not_available They will move on your order.
not_available They will move on your order.
not_available Look, Chase, please be careful Look, Chase, please be careful Don't worry about me.
not_available I will be fine.
not_available Chloe, how much time before you can setup a real time satellite feed for the 6th street bridge? Do you really think Chase is going to quit field ops to start a family? He won't I don't know where you are getting this from, but it's none of your business.
not_available I have known Chase for 3 years.
not_available You have been dating him for 3 months.
not_available And your point being? He might be a great guy, but he's just like your father They are both the same person.
not_available So if you are expecting him to leave this for the suburbs, you should revise your expectations.
not_available When can you uplink a satellite feed? Then do it I am just trying to be a friend, Kim.
not_available That's all Hello You have gone too far this time, Sherry You know, I thought I might be hearing from you, David You sent Keeler over here to blackmail me into giving up my presidency? Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down You mean Keeler paid you a visit? You know damn well he did and you know why Only one person could have given him that prescription bottle and that's you Ok, supposing that was true.
not_available What then? You should go to jail for murder.
not_available You should go to jail, too, David You lied to the police.
not_available You told them that I was with you all night Withholding evidence, obstruction of justice.
not_available Those are serious crimes I knew you always wanted to go down in the history books, David.
not_available But I am not certain like this.
not_available Am I right? What did Keeler offer you, Sherry? Exactly what you should have offered me, respect and a seat at the table, but instead you called me up when you needed me and then after I did your little dirty work, You threw me out like an old pair of shoes.
not_available You know me, Sherry, better than anyone, and you know I won't be bullied.
not_available So before this goes too far, you better ask yourself a question.
not_available Are you willing to go to jail? You know, David, I have asked myself that a million times and the answer is yes, I am willing to go to jail The question is, are you? I didn't think so.
not_available I want the strike teams split into 2 groups Group A can take cover here, group B back here.
not_available I want them briefed and ready to go as soon as we get there.
not_available If Saunders sees anyone other than Tony or his daughter, he's not going to make the approach.
not_available What's the response time for air support? I will relay the coordinates.
not_available I will see you at the bridge.
not_available You got it I know my father released the virus in the hotel that people died.
not_available But do you really think he'll do what he's saying? Release it all over the country? If we don't stop him, yes.
not_available Why? There has to be a reason he's doing all of this When I worked with your father, he dedicated himself to saving the lives of innocent people.
not_available Something has happened to him I don't know what But now he believes our government's betrayed him Is he right? There's no easy answer to that.
not_available The work that your father did often demanded that he make seemingly impossible sacrifices.
not_available Whatever happened to your father in Bosnia was obviously a sacrifice he wasn't willing to make.
not_available I am sorry No Shut up! No one can hear you.
not_available No Shut up now No No! Oh God I said stop, stop screaming Look at me, I have been infected.
not_available Help me, help me, help me¡­ Help We got a problem here What's going on? She has it She has the virus What are you talking about? She's bleeding, she must have caught it at the hotel They wouldn't have release her without testing her It's a trick She did it to herself Kevin, are you there? Kevin All right, take the east corridor Stop her from getting aboveground But do not shoot to kill CTU, O'Brian It's Michelle Hello? Chloe, can you here me? Whoever this is, I have a really a bad connection.
not_available I have got a lot of stuff to do right now Chloe So what did Keeler want? My job He has proof that Sherry was at Alan Milliken's tonight What? What, what proof? Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up with Sherry's fingerprints on it.
not_available How did he get a hold of this? How do you think? Sherry I talked to her a few minutes ago.
not_available She didn't even bother to deny it David, she's got to be bluffing I mean, if this gets out, she goes to jail.
not_available So will I She figures I have more to lose than she does And she's right What does Keeler want you to do? Withdraw from the race for whatever reason I choose.
not_available The party gets thrown into chaos, whoever takes my place won't have a prayer in the election, and Keeler becomes President.
not_available Oh, my god This is all my fault Hey, look We both made mistakes I am the one who called Sherry There may be a way out of this How Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right? What are you suggesting? That we take away the only leverage she has.
not_available You mean, steal evidence.
not_available My god, Wayne Before you say no, you just think about this, ok? Now, I can call Foxton, and he can make this all disappear.
not_available All you have to do is give me the ok Stay with her 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Is your strike team in place? You sure they will be of sight? They will be invisible, Tony Ok I am gonna back Tony up here at the 6th street bridge.
not_available We should get in position now.
not_available Jack, priority call from Kim This is Jack Dad, I got Michelle on the line Is she with Saunders No, she said she get away from him.
not_available Patch her through Hold on Michelle, go ahead I got away from Saunders, but he's still after me Michelle, it's me.
not_available Where are you? Wilshire, a block east of Olive Chase, send your strike team in now.
not_available Chase, don't What are you talking about? Michelle, I want you to listen to me very carefully I want you to let Saunders catch you again.
not_available What, are you crazy? We have to let the exchange go down It's the only way we are gonna catch him You want me to give myself up? Yes, the exchange site is secure, I will send our people in as soon as we know he's there.
not_available Chase, redirect your people now.That's an order.
not_available Chase, don't! Jack, stay out of this You are not in command here Get him out of here, now Jack, Jack, that's my wife, Jack You son of a bitch It's my wife Jack We need this exchange to go through Everything depends on it, do you understand me? Michelle, if he doesn't have you for trade, he won't go through with the meeting Look, we are not going to get another chance at it Do you understand, Michelle Yes We are gonna do everything we have to to make sure you come out of this ok But we have got to move now Let's get our teams into position And I thought your brother was the kind of politician who would never lower himself to my level I need to recover something that could cause him a great deal of trouble What is it? A bottle of medicine was taken from a crime scene.
not_available Has it been admitted into evidence? No.
not_available It's in the possession of Sherry Palmer, the President's ex
not_available wife I have a pretty good idea where she is right now, and I can partially reconstruct where she's been since she stole it.
not_available What kind of time frame are we looking at? Hours, Foxton, not days.
not_available Has this operation been authorized by the President? What difference does it make? You will get your money I am not worried about that, I just need to know who I am working for My brother knows what you are doing Not that I don't trust you, but I'd like to hear it from him Fine That's proof enough Let's go Chase and his men have Saunders yet? No one's coming yet Look, Jack, promise me you won't make a move on Saunders until Michelle is safe.
not_available We are going to move as soon as we have got a visual on Saunders, Tony That's the way it's got to go I know I am just asking you to do what you can You know I will We have got 3 cars headed in from the west Tony, they are coming.
not_available Are you ready? Yeah The windows are tinted.
not_available I can't see inside.
not_available Yeah Give her the phone My preference is to turn you over to your husband unharmed But I will kill you if anything goes wrong Yeah When I see my daughter, you will get your wife All right Jane, I need you to get out of the car Ok, everything is going to be ok I want you to walk over to your father's men Where's my father? We don't know Listen, we have to do this, Jane I am sorry Look, Jane, you have got to trust me on this Please go.
not_available Come on Jack, send your men in now.
not_available We don't have a visual on Saunders.
not_available I repeat we don't have a visual on Saunders I can't Hey, come here 
not_available Jane, no, turn around Jane, it's ok, come here Team A and B move We've got a visual on Saunders.
