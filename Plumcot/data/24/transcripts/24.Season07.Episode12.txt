not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Jack! 
not_available Put down your weapon.
not_available Now! 
not_available What the hell's going on? Where's Ryan Burnett? 
not_available What? Senator Mayer's chief of staff.
not_available Where is he? Tony doubled back to one of his contacts who gave him information of a second attack.
not_available It's gonna take place here in Washington within the hour.
not_available Juma's operatives are carrying it out.
not_available Burnett's been supporting them all along.
not_available He knows where the attack's gonna take place.
not_available So you can either tell me where he is, or I will find him myself.
not_available Mr.
not_available Burnett, you are a traitor and a terrorist.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I love my country.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, this is President Taylor.
not_available Where's the target? Where's the target? What you're doing is against the law, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available I am ordering you to stand down.
not_available Where is
not_available Take Mr.
not_available Bauer away.
not_available He's under arrest.
not_available You should have come to me.
not_available You should have presented your case.
not_available And would it really have made a difference, ma'am? 
not_available Colonel Dubaku is dead.
not_available Laurent must never know about this or about his father's cowardice.
not_available There is no sign of my father.
not_available Let me take his place on the assault team.
not_available Spoken like a true Dubaku, Laurent.
not_available It is time for us to go.
not_available This is it, Larry.
not_available No question.
not_available They're moving out.
not_available Any idea what the next target is? 
not_available No.
not_available From here, it is approximately 100 meters to the entrance.
not_available The following takes place between 7:00 p.m.
not_available And 8:00 p.m.
not_available Put it there
not_available this bag.
not_available Over there.
not_available Right there.
not_available Right there.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available That's it.
not_available I need to see her right now.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor, the president will see you as soon as she's able.
not_available Well, you tell her her daughter is done waiting.
not_available I'm going to the hospital to be with my father.
not_available I think it'd be a good idea to talk to your mother before you do that.
not_available The president's orders are that you remain in the White House.
not_available So if I try to leave you will actually physically restrain me? Now, that would never happen, Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available Because I know you have too much respect for your mother and her office to ever let things get that far.
not_available Well done, Agent.
not_available You've been at this a while.
not_available Five administrations, ma'am.
not_available Olivia, your mother asked me to fill you in on what's happening.
not_available Well, with all due respect, Ethan, you're the last person she should be sending.
not_available There's about to be another terrorist attack on this city.
not_available That's why she wants you to remain here.
not_available You're talking about more planes going down? We don't know, but whatever's going to happen will happen soon.
not_available I'm heading to the Pentagon.
not_available On top of all of this there's also the invasion to deal with.
not_available So bear in mind, your mother's under tremendous pressure right now.
not_available It's only a matter of time before the media picks up on the heightened security measures.
not_available I want to issue a statement before that happens.
not_available Play down the actual likelihood of an attack talk about the security measures as being due diligence rather than
not_available No, Meredith.
not_available The public deserves the truth.
not_available We stress caution and calm but we acknowledge we have intel about another terrorist action.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Angela and I will have something for you as soon as possible.
not_available Madam President, Larry Moss is calling in.
not_available He says he's got a lead on the attack.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Agent Moss, you're on with the president.
not_available Madam President, we've discovered what we believe was a staging area being used by terrorists on the south shore of the Potomac near the I.T.P.
not_available Rail and shipyards.
not_available Madam President, we've identified one of the men as GeneralJuma.
not_available What? Juma's in D.C.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available And we know that there are at least a dozen other men involved in the attack.
not_available And they are armed for a small war.
not_available Have you found evidence that tells us where the target might be? No, ma'am, but we have search teams out looking for the men and we're hoping that Agent Walker has more information.
not_available She's the one who I.D.'d Juma, but, uh we've lost contact with her.
not_available Lost contact? 
not_available Yes, Madam President.
not_available But we have every reason to hope that she's still alive and in pursuit of the terrorists.
not_available If she's out there, ma'am, we'll find her.
not_available Hold it right there! I'm Agent Renee Walker, F.B.I.
not_available Agent Walker? We just got an alert on you.
not_available You need to call Larry Moss at F.B.I.
not_available Right now.
not_available Tell him there's gonna be a terrorist attack on the White House.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I'll call it in right away.
not_available This is Thompson
not_available Ranger Thompson, please respond and report your location.
not_available Ranger Thompson.
not_available Ranger Thompson, please respond and report your location.
not_available Ranger Thompson.
not_available Bill.
not_available The Attorney General wants you transferred to his custody so I can file criminal charges.
not_available Have you learned anything else about the attack? I reached Tony.
not_available He couldn't get any more information from his guy.
not_available According to F.B.I., Renee Walker followed a lead on her own to an abandoned warehouse on the Potomac.
not_available Got a visual on a heavily armed commando unit led byJuma himself.
not_available But she went missing right after she called in.
not_available What do you mean, missing? We're not sure.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Searching the area, but there's no sign of her 
not_available or any evidence telling us what the target might be.
not_available Burnett knows.
not_available The president offered him an immunity deal.
not_available He turned it down.
not_available Hasn't said a word since.
not_available Damn it, Bill.
not_available He was talking when they stopped me.
not_available Put me in a room with him for five minutes, and we can stop this thing from happening.
not_available Jack, even if I was willing to release you, he's being transported to Kennedy Memorial.
not_available You couldn't get access to him.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then you do it.
not_available You can get access.
not_available I'm not trained in coercive techniques.
not_available This is not a maybe.
not_available Ryan Burnett is an accessory to a terrorist attack.
not_available If you don't do this, people will die.
not_available I'm not arguing about what needs to be done, but I can't do it.
not_available It's not me.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available Jack.
not_available Damn it, Bill.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available You were the one who told me
not_available people who stand by they might as well help them plant the bomb.
not_available You can do this.
not_available Bill, you have to do this.
not_available I can't, Jack.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Bill.
not_available I can't.
not_available This is it, General.
not_available Cimbe.
not_available We're on the other side of the conduit.
not_available Are you in position? Yes, General.
not_available I will be ready for you.
not_available What was that? I thought I heard you say somethin'.
not_available Just, uh, talking to myself.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, I tell you we're having people over on Saturday? Nothing fancy.
not_available We're bringing in Chinese.
not_available You think you're gonna make it this time? Oh, Chinese.
not_available I was looking forward to Sheila's cooking.
not_available All clear, General.
not_available Excellent.
not_available We'll have access in 10 seconds.
not_available Once we're in, we'll have two minutes until the proximity alarms come back up.
not_available Five, four, three, two, one.
not_available Move! I've accessed the Secret Service tracking grid.
not_available Where is she? Right here, in the Oval Office.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Clear.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available We will meet resistance, which we must counter quickly, silently.
not_available We have nine minutes until the next Secret Service roll call.
not_available We must find the president by then.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Keep me up on your status.
not_available Quiet.
not_available The president is preparing to issue a statement to clarify that.
not_available Yeah, I'll let you know as soon as it's ready for release.
not_available Let go of the phone.
not_available Huh? 
not_available Five minutes until roll call, General.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Let's get this secure.
not_available Down that way.
not_available All the way around.
not_available All the way.
not_available Move it! Go! Go! 
not_available It's clear.
not_available Heads up.
not_available 10:00.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Juma had your father killed.
not_available What? Listen to me.
not_available I know that Dubaku is your father.
not_available Juma's been lying to you.
not_available Your father is dead.
not_available My father is alive! Juma had to make sure that your father didn't talk so he sent a man named Udo to murder him.
not_available No.
not_available L
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I was there when Udo did it.
not_available That's how I found you
not_available by following him back to the railcar.
not_available GeneralJuma betrayed you.
not_available You are lying.
not_available You are lying! 
not_available Renee! 
not_available Set it up.
not_available I know the target! Reissued warrants and order for transport, sir.
not_available Transport is set.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Sorry, Jack.
not_available This way, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available It's Larry Moss.
not_available Renee Walker says the target is the White House.
not_available How good is her intel? 
not_available Firsthand.
not_available She says they're getting in via subterranean access.
not_available I'll initiate a lockdown.
not_available You alert C.I.R.G.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan.
not_available I have confirmation the White House is the target of a terrorist attack.
not_available Condition red.
not_available Repeat.
not_available Condition red.
not_available Secure the president.
not_available Get to your posts.
not_available All teams be advised.
not_available We have breach.
not_available Jack, I could use your help.
not_available I need to know you'll do exactly as I say.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Where's the president now? 
not_available Oval Office.
not_available What's the meaning of this? 
not_available You need to come with us.
not_available The White House is under attack.
not_available What? 
not_available Madam President, we need to go.
not_available Ma'am, we need to go right now.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available I've got the president's daughter.
not_available We're on our way to the lockdown.
not_available Men are down.
not_available There's no safe path out.
not_available We need to secure her in the first floor lockdown.
not_available Bill, we're clear.
not_available What the hell is he doing here? 
not_available He's with me.
not_available Madam President, right now you need all the help you can get.
not_available How is this happening? Where's my daughter? Aaron Pierce is taking her to lockdown as we speak.
not_available But we need to move.
not_available Agents in zones five, seven and nine, please respond.
not_available Five, seven and nine, respond.
not_available I can't reach anyone in the quadrant.
not_available Juma's men are headed straight for us.
not_available They know where she is.
not_available They're tracking her, Bill.
not_available Madam President, let me see your tracker.
not_available Bill, what's the most direct route to the lockdown? 
not_available From the east.
not_available I'll head west with the tracker and draw them away.
not_available You go with Jack.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer? This is your house.
not_available I'll follow.
not_available We're moving the president to lockdown.
not_available Agent Hovis, we've got agents down in multiple quadrants.
not_available We need reinforcements, sir.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're on our way to the lockdown now.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available General.
not_available The president has left the Oval Office.
not_available She's heading down the west corridor.
not_available Udo, take your team that way.
not_available We'll trap her in between us.
not_available We're getting close to the president, sir.
not_available Up ahead, around this corner.
not_available The president's tracker, sir.
not_available They know we're here.
not_available They're moving the president to the lockdown.
not_available Find her.
not_available Take him.
not_available We need hostages.
not_available Start gathering them.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Cleared five.
not_available Seven! 
not_available Code red! Code red! Where? 
not_available We've engaged hostiles on the way to the lockdown.
not_available We do not have a visual on the president.
not_available We're still two minutes away.
not_available Don't shoot! Get up! Get up! Move! Move! 
not_available Move it! Go! Go! Get up! Aaron, it's Jack.
not_available I'm with the president, approaching the lockdown.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available We're still upstairs, Jack.
not_available Keep walking! Shut up! Move! 
not_available Please! Let us go.
not_available Hostiles are in control of the area.
not_available Looking for a way past them to the lockdown.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Juma's men are closing in on our position.
not_available You're gonna have 30 seconds to get here before I have to seal this door.
not_available Understood.
not_available You will not close this door until my daughter gets here.
not_available Madam President, right now, your life is a priority whether you like it or not.
not_available Please, step inside.
not_available Madam President, are you all right? Aaron, it's Jack.
not_available We're sealed off in the lockdown.
not_available We came under attack.
not_available We didn't have a choice.
not_available We couldn't have made it anyway, Jack.
not_available We'll try to find a way out of the building.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Aaron
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack, do you read me? Aaron, it's Jack.
not_available Do you copy? Damn it.
not_available Juma's cut off our communication.
not_available I need to know that my daughter's safe.
not_available Madam President, I can't answer that yet.
not_available Abo.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's roll! 
not_available GeneralJuma.
not_available They brought in reinforcements.
not_available I don't know how much longer we can hold them off from your position.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Ngozi.
not_available Agents are moving in from all directions.
not_available We will be heavily outnumbered.
not_available Does Secret Service know their president is secured in the lockdown? The only ones who saw are dead.
not_available Put me on to their communications channel.
not_available Go ahead, sir.
not_available This is GeneralJuma.
not_available I have the president.
not_available Evacuate immediately, or she will die.
not_available I need proof you have the president before I can give that order.
not_available Let us speak to her.
not_available Who is this? 
not_available Special Agent Hovis.
not_available Agent Hovis.
not_available Move your men out of the building and beyond the fence line or I will kill the president.
not_available And her death will be on your head.
not_available Agent Hovis? We're pulling back.
not_available All agents fall back immediately.
not_available Wilson here.
not_available Pulling back.
not_available I repeat: All agents, fall back.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Pull back.
not_available A II teams, pull back.
not_available General, Secret Service is retreating.
not_available They are retreating, General.
not_available All of them? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Gather all the hostages and bring them here.
not_available Come on, move! 
not_available Lock down the exits.
not_available Move.
not_available Sir.
not_available Cimbe.
not_available Status report.
not_available Confirming Secret Service retreat in western quadrant.
not_available Continue sweep.
not_available Copy, General.
not_available The only reason Secret Service would retreat is if they thoughtJuma had the president.
not_available But that man Bauer said he got my mother into the lockdown.
not_available Juma's bluffing them.
not_available We need to get out of here and let our people know that as soon as possible so they can retake the building.
not_available Get out of here? How? They're everywhere.
not_available Move it! 
not_available Get them in the back! Everyone keep moving! Keep your hands on your head.
not_available Move it! Stop lagging! Let's go! 
not_available Move it! 
not_available Move it! Move! 
not_available Move it! Come on! 
not_available Move it! Move your feet! 
not_available Right here! Come on! Keep going! Sit! 
not_available Everybody down! Get down! 
not_available Turn around! Turn around! 
not_available Can you open it? Yes.
not_available Assuming the specifications Hodges gave us are correct.
not_available How long? 
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available Right here, Agent.
not_available Copy.
not_available We confronted them in one of the first floor corridors.
not_available At that point, Juma ordered us to retreat threatening to kill the president if we didn't comply.
not_available But he never gave a visual confirmation he was holding the president? He didn't, but I felt at that point, I had no choice but to pull back.
not_available His men were killing civilians and agents.
not_available Any idea how many people are still trapped inside? Cross
not_available checking the evacuees with the White House manifest so far, it looks like 53.
not_available Any Secret Service? 
not_available As far as I know we have no agents left in there still alive.
not_available Hostage rescue teams are moving into place.
not_available They'll be prepared to storm the building as soon as the order's given.
not_available Yeah, well, at this point, that order has to be given by the vice president.
not_available What's his status? 
not_available Secret Service has him en route to a secure location.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me know as soon as he's locked down.
not_available And, Hovis, I need an infrared sat scan of the building.
not_available Highest resolution possible.
not_available Got it.
not_available You didn't tell me thatJack was in the White House.
not_available He was under arrest, being held under guard when the attack took place.
not_available Under arrest for what? He found out an aide to Senator Mayer named Burnett was part of the conspiracy.
not_available He was caught torturing him
not_available in the White House.
not_available Almost killed the man before he was stopped.
not_available Renee, the president is our priority, notJack Bauer.
not_available Are we clear on that? 
not_available Clear.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yes.
not_available They're bringing in more hostages.
not_available Get in there! Sit down! Sit! No talking! No talking! 
not_available Silence! I don't see Olivia.
not_available Madam President, that's good news.
not_available I know Aaron Pierce.
not_available He will do everything in his power to make sure that your daughter is safe.
not_available This is the White House, for God's sake.
not_available How was it possible that they were able to get around our security protocols? There's only one explanation.
not_available They had help on the inside.
not_available From whom? Oh, this is insane.
not_available Juma must realize that there's no way for him to get out of this alive.
not_available I'm afraid he does.
not_available This is his endgame.
not_available He came here to make a statement, and he's willing to die for it.
not_available As soon as the rescue teams realize that you're secure, they'll move in.
not_available It's only a matter of time.
not_available What's he doing? Is that some kind of explosive? 
not_available No.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer? 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available They've got the access codes.
not_available I need to get into that panel.
not_available Is there something I can do? Yeah.
not_available Get me that toolbox over there.
not_available Put it on the table.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Madam President, plug the cord into the wall, please.
not_available Now.
not_available Okay.
not_available General.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available It just went dead.
not_available Somehow, they must have disabled the circuitry from inside.
not_available Do we use C
not_available 4 to blow open the door? We'll have to drill sinkholes into each of the 11 locking rods.
not_available It would take too long.
not_available Depending on how the steel is hardened, C
not_available 4 might not even work.
not_available Then you will find another way.
not_available There can be no room for doubt.
not_available We have the president trapped.
not_available We open up that door, we become a part of history.
not_available We will find another way.
not_available Despite previous predictions 
not_available American forces have met surprisingly little resistance in establishing a protective ring around Sangala City.
not_available Top military leaders are pleased with the progress
not_available Yes.
not_available Oh.
not_available Just a moment.
not_available Call came in on the dedicated uplink.
not_available I heard it.
not_available It's him, sir.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available General, didn't expect to be hearing from you directly.
not_available What is it I can do for you? 
not_available We have a problem.
not_available The president is secured in the lockdown.
not_available Well, we prepared you for that possibility.
not_available We gave you the specs for the locking mechanism.
not_available They shorted the lock out from the inside.
not_available I need you to find me another way in.
not_available General, I've given you everything I have to give.
not_available My part in this thing's over.
not_available Are you forgetting that you don't have the shipment yet? Now, General, I expect you to be an honorable man.
not_available We made a deal.
not_available We held up our end of the bargain.
not_available We got you in the White House.
not_available I expect you to hold up yours.
not_available I don't care about your expectations.
not_available You help me, or I will destroy that shipment before it ever arrives to you.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Well, Seaton, what do you think? Can he do what he says? Shipment's not due in the port for another two hours.
not_available His men will have plenty of time to destroy it render it useless.
not_available General, tell me.
not_available Who else is in the lockdown with the president? My men saw her enter with another man.
not_available Well, I'm looking at the White House manifest.
not_available And according to this, Olivia Taylor is presently in the building with you.
not_available The president's daughter? Are you sure? Their system logs everyone in and out electronically.
not_available If it says that she's in there, she's in there.
not_available Now, you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get the president to open that door.
not_available Your shipment will arrive as planned.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There, you see? Stress.
not_available Stress is the fertilizer of creativity.
not_available Let's play some darts.
not_available The president's daughter is somewhere in the White House.
not_available Let's find her.
not_available Raise your heads.
not_available Show me your faces.
not_available Silent.
not_available Eyes down.
not_available What do you think's going on? I asked you a question, Mr.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available You think I made the wrong call with Bauer.
not_available You think that if I'd signed off on him torturing Ryan Burnett all of this could have been avoided? You don't know what I'm thinking, Senator.
not_available Your hands where I can see them.
not_available She's not here.
not_available Go and find her and bring her to me.
not_available Our orders are to hold tight and wait for them.
not_available What happened? What'd you see? 
not_available Door's guarded.
not_available There's gotta be another way out.
not_available There are only three exits to this wing, and they're all covered.
not_available The windows are sealed and hardened
not_available unbreakable.
not_available We have to let them know the terrorists are bluffing, that they don't have my mother.
not_available Our only option is to get a signal out.
not_available We can do it from the windows of the residence.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available You'll be safer if I leave you in a secure area.
not_available I'll get the signal out and come back for you.
not_available I'm not gonna sit and hide in some damn vent, Agent Pierce.
not_available Ma'am, it is a long way, and we're probably gonna encounter more ofJuma's men.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I'm going with you, and don't try to argue.
not_available We don't have the time.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stay behind me.
not_available Inside.
not_available Agent Moss, sat scan's all set up here.
not_available We can see the cluster of hostages, but not the individual bodies.
not_available The best they can do? They can't boost the resolution? No, sir.
not_available The White House is one of the most heavily shielded buildings in the world.
not_available You copy? 
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available Vice president's ready.
not_available They're initiating communication.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Give us the room.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You're on with the vice president.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, I'm Special Agent Moss head of the F.B.I.
not_available D.C.
not_available Branch.
not_available This is Agent Walker.
not_available I've been briefed on the general situation.
not_available What are the latest facts on the ground? There's nothing further from GeneralJuma but an infrared scan of the building shows he's holding the hostages in a hallway outside the Roosevelt Room.
not_available This is very possibly good news for the president.
not_available Explain.
not_available The area's not one of the more defensible places in the building.
not_available Tactically, it makes no sense forJuma to have chosen it as a base.
not_available However, the area is adjacent to the ground floor lockdown which we know the president was en route to.
not_available So you think the president made it into the lockdown? That's our best explanation for him being there.
not_available We're therefore asking you to authorize the rescue operation beforeJuma manages to penetrate the lockdown.
not_available Do you have any other evidence that supports your theory that the president is in the lockdown? There's the fact that he couldn't produce the president when we asked him to prove that he had her.
not_available Couldn't or wouldn't? You can't be certain which one it is, can you? Certainty is not possible in this case, sir.
not_available We're giving you our best estimation and we urge you to allow us to launch.
not_available What if you're wrong? What ifJuma does have the president? He will kill her as soon as he realizes what you're doing.
not_available Inaction has its own risks too, sir.
not_available The more timeJuma has to reinforce his position the more difficult it'll be to take the building and to save lives.
not_available I understand but my priority must be the president's life.
