
not_available Previously on 24 We pay you to develop the override, not for you to give it away to the rest of the world.
not_available You're working with Cheng? Are you insane? Cheng kidnapped Jack, had him put in a secret prison outside of Beijing and tortured him for over a year.
not_available When Audrey went to go look for him, he did the same thing to her.
not_available I really don't have any use for you anymore.
not_available Send it.
not_available Fire order.
not_available We're to sink the Chinese carrier Shenyang.
not_available Fire torpedoes one and two! Mr.
not_available President, we know who issued the false order that sank your carrier.
not_available Cheng Zhi.
not_available Cheng is dead.
not_available We have reliable evidence that he's alive and he's here in England.
not_available Our carrier sinking and the deaths of thousands of crewmen is a brazen act of war that cannot go unanswered.
not_available It's imperative that you find Cheng and the override device, so that we can show the Chinese that we were not responsible.
not_available Bauer is still in the picture.
not_available You were supposed to have taken him out.
not_available I sent a team to recover him.
not_available He's not gonna stop until he finds me.
not_available My people will meet you at the dock.
not_available You'll be out of the country in less than an hour.
not_available Bring the witness.
not_available What's in her head is extremely valuable.
not_available You set me up for the Russians, you son of a bitch.
not_available Why?! I thought Bauer was a traitor.
not_available I thought he was here to assassinate you.
not_available The Russians have been pushing us for four years to turn him over to them.
not_available I forged your signature on the rendition order.
not_available I am placing you under arrest for treason.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I can still use him.
not_available I'm gonna need him to set up a meet.
not_available He's bleeding out.
not_available Get me a towel now! Where is Cheng?! 
not_available My country has not forgotten.
not_available They will not give up until you pay for what you have done.
not_available I have a contact at the Chinese Embassy here in London.
not_available Let me arrange a meeting and I will bring evidence that the penetration of our systems was out of our control.
not_available Please take this to your father as quickly as possible.
not_available Jiao thank you.
not_available My associate has his weapon trained on you.
not_available Sit back down on the bench and don't move.
not_available Maybe I'll allow you to live.
not_available Jiao? My God.
not_available I told you, you may not move from the bench.
not_available But my friend is still alive.
not_available Let me go see if I can help her.
not_available I won't run.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available I'm going to her to see if I can help her.
not_available Do not scream.
not_available Do not communicate with anyone in any way.
not_available Why are you doing this? What do you want? You move from the bench again, my sniper will kill you.
not_available Sit.
not_available Stolnavich's e
not_available mails all look like they're personal.
not_available To family, different women.
not_available Could it be in some sort of code? Stolnavich wouldn't have kept something like that in the open, even if it was coded.
not_available I got e
not_available mails from three days ago using a false name and arranging for payments for a shipment.
not_available Leaves tonight.
not_available Cheng's got to be that shipment.
not_available He's gonna be on a freighter from the harbor 
not_available in less than 40 minutes.
not_available Okay, I'll call it in.
not_available I'll get Erik to send a team there right now.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What is it? This is Agent Morgan.
not_available I'm gonna need a team sent down to South Hampton.
not_available This time stamp this was taken less than a minute ago.
not_available Hang up the phone.
not_available Hang up the phone now.
not_available I'll call back.
not_available Yes? Stop tracking me.
not_available As soon as I'm safely away, I will set her free.
not_available If you come near me or anyone try to help her, 
not_available she dies instantly.
not_available Cheng, please listen to me Those are my terms! Is that clear? Yes.
not_available Cheng? Cheng?! So it's over.
not_available We We we can't go after him.
not_available Getting to Cheng is the only way 
not_available we're gonna stop this war with China.
not_available You're just assuming that.
not_available We don't know if we can get the proof to President Wei! Or even if he'll back off when he gets it.
not_available We're condemning Audrey to death for nothing.
not_available We don't have another choice.
not_available She loves you.
not_available Shut up! Agent Morgan.
not_available We can't involve the CIA.
not_available Cheng will see them coming from a mile away.
not_available What's the alternative? He's right, there isn't one.
not_available I need to go after Audrey.
not_available Jack, you're under a direct order from the president to go after Cheng; you got to follow that.
not_available I can go after Audrey.
not_available You really think you can handle this? Yes.
not_available Okay, I want you to contact Audrey's office discreetly.
not_available Find out where she was going.
not_available Whatever you do, do not alert the CIA.
not_available I want you to put together a small team.
not_available You take out that sniper.
not_available You keep me posted every step of the way.
not_available I will.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm Agent Erik Ritter, acting head of station.
not_available Your military advisors are set up in our secure comm and briefing facilities upstairs.
not_available Well, thank you, Agent Ritter.
not_available Have you heard anything from Audrey? I checked in on their Secret Service detail She and Jiao Sim were still talking.
not_available What about Bauer? Negative on Bauer, sir.
not_available What's our status, Admiral? The Chinese now have eight amphibious landing groups steaming toward our bases in Okinawa.
not_available The first Chinese carrier to reach the 12
not_available mile limit will be in the next half hour.
not_available At which point, the seventh fleet has standing orders to engage.
not_available Also, they've ordered their nuclear armed submarines to ascend to 300 feet firing depth.
not_available Sir, we need your authorization to escalate our own nuclear readiness in response.
not_available Put our subs and silos on the highest alert.
not_available See if you can get President Wei on the line.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available Ma'am, are you okay? Are you all right, love? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Can I use your phone, please? Yes.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Who is this? Jack, it's me.
not_available Chloe, where are you? Cheng had me; I jumped out of his truck.
not_available Adrian's dead.
not_available I know.
not_available You got my message.
not_available You know he used the device to launch the attack on the Chinese carrier? Yes, and if I capture Cheng alive and can prove his involvement in today's attack, we might be able to get China to back down from war.
not_available Do you know where he is? He's leaving on a cargo ship.
not_available Belcheck's meeting me down at the docks.
not_available You can't go in there blind.
not_available I'm at Millswood, not far from the docks.
not_available Come get me.
not_available I'll run comm for you.
not_available I'll get you satellites, schematics.
not_available Chloe, I don't think that's a good idea.
not_available Jack, I know you don't trust me.
not_available Adrian lied to me.
not_available The only thing I did wrong was to believe him.
not_available Please, let me make this right.
not_available Give me your cross streets; I'll pick you up.
not_available President Wei, whenever you're ready.
not_available Go.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Forgive me for being blunt.
not_available You've got your navy heading toward Okinawa, which our seventh fleet is ready to defend.
not_available But it's in both our interests to avoid a shooting war.
not_available Especially with both our countries at a high
not_available level of nuclear readiness.
not_available The destruction of our carrier and the deaths of our soldiers is a provocation.
not_available Our military must respond.
not_available We have agents in the field in the process of apprehending Cheng Zhi.
not_available While that's happening, I'm asking you, as a gesture of good faith, to halt your naval advance.
not_available Our military's official position is that Cheng is dead.
not_available Myself and my allies in the Politburo must accept this is true, unless proven otherwise.
not_available You've made yourself clear, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Let me make myself clear.
not_available Once your forces cross the 12
not_available mile limit outside of Okinawa we will fight.
not_available Get your men on board and out of sight.
not_available We are scheduled to depart in 15 minutes.
not_available Is there a way to expedite this? That would draw scrutiny neither of us want.
not_available Chloe, get in.
not_available What the hell happened? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available I got banged up getting away from Cheng.
not_available We don't have a lot of time.
not_available I'll explain everything while we drive.
not_available Where is your communications setup? The trunk in the backseat.
not_available Chloe, I need to know why you were with Adrian Cross when you took the override device.
not_available Jack, I tried to get the device from Adrian, but he had a gun.
not_available We got back to the base and Cheng was waiting.
not_available Adrian wasn't who I thought he was.
not_available He manipulated me and he used my knowledge to create the device.
not_available So, this is partly my fault.
not_available That's why I need to help you.
not_available I need to try to make this right.
not_available It's up to you.
not_available At this point, I think I'm the only friend you have left.
not_available Whether you want to admit it or not.
not_available The operation's simple.
not_available Capture Cheng alive.
not_available Why are you doing this alone? Why not ask the CIA for help? Because he's got Audrey pinned down by a sniper.
not_available He'll kill her if he sees any operation moving against him.
not_available Jack, I'm sorry.
not_available It's not your fault, Chloe.
not_available You need to let that go.
not_available None of this is.
not_available Audrey, this is Kate Morgan.
not_available I'm working with Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm here to help you.
not_available It's really important that you don't react to what I'm saying because we don't want the sniper to know that you're in communication with me.
not_available Okay? Nod if you understand what I'm saying.
not_available Okay, I need to know if you have any idea where the sniper is.
not_available Look down if the answer is no.
not_available Listen, I know Cheng doesn't want to kill you.
not_available You're gonna have to trust me on this.
not_available I'm gonna need you to draw the sniper's fire so that I can locate exactly where he is.
not_available Nod if you're still with me on this.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna count to three, and on three, I need you to make a sudden movement.
not_available Okay, ready? One two three.
not_available I got him.
not_available Stay put and just know that I'm out here, okay? Jack.
not_available What's your status? 
not_available I've located the sniper, but I need to move into position so I can lay down some cover fire for Audrey to run.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you've got her secured.
not_available Got it.
not_available Four of us moving in is just gonna attract too much attention.
not_available I'm gonna run point.
not_available The minute I have a clean line of sight, we move on my command.
not_available Did you get everything? There are too many places for Cheng's men to hide.
not_available That's what I'm here for.
not_available I should be able to backdoor a satellite and get their positions.
not_available Cellular modem's not giving me a signal.
not_available I need to get online.
not_available I can wire into that dish.
not_available I need to reprogram the transponders.
not_available My comm is open.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Cover me.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Wait.
not_available Thank you for everything.
not_available And good luck.
not_available Go.
not_available Audrey, I'm about to move into position where I can get a clean shot on the sniper.
not_available As soon as that happens, the second that you hear gunfire, I want you to run toward the tree behind your left shoulder.
not_available Okay, stand by.
not_available Jack, I'm backdoored into a satellite overhead.
not_available Resolving the infrared.
not_available Okay, I can see you and Belcheck.
not_available You're clear.
not_available Go.
not_available Stop, Jack.
not_available You have two guards coming straight at you.
not_available Ready? Now.
not_available Jack, there's another guy on top of the container.
not_available Five o'clock.
not_available Got it.
not_available Turn here.
not_available Go.
not_available Jack, you'll have to take out two guards on the port side.
not_available There are men on the bridge.
not_available They're moving away.
not_available You're good.
not_available Clear.
not_available Go.
not_available Copy that.
not_available target on the left; you take target on the right.
not_available On my count.
not_available Three, two, one, fire.
not_available Chloe, we're on the boat.
not_available Jack, you have a man at the top of the stairs to your left; there's another one on the container directly in front of you.
not_available I'm picking up about a dozen other heat signatures on the ship, mostly in pairs.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What's the status on Audrey? I haven't heard anything.
not_available Most of the men are in a defensive formation around the comm tower that must be where Cheng is.
not_available Guide us in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sir.
not_available I've been running scans someone in the immediate area is downstreaming with a local satellite.
not_available Roll
not_available call your men.
not_available _ _ Whoever's linking to the satellite, can you cut the access and the communication? Yes, and I can redirect their feed to my screen.
not_available Do it.
not_available Contact whoever's left.
not_available Tell them to go find him.
not_available Go! _ _ What are they doing? No.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Cheng knows we're here.
not_available Jack, I have to tell Kate.
not_available She needs to move now.
not_available Kate, it's Chloe.
not_available They're onto us.
not_available You have to get Audrey out of there 
not_available and get the CIA involved.
not_available I'm about to move into position, Chloe.
not_available Cheng's gonna order the sniper to shoot! Get Audrey out of there now.
not_available Move.
not_available _ Engage! Engage! Go! Go! Go! Okay, got him.
not_available Get up there and make sure he's dead.
not_available Audrey, are you okay? Yes.
not_available Eric, it's Kate.
not_available Where are you? I'm at Malden Park with Audrey Boudreau.
not_available Inform Secret Service that we have secured her and we're taking her back to the CIA.
not_available Where's her current detail? 
not_available I'll explain everything later.
not_available Right now you need to get a team over to South Hampton docks.
not_available Jack was going in stealth but right now he's in trouble and he really needs your help he's trying 
not_available to stop this war.
not_available Kate I need tac teams suited up in choppers, now! Jack, Audrey's safe.
not_available Thank God.
not_available They've jacked my feed.
not_available I've lost satellite, and I'm trying to get it ba Chloe? Chloe? Jack? Jack! Jack, do you copy? I've cut communications and taken over their satellite feed.
not_available These two signatures must be Bauer and whoever he has with him.
not_available We're leaving now.
not_available _ _ They're getting ready to push off.
not_available I need you to get down to the engine room, do whatever you can to stop, and I'll make my way to the bridge.
not_available Go.
not_available Is Jack closing in on Cheng? Yes.
not_available Cheng was using you to get to Jack.
not_available That's why Jack sent me here.
not_available Is Jack all right? I don't know.
not_available Get down! Got two men down.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Audrey.
not_available No.
not_available Call Erik, tell him we have a second shooter.
not_available Give me that.
not_available Get medical here right now! Oh, my God.
not_available Stay with us.
not_available Erik, we need medical now! Audrey Boudreau's been hit.
not_available Cheng had a second shooter.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Stay with me, Audrey.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Audrey, will you stay with? Oh, God.
not_available Please, Audrey.
not_available You're not gonna Audrey, please stay with me.
not_available Stay with me, okay? Stay with me! Oh, God.
not_available Admiral? Air reconnaissance confirms.
not_available The Chinese amphibious groups are still on course for our base in Okinawa.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I need a go
not_available ahead to engage if the perimeter is breached.
not_available Anything from Jack? 
not_available I'm afraid not, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Sir, our forces are awaiting your orders.
not_available I know that, Colonel.
not_available Sir I need a word.
not_available Private.
not_available Belcheck? I got to fall back to reset.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Jack, it's Kate.
not_available Yeah, go ahead.
not_available Jack, I'm so sorry.
not_available We lost Audrey.
not_available What are you talking about? You said she was safe.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available There was another shooter, and he got her, Jack.
not_available I'm I'm so sorry.
not_available Jack? Jack, can you hear me? Jack, talk to me.
not_available Engine turn it off.
not_available You should have stayed hidden like a rat.
not_available You could have died an old man.
not_available The Chinese have breached the perimeter, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Permission to engage.
not_available Set weapon postures red and tight.
not_available You are cleared to engage any positively
not_available identified Chinese air or surface targets.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, if this should escalate, we need to begin reviewing the nuclear response scenario.
not_available Begin the review.
not_available Sir, I'm putting through an urgent call from downstairs.
not_available Excuse me, gentlemen.
not_available I have Jack Bauer on live comm link.
not_available Hold that order.
not_available Delay weapon posture red.
not_available Putting it up on the monitors.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available I have Cheng Zhi, and he is alive.
not_available I have Cheng, and he is alive.
not_available Initiate facial recognition.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Just connected with the Chinese.
not_available Just give me one second.
not_available You're being recorded.
not_available Tell them who you are.
not_available Tell them who you are.
not_available Do we have confirmation? Just a few more seconds, sir.
not_available Tell them who you are! My name is Cheng Zhi! Did you get that? Did you get that?! Got it.
not_available That's facial recognition and voice match.
not_available It's him.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Out.
not_available Let's get President Wei on the line.
not_available This is for Audrey, you son of a bitch.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, did you receive the file we just sent you? I'm looking at it now.
not_available Then you can see that Cheng is alive and in our custody.
not_available This confirms everything I've told you about the sinking of the Shenyang.
not_available It was not my order.
not_available We will need to verify this recording.
not_available Well, you can verify it all you want, but in the meantime, you need to turn your ships around.
not_available Your ships have crossed our defensive perimeter.
not_available If you don't turn them around, I'm going to be forced to respond.
not_available All right.
not_available I will instruct our ships to withdraw, but I need your assurance that we will discuss reparations for the loss of our carrier and the soldiers aboard.
not_available You have that.
not_available And thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Sir, I, uh Before we head back out, I need to talk to you.
not_available Speak.
not_available It's rather sensitive, sir.
not_available Maybe, uh Maybe you want to sit back down.
not_available I don't need to sit down.
not_available What happened? Tell me.
not_available Sir, um It's Audrey.
not_available She's dead.
not_available She was shot by a sniper during her meeting with Jiao Sim.
not_available It was one of Cheng's men.
not_available That's got to be a mistake.
not_available She was at a covert meeting.
not_available She had Secret Service detail with her.
not_available That's impossible! Every man on that detail was killed, as well.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available It's not a mistake.
not_available We got confirmation from the field that your daughter died ten minutes ago from a gunshot wound.
not_available Oh.
not_available Sir.
not_available Sir.
not_available Get a medic in here, will you? We need a medic at the second floor conference room.
not_available You okay? Sir, you okay? Okay.
not_available Go easy, go easy, go easy, go easy.
not_available Easy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Chloe? 
not_available I haven't heard from her.
not_available Not since we charged the boat.
not_available Chloe? Jack.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available No.
not_available Chloe! This is Bauer.
not_available Who is this? When? Where? Understood.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Just set it up.
not_available Erik.
not_available It's my after action report.
not_available Look what happened to Audrey, it wasn't your fault.
not_available Field work is not an exact science.
not_available There's no way you could have known that Cheng had a second shooter.
not_available Yeah, I, uh I realize that.
not_available Per the president's orders, these men are going to escort you to Lakenheath where a military transport will take you back to the States.
not_available How is the president? The president is boarding Air Force One as we speak.
not_available James, you have my deepest sympathy.
not_available I can't even imagine what you're going through.
not_available Thank you, Alastair.
not_available You've been a good friend.
not_available If there's anything I can do, anything at all No, there's nothing you can do.
not_available Nothing anyone can do.
not_available The day before we left for London, I was sitting in my office looking at a picture on my desk of a beautiful woman.
not_available I kept staring at it.
not_available It's been on my desk since my first day in office.
not_available And I knew that I knew that woman.
not_available But I couldn't think of her name.
not_available Ten seconds, 15 seconds go by, then, poof.
not_available Pops into my head.
not_available It was Audrey.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I won't remember anything that happens today.
not_available I won't remember anything that happens, period.
not_available I won't remember that I had a daughter that died in such a horrible fashion.
not_available _ Are you sure you want to do this? Yeah.
not_available She walks first! Jack, you don't have to do this.
not_available It's time for you to go home.
not_available You were right about what you said, earlier.
not_available About being my best friend.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Look in on my family when you can.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available I've taken you at your word.
not_available But if you're lying to me if anything happens to her or my family your entire world will come apart, and you will never see it coming.
not_available We just want you, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available That's all we ever wanted.
not_available I would say you're going to enjoy Moscow but you'd know I was lying.
not_available Go to the car.
not_available Go.
