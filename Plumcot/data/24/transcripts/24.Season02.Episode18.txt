
not_available Vice president's on the line.
not_available Jim, I have reason to believe the Cyprus audio was fabricated.
not_available I thought we proved it was real.
not_available CTU LA is in the process of obtaining intelligence that may show otherwise.
not_available With all due respect, it's too late for second thoughts.
not_available Come out with your hands on your head.
not_available I killed a man! If you turn yourself in, they'll consider that.
not_available If I see you coming in, I will kill her! Go, go, go! 
not_available He wasn't working alone.
not_available What? Baker was keeping an eye on Kate.
not_available Michelle distracted him.
not_available Did you help Jacktake Kate Warner? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available Put a filter on all of Michelle's communications.
not_available Let me know when Jacktries to contact her.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Ten minutes ago a man called me.
not_available Said he had proof the evidence the president was basing his decisions on was forged.
not_available He'll give me more info if I bring you to him.
not_available I got whatyou need.
not_available I won't give it to you until you give me Kate.
not_available How does the evidence prove the recording was forged? I have the source recordings.
not_available Why did you follow me from CTU? When you broke out, you isolated yourself.
not_available You'll need help.
not_available Left! On the left! 
not_available Go for the door now! Kate, come with me.
not_available Get down.
not_available Stay down! Who are these guys?! Follow
not_available up team sent by my employers.
not_available Figured out they didn't get me.
not_available How'd they know you were here? Beats the hell out of me.
not_available Jack, you there? Yusuf, are you OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where are you? I've managed to get to the vehicle and rearm.
not_available What's out there? 
not_available Three down that I know of.
not_available There's three more.
not_available I don't have their positions.
not_available I'll find a better vantage point.
not_available We'll figure out what we're gonna do in here.
not_available I'll get backto you.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Have him cover us.
not_available Let's get out of here! We don't know how many are out there! 
not_available I'll call my person at CTU.
not_available She can help.
not_available Negative.
not_available You're not calling anybody.
not_available The only way you get the proof Palmer needs is if we do this my way.
not_available We go now! They're trying to kill us.
not_available Doesn't it prove something? Not to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in DC.
not_available Call Yusuf, let's shape an exit strategy! 
not_available Jack.
not_available Yusuf, go ahead.
not_available Sounds like another Humvee just arrived.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Stand by.
not_available We're surrounded.
not_available You've gotta let me make this call.
not_available I've got someone on the inside that can give us infrared satellite.
not_available I guarantee you, I will not jeopardise your identity.
not_available Off line? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do it.
not_available Dessler.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Are we secure? My cell's scrambled, but don't call on agency numbers.
not_available I'm being monitored.
not_available You were right, Ali's recording was fake.
not_available The president's about to invade the Middle East based on falsified evidence.
not_available Do you have proof? 
not_available Notyet, but I can get it.
not_available I need your help.
not_available It'll be difficult.
not_available Tony's been breathing down my neck since I helped you.
not_available Work around it.
not_available I need infrared satellite.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Get the coordinates off our connection.
not_available What are you looking for? We're surrounded.
not_available There's three of us inside.
not_available I need to know how many men are outside.
not_available I got a friendly at the end of the alley, behind the dumpster.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yusuf? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available We're gonna be a few minutes.
not_available We're waiting on satellite.
not_available It's gonna take a while.
not_available We should secure our position.
not_available Come on.
not_available Is Mr Garcia gonna be all right? 
not_available He'll live.
not_available I'm gonna put down thatyou claim the shooting was an accident.
not_available It was.
not_available He'll still have to explain to the DA what he was doing going into the store with a gun.
not_available It wasn't his.
not_available What's that? The gun, it was mine.
not_available What are you doing with a gun? Someone gave it to me earlier tonight.
not_available Look, my name's Kim Bauer.
not_available This afternoon, I escaped from police custody.
not_available And I'm a suspect in a murder.
not_available While most Americans are asleep and haven't heard the news about the nuclear detonation in California, many are up and are starting to react.
not_available That reaction is taking many forms, and in some cases violence is erupting.
not_available We're still awaiting a statement from the White House on who is behind the attack.
not_available That's enough.
not_available We hope The alert status of the National Guard? 
not_available They're ready in metropolitan areas.
not_available What about outside the big cities? 
not_available We may have to get help from the military.
not_available Local law enforcement might not be able to do the job.
not_available Call General Bowden, tell him to put troops on standby.
not_available The army? We can't do that.
not_available You're worried about posse comitatus.
not_available Exactly.
not_available We can't use army or air force on American soil.
not_available Only navy and marines.
not_available No, the navy can't help us.
not_available And there are not enough marines on standby.
not_available I'll deal with the consequences.
not_available Call him.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The status of our bombers? 
not_available They're proceeding to their targets.
not_available Where are they now? 
not_available South of Greenland.
not_available They should enter Middle Eastern airspace in four hours.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What are you doing on the satellite? Just checking on something.
not_available Prepped the files for the next shift? Yeah, I'm almost done.
not_available I'm gonna go see if Tony needs some help.
not_available Hey what's up? You asked me to keep an eye on Michelle? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She was accessing a mod
not_available sat screen.
not_available That's not unusual.
not_available We've been on mod
not_available sat all night.
not_available She received a call that wouldn't lock onto our log.
not_available It was open? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It might have been Division.
not_available It might have been.
not_available All right find out what she was looking at.
not_available Let me know.
not_available Yusuf, what's happening out there? I thinkthey're repositioning.
not_available We're still waiting on satellite.
not_available I'll get backto you.
not_available With CTU's help, we're gonna get out of here, I promise.
not_available What does Wallace want with me? 
not_available He needs you to get out of the country.
not_available Needs me? How? With your father's CIA connections, his company has a special travel dispensation.
not_available They wouldn't let him on board as a passenger unless I was on the plane with him.
not_available I know.
not_available Kate.
not_available I will not letyou get on that plane.
not_available Is there any way I can find out how my boyfriend is doing? I don't know about that.
not_available Wait till we get to the station.
not_available There was also another officer.
not_available His name was Brown.
not_available He was in the accident as well.
not_available I don't know him either.
not_available Look, miss, you're under arrest.
not_available So, take my advice, don't say any more.
not_available It doesn't matter anyway.
not_available You can make a phone call at the station.
not_available Who am I gonna call? My dad was the one who was flying the plane, the one with the bomb in it.
not_available I don't have anyone any more.
not_available Almeida.
not_available She's looking at infrareds.
not_available She's been collecting data.
not_available Pull coordinates off what she's looking at.
not_available If it's for Jack, that's where we'll find him.
not_available I tried that.
not_available What's the problem? She's covered her tracks.
not_available She's pulled 100 quadrants.
not_available I have no idea which one she's interested in.
not_available I'll tell you what, I'll deal with this, Carrie.
not_available All right? Thanks.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I don't have a lot of time.
not_available Are you ready? Give me one sec.
not_available OK, I'm ready.
not_available I count11, including your friendly.
not_available I'm sending you their positions on an infrared map.
not_available They're all stationary except for one.
not_available Jack, he's roving.
not_available OK, send it.
not_available OK.
not_available You got it? 
not_available Yeah, I got it.
not_available How much longer do you need to stay anonymous? I don't know, why? 
not_available Tony's watching me.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available All right.
not_available I've got so much to do.
not_available I know.
not_available You always take a phone with you to the bathroom? Where's Jack? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available We've been monitoring all communication coming in and out all day.
not_available If you're breaking protocol 
not_available I'm not.
not_available All right, then I'll ask you again.
not_available Where's Jack? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Butyou have to call President Palmer.
not_available Tell him not to act on the recording until Jack finishes the investigation.
not_available So you have talked to Jack? 
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Listen carefully, Michelle.
not_available You don't work for Jack, you work for me.
not_available Get pastyour ego Ego? You don't like the way I'm doing my job, that's your problem.
not_available But if you know anything about Jack Bauer, you'd better tell me about it right now! I have no information.
not_available I'm not helping Jack.
not_available I hope you're not lying to me.
not_available She counted nine, plus one roving.
not_available If I was a sniper, I'd cover the building from here.
not_available Yeah, looks right.
not_available We'll have to build a corridor.
not_available Which exit? 
not_available This one right here.
not_available Go between here, let 'em fire at each other.
not_available It'll give us ten seconds to get to the car.
not_available With just us firing? We don't have another way.
not_available Jack, I know howto shoot a gun.
not_available Take this.
not_available You stay right behind me.
not_available Yusuf, this is Jack, do you copy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're getting ready to make our exit.
not_available Let me give you positions.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We've counted nine, plus one roving.
not_available We got two shooters on the balcony right above me.
not_available Three in the building adjacent.
not_available I just got off with the secretary of defence.
not_available He wants to know how much longer you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape before we fail
not_available safe the orders.
not_available Jack Bauer will have up until the time the planes start releasing bombs.
not_available From the secretary's point of view, that's tying the DOD's hands.
not_available The longer it takes for your decision, the less flexibility he has, and he may want to launch a prestrike There will be no prestrikes on this mission.
not_available We're gonna utilise every moment we have to be thorough.
not_available He won't like that.
not_available That's his problem.
not_available I understand.
not_available Sir, there's a situation that requires your immediate attention.
not_available What, Mike? Civil unrest is starting to tip up and down the East Coast.
not_available The area I'm most concerned about is outside of Atlanta.
not_available What's going on there? Some ad hoc militias have joined forces and they're getting very aggressive in one of the suburbs.
not_available Is this racially motivated? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The demographics of the area are predominantly Middle Eastern.
not_available What do you hope to accomplish here? We want Washington to know we consider ourselves at war.
not_available We want these people interned.
not_available And if they won't do it, we will.
not_available Who do you want interned? Most people in this neighbourhood are US citizens.
not_available They weren't born here.
not_available Some of them don't speak English.
not_available They memorise answers to 50 questions, take the test, then we let them vote.
not_available How do you respond to claims that these people have no more to do with the bomb than you or I? If we'd locked down our borders 20 years ago, none of this would have happened.
not_available What's eerie is, even though the crowd has been here for half an hour, there are only a few police cars.
not_available Why? I thought we ordered the National Guard.
not_available Some are on their way, some are at other flash points.
not_available Want me to call the FBI and the army? And tell them what? 
not_available They've had their orders.
not_available The problem is resources.
not_available We just don't have enough bodies to cover everything.
not_available Where's the media heading right now? It's happening all up and down the East Coast.
not_available But this city, Marietta in Atlanta, seems to have the most traction with the press.
not_available All right.
not_available This is what we're gonna do.
not_available We may be short on manpower, but it doesn't have to appear that way.
not_available Send all the Eastern Georgia National Guard to Marietta.
not_available And tell the media that this is where something's going to happen.
not_available What's going to happen, sir? If this is what the people are going to be watching, let's showthem how we're going to respond.
not_available I want them to see how we protect our citizens.
not_available We will not put up with racism or xenophobia.
not_available If this is where it's gonna start, this is where it's gonna stop! All right, I'm all set up here.
not_available Start laying down the smoke.
not_available We're ready to go.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Go in on the smoke.
not_available You take the men on the left, I got the ones right above us.
not_available You ready? Smoke's in place.
not_available I'll drawfire and go pick up the vehicle.
not_available Go! Kate! 
not_available Jack! Kate, get down! Kate.
not_available Come on, we gotta keep going.
not_available Keep moving! Get in the front seat and stay down! Get down! Stay down! Go, go, go! 
not_available Let me look at it.
not_available No exit wound.
not_available We gotta getyou to a hospital.
not_available No.
not_available LAX, cargo departures.
not_available You will not make it.
not_available I'll make it.
not_available Just stop the bleeding.
not_available Kate, in the glove box, there's a first
not_available aid kit.
not_available Get me all the gauze, pads and wraps.
not_available Hold on, hold on.
not_available Put pressure on it now.
not_available It's a surreal scene in Marietta.
not_available It's 4.30am and normally people would be at home, asleep.
not_available Yet today a showdown is in the making.
not_available The riots have escalated all over the city.
not_available Fires and looting are reported to be widespread.
not_available The National Guard continue to roll in, as do the angry citizens, who are taking out their frustration on this peaceful Middle Eastern community.
not_available You got whatyou asked for.
not_available It's on all the news channels.
not_available Manski of the National Guard wants to know what tactical rule
not_available setyou wanna follow.
not_available What are they on now? 
not_available Containment only.
not_available Unacceptable.
not_available I want the law enforced.
not_available Tell him to start making arrests and taking people in.
not_available Sir, if you declare a curfew you can start pulling every one of them in 
not_available before this thing gets out of control.
not_available That a good idea, do it.
not_available Tell him we're not afraid to take action.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What will help more than anything, sir, is your voice.
not_available You need to talk directly to the people.
not_available I know.
not_available Tell Jenny I'll be down in a few minutes.
not_available Murphy speaking.
not_available This is Novick.
not_available I need Jenny Dodge.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Yeah? LAPD said there was automatic
not_available weapon fire in Studio City.
not_available Police are finding bodies and military
not_available spec weapons.
not_available We got the address.
not_available Check it against what Michelle pulled off the satellite.
not_available Right away.
not_available Is that the location, Michelle? Huh, is it? The police just got there, they already got four bodies.
not_available So let's talk! 
not_available Yeah, that's it.
not_available We gotta call him.
not_available He may need our help.
not_available Jack made it clear that the only way to get proof is if CTU stays out of it.
not_available We don't even know if he's still alive! He's on an open channel.
not_available You won't be able to trace it, butyou can talkto him.
not_available Michelle! 
not_available No, Jack, it's Tony.
not_available Tony, trust me, stay out of this! What's going on? 
not_available The president asked me for proof that the Cyprus recording was fake.
not_available I'm trying to do that.
not_available The man who can provide proof will only deal with me.
not_available He won't cooperate with CTU.
not_available That's why I left in that way.
not_available How do we know he's not using you? Cos ten commandos tried to kill him to stop him from making a deal with me.
not_available What's he want? 
not_available He wants to disappear.
not_available We'll deal with him here.
not_available He will not cooperate with us under those circumstances.
not_available I understand, but this country's about to go to war over this.
not_available This is too big for one person to handle.
not_available Even you.
not_available Keep going straight! Sorry, I can't do it.
not_available He's still bleeding bad! Hey, Bobby.
not_available Is this Kim Bauer? 
not_available I'll take her.
not_available What about processing her? It's OK.
not_available Go fill out the report.
not_available Come with me.
not_available We'll go in here.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Looks like you've had quite a day.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You took Megan Matheson from her home.
not_available She was being abused.
not_available Got into a fight with her father.
not_available Then, you took Megan again, this time from the hospital.
not_available You stole Gary's car and fled the city.
not_available I had to.
not_available I knew about the bomb.
not_available Understood.
not_available But then you were stopped by CHP Officer Raymond Brown, who discovered the dead body of Carla.
not_available I didn't kill anyone.
not_available I know you didn't.
not_available We know Gary killed his wife.
not_available We're looking for him.
not_available There was a witness, and we found his prints on the murder weapon.
not_available You did? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're off the hook for everything that happened this morning.
not_available Thank God.
not_available There's still the matter of you and your boyfriend's attempted escape from custody.
not_available Officer Brown was badly injured in the accident.
not_available But he's gonna make it.
not_available And we now knowthatyou were telling him the truth about the bomb.
not_available So I'm free? You should have somebody from CTU call the DA's office on your behalf.
not_available Butyes, you'll be free to go.
not_available I know my father usually does this, but I have clearance.
not_available An offiicer of the company has to be on the flight.
not_available I'll be on it.
not_available Can you hold on? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Jakarta.
not_available Surprised I'm giving up my destination? No.
not_available You'll just change it once you're in the air.
not_available Prep a cargo transport to Jakarta, Indonesia.
not_available Give us clearance so we can leave tonight.
not_available Who else will be flying with you? What name should I give them? 
not_available Passport, in my pocket.
not_available I got it.
not_available William Patterson.
not_available One moment, please.
not_available Come on, stay with me.
not_available He's losing consciousness! Wallace, we can't take this chance.
not_available Tell me where the evidence is, and I give you my word, I'll getyou out of the country.
not_available You know what, Jack? You were a real badass backthere at the warehouse.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available No.
not_available I'm losing him! Dammit! 
not_available What are you doing? I wanna see if there's an urgent care centre in the neighbourhood.
not_available Come on! Four blocks.
not_available Four blocks, make a right.
not_available Go! I want ID's on the bodies.
not_available See what traces are on the weapons.
not_available Bauer's actions are CTU's responsibility.
not_available We won't run from this.
not_available Let's find out who they are.
not_available Send in forensic teams? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available NSA andfield units? 
not_available Yeah, that's fine.
not_available Mr Almeida, Kim Bauer on line four.
not_available Kim, where are you? 
not_available At a sheriffs station in Santa Clarita.
not_available What happened? I won't be charged for murder, but 
not_available Look, I still might need some help.
not_available Sure, what do you need? They were taking us backto LA, and my boyfriend and I tried to escape.
not_available And we got into a car accident.
not_available A police officer was injured.
not_available I'll call the DA's office, see what I can do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm sure you'd rather be talking to your dad about this, but I know they probably told you he's not available right now.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available He's in the field.
not_available In the field? You mean, he's alive? Oh, my God, Kim.
not_available You still think he died in the plane.
not_available He didn't? 
not_available No, no.
not_available George Mason took over.
not_available He was able to get out in time.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available When can I talkto him? Not for a while, Kim.
not_available Come on, come on, get him! I need to see the doctor! 
not_available You can't do that.
not_available Open the door! I will call the police! 
not_available Lady, I am the police.
not_available Now, open the door! 
not_available Let him in.
not_available Let him in! We need you! 
not_available What happened? He's been shot.
not_available I'm a Federal Agent.
not_available He has information vital to national security.
not_available I need you to stop the bleeding and keep him alive.
not_available This is a clinic.
not_available He needs a hospital.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available You've got to do whatyou can now.
not_available Doctor, please.
not_available All right.
not_available Clara, get me suture kits, lidocaine with epi, and a crash cart.
not_available Now, now! The wound's right here.
not_available He's got a bullet lodged in his back.
not_available Hello.
not_available Miguel, it's me.
not_available Kim.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I'm OK.
not_available Yeah? Look, it's so weird, but the police know Gary killed Carla.
not_available We're not gonna be charged with anything, except maybe the escape.
not_available But I think we're OK there, too.
not_available That's good.
not_available Good? It's great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How aboutyou? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Are you sure? I mean, you don't sound I don't sound what? Excited? Gee, Kim, I'm really sorry.
not_available Miguel, what's wrong? Why are you acting like this? 
not_available I shouldn't have letyou talk me into it.
not_available Yeah, but it worked out.
not_available For you.
not_available I'm the one that's here in the hospital.
not_available You just said you were fine.
not_available I am going to be fine.
not_available I'm just gonna be fine withoutyou.
not_available What? 
not_available I don't wanna see you any more.
not_available Why not? 
not_available There's no "why not", it just is.
not_available No.
not_available Miguel, what is going on? Are you OK? 
not_available I'm coming to see you right now.
not_available Kim, I said no.
not_available It's over.
not_available You mean that? Yeah I mean it.
not_available I knowthe rules.
not_available I knowthat I work for you.
not_available And if you fire me, I wouldn't blame you.
not_available This isn't about me firing you, Michelle.
not_available This agency is supposed to be supporting the president and this country.
not_available If I can't account for our actions, we've got chaos.
not_available Jack is in an impossible situation.
not_available I was helping him get proof the audio was fake.
not_available Yeah? Well, where's the proof? We don't have any proof.
not_available We don't have Jack, he doesn't want to be found.
not_available What do you want from me, Michelle? I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah, well, you've said it.
not_available Now, if you don't mind, I got workto do, all right? Our planes are over the Atlantic.
not_available They will be reaching their targets in three hours.
not_available The pilots' communication posture? 
not_available Comm is open to them.
not_available The planes can be ordered back at any time.
not_available Good.
not_available I don't know if anyone's told you, but the sooner we can lockthis mission down, the more comfortable the Joint Chiefs will be with it.
not_available My job's not to make the Joint Chiefs comfortable.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr President.
not_available There's been a development in Marietta.
not_available The National Guard took on a more aggressive posture at our request.
not_available But the disturbance got to be more than they could handle.
not_available What happened? Two people were killed, sir.
not_available The National Guard started shooting rubber bullets, and there were two fatal hits.
not_available One of the victims was a leader of the dissent, and And? 
not_available And the other was a young boy, sir.
not_available He was Middle Eastern, and he was from one of the families that we were trying to protect.
not_available What's going on now? They've made some arrests, but the crowd is still unruly.
not_available Now, we might want to think about taking a step back.
not_available Maybe the presence of the National Guard is making matters worse.
not_available If we step back now, those families are left completely unprotected.
not_available Yeah.
not_available A young boy.
not_available What was his name? The boy? 
not_available I don't know, sir.
not_available The boy had a name.
not_available Find out.
not_available Indeed I will, sir.
not_available It was a tragic accident.
not_available Tell the National Guard to hold their ground.
not_available I want that neighbourhood protected.
not_available I want order restored.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available There's the bullet.
not_available It missed the jugular, but still caused damage.
not_available What can you do? 
not_available I might be able to tie off the bleeders.
