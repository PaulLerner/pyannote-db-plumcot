not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin, Ken Dellao, CNB.
not_available I'm wondering if you can confirm some information.
not_available I'm gonna be reporting in this evening's broadcast that a rogue ex
not_available federal agent named Jack Bauer is the prime suspect in the murder of Ryan Burnett.
not_available You leaked the story of Burnett's murder and my involvement to the press.
not_available So another one of your errors in judgment bites you on the ass.
not_available You've gone too far this time.
not_available Renee, it's Jack.
not_available Don't hang up the phone, please.
not_available Whatever they told you, I did not kill Burnett.
not_available I sent you a photo of the man who did.
not_available All I want you to do is make an I.D.
not_available John Quinn.
not_available Black ops combat vet.
not_available Now he works for Starkwood.
not_available Starkwood work with Juma? 
not_available If they did, it wasn't on the books.
not_available You know, if anyone knows, it's Senator Mayer.
not_available Renee.
not_available Where's Bauer? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Don't you lie to me.
not_available We know you accessed a classified government database and sent someone's name and address to Bauer.
not_available Tell me where he is.
not_available I can't.
not_available Put her in holding.
not_available Mirandize her.
not_available If Bauer connects us toJuma, it could seriously impede this operation.
not_available Yes, it could.
not_available Is the shipment on time? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Due into port in the next hour.
not_available Once the weapons are deployed, then it doesn't matter what Mr.
not_available Bauer or anyone else knows.
not_available I didn't kill Burnett.
not_available This man did.
not_available His name is John Quinn.
not_available He works for Starkwood.
not_available What in the world does Starkwood have to do with this? Your informant claims Starkwood was trying to acquire a bioweapon.
not_available That's your connection toJuma.
not_available You've been trying to dismantle Starkwood for the last six months.
not_available If they have a weapon like this, you better believe they intend to use it.
not_available No! 
not_available Just tell me where the weapons are coming in.
not_available You're too late.
not_available They're already here.
not_available The following takes place between 10:00 p.m.
not_available And 11:00 p.m.
not_available Sir.
not_available Preliminary sweep of the immediate area is done.
not_available There's no sign of Bauer.
not_available All right.
not_available Widen the grid.
not_available And run down any security cameras around the perimeter.
not_available Witnesses.
not_available Somebody must have seen him.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available Yes.
not_available Larry Moss is on the line.
not_available Agent Moss, please tell me you haveJack Bauer in custody.
not_available I wish that were the case, Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available The truth is
not_available Sir, it's Senator Mayer.
not_available He's dead.
not_available What? 
not_available He was murdered at his house.
not_available We only found out that Bauer was on his way over here a short time ago.
not_available Unfortunately, we got here too late.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Are you telling me thatJack Bauer just killed a United States senator? That's the assumption that we're working under.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How could you have let this happen, Agent Moss? He had us all fooled, sir.
not_available I released Jack Bauer into your custody.
not_available I ordered you to keep him on a short leash.
not_available No.
not_available No, Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available You are not gonna lay this one at my feet.
not_available It was your decision to give Bauer access to Burnett.
not_available I advised you against it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin? I'm sorry.
not_available Uh, what did you say? I said I advised you against it.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available Sir, I have teams sweeping the area.
not_available Just find him, Agent Moss.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Starkwood was involved with everything that's happened today.
not_available They helped Juma and his men bring down those planes and attack the White House.
not_available In exchange, they were allowed to develop and manufacture a W.M.D.
not_available In Sangala.
not_available It's a bioweapon.
not_available Apparently it's already here in the U.S.
not_available Who else knows about this? No one.
not_available Senator Mayer and I were piecing together the information right before he was killed.
not_available You said the weapon's already here.
not_available Are they in possession of it? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available The text message I got off their agent's cell phone said " Port of Alexandria, Lot C, 10:15 p.m." 
not_available Why not just call the F.B.I.
not_available And lock the whole place down? 
not_available Because we're fugitives, Tony.
not_available No one's gonna believe us.
not_available We need to know exactly where that weapon is before we call anyone else in.
not_available Tony, I need to know if you're with me on this.
not_available Yeah, I'm with you.
not_available Okay, meet me at the north end of the port.
not_available There's an access road right before the main entrance.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available It's over.
not_available Dubaku and Juma are dead.
not_available Everyone responsible for the terrorist attacks.
not_available Responsible for Roger.
not_available Thank God for that.
not_available And there'sthere's something else
not_available something good that's come out of all of this.
not_available Olivia is here at the White House.
not_available Olivia? She's come home, Henry.
not_available This crisis
not_available it brought us together.
not_available I've asked her to stay on as special adviser, and she's agreed.
not_available Ally I can't begin to tell you how happy that makes me.
not_available Me too.
not_available Sweetheart, I know that you're tired.
not_available You should get some rest.
not_available Livy and I will come to the hospital just as soon as we can.
not_available When you can.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available Give Olivia my love.
not_available Love you.
not_available We love you too.
not_available Doctors expect him to make a full recovery.
not_available Henry's a lot tougher than anyone thought.
not_available Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe, just maybe this day will end on a positive note.
not_available What is it, Ethan? What's wrong? I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Madam President, but Senator Mayer is dead.
not_available What happened? All evidence points to the fact that he was murdered 
not_available byJack Bauer.
not_available Bauer? It's hard to believe.
not_available I know.
not_available It
not_available It doesn't make any sense.
not_available After everything he's done today why on earth would he do this? We'll know more when we find him.
not_available My God.
not_available Madam President in light of what's happened, and for the sake of your administration I'm afraid I have no choice but to resign as your chief of staff.
not_available Ethan.
not_available Madam President, please.
not_available You need to hear this.
not_available Inevitably it'll come to light that I sanctioned Bauer's release from custody.
not_available Unless I step down immediately the damage to your office and you personally will be extensive.
not_available Ethan, Olivia has already killed this story once today.
not_available We can control the damage.
not_available No.
not_available No, not even Olivia can control it now.
not_available Not after the senator's murder.
not_available The truth is, Madam President I didn't do enough to protect you.
not_available The truth is, I failed you and I should shoulder the blame for what's happened.
not_available Ethan, really.
not_available You're
not_available You're taking this too far.
not_available Am I? I'm not so sure.
not_available As your daughter has made abundantly clear I have a lot to answer for.
not_available You have done nothing but be an invaluable adviser to me
not_available and an even better friend.
not_available I appreciate your saying that, Madam President, but Olivia's right.
not_available The political knives will be out.
not_available Every decision I've made will be scrutinized.
not_available There'll be calls for a special prosecutor.
not_available You're a great woman, Allison.
not_available You have great work yet to do.
not_available I'm a liability to you now.
not_available Don't let me compromise your next three years in office.
not_available Don't let me sink your agenda.
not_available Our agenda, Ethan.
not_available Yes.
not_available Our agenda.
not_available Trust me, Madam President.
not_available It's the right thing to do.
not_available Accept my resignation.
not_available I'll have a letter on your desk in the morning.
not_available They're gonna be here any minute.
not_available We need to narrow down the search.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If they off
not_available loaded it today, it should still be on the storage dock.
not_available It's still a needle in a haystack, Jack.
not_available There must be over a thousand containers in there.
not_available We need to access the yard's manifest.
not_available What's the security? 
not_available I spotted one port authority officer.
not_available That's it? That's it.
not_available There's gotta be more.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Honey, it'll be fine.
not_available I get relieved in a few hours.
not_available Carl, you know I don't like you working double shifts.
not_available Well, it was my choice.
not_available And we could use the overtime.
not_available How are the girls? 
not_available Kicking like a chorus line tonight.
not_available They miss their daddy.
not_available What did the doctor say? 
not_available That I'm lucky it's not triplets.
not_available Honey, let me call you back.
not_available Don't even think about going for your weapon.
not_available I need the port's manifest.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available I'm just a P.A.
not_available Cop.
not_available Where is it? Customshouse.
not_available That way.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We on schedule? 
not_available We're at the staging area near the port, sir but we're still waiting on Quinn.
not_available He should have been there by now.
not_available Have you heard from him? We tried his cell, but he's not answering.
not_available If Bauer took out Quinn he might have knowledge of the operation, mightn't he? Should we stand down, sir? No.
not_available Give Quinn five more minutes, then go in.
not_available Do so with extreme caution 
not_available and contact me the minute that you secure the container.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Everybody on the board is here, sir.
not_available You have a worried look, Greg.
not_available It's very tense in there, sir.
not_available They're sixyear
not_available olds, Greg and they need to eat their carrots.
not_available Doug.
not_available Rough day.
not_available Been a rough day for the United States of America.
not_available White House under siege, president taken hostage.
not_available It's especially painful because we know this didn't have to be.
not_available Fact: The United States military is strained to the breaking point.
not_available Fact: Reinstatement of the draft 
not_available is off the table, for political reasons.
not_available Fact: The people in this roomyou all
not_available control the largest private army in the Western Hemisphere.
not_available Now, could we have been of help today? You bet your ass we could have been of help.
not_available But they didn't call us, did they? No.
not_available Instead we sit here our contracts are canceled, our soldiers vilified our corporate sovereignty is threatened by congressional fiat.
not_available Doug, you brokered the deal with this government.
not_available You were shortsighted.
not_available They don't understand that the global war on terror can only be won with forces like ours.
not_available So, as of this minute, we sit for no more depositions, we volunteer no more documents.
not_available I don't even want us to take any phone calls.
not_available Is that what this is about? For the security of our countryIs that what this is about? 
not_available We cannot afford to let them take us down.
not_available You came here to ask the board to risk a federal indictment? It won't work, Jonas.
not_available We got a deal.
not_available It's a good deal, and we're lucky to have it.
not_available With an administration that wants to destroy us, wants to take us out of business.
not_available No, this
not_available It's all different now.
not_available Today was a game
not_available changer.
not_available No
not_available Institutionally, we are in compliance with the subpoena.
not_available Documents have been filed, depositions taken.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Jonas, we have to stay engaged with this administration.
not_available No, we don't, Doug.
not_available You and I can talk this out.
not_available If you guys have any questionsany further questions
not_available Greg, you will stick around, and you'll answer them.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Your way was a mistake, Doug.
not_available You have to acknowledge that.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But you and I both know that Starkwood cannot survive an all
not_available out war against the subcommittee.
not_available Let me worry about that.
not_available You should worry about Senator Mayer.
not_available He's not gonna let go of this.
not_available He's got his teeth in it.
not_available Senator Mayer's dead.
not_available He was killed by a rogue federal agent not one hour ago, tragically.
not_available Jonas.
not_available Tell me you had nothing to do with this.
not_available Are you accusing me of complicity in the murder of Senator Mayer? I want a personal assurance.
not_available Starkwood is not in the business of political assassination, Doug.
not_available Maybe we should look into it.
not_available I hear it's a growth market.
not_available Jack, you find anything? 
not_available Twelve ships were unloaded here today.
not_available Any from Sangala? There's no deepwater port in that area of West Africa.
not_available If the weapon originated from there, they would have had to overland it to Pointe
not_available Noire.
not_available Where
not_available Two of the 12 ships acquired cargo from that port within the last four weeks.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What is it? I can't access their manifests.
not_available Their database is password protected.
not_available What's your name, Officer? 
not_available Gadsen.
not_available Carl Gadsen.
not_available I don't have any information about a password.
not_available Carl, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
not_available The same terrorists who took down two planes earlier today and attacked the White House are trying to acquire a weapon of mass destruction.
not_available They're coming here to pick up that weapon.
not_available It's somewhere out there in your yard in one of those canisters.
not_available Look.
not_available I understand this might be hard for you to believe.
not_available No, actually, it's not.
not_available You don't have a lot of time.
not_available What do you mean? They are coming.
not_available In fact, they should be here already.
not_available Keep talking, Carl.
not_available They told me they were smuggling in electronics from South Korea.
not_available I swear, I had no idea they were terrorists.
not_available What'd you agree to do for them? Open the front gate 
not_available look the other way.
not_available Is that it? 
not_available Disable the security cameras.
not_available Ayard this size should have more police officers.
not_available Where are they? 
not_available I'm the supervisor.
not_available I do the shift schedules.
not_available I made sure I'd be the only one here.
not_available That's enough confirmation for me.
not_available I'm making the call.
not_available Untie him.
not_available Who's he calling? 
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Now that we're confident the weapon is here, we're calling in the authorities.
not_available Tony, my cell is down.
not_available So is the landline.
not_available Someone's jamming communications.
not_available [Walkie
not_available talkie Beeps.]
not_available Carl, pick up.
not_available It's them.
not_available They gave me that radio, told me they'd be contacting me.
not_available Answer the call.
not_available Just play along.
not_available Carl.
not_available Answer the call.
not_available Hello.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I didn't think you were coming.
not_available You're late.
not_available Well, we're here now and we're waiting.
not_available Okay.
not_available They're at the front gate.
not_available Put your belt back on.
not_available I want you to resume your post.
not_available Pretend like everything's normal.
not_available Just let 'em in.
not_available And then what? We're gonna follow them as soon as they pick up their container.
not_available Once we're past thejamming grid, we'll make our call.
not_available I don't know.
not_available What do you mean, you don't know? You're a part of this, Carl, whether you want to be or not.
not_available You became a part of this the second you said yes to these people.
not_available Jack.
not_available What do you got? I got three vehicles.
not_available Eight hostiles, heavily armed.
not_available Gotta assume there's more inside the trucks.
not_available Carl, if you don't open that gate, they're gonna come in here looking for you.
not_available You understand me? Let me put it to you this way: These men have killed over 300 people today.
not_available If they get ahold of that weapon they're gonna make that look like child's play.
not_available You've only got one choice here.
not_available I just open the gate and let them in.
not_available That's all you've gotta do.
not_available And you guys got my back, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Promise me.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tony, get the surveillance package.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's just so we can hear what's going on.
not_available Turn around.
not_available I need to put this on your back.
not_available Listen.
not_available The money
not_available it wasn't about greed or anything.
not_available It's
not_available It's my wife, Linda.
not_available She's having twins.
not_available They say it's the most natural thing in the world, right? Getting pregnant.
not_available Well, it took us three years, cost an arm and a leg.
not_available No excuses, but insurance doesn't cover a dime.
not_available Just always wanted to have a family.
not_available You know what I mean? Put this in your pocket.
not_available You got him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Remember, it's just another day at the office.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available He's coming.
not_available What took you so long, Carl? You got the routing documents? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I need to see 'em in order to locate the container.
not_available Relax, Carl.
not_available They're right here.
not_available Okay.
not_available "Center section, row 36, 'Q' block." It's the fourth stack on your right.
not_available I know where the container is, Carl.
not_available Did you disable the security cameras? They've been off since 10:00, just like you said.
not_available How's your wife? She's fine.
not_available You didn't tell her anything about this, did you? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available Did you tell anybody else? 
not_available No, no.
not_available Why would I? 
not_available You tell me, Carl.
not_available Why are you so nervous? Okay.
not_available Uh, you want to know the truth, Mr.
not_available Stokes? Uh I was expecting a simple pickup, but, uh you show up with a small army here, andAnd what? It's just
not_available Not what
not_available what I was expecting.
not_available That's all.
not_available I just don't want to get caught.
not_available Nobody's getting caught, Carl.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're movin'.
not_available You too, Carl.
not_available Take a ride.
not_available I told you.
not_available It's the fourth stack on your left, "Q" block, row 36.
not_available I'd feel better if you showed us.
not_available I really should stay here.
not_available I gotta finish my patrol.
not_available Why, Carl? You expectin' somebody? 
not_available No.
not_available Then get in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Forget about him, Jack.
not_available He was dead the minute he stepped out that door.
not_available You and I both know that.
not_available Ethan, I just came to say how sorry I am.
not_available Well, I appreciate the courtesy, if not the sincerity.
not_available As much as I may feel this is what's best for my mother on a personal level I'm sorry you have to go through this and for some of the harsher things I said to you in anger.
not_available Well, I suppose I owe you an apology too
not_available for accusing you of leaking my role in this Bauer fiasco to the press.
not_available I really believed you were trying to blindside me.
not_available Considering the impression I gave you, I'm not surprised.
not_available Olivia as someone who's known you most of your life I'd like to offer some advice.
not_available Of course.
not_available Ambition can be a valuable quality
not_available here in Washington as well as in life.
not_available But unchecked, it can be unhealthy, if not dangerous.
not_available What I'm trying to say is you got yourself a seat at the president's table.
not_available She listens to you.
not_available But running a country's not like running a campaign.
not_available It's not about doing whatever it takes to win.
not_available It's about doing what's right for the American people.
not_available Sometimes those things aren't mutually exclusive.
not_available Well good
not_available bye, Olivia.
not_available Good
not_available bye.
not_available Hello.
not_available It's Olivia.
not_available You can go with that story now, Ken.
not_available And it just got better.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Ethan Kanin's resigning.
not_available What happened? Thought the plan was to let him twist in the wind for a while.
not_available His hand was forced.
not_available It seems Jack Bauer just murdered Senator Mayer.
not_available What? You're kidding me.
not_available Anybody else have this yet? Not yet.
not_available It's all yours, in time for the 11:00.
not_available Told you I'd take care of you, didn't I? 
not_available You are too good to me, Olivia.
not_available You just hold up your end.
not_available Make sure Kanin's the fall guy.
not_available My mother's nowhere near this.
not_available Understand? No problem.
not_available She really doesn't have any idea that you're the leak? No.
not_available And it better stay that way.
not_available She won't hear it from me.
not_available So, when are we having that dinner you promised? 
not_available Maybe next week.
not_available It's always next week.
not_available You better get to work if you're gonna make that broadcast.
not_available Preliminary ballistics.
not_available So these files on the computer
not_available presumably Senator Mayer was lookin' at 'em before he was killed? Someone was, sir.
not_available They were opened and viewed within the last hour.
not_available So the senThe senator was killed point
not_available blank in the entry hall.
not_available How do we explain the slugs in the door frame and the railing? 
not_available I don't know, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available Get the crime lab guys on it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Agent Walker, it's Larry Moss for you.
not_available Hello.
not_available Senator Mayer is dead.
not_available Where's Jack? Don't know.
not_available We don't have him.
not_available Okay.
not_available But what? You think that he did this, Larry? First Burnett, and now Mayer? 
not_available Well Iooks that way.
not_available What do you mean, "looks that way"? Well, that's why I'm calling.
not_available Senator Mayer was killed with a UMP40 submachine gun.
not_available If Bauer was on the run, where'd he get hold of a weapon like that? Also, there's evidence to suggest that the, uh
not_available there was a third party in the house when the senator was killed.
not_available What kind of evidence? 
not_available Well, unexplained slugs.
not_available Broken set of French doors.
not_available Chair where it doesn't belong.
not_available Okay, so are you saying that this third party killed Mayer? Well, you know, Renee, I might be sayin' it if I knew what the hell Bauer was doin' here in the first place.
not_available All right.
not_available Renee, listen.
not_available Look.
not_available I want to meet you halfway.
not_available I do.
not_available But if you expect me to even entertain Bauer's innocence, you have got to help me here.
not_available I can't, Larry.
not_available LfJack is still underground, he's underground for a reason.
not_available Look.
not_available There were files open on Mayer's computer
not_available documents relating to his investigation into Starkwood.
not_available All right.
not_available So just tell me that.
not_available Tell me that.
not_available Did
not_available Did Starkwood ever come up in your conversation with Bauer? Renee.
not_available Look.
not_available Look.
not_available Maybe
not_available Maybe I should have trusted you before.
not_available Okay.
not_available But you have got to trust me now.
not_available What role does Starkwood play in all this? The man who framed Jack for Burnett's murder was John Quinn a Starkwood contractor.
not_available Jack believes that they were behind Juma and all of the terrorist attacks today.
not_available He went to Mayer to get the evidence to prove it.
not_available I have to assume that Quinn followed him there.
not_available That's all that I know, Larry.
not_available I swear.
not_available Okay.
not_available No, I believe you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Just sit tight.
not_available I'll be in touch soon.
not_available Well, let me help, Larry.
not_available I mean, Jack could still be out there.
not_available He may be in trouble.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I can't release you.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Reese, what's the status? 
not_available Just getting the chassis on, sir.
not_available I'll be a minute.
not_available Hurry it up.
not_available Hold up! Hold up! I don't have my truck.
not_available Put it down there.
not_available I want it there.
not_available Mitch, get up there.
not_available Let's run a diagnostic now.
not_available I want to be ready to roll as soon as Reese gets here with that flatbed.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available There's the package.
not_available We should get back to the car.
not_available We want to be in position to follow that container once they move out.
not_available Jack.
not_available Just give me one second.
not_available Cooper.
not_available Now is as good a time as any to settle up with Carl.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thanks, Carl.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Where we goin'? The money's in my truck, just one aisle over.
not_available Come on.
not_available Jack, we should get goin'.
not_available No.
not_available What are you doin'? I thought you said the money was in the truck.
not_available What the hell's goin' on? 
not_available Just keep movin'.
not_available Listen.
not_available I don't know what Stokes told you, but I didn't tell a soul.
not_available Damn it, Jack.
not_available What the hell are you doin'? Don't do it.
not_available You're gonna turn a surveillance job into a firefight.
not_available It'll be two against 10.
not_available Two against nine.
not_available Great.
not_available And we lose our best chance at getting this weapon.
not_available Don't break your own rules.
not_available You may save one man but what about the thousands of people who could die in a biological attack? Is this about you, Jack, or about them? You want to prevent another disaster or ensure that it's gonna happen? That's far enough.
not_available Turn around.
not_available You're gonna kill me you're gonna have to look me in the eye.
not_available Okay.
not_available Goddamn it! Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We got about 30 seconds before they figure out what happened.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's our fallback? 
not_available Steal the truck.
not_available Strong? 
not_available I'll make the direct assault.
not_available You cover the east flank.
not_available All we need is a big enough firefight to get one of us behind the wheel.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go.
not_available How do we look? Diagnostics check out, sir.
not_available The package is stable.
not_available Good.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get her on the chassis! 
not_available Cooper, come on.
not_available Let's roll.
not_available Cooper, do you copy? 
not_available Dolen, check the next aisle over.
not_available Find Cooper.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hold your position.
not_available Wait for my signal.
not_available Cooper's down.
not_available Cooper's down.
not_available Go red! Go red! Let's move out.
not_available Greer
not_available Engage.
not_available Engage.
not_available Get the container on the truck.
not_available Reese, get that truck outta here now! Go, go, go! Tony! The truck
not_available I'm going after it! Cover me now! All right.
not_available Two shooters.
not_available Fan out and find 'em.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available Do you copy? Drop it.
not_available Tony? 
not_available I know you.
not_available You're on Emerson's crew.
not_available You're Almeida, right? 
not_available Damn it.
not_available I know Bauer's with you.
not_available Now, where is he? 
not_available Larry Moss.
not_available Larry, it's Jack.
not_available Jack, where the hell have you been? I need you to scramble multiple teams to a weigh station on Highway 236, exit 29.
not_available I'm in a big rig about 10 miles south.
not_available What's goin' on? You also need to send a C.D.C.
not_available Recovery unit.
not_available Why? 
not_available I'm in possession of a biological weapon interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.
not_available Biological weapon? 
not_available Larry, just listen to me.
not_available I don't care if you arrest me.
not_available I don't care if you shoot me.
not_available Just get your teams out here.
not_available I fully expect to be pursued by hostiles.
not_available Starkwood? 
not_available How do you know about Starkwood? I talked to Renee, and I saw what was on Mayer's computer.
not_available Larry, they're coming after this weapon.
not_available You can count on it.
not_available But be advised, I believe that Tony Almeida is being held hostage.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll call out an interagency alert.
not_available We'll secure both locations.
not_available Larry, hurry.
not_available Move, move, move.
not_available Come on, guys! Come on! 
not_available Damn it! 
not_available Hodges.
not_available Sir, this is Stokes.
not_available What's your status? 
not_available The package is secure.
not_available We're inbound.
not_available What about Bauer? 
not_available He's at the scene, sir, but he sought cover nearby.
not_available Well, we have to assume that he contacted the authorities so we better be on an accelerated timetable.
not_available Get over here.
not_available It'll be there in 10 minutes.
not_available We're right behind.
not_available Good.
not_available I've got teams on the ground prepping for your arrival.
not_available Larry Moss.
not_available Larry, it's Jack.
not_available I'm still on Route 236 but I had to stop approximately seven miles before the weigh station.
not_available Jack, I got two units moving to you right now.
not_available Yeah, well, you're gonna have to redirect them.
not_available Why? Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon.
not_available They managed to access one of the dock's freight helicopters.
not_available While they had me pinned down, they airlifted the freight right outta here.
not_available They were headed due west from my current position.
not_available West.
not_available They got a large military facility in that area.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available Redirect the teams there.
not_available Jack, I can't assault a private compound unless I have proof that a weapon exists.
not_available Okay, where's the C.D.C.
not_available They're scrambling a team right now.
not_available Send them to me.
not_available You'll have all the proof you need.
not_available Jack, what happened? One of the canisters was breached during the interdiction.
not_available Some of the bio
not_available agent was released.
not_available L
not_available I was exposed.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jack, just sit tight.
not_available C.D.C.
not_available On the way.
not_available They're gonna be there soon.
