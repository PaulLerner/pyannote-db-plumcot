
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available CTU is being absorbed by the department of Homeland Security, and Christopher Henderson remains an open protocol.
not_available Ms.
not_available Raines signed a detailed statement documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU, and by you, in particular.
not_available I don't understand, why am I staying and everybody else is being let go? Because Ms.
not_available Raines requested that you keep your position.
not_available I had to keep Karen from replacing you, that's why I signed the document, I didn't have a choice.
not_available Why were those men trying to kill you? David had a source inside the White House.
not_available Who's the source? Mrs.
not_available Logan's assistant.
not_available I have proof about who's behind everything that's happened today.
not_available Someone killed David and they just tried to kill me.
not_available I have to go now 
not_available Tell me what I need! They kidnapped my little girl.
not_available Evelyn.
not_available I promise you we're going to get your daughter back.
not_available I already told them I wouldn't give up any information until I have my daughter.
not_available We need Henderson alive; do not shoot to kill.
not_available Did you bring what we discussed? I have the evidence with me.
not_available I want my daughter.
not_available She's moving.
not_available Give me the evidence, Evelyn.
not_available Now.
not_available Wayne, I didn't get him if you got a shot, take it! Chloe, it's Jack, Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car! Do you have him on satellite? we can't lose him! Evelyn's been hit.
not_available It's not serious, but it's gonna have to be dressed.
not_available Evelyn, you've got your daughter back, now tell me what I need to know.
not_available Who is behind this? Is it the vice president? The vice president has nothing to do with this! You promised me you would control the situation.
not_available I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.
not_available Bauer and Wayne Palmer won't be around long enough to tell anybody else what they know.
not_available I will not let you down.
not_available See that you don't.
not_available Wayne, turn that off.
not_available Okay, Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.
not_available The recording of the phone call that you made between President Logan and Henderson is in a safety deposit box which bank? Which bank? City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills.
not_available Where's the key? 
not_available My jacket pocket.
not_available Mom? It's all right, sweetheart, your mom's going to be fine.
not_available She's going to be fine, okay? Jack, you heard what they said.
not_available We have to get off this road, there are military patrols everywhere.
not_available There's a motel up there on the right.
not_available Turn in there.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available We're gonna get you home, honey.
not_available We're gonna get you home.
not_available Wayne, can you get us a room? I'll keep watch.
not_available Make sure you keep pressure on the wound, I'll be right back.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Audrey, it's Jack.
not_available Have you got Henderson on satellite yet? No, Chloe wasn't able to reposition in time.
not_available Damn it! Are you still on a secure line? Yes.
not_available Why, what's going on? Evelyn didn't implicate Gardner.
not_available She implicated President Logan.
not_available Oh, my God, Jack.
not_available Logan? Are you sure? She said he was responsible for everything that happened today, starting with providing the terrorists with the nerve gas.
not_available That's what David Palmer found out.
not_available That's why they killed him.
not_available Are you saying that President Logan ordered Palmer's assassination? Henderson gave the order.
not_available But Evelyn says she has evidence that shows that President Logan was complicit.
not_available What kind of evidence? She recorded a conversation earlier this morning between Henderson and President Logan.
not_available She put it in a safety deposit box in a bank.
not_available We're on our way to get it now.
not_available Jack, the city is under martial law.
not_available I know.
not_available I need you to upload every military checkpoint to my PDA so we can navigate our way around them.
not_available All right, I'll take care of that.
not_available Audrey, as soon as I have the recording, we're going to have to involve your father.
not_available We need someone in the government, someone credible, to present the evidence.
not_available All right.
not_available He's on his way back from a summit in Japan.
not_available I'll call him on the plane.
not_available Okay.
not_available Make sure you leave CTU before you do anything.
not_available You don't think that they can be trusted? Right now, we can't trust anyone.
not_available Logan will have every federal law enforcement agency, the military, all at his disposal.
not_available And he will use them to try and stop us.
not_available Don't fill your father in on the particulars.
not_available Just try and set up the meeting.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording.
not_available All right, I'll upload those checkpoints.
not_available Wayne? The bank manager was listed.
not_available That's his address, he's not far.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's get them in the room.
not_available Hey we need to get inside now.
not_available Come on, it's okay.
not_available Give me your arm.
not_available You can sit right here, okay? Okay.
not_available Lie down here on the bed.
not_available I'm sorry, but it's not safe enough to take you to a hospital yet.
not_available Let me see, let me see.
not_available Wayne? Take Amy outside for a second.
not_available Come on, sweaty.
not_available Okay, even though the bullet went through, I'm still going to have to clean out this wound.
not_available It's gonna hurt.
not_available But I promise you I'll get you to a hospital as soon as I can.
not_available In the meantime, I'm going to have Wayne look after you.
not_available No.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available You need to get the evidence.
not_available And you'll need help.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Keep pressure on it.
not_available Sweetheart, you can see your mom now.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Give me the car keys.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I haven't been able to pick up Bauer's trail yet.
not_available So he got away.
not_available And there's nothing to stop him and Wayne Palmer from going to the media with everything they know.
not_available Jack knows there's no point in going public until he has proof.
not_available He won't make any accusations until he has that evidence in his hand.
not_available This evidence, this this recording that Evelyn made of our conversation.
not_available Are you any closer to finding out where she's hidden it? No, sir, not yet.
not_available But she was wounded, and I will find her.
not_available We're monitoring hospitals, emergency services.
not_available This is containable, I promise you.
not_available Please spare me your promises, Mr.
not_available Henderson.
not_available It's all gone wrong.
not_available None of this should have happened.
not_available All these killings This whole thing was planned to make our country safer.
not_available Stronger.
not_available To protect our interests.
not_available And it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill David Palmer.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, what's done is done.
not_available And right now, we have to focus on stopping Bauer before he finds that recording.
not_available No.
not_available You have to focus on it.
not_available Why haven't the analysts finished the hourly's? They're still getting up to speed on CTU's protocols.
not_available We knew this wasn't going to be a seamless transition.
not_available Sometimes I wonder if it was even a necessary one.
not_available Karen CTU's performance today has been considerably less than stellar.
not_available Dozens of people have been killed.
not_available And they weren't even able to prevent an attack on themselves.
not_available Do you really believe, under the circumstances, that we could have done any better? 
not_available Ms.
not_available Hayes? 
not_available The president is on line one.
not_available Put him through to Bill Buchanan's office, I'll be working out of there from now on.
not_available And have Medical notify me as soon as Bierko has regained consciousness.
not_available Miles.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President? 
not_available Karen.
not_available Do you know where Jack Bauer is? 
not_available Not at the moment, sir.
not_available He was due back here 30 minutes ago to lead the Bierko interrogation.
not_available He's gone off grid.
not_available I'm not surprised.
not_available Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer.
not_available I want you to run point on this, and I want you to make this CTU's top priority.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available For purposes of the warrant, I'll need to know what Bauer's being charged with.
not_available His role in the assassination of President David Palmer.
not_available But I understood that he'd been exonerated of that charge, sir.
not_available You, yourself, reinstated his credentials.
not_available I know, but I didn't have all the facts then.
not_available Some new evidence has come to light.
not_available New evidence? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm looking at it right now, and I will forward it to you at the appropriate time.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Karen.
not_available Obviously, this is a very sensitive matter, and for now I would like you to treat the origin of this warrant as confidential.
not_available Understood, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Put out an alert on Jack Bauer to all federal law enforcement agencies and NSA.
not_available I'll also get military the warrant
not_available they have more men on the street than anyone.
not_available I don't like this.
not_available Pulling our resources off finding Christopher Henderson to go after Jack Bauer without knowing the evidence? It's a direct order from the president.
not_available You know, if we really want to find Bauer, we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help.
not_available Starting with Audrey Raines.
not_available What's this? Chloe, open it up and make it look like this is what we're talking about.
not_available Okay Can you get me a secure channel, so the calls on my cell phone can't be monitored? Using a VPN pathway, sure.
not_available Take somebody about an hour to crack.
not_available Why, what's going on? I just spoke with Jack.
not_available Gardner isn't the one who's behind this.
not_available It's President Logan.
not_available What? Jack is on his way getting proof.
not_available I'm leaving now to go help him.
not_available Take a CTU walkie.
not_available Audrey.
not_available It's a warrant for Jack's arrest.
not_available It's starting.
not_available What do we do? Heading out? Yes, I'm going to try to grab a couple hours of sleep.
not_available I came to talk to both of you about the warrant.
not_available Well, let's start with why the hell it was issued.
not_available There's new evidence implicating Jack in David Palmer's assassination.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available I was there when the assassin confessed.
not_available All you have to do is check the logs.
not_available I know about the logs, Chloe.
not_available My orders are to bring Jack in.
not_available New evidence? Have you seen it? 
not_available It's forthcoming.
not_available Who ordered this, Karen? I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
not_available When was the last time you spoke with Jack? About an hour ago.
not_available We haven't had contact since.
not_available I hope I don't have to remind either one of you that you have a legal obligation to notify me if Jack contacts you.
not_available Look, I know this may seem odd to the both of you frankly, it does to me but let's remember it's in everyone's best interest to bring Jack in peacefully.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Harris.
not_available Valerie? Audrey's on her way.
not_available What's your status? We're placing the transponder on Audrey's car right now.
not_available Good.
not_available There won't be many cars on the road, so use the tracker and stay out of sight.
not_available Will do.
not_available We don't want anything to stop Audrey from leading us to Bauer.
not_available That's the house.
not_available Okay.
not_available What's the bank manager's name? Carl Mossman.
not_available You got your gun? Yeah, but we don't need them for this, do we? He's not going to let into his bank in the middle of the night unless he thinks he has to.
not_available Jack, why don't we just try telling him the truth? Would you believe it? The only way we're going to have his full compliance is if he's scared.
not_available If you're uncomfortable with that, you should stay here.
not_available They've got a magnetic alarm.
not_available We're in.
not_available Did you hear something? Like what? I don't know.
not_available Carl? 
not_available Hang on.
not_available Carl? 
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Rose, call the police! Cover him.
not_available Put the phone down.
not_available Put the phone down now! Bring him in here! Just stay calm, and everything will be fine.
not_available Let's go! Oh my God.
not_available Carl Take a seat on the bed.
not_available Okay, look, our money and jewelry's in floor safe in the closet.
not_available We're not interested in that.
not_available You're gonna get us into your bank.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available It's not that I won't.
not_available I can't.
not_available The alarm system and the vault only allow entry during business hours.
not_available Don't lie to me.
not_available Every bank has procedures to allow access during an emergency.
not_available Hey! No, no! I'll take you to the bank.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Get up, get dressed.
not_available Go on.
not_available It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
not_available I want four of your neckties.
not_available Tie her up to the chair.
not_available Ankles and wrists.
not_available Make sure she doesn't move.
not_available Yes, hi.
not_available This is Audrey Raines.
not_available I need to speak with Secretary Heller, please.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary, there's a call coming in for you on an over
not_available air encrypted channel.
not_available It's your daughter.
not_available Audrey, is everything okay? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Uh, yes, I'm okay.
not_available Dad, I need your help.
not_available Is this a secure line? Very secure.
not_available Is this about the arrest order for Jack? I was just informed.
not_available Dad, I can't go into details right now, but Jack is innocent.
not_available He's being set up.
not_available Set up by whom? What the hell is going on, Audrey? You call me this morning, to tell me that Jack's alive.
not_available Now I get word he's a suspect again in the Palmer assassination.
not_available Dad, I can't talk to you about it right now.
not_available I need to see you in person.
not_available Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles? Dad, I would never ask you to do this if it wasn't extremely important.
not_available All right, yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The closest airport is Van Nuys.
not_available We're about an hour out.
not_available I'll call you on final approach.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available I'll see you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Doug! Yes, sir.
not_available We have to make a stop in L.A.
not_available And keep it off the manifest.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Pull over.
not_available She stopped.
not_available Corner of Alderton and Davis.
not_available It's a gas station.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's me.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Okay, switched over to my own VPN.
not_available Now they can't monitor either end of the conversation.
not_available Do you have the walkie? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hang on.
not_available All right, what do I do with it? Tune to proprietary channel 17, turn the sensitivity up all the way.
not_available See if you pick up a pilot signal.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Wow.
not_available Do you hear that? That's what I figured they put a tracker on you.
not_available I found it.
not_available All right, Chloe, I got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Audrey, you need to disable your phone by taking the battery out as soon as you can.
not_available All right, I have to wait for a call from Jack and then I will.
not_available Yes.
not_available Sir, it's almost time.
not_available Yes.
not_available The press conference.
not_available That's right.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, if I could have a moment Uh, I should be done with my statement shortly, Hal.
not_available This is potentially time sensitive, sir.
not_available I just got an alert that a warrant has been issued for Jack Bauer.
not_available Thank you, Aaron.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What about the warrant? Well, it's an executive branch warrant.
not_available I didn't issue it, so it must have come from you.
not_available That's right, it came from me.
not_available Well, as you've put me in charge of overseeing CTU and the Homeland Security transfer, don't you think you should have discussed it with me first? I appreciate everything you've done today, Hal, but the last time I checked, I was still Commander in Chief.
not_available Of course, Mr.
not_available President, but Jack Bauer? It doesn't make any sense.
not_available We should be treating that man like a hero.
not_available I've gone over the logs.
not_available Walt Cummings has confessed that he arranged Palmer's assassination, framing Bauer.
not_available Well, clearly, Cummings was protecting Bauer.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know why.
not_available But the fact remains I have received confirmation from Intelligence sources that Jack Bauer was, without question, the shooter.
not_available Which sources? That's enough! I'm not going to stand here and have my orders challenged.
not_available You have concerns, Hal.
not_available We'll sort this all out once Bauer's in custody.
not_available Does that suit you? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Mom? Amy? I'm coming.
not_available Sweetheart? Mom! Mom! My mom she passed out.
not_available I can't wake her up.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Tell me your name.
not_available Amy.
not_available My mom's name is Evelyn.
not_available What's your mom's last name? Martin.
not_available Her name's Evelyn Martin.
not_available All right, honey, now tell me where you are.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sir, a call is coming in to the 911 operator from a Motel on Porter Valley Drive requesting medical assistance for an Evelyn Martin.
not_available Be there shortly.
not_available My fellow Americans, it is with great relief that I announce that the terrorist threat our nation faced today is over.
not_available More than an hour ago, federal counter
not_available terrorist agents, under my direction, thwarted the latest attack on innocent civilians, the nature of which was kept secret due to national security.
not_available This was done with the public's best interest in mind.
not_available He really did it.
not_available Ma'am? Charles.
not_available He stopped the terrorists, the treaty was signed.
not_available He said he would ride out this crisis, and everything would be okay.
not_available And it is.
not_available I should have trusted him.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available What's wrong, Aaron? I'm just a little battle worn.
not_available Jack, why are we stopping here? There's too many military checkpoints in the area.
not_available They'll stop our car.
not_available We have to go the rest of the way on foot.
not_available How far is the bank from here? About a quarter of a mile that way.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Aaron, it's Jack.
not_available Jack, are you aware President Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest for your role in David Palmer's assassination? No, but that makes sense.
not_available The Vice President's not the one who's behind this, is he? No, it's Logan.
not_available They're going to have every agency and the military looking for you.
not_available And Logan is the only one who can call them off.
not_available As soon as we have the evidence in hand, we're gonna pass it off to Secretary of Defense Heller.
not_available After that, it's not gonna matter.
not_available Is there anything Incan do for you, Jack? Keep your eyes open and watch your back.
not_available Will do.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Move, move.
not_available Take cover, go! Not a word.
not_available Ms.
not_available Hayes, Valerie Harris is on line two for you.
not_available She says it's urgent.
not_available Valerie, what's happening? 
not_available We lost Audrey Raines.
not_available What? She found the tracker and transferred it to a DWP truck at a gas station.
not_available Damn it.
not_available How did she find it? She's got no field experience.
not_available I don't know.
not_available The only reason we discovered it is the DWP guy stopped to check a faulty power line.
not_available All right, hold your position and wait for my instructions.
not_available Will do.
not_available Papazian.
not_available Audrey Raines ditched her transponder.
not_available I need you to redirect satellite surveillance and track her.
not_available I can redirect Caltrans and maybe one SAT
not_available LINK, but the rest are dedicated to finding Bauer.
not_available Following Audrey should lead us right to him.
not_available Just get it done and tell me when you've got something.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Against the wall.
not_available Watch him.
not_available Just do what he says, Carl.
not_available Do what he says and you'll be home before you know it.
not_available Right.
not_available What's the emergency procedure to enter the bank? I have 30 seconds to put my key in the alarm panel, then I enter my code.
not_available You enter the wrong code and alert the police, all I have to do is make one call, your wife is dead.
not_available You understand me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Where's the vault? Take us around the back, stay away from the windows.
not_available How do I open it? There's a 12
not_available digit code, but it's a timed unlock procedure, which allows enough time for the police to arrive in the event that someone should trigger the silent alarm.
not_available Write the code down for me.
not_available Take him over to one of the desks, keep an eye on him.
not_available I know you.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available You're David Palmer's brother.
not_available I saw you on TV this morning.
not_available You were there when he was shot.
not_available Now, what the hell are you doing in my bank? And who is he? Listen, I know it's absurd to ask you to trust me under these circumstances, but believe me, you don't want to know.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available You threaten me with a gun, you kidnap me, you're robbing my bank.
not_available Now, I deserve to know what the hell is going on here.
not_available Fine.
not_available Jack and I believe there's evidence inside of one of your safety deposit boxes that's gonna prove who was behind the assassination of my brother, okay? Wayne.
not_available What's going on? What do you want me to say, Jack? He recognized me.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mossman, how long is the delay before the vault opens? Five minutes.
not_available Is that true what he said? Is that why you two are here? Yes.
not_available Why didn't you just wait till morning, get a subpoena? The people that are behind this will never let it go that far.
not_available They've already tried to kill me twice tonight, Carl.
not_available And they're gonna try again the very first chance they get.
not_available Mom.
not_available Miss Martin, you're in shock.
not_available But you're going to be okay.
not_available You know my name? Where's Bauer? You did? Well, that's good.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available I thought you went to bed.
not_available No.
not_available I, uh, watched you with the press.
not_available Well, um, that was Morry, and he thought it went pretty well.
not_available Good.
not_available But that doesn't begin to describe it.
not_available Charles, you have had to deal with more crisis today than any president in an entire term.
not_available You were magnificent.
not_available Magnificent.
not_available Well, I like the sound of that.
not_available Especially coming from you.
not_available I'm so proud of you.
not_available I hope I haven't embarrassed you too much as your First Lady.
not_available No.
not_available Don't be ridiculous.
not_available I mean, you walked up to the edge a couple times, but nobody noticed.
not_available I'll try to find a compliment in there somewhere.
not_available I'm sorry, Marty.
not_available I didn't Wow.
not_available I was so selfish today.
not_available No.
not_available You had so much on your plate, you didn't need me piling more on.
not_available No, I 
not_available Please don't say anything.
not_available Just accept my apology.
not_available I do.
not_available I do, I accept your apology.
not_available I have to take this privately.
not_available Who is it? Now, what difference does it make? Please, Marty.
not_available I thought the crisis was over.
not_available I thought you and I All right.
not_available Yes.
not_available We know where Bauer is.
not_available Evelyn gave him up.
not_available Well, then take care of it.
not_available My men are heading there now.
not_available Good.
not_available Let me know when it's done.
not_available I will.
not_available I'm sorry, honey.
not_available I guess I haven't gotten used to the idea that that the crisis is over.
not_available When what's done? What? You just said, "Let me know when it's done." Oh, that was Jamey.
not_available I asked her to write me a radio speech for tomorrow morning.
not_available We found Audrey Raines.
not_available Where? She's heading north toward Mulholland.
not_available Connect me with Harris.
not_available Harris.
not_available Valerie, we have a fix on Raines.
not_available She's heading toward the Sepulveda Pass, coming up on Mulholland.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Chloe? Do you have a minute? 
not_available No.
not_available What is it? I was assigned to log all satellite and ground video activity, but part of the vector is locked out.
not_available Locked out? What do you mean? I mean, someone's taken control of one of the satellites using a class one priority override.
not_available Do you know anything about it? No.
not_available I'll look into it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Crap.
not_available All points are covered, sir.
not_available The perimeter is secure.
not_available Do you have a visual? 
not_available Yes, I did, briefly.
not_available All right, listen.
not_available You tell your men the instant, and I mean the instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building you take him down.
not_available Then, kill the others and secure the recording.
not_available Which one is it? Twenty
not_available three.
not_available Mr.
not_available Palmer, I admired your brother a great deal.
not_available He was a great man.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It had to be done, sir.
not_available I decide what needs to be done, Mr.
not_available Henderson.
not_available I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.
not_available Palmer was nosing around.
not_available He'd have found out about your involvement.
not_available For God's sake, sir, he called your wife.
not_available I can handle my wife.
not_available Right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards.
not_available That's president Logan's voice.
not_available Every thread ends with Cummings.
not_available He thinks he's running this and you need to keep playing it that way.
not_available I know my part, Mr.
not_available Henderson.
not_available You just do as you're told.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available We got what we need.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mossman, I'm sorry we put you and your wife through this.
not_available It'll be safer for you to stay here now.
not_available Could you please let us out? Like to help if I can.
not_available I've come this far.
not_available We're gonna need to borrow your car a little longer.
not_available Sure, it's insured.
not_available Wait.
not_available There's someone inside.
not_available Mr.
not_available Mossman, get back in the vault now.
not_available Is there any other way out of here besides the front door? No, front door only security reasons.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Both of you stay here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Henderson's men are taking up positions.
not_available There's no other way out
not_available we're gonna have to turn ourselves in.
not_available They didn't come here to arrest us; they came here to kill us.
not_available What are they waiting for? All the windows are bulletproof.
not_available They're waiting for us to leave the building.
not_available So what are you gonna do? How do you trip the silent alarm? I have a key, but you trip that alarm, LAPD will be here within a few minutes.
not_available That's exactly what I want.
not_available Henderson's men outnumber us.
not_available We leave this building now, we lose.
not_available Jack, if you call the cops, they're gonna get the recording when we're taken into custody.
not_available We won't be taken into custody.
not_available As soon as Henderson finds out the LAPD have arrived, he's gonna have his men engage them.
not_available He doesn't want the police to have the recording any more than he wants us to have it.
not_available So they start shooting at each other.
not_available How does that help us? We have to try and use that as a diversion.
not_available It's our only way out.
not_available Trigger the alarm.
not_available Let's get ready.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Valerie.
not_available The feed should be coming through to your laptop now.
not_available I've got her.
not_available She's heading west on Chandler.
not_available How close are you to Audrey's car? About two miles.
not_available Close the gap to one mile.
not_available Will do.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available The feed's breaking up.
not_available We're experiencing the same difficulty with our signal
not_available hold on.
not_available What's going on? I don't know.
not_available The satellite's positioned correctly.
not_available I'm tracing the corruption.
not_available It's the server.
not_available What is it? 
not_available O'Brian's gone.
not_available What were you doing? 
not_available What? What were you doing? Are you kidding? If you really want the details, I'll write you a report.
not_available Let's go, now.
not_available They're here? Mr.
not_available Mossman, like I said before, it might be safer for you to stay here in the bank.
not_available No, these guys find me, they assume I know about the recording, they'd probably kill me, right? I'll take my chances with you.
not_available I want you to stay as close to Mr.
not_available Palmer as you can.
not_available I'll provide cover fire.
not_available Once we leave the bank, you break left.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Cooper, what's your status? No change, they still haven't come out.
not_available Must have seen you, damn it.
not_available Tell your men to move in immediately.
not_available The cops are here.
not_available We can't let them have Bauer; take them down.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Drop your weapons! Let's go.
not_available Need to go to then police car nowmove! He's been hit! How is he doing? 
not_available He's dead.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Jack, where are you? 
not_available I'm on my way to you.
not_available Did your father agree to meet? Yes, he's landing at Van Nuys Airport in about 15 minutes.
not_available I'm there now.
not_available Good, we got the evidence.
not_available Have you listened to it? Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan.
not_available You understand what this means.
not_available We're talking about taking down the President of the United States.
