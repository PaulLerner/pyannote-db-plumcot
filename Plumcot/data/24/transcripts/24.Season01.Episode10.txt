
not_available There are terrorists planning to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.
not_available And the people that I work with may be involved in both.
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
not_available This, is the longest day of my life.
not_available This is Dave Thompson in Jet Copter Three.
not_available It's just 9:00 on Primary Day in Southern California.
not_available Freeways are looking pretty good.
not_available Usual delays in the Sepulveda Pass southbound, but it loosens up at Culver.
not_available We'll have a complete report in six minutes.
not_available Back to you, Bill.
not_available Thanks, Dave.
not_available In the news, we haven't learned any more about the incident at the San Clarita power plant where Senator Palmer was rushed out this morning.
not_available We're told the Senator was unharmed but Secret Service and the FBI haven't released any new information.
not_available Get the drip started.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Find me a pulse.
not_available I've got a pulse.
not_available 140/30.
not_available Pupils not reactive.
not_available Respiration shallow.
not_available 48.
not_available Let's start two large
not_available bore IVs, bilateral.
not_available She's lost a lot of blood.
not_available We should start the other line.
not_available All right.
not_available Is it in? Ready, one, two, three.
not_available Ready? Lift! Excuse me.
not_available I've got the door.
not_available Okay.
not_available Everyone I'm sorry to tell you that Jamey Farrell tried to commit suicide a few minutes ago.
not_available Fortunately, she's still alive and they're doing everything they can to keep her that way.
not_available I know it won't be easy to put this out of our minds, but we have no choice.
not_available There's still reason to believe Senator Palmer's life is in danger which means we all have to get back to work, now.
not_available You wanna look at this? 
not_available Not now.
not_available Call Jamey's mom, explain what happened.
not_available Have her pick up Kyle.
not_available CTU, Myers.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you get the car? Yes, and I got the care package, too.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Jack, Teri called.
not_available What? About 20 minutes ago.
not_available Where is She? What'd she say? I don't know.
not_available She barely had time to say her name before she got disconnected.
not_available What happened? She didn't call back and when I tried to redial, the number was blocked.
not_available She sounded Okay.
not_available She sounded all right.
not_available The police have thrown a net over this entire area.
not_available There's nothing I can do to help Teri until I get through it.
not_available Maybe you should think about turning yourself in.
not_available Tell your side of the story.
not_available No.
not_available Gaines will keep Teri and Kim alive as long as he thinks I can be useful to him.
not_available If I'm in custody, I won't be.
not_available Scan the police frequencies, see if you can locate any of these roadblocks for me.
not_available All right.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jamey give you anything else? Jack Jamey tried to kill herself.
not_available Jack, did you hear me? Jack? Yeah, you said she tried? We sent her to County, but it doesn't look good.
not_available Are you sure it was a suicide attempt? Yeah, she slit her wrists.
not_available Where was her son Kyle? He didn't see anything.
not_available We've already called Jamey's mom.
not_available She's on her way to pick him up.
not_available Okay, send someone down to County to question Jamey in case she makes it.
not_available Right now she's still our best source of information.
not_available Okay.
not_available Damn it! 
not_available What's wrong? They set up a road block at Montana.
not_available Nina, I could have used the heads
not_available up here.
not_available I'm sorry, they must have set it up before I started scanning.
not_available Find me another route.
not_available All right, give me a second to pull up LA traffic.
not_available You go to the window.
not_available You let me know if somebody comes.
not_available Tony, Line 3, can you get it? Almeida.
not_available Okay, it looks like roadblocks aren't your only problem.
not_available They sent a description of you to all the units in the area.
not_available Nina, it's Teri Bauer.
not_available Jack, hold on a minute.
not_available Teri? 
not_available Nina, thank God.
not_available Where are you? I don't know, but I got ahold of a phone.
not_available Okay, is Kim with you? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, Kimberly's fine.
not_available Do you know where Jack is? Yeah, listen, I'm gonna connect you with him right now.
not_available Leave the line open as long as you can so we can set up a trace.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have Milo set up the trace on Line 3.
not_available Jack? I've got Teri.
not_available Patch her through.
not_available Mom, someone's coming.
not_available He's here! Teri? What do you want from us? I think I left my phone in here.
not_available You seen it? No, I haven't.
not_available Jack, I've muted our side of the conversation.
not_available Have you set up a trace on the call? Yeah.
not_available I told Teri to leave the line open.
not_available Good.
not_available Keep our side muted.
not_available I don't want to give away this phone.
not_available You better not be lying, bitch.
not_available Bitch.
not_available They moved everything around in here.
not_available Damn it! Rick, you see it anywhere? No.
not_available Got anything on that trace? Latitude is somewhere north of the 10.
not_available I should have a rough longitude in a couple of minutes.
not_available Triangulating the longitude is trickier.
not_available This is Dave in Jet Copter 3.
not_available We're seeing some congestion in North Hollywood at Verdugo around the Grant Street Elementary School.
not_available Senator Palmer is due to make an appearance there, and it looks like supporters and media are hoping to catch a glimpse of the presidential candidate, who apparently, is not letting this morning's incident interfere with his schedule.
not_available I don't understand the rationale behind it.
not_available No, listen to me.
not_available Why? Why defend something that you don't need to defend? Maureen Kingsley is not coming out with the story today.
not_available She will.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available Look, if not now, tomorrow.
not_available If not her, someone else.
not_available Our son is accused of murder.
not_available The story's too big to hide.
not_available Mike.
not_available He's right, Sherry.
not_available We need to control when and how this story comes out.
not_available One hour ago, someone tried to kill my husband.
not_available That bought us time and we should use it.
not_available The assassination attempt might even work for us if we break the story about Keith.
not_available It might put the public in a more forgiving frame of mind.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available It's my mistake to make.
not_available No, it isn't, David, because you didn't get here by yourself.
not_available Do not go against me on this, Sherry! Promise me.
not_available I can't promise you anything.
not_available Jack, we've got a preliminary read on the trace.
not_available It's a pretty big area.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available North of the 10, east of the 405.
not_available Did you hear me? Yeah, that's a start.
not_available Now get me through these cops.
not_available Your best bet is east on Thurston.
not_available I don't think you should move yet.
not_available I'll get through the net somehow.
not_available Nina, just stay on that trace and help me find my family, please.
not_available Tony, open an extra socket for me on 1.
not_available Did you hear me? Come here for a second.
not_available You gotta check this out.
not_available What is it? I was checking Jamey's disk to see if I could find any e
not_available mails.
not_available She was careful about cleaning up, but she didn't have time for this one.
not_available That's from this morning.
not_available To an anonymous recipient.
not_available What about the encryption? 
not_available I'll get Milo on that.
not_available But you can still see the subject.
not_available Ted Cofell.
not_available Find out who he is.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Yeah? I need you to do something for me.
not_available I'm working on this trace.
not_available You'll have to do two things at once.
not_available I need this e
not_available mail decrypted, all right? CTU, Almeida.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Nina, that was the clinic.
not_available Jamey didn't make it.
not_available Mom, it's clear.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Hello, Jack? Are you there? Teri, it's Nina.
not_available You okay to talk? I'll put you through to Jack.
not_available Jack, I've got Teri.
not_available Teri? 
not_available Jack? Can you talk? Where are you? I'm on my way to get you out of there, sweetheart.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm hanging in there.
not_available Good, thank God.
not_available Nina's tracing the cellular signal to your location.
not_available How long will that take? Nina? Twenty minutes.
not_available Milo's narrowed the signal to four repeater antennas which is still about 500 square miles.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Teri, don't worry, we're closing in on it.
not_available Please pull over to the curb.
not_available Jack? I'm still here, honey.
not_available Is there anything you can tell us that might help us find you? I know we're at least a few miles out of the city.
not_available This is gonna take me about a minute.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Jack, are you all right? Jack? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available It would really help us out if you could tell us everything you know about where you are.
not_available I don't know much.
not_available They blindfolded me when they picked me up.
not_available Where was that? 
not_available On Mulholland, near Coldwater.
not_available How long did it take for you to get from there to where you are now? I'm not sure.
not_available Half an hour? Surface streets or freeways? 
not_available Freeways, I think.
not_available Milo.
not_available Already on it.
not_available Anything else, any sounds or smells? Can you hear cars or airplanes? Anything? No, it's pretty quiet.
not_available There's hills, and some eucalyptus trees.
not_available It may be the North Valley, somewhere inland.
not_available It's pretty remote.
not_available That helps.
not_available I've got it narrowed down to three sectors.
not_available The closer we get, the longer each iteration's gonna take.
not_available What does that mean? It's just techno
not_available talk, Teri.
not_available Don't worry, we're making good progress.
not_available Jack, are you there? Yeah, baby, I'm still here.
not_available Teri, I'm gonna find you.
not_available I promise.
not_available I know you will.
not_available Nina's tracing the call right now.
not_available We're gonna have your location in a couple of minutes but it's important you don't hang up that phone, okay? Even if you can't talk, don't hang up the phone.
not_available Sweetheart, are you sure you're all right? They didn't hurt you, did they? I'm fine.
not_available So is Kim.
not_available Is she there with you? 
not_available Yeah, she's right here.
not_available Put her on the phone so both of you can hear.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dad? Hey, sweetheart.
not_available You okay? Yeah.
not_available Who are these guys? Why are they doing this? I don't know honey, but I'm gonna find out, I promise.
not_available Right now I just want to make sure that you and Mommy get home safely, okay? Honey, look I know I haven't always been there when you've needed me.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available I want both of you to know that I'm here for you now.
not_available I love you more than anything in the whole world and I promise you, I am gonna get you both out of there, okay? So no matter what happens, don't give up.
not_available We're a family, we're gonna get through this like a family.
not_available Okay? Sweetie, don't forget, I'm coming to get you.
not_available Sweetheart, stay on the phone.
not_available I'm gonna be right back.
not_available Honey, you still there? 
not_available Mom, he's coming back.
not_available Jack, I need to get off the phone.
not_available He's coming back.
not_available Who's coming? Teri, keep the line open.
not_available Dude, it's just a phone.
not_available It's how Gaines gets ahold of me when he needs me.
not_available You already looked here.
not_available Where is it? I told you, I don't know.
not_available Where's my phone? 
not_available She doesn't know either.
not_available Stay away from her.
not_available Stop it! What are you doing? Don't you touch her! Can't speak for yourself? I don't know where your stupid
not_available Don't hurt her.
not_available Come on! Take it easy! Nina, what's going on? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available The signal's dying.
not_available Who'd you call? Who is this? I'm the last thing that you'll ever see if anything happens to my wife or my daughter.
not_available Where you going? To tell Gaines they called for help.
not_available What do you think he's gonna do when he finds out they used your phone? Jack, get us out of here, please.
not_available Hurry! Teri, I'm going to find you.
not_available I promise.
not_available Think about it.
not_available They called on your phone.
not_available Nina.
not_available Tell me you got that trace.
not_available We didn't get it.
not_available We've located Bauer's car.
not_available Nina, it's Jack.
not_available You still there? What's happening, Jack? 
not_available I got a car.
not_available How close did Milo get with the trace? Twenty
not_available five mile radius.
not_available Damn it, that's not good enough.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Look, I've gotta do something.
not_available Come on, Nina, anything, please help me out.
not_available What about Jamey? She didn't make it, Jack.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Nina, please, I've got to find them.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Did you get anything yet with that email address? 
not_available Yeah, it's coming through now.
not_available Patch into Line 2.
not_available Hey, Jack, it's Tony.
not_available I found something on Jamey's computer that might be a lead.
not_available What? The name, Ted Cofell.
not_available I did a search of LA and found Ted Cofell as a CEO of an investment banking firm in Burbank.
not_available That's it? 
not_available So far.<br>.
not_available There's something.<br>.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Speak one at a time.
not_available Tony, you go first.
not_available So far that's it.
not_available We have Milo decoding the e
not_available mail right now.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm gonna head to Cofell's office.
not_available What's the address? It's 21500 Riverside Drive.
not_available Tony, Gaines is gonna probably try to contact Jamey.
not_available He doesn't know she's dead.
not_available Make sure you keep it that way, okay? Nina, you help me navigate through traffic.
not_available All right.
not_available Gaines.
not_available Hello, Ira.
not_available Mr.
not_available Drazen.
not_available Where are you? Flying into Los Angeles.
not_available I'd like to know why the David Palmer situation hasn't been taken care of.
not_available I don't have to tell you, my brother and I are very disappointed.
not_available We had some bad luck, that's all.
not_available Bad luck or bad management, we have every reason to void the contract.
not_available There's no need for that.
not_available To have Jack Bauer and David Palmer in the same city on the same day and let them slip through our fingers would be intolerable.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Palmer will be dead by the end of the day, just as we agreed.
not_available How? We still have Bauer's family as leverage.
not_available We'll find Bauer and use him, just like we did before.
not_available If plan 'A' doesn't work, you should have a plan 'B'.
not_available Not plan 'A' recycled.
not_available Like I said, we still have his family.
not_available If we sit tight, there's a good chance Bauer will find us.
not_available Then we'll make him the scapegoat, just as before.
not_available My brother wants me to assess the situation personally.
not_available I land in half an hour.
not_available I'll join you by 10:30.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available If I don't see a substantial improvement in things in the next hour I'm going to ask Mr.
not_available Cofell to empty the accounts.
not_available You will get zero.
not_available Mr.
not_available Drazen
not_available You may be in this for the money, but for my family, it's personal.
not_available I realize that.
not_available Then realize this.
not_available If things continue to go wrong the money isn't all you'll lose.
not_available You understand? 
not_available This is Sherry Palmer.
not_available Hello, Sherry.
not_available I'm sure you're just as surprised as I am that I'm calling you.
not_available I'm only surprised you waited this long.
not_available I assume you're calling because David still plans to make the announcement about Keith, and you can't stop him.
not_available So, now you want me to stop him? You've lost whatever influence you once had with David so I'm sure that's gonna be a problem.
not_available But you might be able to stop Maureen Kingsley.
not_available How? I don't know.
not_available I'm sure she has a weakness somewhere.
not_available Look, Carl, you don't need to ask me for any advice on stuff like this.
not_available As a matter of fact, I've already taken care of the evidence against Keith.
not_available Taken care of it? How? That's all you really need to know.
not_available I'm not sure I'm understanding you.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available But if we give David a way out of this, make sure he takes it.
not_available Got it.
not_available Send it to me.
not_available A wire transfer to Ira Gaines at 2:10 this morning from a Swiss account: $1,000,000.
not_available What does Cofell have to do with this? I don't know.
not_available Maybe it was his money.
not_available It makes sense.
not_available Cofell's in finance.
not_available Yeah, it's Jack.
not_available Jack, looks like we have the right Cofell.
not_available Good.
not_available What have you got on him? All right.
not_available Born in Philadelphia.
not_available Went to Colgate.
not_available MBA from UCLA in '88.
not_available Worked in investment banking, started his own firm about five years ago.
not_available Net worth is in excess of $35 million.
not_available Okay, good, patch me through to his office.
not_available Cofell Enterprises.
not_available Hi, is Ted there, please? Mr.
not_available Cofell's in a meeting.
not_available May I take a message? I'm a friend from business school.
not_available I'm in town today.
not_available I was hoping we could get together.
not_available As soon as he's out of the meeting, he's going out of town.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available How much longer will he be in his office? He plans to leave by 10:00.
not_available Would you like to leave your name? Hello? Tell Milo to be ready in case Teri calls back.
not_available Nina, Division gave me a heads
not_available up.
not_available They're sending in a provisional replacement for Jack.
not_available They didn't waste any time, did they? Who is it? Alberta Green.
not_available Didn't she work for you over at Division? Yes, she did.
not_available When's she coming? Scheduled to arrive at 9:45.
not_available Okay.
not_available CTU, Myers.
not_available Cofell's there, but he's leaving at 10:00.
not_available I'm passing Culver.
not_available What's the traffic like moving east? Hang on, I'll check.
not_available Jack, there's another thing.
not_available They're bringing in Alberta Green to run things.
not_available She's gonna be here in a few minutes.
not_available Damn it! Whatever, look, we'll deal with it.
not_available Tell me how to get out of this traffic.
not_available You'll hit gridlock in about two miles.
not_available How is Riverside? It's a little better.
not_available You might want to get off.
not_available I'm getting off at the next exit.
not_available I'm gonna cut over.
not_available Mom, tell me what happened between you and Dad.
not_available Why did he move out? Kim, let's not talk about this now.
not_available Why not? I mean, we both know there might not be a later.
not_available Kim 
not_available Please, Mom.
not_available I wanna know.
not_available I think your father is the best man that I've ever known.
not_available But he can be difficult and his job doesn't help.
not_available You remember a couple of years ago, when he went away for a few weeks? Yeah, for some.<br>.
not_available training thing.
not_available That's what he told us, but I'm sure it was a mission.
not_available He wouldn't say, and maybe he probably couldn't.
not_available Anyway, when he came back, he was different.
not_available He was distant and preoccupied and other times he was just angry.
not_available He did everything he could to keep it from you but things between us weren't so great.
not_available I suppose I could have been more patient.
not_available So we decided to try being apart.
not_available But it didn't work.
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available I just want us to be together again.
not_available Cofell is taking a private plane and we got a copy of his flight plan from the FAA.
not_available He's going to Denver.
not_available What does that tell us? 
not_available We're not sure.
not_available We're checking people in the Denver area who have known terrorist connections.
not_available So far we haven't got much.
not_available Hello, Nina.
not_available Hello, Alberta.
not_available Nice to see you.
not_available You know why I'm here.
not_available Yes.
not_available Gather everyone around, will you? Could everyone stop what they're doing for just a moment? I have something to tell you.
not_available I'd like to introduce you to Alberta Green.
not_available Jack Bauer has been relieved of his duties here indefinitely.
not_available In the meantime, Alberta's been appointed Acting Director of CTU.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Things have been out of control here today.
not_available Starting now, they're back in control.
not_available Most of you know an attempt was made on Senator Palmer at 8:00 this morning.
not_available You may not know that Jack Bauer was apparently involved in that attempt.
not_available The nature of his involvement isn't clear but he has escaped custody, and is considered a fugitive.
not_available We therefore have two objectives: Find Jack Bauer, and make a quick and accurate assessment of the threat, if any, facing Senator Palmer.
not_available I know most of you have been up more than 24 hours.
not_available Too bad.
not_available Nobody so much as yawns until we accomplish our objective.
not_available If anyone has a problem with that, now would be a good time to resign.
not_available Good.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available Specific assignments will be confirmed or revised within the hour.
not_available Obviously this is awkward, but we'll get through this.
not_available We're pros.
not_available Of course.
not_available We'll talk later.
not_available Hold on a minute.
not_available Is it true you played basketball? I sure did.
not_available Georgetown.
not_available My daddy says Georgetown sucks! I need to have a little talk with your daddy.
not_available My daddy also says there will never be a black president in this country.
not_available Ever.
not_available Would you give your daddy a message for me? You tell him I understand where he's coming from, but he's wrong and I'm gonna prove it.
not_available Tell him that, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I have Frank Ames on the phone.
not_available What does he want? 
not_available He wouldn't tell me.
not_available I'll call him back.
not_available He said it was urgent.
not_available He's your biggest contributor.
not_available You can't just blow him off.
not_available I am very sorry.
not_available Would you excuse me for a minute? Senator.
not_available Frank? This is kind of a bad time.
not_available Well, it's about to get worse.
not_available What do you mean? I just got out of a meeting with Carl, Phil Tuttle and Bob Jorgensen.
not_available A meeting about what? George Ferragamo, your son's therapist.
not_available I know the three of you have given a lot of money to my campaign but that doesn't make my son's therapist your business.
not_available It is when he's accusing your son of murder.
not_available He's a problem, and Tuttle and Jorgensen don't like problems.
not_available They told Carl to get rid of it, permanently.
not_available I've played hardball all my life, but this.
not_available What are you trying to say? They told Carl to
not_available Listen, I am washing my hands of this and your whole campaign.
not_available Frank! 
not_available I am out of it, David.
not_available What was that about? I need to talk to Carl, now.
not_available You wanted to see me? 
not_available Give us five minutes.
not_available Certainly.
not_available I don't know where Jack is.
not_available I haven't talked to him since this morning.
not_available Since he escaped from custody with a hostage? 
not_available That's right.
not_available I'm not sure I believe you.
not_available If you tell me where he is I'll do what I can to make sure nothing heavy falls on you.
not_available I told you, I don't know.
not_available From what I've heard, there are very few secrets between you and Jack.
not_available Jack doesn't trust anyone, including me.
not_available Getting involved with Jack was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.
not_available Not that I'm judging you, Nina, but there's a right way to do these things.
not_available Let them screw you, don't let them screw you over.
not_available If you don't have any more pearls of wisdom, I'd like to get back to work.
not_available By all means.
not_available Cofell Enterprises.
not_available Hey, it's Ted's friend from business school again.
not_available I'm sorry, but I'm in the building.
not_available I was hoping I could come up and say a quick hello.
not_available Is Ted gonna be there for a few more minutes? I'm sorry, sir, he's on his way out.
not_available What floor is Cofell Enterprises on? Fourteenth.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Could you call my car please? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I should head to the airport a little early today.
not_available The radio said the traffic was a little slow.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cofell, a friend of yours from business school is on the way to see you.
not_available On his way up now? 
not_available I tried to stop him.
not_available He say who it was? He didn't give his name.
not_available He's probably trying to sell you something.
not_available Don't give him my cell number.
not_available Have a good trip.
not_available Don't forget your phone.
not_available Great.
not_available I just wanted to let you know that Mr.
not_available Cofell is on his way down.
not_available Excuse me, where's Mr.
not_available Cofell? I'm so sorry, he just stepped into the elevator.
not_available Where was he going? Down to the parking garage? It's all right.
not_available Never mind.
