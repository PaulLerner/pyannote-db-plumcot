not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Tanner, Emerson spoke to his man inside the Bureau.
not_available He says you're clear.
not_available Good.
not_available I need to prep my men on the nextjob.
not_available Tell me what we need.
not_available I'll give you the specs when I get there.
not_available I'll engage him.
not_available Cover my flank.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.
not_available If he doesn't have the C.I.P.
not_available Device, who does? Almeida's working for theJuma regime.
not_available This is Colonel Ik√© Dubaku.
not_available We demand an immediate withdrawal of the U.S.
not_available Naval strike force by this time tomorrow.
not_available The American troops are still in position near our country.
not_available President Taylor just received your demands.
not_available Then perhaps it is time for a more forceful demonstration.
not_available I know about Samantha Roth.
not_available She's hiding something about my son's murder.
not_available Roger wasn't murdered.
not_available I wasn't completely honest with you.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available He was murdered.
not_available Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.
not_available He's working with me.
not_available We're working outside the government.
not_available That's why we have to get Tony back undercover.
not_available Bauer, you're not gonna make it out of here.
not_available Shut up! I said shut up! 
not_available Get down! We gotta get you out of here and back undercover.
not_available Go! 
not_available Tony, let's go! 
not_available The following takes place between 11:00 a.m.
not_available And 12:00 p.m.
not_available Renee.
not_available Security saw Bauer and Almeida getting into a dark
not_available colored panel van.
not_available What direction were they heading? 
not_available West.
not_available What's happening with D.O.T.
not_available Cameras? I've been trying.
not_available Traffic images aren't loading.
not_available What do you mean, not loading? Just what I said.
not_available The server's not responding.
not_available The hacker must be jamming the transmission.
not_available How the hell can they do that? If I knew, I'd be able to get around it.
not_available Continue checking ancillary security cams
not_available A.T.M., parking garages.
not_available There has to be something.
not_available Well, keep canvassing the area.
not_available Someone else may have seen the vehicle.
not_available That's what we're doing.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let me know.
not_available No luck on municipal cameras.
not_available Looks like they have someone running interference for them.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Bauer must've worked out this escape with Almeida's people.
not_available I'm so sorry, Larry.
not_available That son of a bitch played me.
not_available Had me believing the Bureau was compromised someone on the inside working against us.
not_available I realize now it was him all along.
not_available Don't put this on yourself.
not_available He played us both.
not_available No.
not_available I should have seen it.
not_available This is fine.
not_available Take it downstairs, will you? Bauer's facing a federal indictment, years in prison and Almeida must have offered him a way out.
not_available Agent Moss? The White House is on line one.
not_available Yeah, I'll take it in the conference room.
not_available Thanks, Erika.
not_available I'm gonna make this right, Larry.
not_available Whatever it takes, I will find Bauer and Almeida.
not_available Throw in the C.I.P.
not_available Device and maybe we'll be off the hook.
not_available Janis, what's the status of that shooter? He hasn't regained consciousness yet.
not_available But a print match is just coming up now.
not_available His name is Alan Tanner.
not_available He was former Special Forces, discharged after Desert Storm.
not_available Discharged why? 
not_available Medical reasons.
not_available He made claims to having Gulf War Syndrome.
not_available Tried to sue the government.
not_available Case was dismissed.
not_available I wanna be informed the minute he's awake.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Sir, I'm connecting you now.
not_available Agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin.
not_available I'm here with the president.
not_available What are you and your folks doing about this situation? We put out an all
not_available agency alert.
not_available Everyone understands apprehending Almeida is our top priority.
not_available How did he escape? He had the help of a former C.T.U.
not_available Agent that we mistakenly trusted.
not_available A man by the name ofJack Bauer.
not_available Bauer? Thought he was in the middle of a Senate investigative hearing.
not_available Uh, yes, sir.
not_available That is correct.
not_available We issued a subpoena a few hours ago excusing him from the hearings in order to enlist his help in apprehending Almeida.
not_available Now you're saying that these two men are allied? 
not_available It would appear so.
not_available My God.
not_available You and your people have royally screwed up, Agent Moss.
not_available Without Almeida, we have no way of finding Dubaku and no chance of recovering the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available Ethan, let's stay on point.
not_available Agent Moss, are you working any other leads? Yes, Madam President
not_available a confederate of Almeida's who was wounded earlier today.
not_available Uh, he's just out of surgery.
not_available We're waiting for him to regain consciousness.
not_available Do we have a time frame from the hospital on when that might happen? No, ma'am, not really.
not_available Let me be clear, Agent Moss.
not_available Recapturing Almeida and Bauer isn't just your top priority.
not_available It's your only priority.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Keep us posted, Agent.
not_available Bottom line, the Bureau is not going to be the answer to our prayers here.
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available How much time does that leave us? Less than two hours.
not_available Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours.
not_available Now, in order to meet that timetable the fleet and carrier air wing must start withdrawing by 1:00 at the latest.
not_available Which would effectively end our mission in Africa and condemn another 100,000 Sangalans to a certain and brutal death.
not_available On the other hand, if you authorize the invasion Dubaku will undoubtedly engage the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available How far has the F.A.A.
not_available Gotten with grounding aircraft? Still over a thousand planes in the air across the country, waiting for clearance to land.
not_available Dubaku could bring down any one of them at any moment or use the device for something far worse.
not_available I ran for office on the principle of non
not_available negotiation with terrorists.
not_available How can I abandon that now, the very first time I'm tested? And if I do so, won't I be telling Dubaku and the rest of the world that blackmailing America works? Madam President, those are questions for the future.
not_available We have a decision to make now.
not_available What do you call this place? We like to think of it as C.T.U.
not_available What's left of it, anyway.
not_available Jack.
not_available Chloe.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available It's good to see you too.
not_available I'm glad you're with us.
not_available I'm not with anyone until someone starts answering some questions.
not_available Might as well start with you.
not_available Why the hell are you not dead? I was dead, Jack.
not_available For almost 10 minutes, or so I was told.
not_available By who? 
not_available By him.
not_available His name's David Emerson.
not_available I don't know who he paid off at C.T.
not_available U but it was his people who injected my body with a hypothermic compound was able to revive me.
not_available Who is he, and what does he want? 
not_available Independent contractor.
not_available Enlists ex
not_available military and intelligence operatives, jobs 'em out to clients.
not_available Apparently, I fit the profile.
not_available What profile? Former employees with grievances against the federal government.
not_available Emerson had been keeping tabs on me ever since I left C.T.U.
not_available After Michelle was killed, he figured I'd make a good recruit.
not_available And everyone else thinking you're dead, so much the better.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And since then you've been working undercover to expose his operation? 
not_available No, Jack.
not_available What? I was really working for him.
not_available I was angry.
not_available I hated the federal government for what it took from me.
not_available I ran Emerson's crew for more than three years and I did some pretty bad things.
not_available What made you turn against him? The C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available Emerson had my crew stealing components to breach the firewall.
not_available I knew what that meant.
not_available Innocent Americans would die, and I didn't sign up for that.
not_available Damn it, Tony.
not_available Why didn't you call the authorities? 
not_available He couldn't, Jack.
not_available Why not? 
not_available He found out Emerson's client was Dubaku.
not_available That's who you believe has agents inside the government.
not_available TheJuma regime controls Sangala's vast diamond wealth.
not_available Dubaku hasn't been shy about throwing it around.
not_available How widespread is the corruption? 
not_available Pervasive.
not_available That's why Tony came to me.
not_available He didn't know how far or high up this thing went.
not_available Dubaku's the key to this thing, Jack.
not_available If we're gonna uncover the conspiracy we have to get to him before he leaves the U.S.
not_available That's why I have to get back under as soon as possible.
not_available There's a new job in the pipeline for me and my crew.
not_available I don't have all the details but I do know that it'll get me in the same room with Dubaku himself.
not_available Challenge is going to be reinstalling Tony with Emerson.
not_available We have to assume Emerson knew Tony was in F.B.I.
not_available Custody and somehow managed to escape.
not_available Emerson's gonna think Tony made a deal with the U.S.
not_available Attorney.
not_available That's right.
not_available I can help you with this.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Outside of the three of you, who else is involved in this operation? It's just us.
not_available This is it.
not_available Please at least tell me that you've got some proof that this conspiracy exists.
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available But only at the lowest level.
not_available At this point, we've just begun to scratch the surface.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll work with you.
not_available But only because right now, you are the only people that I trust.
not_available You give me one reason to question that, and I swear I will turn you in.
not_available You understand? All right.
not_available Chloe, set up the call with Emerson.
not_available I found two freelancers who might workex
not_available Rangers.
not_available Trust 'em? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've worked with them before.
not_available They're close.
not_available Litvak knows them too.
not_available Okay.
not_available They may want to know more about the job before they sign on.
not_available Only thing they need to know is what it pays.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Tony.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a parking garage, getting a car.
not_available I got away from the F.B.I.
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available I also heard it was Jack Bauer who broke you out.
not_available That's right.
not_available That doesn't make any sense, Tony.
not_available Bauer's working for them.
not_available He helped capture you.
not_available It's only because he didn't have a choice.
not_available He's on board now.
not_available What do you mean, on board? 
not_available You heard about the Senate hearings this morning? They're gonna file criminal charges against him.
not_available I told Bauer that if he helped us out with the mission we could get him out of the country.
not_available Look, David.
not_available If it weren't forJack, I'd still be in custody.
not_available We can use him.
not_available I'm tellin' you.
not_available I don't know, Tony.
not_available Morgan's hiring new men now.
not_available Morgan's a thug! He can't run point on something this important.
not_available Let me do it like we planned.
not_available Bauer could take Tanner's place, and we're good to go.
not_available All right, bring Bauer.
not_available We're at 2211 Chesterfield.
not_available It's right off Nolan.
not_available Got it.
not_available He buy it? 
not_available We'll see.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available I understand you were looking for me.
not_available Yes, Agent Gedge.
not_available I have to go out, and I'm gonna need some transportation.
not_available Certainly.
not_available Where will we be going? 
not_available I'll direct you on the way.
not_available Need a destination for the manifest, sir.
not_available As before, I'd like you to keep this off the manifest.
not_available And no driver this time.
not_available Just you and me.
not_available Thought we were through with all the subterfuge, Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available Please, just do as I ask.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available Not without an explanation.
not_available It's Samantha Roth.
not_available She says she has new information regarding my son's death.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor
not_available I thought I was done with this too.
not_available Believe me.
not_available I didn't initiate this.
not_available She called me.
not_available Brian, I know you felt obligated to report my prior activities and rightly so.
not_available But I would still like to think that I can count on your loyalty when I ask for it.
not_available Could lose my job, sir.
not_available This will be the last time.
not_available I promise.
not_available Henry? Please.
not_available I'll call you as soon as I secure a vehicle.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Who was that? 
not_available Staff.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Here.
not_available Can you help me with this? 
not_available Sure.
not_available It was a gift from my father.
not_available You remember? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available The day I won back his seat in the Senate.
not_available Prime Minister Matobo has asked to see me.
not_available He's gonna want to know why I haven't authorized the invasion yet.
not_available What are you gonna tell him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available The American people elected you because they trust your judgment, Allison.
not_available And they're gonna trust you to make the right call on this too.
not_available I don't know what the right call is.
not_available The right call is whatever you decide it is.
not_available How many units in the field? 
not_available Seventeen.
not_available All available agents are deployed.
not_available Widen the grid.
not_available We have to assume Bauer and Almeida have gotten outside of our perimeter by now.
not_available On it.
not_available Sean Hillinger.
not_available Sean, it's me.
not_available Christina.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm calling from the plane.
not_available You haven't landed yet? No.
not_available TheThe pilot says we're in a holding pattern, but
not_available but we just keep circling and circling.
not_available And I can see other planes out the window too
not_available eight or nine, at least.
not_available Christina, sweetheart.
not_available Relax.
not_available ButBut the woman sitting next to me says sheshe heard something about a
not_available a near miss and a problem with the air traffic control system.
not_available Sean, do you know anything about this? Yeah, it's true.
not_available The F.A.A.
not_available Has grounded some planes.
not_available But it's only a precaution.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available It was an isolated incident.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available I just
not_available I got worried there for a minute.
not_available You know how I am.
not_available I do.
not_available Now, listen.
not_available I want you to call me as soon as you land.
not_available I will.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Was that your wife? Janis told me her plane's still in the air.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Okay? There's a maniac out there with the capability of bringing down planes at will so no, Erika, I'm not okay.
not_available Her flight is number 18 in the queue so it'll be another two hours at least before hers gets clearance.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Is there anything I can do? No.
not_available No.
not_available There's nothing anybody can do.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available Yes, she's right here.
not_available I'll let her know.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Renee.
not_available I just got off the phone with the hospital.
not_available Tanner's regained consciousness.
not_available Is he well enough to talk? He's well enough to ask the doctor to make a phone call for him.
not_available Who did he call? 
not_available Gage Whitney Pace, which is a law firm, I think.
not_available Second largest in D.C.
not_available Go grab your laptop, Janis.
not_available You're coming with me.
not_available I am? Why? 
not_available Because we have to get to Tanner before his lawyers do.
not_available Because if I can get Almeida's location out of him I want you on
not_available site to vet the intelligence to our field teams.
not_available Go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell me about Emerson.
not_available He's British, former S.A.S.
not_available Urban warfare, sniping, close
not_available quarter combat.
not_available Saw action in Beirut and Mogadishu.
not_available So he's good.
not_available Extremely.
not_available But he's not some wack job or ideologue.
not_available He's about two things
not_available money and personal loyalty.
not_available Sounds like you still admire him.
not_available Listen, Jack.
not_available He treated me like a brother when I thought I had nobody else.
not_available Is this gonna be a problem? No.
not_available I know he's on the wrong side of this.
not_available I'll do what has to be done.
not_available We're here.
not_available Where's Emerson? 
not_available Inside.
not_available Come in.
not_available David.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Take Mr.
not_available Bauer downstairs.
not_available I need to talk to Tony.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Bringing in Bauer is not worth the risk.
not_available What are you talking about? Have a seat.
not_available Mr.
not_available Emerson'll be right with you.
not_available I'd still be in F.B.I.
not_available Custody if it wasn't for him.
not_available Tony, you already made your case.
not_available We can use him.
not_available I considered it.
not_available But I'm going a different way.
not_available I owe him, David.
not_available You understand that? 
not_available Yeah, I appreciate your sense ofloyalty.
not_available I always have.
not_available But this is business, Tony.
not_available You can't have a
not_available an unknown factor like Jack Bauer comin' in and messing things up.
not_available So what? You're gonna kill him? No, you are.
not_available They're gonna kill him.
not_available He'll get out of it.
not_available What if he can't? Then Jack's death solidifies Tony's position in the crew.
not_available Tony was in F.B.I.
not_available Custody.
not_available If he'd gone back in there by himself, suspicion would have rested on him alone.
not_available So by deflecting it ontoJack
not_available We keep Tony's cover viable.
not_available You knew this might happen the whole time.
not_available Yes.
not_available So did Jack.
not_available Put your weapon down! Put your weapon down, or I will kill him! I came here to do a job, not be doublecrossed by you! You're already short
not_available handed.
not_available You need good men
not_available not like these two traffic cops.
not_available Look what I've done to them! I am here because I've got nowhere else to go.
not_available Tony said if I helped you, you could get me out of the country.
not_available Look, if you don't believe me, pull the trigger.
not_available What are you, crazy? Kill him.
not_available No.
not_available Kill him or I'm out of here.
not_available Fine.
not_available Keep it.
not_available Right.
not_available I need Flight 112 reassigned for immediate landing.
not_available So you're requesting a priority landing for Flight 112 out of Las Vegas? This is not a request.
not_available I'm forwarding an urgent protocol from the White House.
not_available And your name was? Larry Moss, Special Agent in Charge.
not_available This is a matter of national security.
not_available Agent Moss, may I have your Level Five access number? 
not_available 6223510.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Flight 112 is moved to the head of the queue and should be on the ground shortly.
not_available Thank you.
not_available President Taylor, this is Colonel Ik√© Dubaku.
not_available As you have no doubt confirmed the near collision atJ.F.K.
not_available International was no accident.
not_available We have the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available We have the capability to kill tens of thousands of Americans.
not_available And we are prepared to do so.
not_available I wanted you to hear it for yourself, Prime Minister so that you would understand my dilemma.
not_available I see.
not_available You are recalling the invasion force.
not_available Well, that determination has yet to be made.
not_available And this device over which Dubaku has control it poses a significant risk to your people? Yes.
not_available It's a technology that has the potential for mass civilian casualties.
not_available And it puts the infrastructure of my country in grave jeopardy.
not_available What of Sangala? Believe me.
not_available No one is more aware of what's at stake than I.
not_available So you've been informed of the situation in Kasanga Province? Juma's troops are advancing on a refugee camp.
not_available Over 2,000 lives are threatened.
not_available Mostly women and children.
not_available There's also the matter of those soldiers who have, on the promise of American support deserted the regime and joined my freedom fighters on the ground.
not_available Please, provide us the weapons we need in order to defend ourselves.
not_available You've been patient with us before, Mr.
not_available Matobo.
not_available I can only ask that you be patient again.
not_available Now please, if you'll excuse me.
not_available Madam President, I implore you.
not_available Do not abandon my country.
not_available Mr.
not_available Matobo, I will do everything that I can.
not_available I count on you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You didn't think that I would want to know about the refugees in Kasanga? Madam President, you have enough to think about without being burdened with details.
not_available Especially details that might push me toward proceeding with the invasion.
not_available Ma'am, you have to start focusing on alternatives to the invasion.
not_available Give me a good alternative and I'll consider it.
not_available I'm not saying it's a good alternative, but it's the only one.
not_available Comply with Dubaku's demands.
not_available Stand down the task force.
not_available That's your recommendationback down? 
not_available It is.
not_available Damn it, Ethan.
not_available You heard Matobo.
not_available He has fighters on the ground counting on us.
not_available Do you want me to be responsible for another Bay of Pigs? Kennedy survived the Bay of Pigs, and you'll survive this.
not_available A superpower has to act first and foremost in its own best interests.
not_available Always? 
not_available Always.
not_available No apologies.
not_available What about allowing a third party to dictate its foreign policy? Does a superpower do that? Yes, if there's no other option.
not_available And right now, there's not.
not_available What have we heard from the F.B.I.
not_available About the search for Almeida and Bauer? 
not_available Nothing, ma'am.
not_available Check with them anyway.
not_available No hard feelings, Jack.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Have to be careful in our profession.
not_available I'm sure you understand.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We all know the drill.
not_available Disagreements are fine, but when a decision's made, fall in or you're gone.
not_available I've heard a lot of guys say that.
not_available Good to know you mean it.
not_available Before you were subpoenaed, you traveled the world, place to place, for more than a year.
not_available Why? What were you looking for? 
not_available Doesn't really matter.
not_available Whatever it was, I didn't find it.
not_available You must have known what was waiting.
not_available Why'd you come back? Wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller.
not_available That's funny.
not_available But no, really.
not_available Why? This is my home.
not_available That doesn't explain why you turned yourself in to theJustice Department.
not_available Tony said you were in Beirut and Mogadishu.
not_available And Afghanistan, two tours.
not_available Went back a third time as a private contractor.
not_available Be polite, professional and have a plan to kill everyone you meet, right? Pretty much.
not_available That's the question, isn't it
not_available where do the rules of engagement end and the crimes begin? You wanna know why I came back.
not_available That's why.
not_available I'm not sure I follow.
not_available Just got tired of talking to myself.
not_available See, I actually believe everything I did was right.
not_available So I wanted to start a dialogue, come clean, set the record straight.
not_available First mistake.
not_available So I found out.
not_available No one who hasn't been to the edge and looked over could ever understand.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's good to have you on board, Jack.
not_available Yeah? Okay, let me check.
not_available What was that about? He's just trying to get a handle on me.
not_available Watch yourself around him, Jack, and do not underestimate him.
not_available I won't.
not_available Okay, I got it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, listen up.
not_available Just got the call.
not_available We're a go.
not_available For what? We don't even know what the hell thejob is.
not_available Picking up a package, delivering it to our client.
not_available Here's the location.
not_available A residence at 167 Foxhall Road? It belongs to the State Department.
not_available Memorize the layout.
not_available We don't know the exact spot of the pickup yet, but probably the master suite.
not_available Package is a person.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available Former Prime Minister Matobo of Sangala.
not_available Assignment is to grab him, deliver him to Colonel Dubaku.
not_available Colonel wants to ask him some questions.
not_available And, as you can imagine, the colonel can be quite persuasive.
not_available Now, Matobo has tight security, so finish arming up.
not_available Be prepared to engage.
not_available We'll roll in two minutes.
not_available They're gonna kidnap Matobo.
not_available We have to alert somebody and stop this.
not_available No.
not_available We do nothing.
not_available But you heard them.
not_available They're gonna torture him and probably kill him.
not_available Unfortunately, yes.
not_available Matobo single
not_available handedly led the fight against genocide in his country.
not_available He doesn't deserve this.
not_available I understand that, Chloe.
not_available But if we don't go along with the grab Jack and Tony will not find Colonel Dubaku and we will not get to the bottom of this conspiracy.
not_available Agreed? 
not_available Agreed.
not_available I don't want you to wait for me.
not_available Sir? Just drive away.
not_available I'll call when I need you.
not_available You know I can't do that, Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available We're already off the manifest, Brian.
not_available She won't talk to me unless I'm alone.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll take up a position on the bridge.
not_available She'll never know I'm there.
not_available All right.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor.
not_available Sam.
not_available I can't stay long.
not_available What you told me on the phoneIs it true? 
not_available Yes.
not_available They killed Roger and made it look like a suicide.
not_available Who? Who did this? The same people who provided false documents to the S.E.
not_available C to show he'd been trading on inside information.
not_available Who are they? 
not_available I don't know who they are.
not_available They just said they would kill me if I said anything.
not_available Easy, easy, Sam.
not_available Easy.
not_available I loved him.
not_available I know you did, Sam.
not_available But right now, I really need to know what happened.
not_available Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department.
not_available That's how it started.
not_available When was this? 
not_available January.
not_available Uh, earlyJanuary.
not_available The compliance officer at his firm asked him to flag any undisclosed ownership 
not_available in securities positions.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Basically, kickbacks.
not_available But what he found was something else.
not_available Two of his portfolio managers had taken on a new client: The Bahamas branch of Switzerland's oldest bank, Bank Lausanne International.
not_available What was wrong with that? 
not_available Bank Lausanne's records revealed that it was actively trading with firms doing business in Sangala.
not_available Sangala? 
not_available It jumped out at Roger too, for obvious reasons.
not_available And digging deeper, he uncovered other blind accounts that were copying the bank's trades.
not_available Which accounts? Accounts that were traced to a senior member of your wife's administration.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But whoever it was had a vested interest in the proposed military action.
not_available Somebody who was betting against her who didn't think she'd be able to pull it off politically? Betting heavily, in 10,000
not_available share blocks.
not_available Roger was a day or two away from presenting her with the evidence.
not_available It's all here
not_available account numbers, trading records, everything that he knew.
not_available I'm sorry that I can't help you out more.
not_available Samantha.
not_available I've given you all I can.
not_available Do what you have to do, but leave me out of it, please.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
