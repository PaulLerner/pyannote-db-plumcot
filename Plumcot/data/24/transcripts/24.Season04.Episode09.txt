
not_available The Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors.
not_available I'll have to manage the override personally.
not_available Make sure those six melt down on schedule.
not_available Is there anything I can do? Take care of your mess.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available My wife and son will be dead by the end of this day.
not_available I'm not afraid of Father.
not_available You should be.
not_available He tried to kill me, and then he did this to you.
not_available You're going to need to set things up on your end.
not_available All right.
not_available What do I do? <ix>Divert suspicion.</ix> Someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside.
not_available <ix>Ms Driscoll, what's going on?</ix> 
not_available You're under arrest, Gavin.
not_available For what? You've been passing classified information.
not_available Thousands of lives are at stake.
not_available Where are the people who control the override? I swear I don't know anything.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available <ix>We've got a match, Jack.</ix> His name is Henry Powell.
not_available <ix>He was a computer consultant for McLennan
not_available Forster.</ix> They designed the device controlling the power plants.
not_available You're going to fly me out of here.
not_available Drop the weapon now! Now! Put him in the back.
not_available He's dead, Jack.
not_available Dammit! You got the wrong one.
not_available Sarah's not guilty.
not_available It's Marianne Taylor.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Excuse me, Curtis.
not_available Not now.
not_available All right.
not_available Coordinate that with NRC.
not_available Copy me on sixzero
not_available Baker.
not_available Fine.
not_available I warned you about her.
not_available What are you talking about? Marianne Taylor.
not_available I said she was trouble and it was a mistake to let her work here.
not_available You said you weren't comfortable working with her.
not_available You didn't say you were having a relationship with a spy.
not_available How could I have known? Don't play that card with me.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then don't have an "I told you so" attitude.
not_available Now we both have to deal with this.
not_available Division? That's right.
not_available They're gonna want a timeline from how Marianne got in here, down to the high
not_available security files that she was able to access in a very short period of time.
not_available Can we have a conversation offbook? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Neither of us should compromise our authority with Division.
not_available Agree or disagree? 
not_available Agreed.
not_available Marianne did an excellent job in establishing her credentials.
not_available All we need to do is leave out some of the details in how she managed to get in here.
not_available I don't like anyone holding something over me.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available How long will it take you to adjust the files? Two minutes.
not_available I'll call Division in five.
not_available Explain to me how this mole, Marianne Taylor, was able to infiltrate CTU.
not_available We're still investigating.
not_available Who does she work for? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available Find out.
not_available We will, as soon as she's conscious.
not_available She's being treated here.
not_available <ix>Treated for what?</ix> 
not_available An attempt on her life.
not_available Who tried to kill her? 
not_available We don't know that either.
not_available But whoever it was, they're more than likely connected with the theft of the override.
not_available Jim, we need to find that override now.
not_available What's the latest from the NRC? They reported the San Gabriel Island reactor's about to go critical.
not_available What's the time frame? Meltdown within the hour.
not_available <ix>We're evacuating the San Gabriel zone.</ix> <ix>The population affected is less than 100,000.
not_available Hopefully, most are already on the move.</ix> All right.
not_available Expedite the process as much as you can.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available <ix>Jack?</ix> Erin, Powell's dead.
not_available He was hit by a sniper when we arrested him.
not_available <ix>Get anything from him before he was killed?</ix> 
not_available No.
not_available But I got his last ten cell phone calls.
not_available He called two numbers repeatedly.
not_available We traced one of them to Marianne Taylor.
not_available Powell was working with Marianne? 
not_available Apparently.
not_available What about this other number? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'm gonna need you to trace it through CTU.
not_available OK.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I've got an ID.
not_available I'll be standing by.
not_available Edgar? I need you to run a locate on this number.
not_available It's a cellular account.
not_available Location? 
not_available I need to ping the number.
not_available How? It has to ring at least four times for triangulation.
not_available Jameson can have me set up in a couple of minutes.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Navi.
not_available Navi? What are you doing here? 
not_available Looking for Dina.
not_available Why would Dina be here? 
not_available She hasn't called in the last hour? No.
not_available What's going on, Navi? Why are you blocking the door? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available Let me in.
not_available She's not here.
not_available You're lying.
not_available You're hiding her.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Navi, no! You have no right to come in here like this.
not_available She is not here.
not_available Look.
not_available That is my bedroom.
not_available You can't go in there! What's going on here? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Navi, please.
not_available Please go.
not_available This is none of your business.
not_available Why don't you hike it on out? Please, don't interfere.
not_available You can either walk out of here or I'm gonna throw you out.
not_available I said go! 
not_available No, Navi.
not_available Please, no! Navi, don't, please.
not_available Get back inside.
not_available Navi.
not_available Don't tell my husband, I beg of you.
not_available You disgust me.
not_available Navi Dina's not here.
not_available What about the hospitals? <ix>Nothing so far.</ix> 
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Is it your father? 
not_available I can't tell.
not_available Don't answer it.
not_available We got it.
not_available Where? 
not_available A hotel in Chatsworth.
not_available Download the coordinates to Jack.
not_available Here's the backup.
not_available Yeah.
not_available <ix>We've traced the call.</ix> Hold on a second.
not_available I got it.
not_available We're less than ten minutes out.
not_available <ix>I'll have a tactical team in place.</ix> Thank you.
not_available The body's by my car.
not_available He was taken out by a sniper from the roof.
not_available I want you to take your photographs, get the body back to CTU as fast as possible.
not_available Come on, Tony.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available Wait, Jack.
not_available Look, I think I'm done here today.
not_available What are you talking about? CTU backup's here.
not_available You don't need me any more.
not_available I need you to see this through with me.
not_available I appreciate that, but you don't have to prop up my ego.
not_available This isn't about you.
not_available If we don't find the override device in an hour, we'll have six nuclear disasters.
not_available So please, get in the car.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Mom, we've got to get you some help.
not_available I'm OK.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available Your father shot me, not you.
not_available Because you were trying to stop him from killing me.
not_available Everything that's happening today, what we've all been fighting to achieve, it's more important to him than anything, or anyone.
not_available But not to you.
not_available Mom? 
not_available I need to get you something for the pain.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available I just need to rest.
not_available I can get it from Naseem.
not_available No.
not_available The hospital he works at is near here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Naseem doesn't know why we were really living here.
not_available Mom, he's your brother.
not_available I'll tell him you need it, and nothing else.
not_available I promise.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Just hurry.
not_available I will.
not_available Mr.
not_available Secretary.
not_available We have a meltdown.
not_available San Gabriel Island reactor's just gone critical.
not_available Core material is now airborne.
not_available I thought we had more time.
not_available Ms Driscoll, Derek Rosner, the engineer at San Gabriel Island, is on with the NRC.
not_available One of their generators exploded, cooked their comm lines.
not_available We may only have a few seconds.
not_available Patch us in.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available We've had a meltdown in San Gabriel Island.
not_available <ix>All attempts to contain the core failed.</ix> <ix>We're trying to bypass the reactor trip, but that's not working.</ix> Mr.
not_available Rosner, this is Erin Driscoll from CTU.
not_available Can you hear me? <ix>Yes, ma'am.</ix> Secretary of Defense James Heller is here.
not_available What are your radiation levels? <ix>We're at 500 REM right now.</ix> <ix>That's ten thousand times the dose of an x
not_available ray.</ix> <ix>At this REM rate the radiation will get stronger</ix> <ix>and will spill into the atmosphere until the core is exhausted.</ix> Son, you've done everything you can, now get out of there.
not_available <ix>Evacuating won't make any difference, sir.</ix> <ix>We've already been exposed.</ix> We've lost them.
not_available Can we re
not_available establish the link? Have we analyzed the cloud's movement? We're waiting for NGS to get a satellite refresh.
not_available Get on the phone, have them expedite.
not_available I will.
not_available After rerouting evacuation instructions.
not_available Can't someone else do that? 
not_available No.
not_available We're short of manpower.
not_available <ix>A government spokesman has confirmed that the nuclear reactor at San Gabriel Island</ix> <ix>is in full meltdown.
not_available Emergency personnel are on site,</ix> <ix>attempting to rescue workers exposed to radiation.</ix> You're not listening.
not_available I've been trying to get through to the evacuation zone for ten minutes.
not_available I need you to link me in to access the emergency bandwidth.
not_available I need it now.
not_available <ix>All right.
not_available Stand by.</ix> 
not_available Thank you.
not_available <ix>If you are on the road or awaiting</ix> <ix>..
not_available here are some items you and your family might need.</ix> Hello? 
not_available <ix>Mom.</ix> Hello, Edgar.
not_available Have you seen the news? 
not_available I'm watching it now.
not_available Why aren't you evacuated by now? 
not_available You know I don't have a car.
not_available Where's Margaret? I tried to get her but the lines are busy.
not_available I'm surprised you got through.
not_available What about one of your neighbors? 
not_available By the time I got outside they were all gone.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm gonna make some calls.
not_available I'm gonna get someone there to help you.
not_available I want you to sit and wait for my call.
not_available Can you do that? Yes.
not_available I don't really have a choice.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available OK? 
not_available OK, honey.
not_available Bye.
not_available <ix>We've delegated that to Murphy's group.</ix> I'm not interested in that.
not_available We don't have the luxury of miscommunications.
not_available Someone from my office will coordinate between state police and the National Guard.
not_available Set up the conference call in ten minutes.
not_available Thank you all.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How are you holding up? Considering the situation we're in I'm doing fine.
not_available The truth of the matter is we do not have the manpower to handle this mess.
not_available Tell me what I can do.
not_available I've prioritized evacuation protocol, but I need someone to keep the state police and the National Guard from interacting.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll stop the guard at the 75th
not_available mile marker and let the police take over from there.
not_available We'll maximize room for civilian traffic.
not_available I wish we had some other way to get those people out of there.
not_available There's nowhere else to route them.
not_available Jack has got to find the override before the rest of these reactors go critical.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available Good to have you in the field again.
not_available Thanks, Lee.
not_available You remember Tony Almeida? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't know what he's doing here.
not_available I want him here.
not_available He's not authorized to be in the field.
not_available I'm going through that door first.
not_available I want him there to back me up.
not_available Fine.
not_available Get another vest.
not_available You got a visual on the suspect? 
not_available We got a fiberoptic camera inside.
not_available The manager says there's a midforties female and a teenage male.
not_available Possibly mother and son.
not_available Both Middle Eastern.
not_available We need them alive.
not_available They're no good to us dead.
not_available I've been briefed.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We got a visual on the woman.
not_available What about the kid? I haven't seen him yet.
not_available We gotta go, now.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Go.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Drop your weapon! Where is the override? Tell me who's got it! Tell me.
not_available Now! Agent Castle! Stand down! Lee, stand down! 
not_available I'm gonna get her to talk.
not_available She'll go into shock before she does.
not_available Agent Castle, step outside.
not_available Now! I want her prints and photograph send over to CTU immediately.
not_available He has no right to give me orders.
not_available Hey, come here.
not_available He did the right thing.
not_available She was willing to kill herself.
not_available She'd die before she gave in to force.
not_available We need to get her to talk now.
not_available And we will.
not_available What do you have in mind? We need to find some leverage.
not_available <ix>CTU, Hudson.</ix> 
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Put me through to Erin.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Let me see your arm.
not_available Driscoll.
not_available <ix>We have a suspect.</ix> I'm sending fingerprints and photographs.
not_available Run a profile.
not_available Send me all databases and electronic communications.
not_available Got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, I understand your concerns about Almeida, but for me, please, just give him a break.
not_available OK, Jack.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is a bullet wound.
not_available Probably a couple of hours old.
not_available <ix>The evacuation appears to be in full swing, with delays on all routes.</ix> Excuse me.
not_available <ix>The nuclear emergency team has just emerged from the plant.</ix> <ix>We can see them here on our sky cam.</ix> <ix>They seem to be going through some kind of decontamination process here.</ix> <ix>Their mission under these circumstances is probably just to try and limit</ix> 
not_available Behrooz.
not_available Uncle Naseem.
not_available You all right? Yeah, I think so.
not_available It's a disaster.
not_available Everyone's panicked about radiation poisoning.
not_available They all want iodide pills.
not_available Is that why you're here? No.
not_available I need pain medication.
not_available It's for my mother.
not_available She couldn't reach her doctor, so she wanted me to get it from you.
not_available What's wrong with her? 
not_available It's her back.
not_available She needs a prescription.
not_available I told you, she couldn't reach her doctor.
not_available I'll see what I can do, OK? Just have a seat.
not_available Yes? <ix>Navi, it's Naseem.</ix> 
not_available Hello.
not_available How are you? 
not_available <ix>Well.
not_available But Behrooz showed up at the hospital.</ix> <ix>He seems disturbed.</ix> 
not_available Is Dina there too? No.
not_available He says he needs pain medication for her, but he's acting very strange.
not_available I'm sorry you have to be involved in this.
not_available <ix>Involved in what? What's going on?</ix> 
not_available Behrooz may be taking drugs.
not_available <ix>It's been getting worse.</ix> 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Me too.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Keep Behrooz there until I can come for him.
not_available How long will you be? 
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available <ix>I'll do my best.</ix> Please, Naseem, don't let him leave until I get there.
not_available <ix>..
not_available congestion.
not_available The government is asking people to remain calm and exit</ix> Excuse me, Ms Raines.
not_available I'm Edgar Stiles.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We have a noncompliance problem.
not_available aren't going where they should, and another 25% don't know they're in the evac zone.
not_available However you need to do it, make sure it gets done.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's my mother.
not_available She lives near San Gabriel Island.
not_available She's in a wheelchair and missed her call to evacuate.
not_available Maybe the National Guard can get her.
not_available The area commander said he couldn't spare anyone.
not_available I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I can do.
not_available Here's his number.
not_available I thought that maybe if you called him Look, I hate asking for special treatment, I wouldn't normally ask, but she's my mother.
not_available I can't make any promises.
not_available Just promise me you'll try, OK? All right.
not_available I want you to give her something for the pain but make sure she stays lucid.
not_available Understand? Have you found out who she is yet? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She is Dina Araz.
not_available She emigrated to the US five years ago.
not_available Became a citizen two years ago.
not_available Married to Navi Araz, also a naturalized citizen.
not_available Owns an electronics store in Carson.
not_available They have one son, Behrooz, 17.
not_available Junior at the local high.
not_available No criminal records.
not_available Not on any watch lists? 
not_available Must have slipped under the radar.
not_available Send teams to the house and the store, see what we can find.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jack, it's Driscoll.
not_available <ix>Homeland Security</ix> 
not_available Hold on, Erin.
not_available I can barely hear you.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available After the attack this morning, Homeland Security has been archiving communications in the LA area.
not_available They pulled up a call that may explain how Dina got shot.
not_available Erin, I'm gonna put you on speaker phone.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available You're on.
not_available This conversation happened two hours ago, between the mother and the son.
not_available <ix>He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie.</ix> <ix>Behrooz, that's not possible.
not_available Your father would never want to hurt you.</ix> <ix>It's true.
not_available Tariq told me everything.</ix> <ix>He was lying.</ix> 
not_available <ix>No, he wasn't.</ix> <ix>Mom, I don't know what to do.
not_available You have to help me.</ix> <ix>Where are you now?</ix> <ix>I'm near the Metro link station on Lassen in Chatsworth.</ix> <ix>Are you using Tariq's car?</ix> <ix>Yes.</ix> 
not_available <ix>Hide it.
not_available I'll pick you up there in a halfhour.</ix> 
not_available <ix>Hurry.</ix> That's it.
not_available Let me know the minute you get something from her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We got our leverage.
not_available Lee.
not_available How long have you been planning this operation? Two years? Five years? Ten? All this planning for one day.
not_available You do realize, if all the reactors melt down hundreds of thousands of people will die.
not_available Every war has casualties.
not_available These people don't know about your war.
not_available These people are innocent.
not_available No one is innocent.
not_available You really believe that? As strongly as you believe in what you believe.
not_available So I won't waste your time or mine trying to explain something you can never understand.
not_available Maybe I understand more than you think.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available I know that something happened today to challenge your commitment to your war.
not_available You weren't willing to let your son become a casualty.
not_available That's why you were shot.
not_available Protecting him from his father.
not_available I understand that.
not_available I know what it's like to watch your child be threatened and feel helpless to do anything about it.
not_available Right now Behrooz is out there alone.
not_available And you and I know he's not going to last very long.
not_available His father will find him then kill him.
not_available There is another option.
not_available If you were to help us find the override device, we <ix>will</ix> protect your son.
not_available So he can spend the rest of his life in prison? No.
not_available So he can walk away from this immune from prosecution.
not_available How? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Araz, your son is a minor.
not_available He's 17 years old.
not_available I can get him a legal and binding pardon signed by the President of the United States.
not_available You don't have the authority to do this.
not_available I can reach the president.
not_available If you provide us with the information that allows us to find the override device in time, I am confident that the president will sign that pardon.
not_available This offer expires the second another reactor melts down.
not_available Do you understand me? You don't have a lot of time.
not_available I would think about this.
not_available Show me this document, and I'll help you find what you want.
not_available Can we rule out this boy's involvement with the terrorists? No.
not_available It's likely he knew of his parents' plans and that he helped them.
not_available You're asking me to grant clemency to a terrorist.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I don't think we have a choice.
not_available In all of my experience, I believe that we have to give in to her demands.
not_available Have you tried negotiating? 
not_available We don't have time.
not_available In two hours, five reactors will go critical unless we find the override device.
not_available <ix>She is our only link.</ix> I'm uncomfortable with this, but I trust your judgment.
not_available <ix>I'll release the letter.</ix> Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Make sure that document is nonbinding.
not_available Yes, I understand.
not_available I'll get back to you on the redeployment figures.
not_available Ms Raines? Did you talk to them? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm sorry, they can't get your mother.
not_available Why not? They're five miles off the highway.
not_available They know where she is.
not_available What's the problem? Thousands of people are stuck.
not_available It's taking the police and the National Guard to move them.
not_available So, who cares about one old woman? 
not_available They have to save the most number of lives.
not_available If my mother were rich or a politician, they'd find a way to save her.
not_available <ix>Communications.</ix> I need another switching station to that number.
not_available Do you need it? 
not_available <ix>No, I've got it logged.
not_available Hold the line.</ix> 
not_available Thank you.
not_available <ix>Go ahead, please.</ix> 
not_available Mom.
not_available Hello, honey.
not_available I can't get anyone out there to help you.
not_available <ix>I've done everything I could.
not_available I did.</ix> 
not_available I'm sure you did.
not_available <ix>It's OK.</ix> 
not_available It's not OK.
not_available The fallout's coming towards you.
not_available It's 15 miles away.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm watching it on the news.
not_available And I know what to do.
not_available There's nothing you can do.
not_available You can't stuff towels under the door.
not_available That's not what I'm talking about doing.
not_available What do you mean? They talked about radiation poisoning.
not_available That's not something I want to go through.
not_available Especially since there's only one way it can end.
not_available Honey, I want to end things on my terms, as opposed to all that pain and suffering.
not_available Mom It's the right thing to do.
not_available It's the only thing, you know that.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available You have been a wonderful son, Edgar.
not_available <ix>You've been a gift to me and your father.</ix> <ix>It's OK.
not_available I'm going to a better place, and</ix> I'll see you there.
not_available But not for a long time.
not_available You've got a lot ahead of you, great things.
not_available Maybe I can get someone to you.
not_available <ix>You've got a very important job to do there.</ix> A lot of people are counting on you.
not_available So I'm gonna hang up now.
not_available And I want you to know how very, very much I love you.
not_available Mom Ma? Edgar, where are you going? Edgar? 
not_available I have to get out of here.
not_available What? My mother lives next to the San Gabriel Island plant.
not_available She wasn't able to evacuate in time.
not_available We have five other reactors that are on the verge of melting down.
not_available I need you at your station.
not_available I don't care.
not_available You better start caring.
not_available You have a choice 
not_available obey orders or end up in a jail cell.
not_available You'll arrest me for saving my mother's life? If what you're saying is true, there's nothing you can do for your mother.
not_available But there are thousands of others who you can save.
not_available If your mother were here, what would make her proud? What would she want you do to? 
not_available She'd want me to help.
not_available Then don't you think you should? We're ready to go.
not_available We're just setting up a comm line.
not_available This is a pardon for your son signed by the president.
not_available This is acceptable.
not_available Where is he? He is at Lindauer Memorial Hospital.
not_available It's not far.
not_available Set up a perimeter around Lindauer Memorial.
not_available I want you to call him, tell him we're coming to pick him up.
not_available Give her the phone.
not_available We have to record the call.
not_available Hello? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Where are you? Waiting for Naseem.
not_available I don't know why he's taking so long.
not_available Don't worry about that now.
not_available Things have changed.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Listen carefully, Behrooz.
not_available Government agents found me.
not_available I'm with them now.
not_available Behrooz, they know everything.
not_available Behrooz, just a few more minutes, OK? But it's all right.
not_available Everything is going to be all right.
not_available I made a deal.
