not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Listen, l've been thinking a lot about what we talked about.
not_available l want to move back to Los Angeles with you.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available You're coming with us tonight? 
not_available If it's okay.
not_available Dad, l don't know what to say.
not_available I'm so happy.
not_available Victor, what are you doing here? How the hell did you find me? 
not_available l have information.
not_available l'm out.
not_available l don't work for the government anymore.
not_available Well, this you're gonna want to hear.
not_available There's a big hit going down.
not_available President Hassan at the U.N.
not_available He's getting taken out.
not_available When? 
not_available Today, before he can sign this thing with Taylor.
not_available My country agrees to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons.
not_available But our terms, Mr.
not_available President, were that the inspectors themselves wouId be American, not I.A.E.A.
not_available Î¤his is the message that you send to the rest of the world, 
not_available and then you wonder why we don't want to negotiate.
not_available Farhad.
not_available Please excuse my brother's passion.
not_available We need to resolve this issue before we can move forward.
not_available Find a way to give him what he wants.
not_available Î¤his man is a onceina
not_available lifetime leader.
not_available l'm, uh, stuck outside.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Î¤his woman poses no threat to me or the peace process.
not_available But you are married.
not_available I've done nothing reckless.
not_available Just reinstate Ms.
not_available Reed's clearance now.
not_available Unless you want to destroy everything that he's worked for, stay away from him.
not_available Î¤he brother revoked my clearance, but l had Hassan reinstate it.
not_available l know I'm behind schedule, but it'll get done.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Jack Bauer's on line three.
not_available He needs to talk to you.
not_available Bauer? I'm with an informant that I used to run who's claiming he's got intel on an assassination attempt on President Hassan.
not_available And what does Mr.
not_available Aruz want in return for his information? C.T.U.
not_available protection and immunity.
not_available l'll send a chopper to pick you up.
not_available Don't stop for anything.
not_available Keep going.
not_available You need to get him out of here.
not_available He's losing a lot of blood.
not_available Îastings wants to debrief you back at C.T.U.
not_available l'm not going back to C.Î¤.U.
not_available I delivered him.
not_available l'm done.
not_available No, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available I got a flight to catch.
not_available Î¤hat's it? 
not_available Get down! Tell me what you know.
not_available The hitter has someone on the inside, close to Hassan.
not_available The following takes place between 5:00 p.m.
not_available and 6:00 p.m.
not_available lt's done.
not_available Aruz is no longer a problem.
not_available But we don't know how much he told C.T.U.
not_available We need to accelerate the hit.
not_available Sir, Agent Ortiz is calling in.
not_available Put him through.
not_available I want everyone on this.
not_available Comm channel 235.
not_available All right, go ahead.
not_available This is Cole.
not_available Where are those E.M.T.s? Î¤hey should be there any second.
not_available How's the rest of your team? Îurley's injured.
not_available Torres and Johnson are dead.
not_available What happened? Look, those drones are supposed to have antiballistics.
not_available Why didn't they take out the missile? We're still running the diagnostic.
not_available This should've never happened.
not_available We should've had another team checking those buildings.
not_available We can discuss this at a later time, Agent Ortiz.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Bauer wants to talk with you.
not_available Put him on the phone.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Jack, l have Mr.
not_available Hastings on the line.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, Victor Aruz told me right before he died that the assassin is working with someone very close to President Hassan.
not_available Did you get a name? No, not before he died.
not_available You believe him? Normally, l wouldn't trust him as far as l could throw him.
not_available Îe was dying, sir.
not_available He had no reason to lie.
not_available All right.
not_available We're on it.
not_available l need you and Cole back here to debrief.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, l already gave one of your agents my statement.
not_available l need you back here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer? Fine.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Yes? l may have a lead on that insider.
not_available What do you mean? I just picked up an unauthorized access in one of the secure databases at the U.N.
not_available Îow do you know it's unauthorized? Because they bypassed the main access page and went through a back
not_available end server.
not_available The only reason to do that is if you're trying to cover your tracks.
not_available Stay on it.
not_available Let me know if you trace the source.
not_available And put O'Brian on this too, if you don't think she'll slow you down.
not_available No.
not_available She's doing much better, sir.
not_available l'm gonna call Î¤aylor's chief of staff.
not_available Î¤hey need to know this insider could be moving against Hassan.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you are under a great deal of pressure at home from an active opposition to this peace agreement.
not_available Î¤hey believe that by dismantling your nuclear weapons programs, you're surrendering to the West.
not_available How do you respond to those charges? Î¤he only thing we are surrendering is the cloud of antagonism and mistrust under which we have lived for far too long.
not_available This is a victory for my people.
not_available lt marks an end to isolation, and will bring economic stability to my country for the first time in decades.
not_available How do you propose economic stability when your people are so divided? 
not_available This is Weiss.
not_available Did you bring in Victor Aruz? 
not_available I'm afraid not, sir.
not_available There was an ambush and Aruz was killed, along with two of our men.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Before Aruz died, he shared some very troubling information.
not_available Now, he claimed that someone close to President Hassan has been conspiring with the assassin.
not_available Now, we don't have a name yet, but we are pursuing a lead.
not_available Tell me how
not_available And I'd better be impressed.
not_available We're tracing what might be an unauthorized entry into one of the U.N.
not_available servers.
not_available And you think this is the person we're looking for? 
not_available Well, we're optimistic.
not_available Yeah, you better hope that optimism translates into results.
not_available Sir, until we locate the insider, you might want to consider locking down President Hassan and postponing this conference.
not_available That is not an option, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available We are close to signing one of the most important treaties in the history of this country.
not_available You were put in charge of C.Î¤.U.
not_available because you said you could get the job done
not_available "Lean, mean and fast." That's what you said.
not_available President Î¤aylor expects you to deliver on those words.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll take this to the president.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available President Hassan and l stilI have a great deal of work to do, so we're gonna wrap this up, but I would like to say that the president and l chose the United Nations as the venue for these talks because the problems facing the Middle East have become a world concern.
not_available And President Hassan and l are confident that this agreement will lay the foundation for a lasting peace in the region.
not_available And we thank you for your time.
not_available Madam President, one more question
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'll see you after the break.
not_available l look forward to resuming it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Madam President, I just spoke with C.T.U.
not_available Î¤here's been a development regarding the threat to Hassan.
not_available We need to speak in private.
not_available That is really wonderful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll join you later.
not_available No, security access.
not_available Hello.
not_available You were terrific.
not_available lt's not about me.
not_available lt's the message that's important.
not_available Ijust hope no one could see how nervous I was.
not_available Well, you hid it well.
not_available Are you here? Yes, on my way up.
not_available Do you still have time to see me? l've been looking forward to it all day.
not_available When? 
not_available What did you say? 
not_available When can I see you? l've got a half an hour before the next session begins.
not_available You meet me now, and we'll go up to my private office together.
not_available l'll tell my staff that you requested an interview.
not_available Perfect.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available l just ran a systems check on the drone.
not_available Sensors did pick up the missile, but the drone didn't fire.
not_available Why not? I won't know until I have a chance to take it apart.
not_available Mr.
not_available Îastings, l don't want to sound like l'm covering my own ass, but I did tell you that the antimissile system had not been tested in an urban environment.
not_available l know what you said, Arlo.
not_available You just find out what went wrong, and you get back to me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Îastings, I was right.
not_available Someone hacked into the U.N.
not_available database.
not_available They downloaded security protocols, schematics to the U.N.
not_available and Hassan's personal itinerary.
not_available l was able to trace an l.P.
not_available address.
not_available Did you get a name? Chloe's into the computer's registry.
not_available She should have it by now.
not_available Almost there.
not_available Come on, Chloe.
not_available Saying that isn't gonna make it happen any faster.
not_available There.
not_available The computer's owner is listed as Meredith Michelle Reed.
not_available She's a reporter working forthe New York Courier.
not_available She's doing a profile on Hassan.
not_available Applied for a security clearance at the U.N.
not_available Did she get it? My God.
not_available What? She's there now.
not_available U.N.
not_available Security logged her in 
not_available She's at the press conference.
not_available Put me through to U.N.
not_available Security.
not_available You're clear.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available This is Brian Hastings, director of C.T.U.
not_available We have a possible on
not_available site threat to President Hassan.
not_available Do you have an l.D.? 
not_available Her name is Meredith Reed.
not_available She has a press security clearance.
not_available We're sending a photograph to your P.D.A.
not_available We just got a call about a threat to President Hassan.
not_available The U.N.
not_available gave us access to their surveillance feed.
not_available Facial recognition software is sweeping the area now.
not_available Got a match.
not_available Northeast corner, moving toward Hassan.
not_available Located the suspect.
not_available She's 1 0 yards from Hassan.
not_available East side of the press section.
not_available Green top, black skirt, blackjacket.
not_available There she is.
not_available Go.
not_available Go, go, go, go, go.
not_available Everybody, move back.
not_available What are you doing? Move back! 
not_available l'm a reporter.
not_available I have clearance.
not_available Move back! 
not_available Meredith? l'm a journalist.
not_available l'm a journalist.
not_available I have credentials.
not_available We got a call from C.Î¤.U.
not_available about a threat to your life.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? Come on.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available Let us through here.
not_available The suspect's name is Meredith Reed.
not_available She's a journalist profiling Hassan.
not_available Now, our operating theory is that she's been using her access to gain security intel, which she's been feeding to the assassin.
not_available Ms.
not_available Reed is being transported back here right now.
not_available My hope is that she will give us the name of the assassin so that we can put an end to this threat.
not_available Refer to your digital briefing packets for specifics.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, l just received a preliminary report 
not_available from the team sweeping Ms.
not_available Reed's apartment.
not_available And? They recovered the files stolen from the U.N.
not_available database off her laptop.
not_available It looks like we found our insider.
not_available They also found a large file that couldn't be opened.
not_available lt's been encrypted with intelligence
not_available grade software.
not_available I want you to find out what's inside that file.
not_available lt's on its way over as we speak.
not_available Good.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Does anyone think this happened a little too fast and a little too easily? Things do happen a little faster in here than what you're used to.
not_available l know.
not_available You keep reminding me.
not_available I might not be up to speed on all your software, but I know if someone doesn't want to be found, they don't leave behind code fragments that could lead to an I.P.
not_available address.
not_available Unless, of course, they were in a hurry and they had to improvise.
not_available Maybe, but then why would you go through all that trouble, and leave a huge red flag for everyone to find? What is your point? 
not_available lt's like someone wanted us to find her.
not_available l just think we should continue to vet this until we're sure that we have the right person.
not_available We are vetting this from every angle.
not_available l appreciate your concerns.
not_available We'll keep them in mind.
not_available ln other words, "Shut up, Chloe." 
not_available That's not what he said.
not_available Well, that's what l heard.
not_available All right, you made your point.
not_available Chloe, thanks.
not_available All right, one last thing.
not_available Ms.
not_available Reed has spent a lot of time on assignment in the Middle East.
not_available l want to cross
not_available check all of her movements with those of known terrorist groups.
not_available Let's get moving.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Jack Bauer should be here any second.
not_available l want you to handle his debrief.
not_available You're taking me off the floor? l think you'll be better utilized debriefing Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Go set up.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available l'm walking in now.
not_available Give me the home phone numbers for Torres and Johnson.
not_available Nobody speaks to their wives before me.
not_available Cole, before you make your report, l want you to keep something in mind.
not_available What's that? l know you asked for more boots on the ground, but what happened, happened.
not_available There's nothing we can do about that.
not_available You put your opinion on record, it's going to flag an internal review from Division.
not_available It's only going to hurt us moving forward.
not_available Clear.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, Brian Hastings.
not_available Sorry about the loss of your men.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You'll be glad to know the lead you got from VictorAruz panned out.
not_available You telling me that you've already found the insider? Îer name is Meredith Reed.
not_available She's a journalist who was covering the peace conference.
not_available She was stealing files off the U.N.
not_available servers.
not_available Now, we wouldn't have gotten this far without your help.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, Chloe O'Brian's waiting to debrief you.
not_available Shouldn't take long.
not_available l just need to make a phone call first.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We need to be on the same page here.
not_available l think you can understand that.
not_available Sir, you're asking me to lie on the record.
not_available l'm asking you to exercise some discretion.
not_available Î¤here's an assassin out there.
not_available We don't need people second
not_available guessing how we do things.
not_available Well, maybe you'd like to debrief for me.
not_available All right, let's get you in here.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, sweetheart, it's me.
not_available Hey, where are you? 
not_available C.T.U.
not_available C.T.U.? Does this have anything to do with what's going on at the U.N.? Yes, but I promise l won't be long.
not_available l just need to give them a statement, and I'm going to have to meet you at the airport.
not_available Dad, what's going on? lt's complicated.
not_available l'lI expIain when I see you.
not_available Okay, but we're coming there to pick you up.
not_available Sweetheart, you don't need to do that.
not_available I want to.
not_available It's on the way.
not_available Okay, I'll have Chloe get you a security pass.
not_available l'll see you soon.
not_available Bye.
not_available Who was that? My father.
not_available Everything all right? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Everyone said you were too young and inexperienced to head up Field Ops, but I believed you could do thejob.
not_available Now, I need you to show the same faith in me that I showed in you.
not_available Keep our little dispute off the record.
not_available Where's Chloe? She's upstairs.
not_available First room to the right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Think about what l said.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available l'm sorry, but we gotta do this kind of quick.
not_available l guess you heard about the reporter they arrested.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, l think we might have the wrong person.
not_available Meredith Reed could be innocent.
not_available Hastings said they found evidence on her computer.
not_available l know, but I think those files may have been planted.
not_available Look, l've been scanning through the traffic cam footage from outside Meredith Reed's apartment building.
not_available Five minutes before the intrusion into the U.N.
not_available server, this man was going into the service entrance of the building.
not_available Ten minutes later, he left.
not_available What if he went into her apartment and used her laptop to break into the servers? Sounds a littIe thin.
not_available Don't you think we found her kind of fast, and that it was a little too easy? Why are you showing me this? Why don't you just take it to Hastings? Îastings doesn't think I know what I'm doing.
not_available Îe won't listen to me.
not_available He might listen to you.
not_available Chloe, I'm here for my debrief.
not_available Kim's on her way.
not_available l'm leaving on a plane to Los Angeles with my family in an hour.
not_available l'm just asking you to talk to him.
not_available It'll take 1 0 minutes.
not_available lf the assassin framed Reed to create a diversion, that means we have the wrong person in custody, that he still has someone inside Hassan's delegation.
not_available l'm sorry, Chloe.
not_available It's not my problem.
not_available Please, let's just continue with the debrief.
not_available nor will they confirm any fatalities.
not_available There is no evidence at this time to support the theory that the two incidents are related.
not_available We're still waiting for an official statement as to why this reporter was arrested.
not_available At this time we can confirm that her name is Meredith Reed.
not_available So glad you're all right.
not_available l can't believe this happened.
not_available has yet to comment.
not_available In other news, the helicopter explosionâ" 
not_available It's hard to believe, Kayla.
not_available l just don't understand how this woman got so close to you.
not_available She's a journalist.
not_available She had security clearance.
not_available Do all reporters get these clearances? No.
not_available But she's writing an article on me.
not_available You know that, Dalia.
not_available She was given special access.
not_available You gave her that access? Yes, l did.
not_available l did it.
not_available Î¤his article was important for me.
not_available l wanted to get my message across to the American public.
not_available That's the only reason? 
not_available Yes, that's the only reason.
not_available What other reason? Ifyou have something to say, then say it.
not_available You should never have let her into our lives.
not_available You put us all in danger.
not_available Please stop.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available l just spoke to the U.N.
not_available press director.
not_available We're going to make a public statement.
not_available Make sure l see it first.
not_available conclusion of the press conference, Hassan put to rest any doubts that these negotiations
not_available Omar, may I speak with you alone? economic instability for his country.
not_available "distrust, under which we have lived for far too long." He went on to say the treaty will bring economic
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Î¤hey've taken Meredith Reed to C.T.U.
not_available l can't believe she's part of this.
not_available What reason could she have to help someone kill me? What reason does any American have to do anything? Money.
not_available They found incriminating files on her computer, Omar.
not_available Whether you want to believe it or not, she is guilty.
not_available And she's going to talk.
not_available I need to know what she's going to tell them about your relationship.
not_available Be honest with me.
not_available Tell me everything.
not_available lt started three months ago in B'Dar.
not_available We met for an interview in her hotel room.
not_available Dalia and I had been fighting that day.
not_available She used you, Omar.
not_available She almost cost you your life.
not_available And if this affair becomes public, it will destroy your credibiIity and everything that you've worked for.
not_available l don't need you to tell me the consequences.
not_available lf she talks to the Americans, you must deny it.
not_available lt never happened.
not_available Look, Omar, l know you're thinking you must do the honorable thing and confess the truth.
not_available Î¤hat would be a terrible mistake.
not_available l need to be with my famiIy.
not_available Yes? I just spoke with my brother.
not_available l told him to deny the affair.
not_available What did he say? He's going to consider it.
not_available Press him harder.
not_available Î¤he reporter's cIaims need to be discredited.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available needs to continue to think she's my contact on the inside.
not_available l understand.
not_available We only need another hour.
not_available l'll be ready to move by then.
not_available Arlo.
not_available Hey.
not_available l need your help decrypting that file they found on Reed's computer.
not_available l broke off a section.
not_available It should be on your screen.
not_available What filter do you want me to run it through? 
not_available Esquire Nine.
not_available No problem.
not_available And, Arlo? You can stop staring at my breasts now.
not_available So when are you going to drop Captain America, find yourself a real man? l'm still thinking about it.
not_available Well, don't take too long.
not_available I might lose interest.
not_available Let me know what you find.
not_available Dana Walsh.
not_available Îello? Dana Walsh.
not_available I like that.
not_available You picked a good name for yourself.
not_available That's actually better than the one your mama picked for you.
not_available Whoever this is, I told you to stop calling me.
not_available Yeah, l know what you told me, Jenny.
not_available My name is not Jenny.
not_available You must be mistaking me for someone else.
not_available Oh, am I? Yes.
not_available That's funny, 'cause you sound a Iot like this girl I used to know from Rock Springs named Jenny Scott.
not_available She was a wild thing, man.
not_available We used to do some crazy stuff.
not_available Î¤he next time you caIl me, I promise you I will contact the police.
not_available Oh
not_available Yeah? You know, l got a better idea.
not_available Let's contact them right now.
not_available l'm hanging up now.
not_available Hey, don't hang up this phone.
not_available l'm warning you, Jenny, do not
not_available Hey.
not_available Whoa.
not_available l was just gonna look for you.
not_available l'm so glad that you're okay.
not_available l'm sorry that I have been so distant lately.
not_available lt's just, l don't ever want to lose you.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Why am l here? This is a mistake.
not_available Damn it, who's in charge here? Tell Mr.
not_available Weiss there's nothing yet, but I'll call him as soon as we have news.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Brian Hastings, director of C.T.U.
not_available Look, l don't know who the hell you people think you are, but I want an attorney, and I demand to know what l'm being charged with.
not_available We found the files, Ms.
not_available Reed.
not_available What files? On your computer in your apartment.
not_available You searched my apartment? We found six documents on your laptop that were stolen from the U.N.
not_available servers.
not_available What documents? Relating to the security arrangements for the peace conference.
not_available You're here because we know that you're part of a plan to assassinate President Hassan.
not_available Wait.
not_available What? Please don't waste my time.
not_available The evidence against you is clear
not_available cut.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available If there are files on my computer, then someone put them there.
not_available Now, you listen to me.
not_available I'm giving you a chance to help yourself by telling us what you know.
not_available l need the name of the assassin, how to find them, and we talk about you avoiding the death penalty.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available You've got the wrong person.
not_available Take her to Interrogation.
not_available Full biometric package.
not_available l'll be there shortly.
not_available This way, ma'am.
not_available Mr.
not_available Îastings? You're done with your debrief? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can l talk to you? 
not_available Not a good time, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Meredith Reed might be telling you the truth.
not_available ls this coming from O'Brian? I told her to drop this.
not_available Yeah, well, she didn't.
not_available She found this.
not_available Î¤hey were taken from traffic cams near Ms.
not_available Reed's apartment.
not_available Check out the time stamps.
not_available It shows this man entering the building through the service entrance almost five minutes before the intrusion into the U.N.
not_available servers.
not_available It shows him leaving the building almost immediately after.
not_available So? 
not_available Chloe talked to the building manager.
not_available There was no scheduled maintenance today, no packages delivered.
not_available And this is your evidence? l'm looking at an apartment building, where dozens of people live, 
not_available coming and going all day long.
not_available Look, I understand.
not_available All l'm saying is that it is possible that someone broke into the apartment and used her computer to steal the documents.
not_available All you need to do is send a couple agents to check it out.
not_available I just don't see it.
not_available And I can't waste valuable resources because Chloe O'Brian has a theory.
not_available Chloe and l have worked together for a long time.
not_available And trust me, she's someone you might want to listen to.
not_available She's very good at what she does.
not_available And if she's right, the assassin's got you looking in the wrong place, and you will get bit.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I have a suspect in hand with a file she felt damning enough to encrypt.
not_available Î¤hat's where I'm going to focus my resources.
not_available Now, if you will excuse me.
not_available l hate this pIace.
not_available He's not gonna help, is he? We have to follow this lead.
not_available lf they have the wrong person
not_available Chloe, I did what you asked.
not_available I talked to Hastings.
not_available lf he doesn't want to listen that's his mistake, but it's not my problem.
not_available To be honest with you, it's not yours either.
not_available What about the threat against Hassan? What about the peace conference? Doesn't any of that matter to you? What if Hastings knows something you don't? Look, l'm sorry.
not_available Kim's waiting for me outside.
not_available l've got to go.
not_available Jack.
not_available You've come to me for help many times, and I've never let you down.
not_available You've asked me to do crazy things, and l've always taken your side.
not_available Please.
not_available Help me.
not_available l can't do this by myself.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available l
not_available l can't.
not_available Not this time.
not_available Not me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Look what I made.
not_available Let me see.
not_available That's Daddy, that's Mommy and that's me and that's you.
not_available See? 
not_available That's you, Grandpa.
not_available It's beautiful, sweetheart.
not_available Dad, we need to taIk.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here, honey.
not_available Why don't you get Daddy to put you in the car seat? We're ready to go.
not_available What's wrong? I spoke to Chloe.
not_available She told me what's happening.
not_available Chloe called you? No, l called her because you wouldn't tell me what was going on, so l decided to find out for myself.
not_available l know about the threat to the peace conference, that C.Î¤.U.
not_available might have the wrong suspect.
not_available What's happening? Chloe had me make her case to the head of C.T.U.
not_available Îe wasn't convinced, and he thinks he's got the right person.
not_available But if he's wrong, then there's still someone inside the U.N.
not_available who's working with this assassin? That's what Chloe thinks.
not_available What do you think? l think it's not my problem.
not_available Dad.
not_available What? l don't believe you.
not_available l've never known you to walk away from something like this.
not_available lf you have to stay, it's all right.
not_available You're not letting me down.
not_available I understand.
not_available Sweetheart, I want to go with you.
not_available I know you do.
not_available And there's nothing I want more than for you to come with us.
not_available l have been waiting so long for this day.
not_available We both have.
not_available But ifsomething terrible happens, and you could have done something to stop it, I don't think you'd be able to live with yourself.
not_available Dad, it's okay.
not_available You can go.
not_available As soon as l'm finished here, I will get on a plane and l will be in Los Angeles.
not_available I promise.
not_available Just be careful, please.
not_available Come here.
not_available l wilI.
not_available I should tell Î¤eri.
not_available No, no.
not_available Let me do it.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go on.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah, l'm fine, but we should go.
not_available Sweetie, Grandpa has some work to do.
not_available He can't fly with us, but he'll come as soon as he can.
not_available But he said he was coming today.
not_available No, not today.
not_available But soon, okay? 
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Jack
not_available We need to find out where your suspect went after he left Miss Reed's apartment.
not_available Start checking traffic cams.
not_available Okay.
not_available l need to get a baseline on her respiratory, cardio and dermal response, so make her comfortable.
not_available Start off with a few softball questions.
not_available Miss Reed, l think we need a fresh start.
not_available Now, you claim those files were pIanted on your computer.
not_available Fine.
not_available l'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, but you need to meet me halfway
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Help me understand your side of the story.
not_available Fair enough? So, when was the first time you met President Hassan? 
not_available About six months ago at a conference of oil ministers.
not_available l requested an interview, and he agreed.
not_available We met in his hotel lobby twice.
not_available Îour
not_available Hour and a half, at the most.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available l want to thank you for wanting to continue our negotiations.
not_available l know it's a risk.
not_available Madam President, you are no stranger to making personal sacrifices for your beliefs.
not_available lf the price for peace is my life, so be it.
not_available Now, we are doing everything in our power to make sure that that doesn't happen.
not_available We've tightened security measures here, and C.Î¤.U.'s top priority is to find the peopIe who are targeting you.
not_available l appreciate that.
not_available Madam President, the woman you took into custody
not_available The reporter.
not_available Meredith Reed.
not_available Yes.
not_available Is C.T.U.
not_available certain that she is part of this plot? Well, from what I understand, the evidence against her 
not_available is quite incriminating.
not_available Have they found out her reasons? Well, Miss Reed is being questioned as we speak.
not_available l'll make sure whatever information we get from her will be shared with your people as soon as possible.
not_available Jack, I've searched through all the traffic cams within a five
not_available block radius of Meredith Reed's apartment.
not_available There's no sign of where the suspect went.
not_available Can you check other sources? C.T.U.
not_available has drones all over the city.
not_available l could look through their archives and see if they picked anything up.
not_available Where are they? The archives are in Arlo's station.
not_available I don't have the clearance.
not_available Can you hack in? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do it.
not_available l'm glad you're here.
not_available Thanks for staying.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This will all be over soon, and you can get to California.
not_available Okay.
not_available l'm in.
not_available One of the drones picked him up leaving Reed's apartment.
not_available Play it forward.
not_available Well, he hailed a cab when he left.
not_available Can you track the cab? 
not_available No.
not_available lt's beyond the drone's search grid.
not_available Okay, back it up.
not_available Stop.
not_available Move in closer.
not_available Î¤here.
not_available Î¤hat's what I want to see.
not_available Closer.
not_available See the medallion? Call the cab company.
not_available Find out where it went.
not_available l'm not tracking this guy without a weapon.
not_available Î¤he armory's on Level "C." l have to input your palm print through the hand scanner.
not_available Erase this as soon as I'm clear.
not_available I'll call you as soon as I'm on the road.
not_available Îello? 
not_available Ruth, it's me.
not_available Jenny? I need to talk to you.
not_available Are you alone? Uh, just my kid.
not_available What's going on? Haven't heard from you since Christmas.
not_available Kevin Wade found me.
not_available Îe's been calling me at work the last two days.
not_available Damn it, Ruth.
not_available You told him how to find me? 
not_available No, l didn't.
not_available You're the only one who knows the truth
not_available Î¤he only one who knows where l am.
not_available l swear, I never talked to Kevin.
not_available I didn't even know he was out ofjail.
not_available Î¤hen how did he find me? I don't know.
not_available Okay.
not_available And what does he want anyway? Why is he calling you? Îe didn't say, but he's threatening to tell everyone the truth about me.
not_available lt'll destroy my career.
not_available l'm about to get married, Ruth, to a really great guy.
not_available Well, there's gotta be something you can do.
not_available You can't let this son of a bitch just ruin your life.
not_available l don't know what to do.
not_available l'm afraid I'm gonna lose everything.
not_available l gotta go.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Where you been? l've been trying to find you.
not_available Did you decrypt the file? No.
not_available I'm still working on it.
not_available l found something weird though.
not_available Someone hacked into my station, and it came from inside C.T.U.
not_available What were they doing? Scanning the drone archives.
not_available Track it down.
not_available See who it was.
not_available And when you were in B'Dar profiling President Hassan, were you ever approached by anyone who was hostile to his regime? No.
not_available No one paid you? No.
not_available Pressured you into cooperating? l said no.
not_available So all you did was interview President Hassan.
not_available That's it? Yes, that's all.
not_available Îer answer prompted a Level Five autonomic reaction.
not_available You're lying, Ms.
not_available Reed.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I
not_available Î¤ell me what really happened in B'Dar.
not_available How is it connected to the assassination plot? l don't have anything to do with any plan to assassinate President Hassan.
not_available My God, why would l? 
not_available Your reasons are irrelevant.
not_available All l care about is stopping the assassin.
not_available So do l.
not_available So if someone really is trying to kill Hassan, you need to stop wasting your time on me, and find them.
not_available Îey, Mike, what's going on? 
not_available Maggie, I
not_available I'm so sorry for dropping by without calling first.
not_available Mind if I come in? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Did, uh, Jim leave for work yet? No.
not_available Just got out of the shower.
not_available Oh, good
not_available 'Cause l need to ask him something before he leaves.
not_available Kind of a favor.
not_available Okay.
not_available Îey, babe? 
not_available Yeah? Mike Farmer's here.
not_available Says he needs to talk to you.
not_available Mikey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing here? You're not on shift till tomorrow.
not_available Yeah, that's what l wanted to talk to you about.
not_available All right, I'll be right down.
not_available All right, take your time.
not_available Want coffee? Sure.
not_available Come on.
not_available during President Taylor's press conference earlier this afternoon.
not_available I wouldn't want to speculate at this time, Bob, but as you know, President Taylor's peace negotiations with I.R.K.
not_available President Omar Hassan are highly controversial
not_available Sit down.
not_available Thanks.
not_available political dissent both in the United States and
not_available Did you hear anything more about what happened at that press conference? No.
not_available Only what they're saying on TV.
not_available l gotta tell you, I'm so proud of you and Jim and all those boys down at the precinct.
not_available l mean, you're gonna be part of history.
not_available Nah, l don't know.
not_available We're just directing traffic, really.
not_available You're on the U.N.
not_available security detail.
not_available Î¤hat's more than directing traffic.
not_available Hell, you might even get on TV.
not_available Wow, yeah, wouldn't that be something.
not_available Yeah, it would.
not_available Right.
not_available l need to speak with Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Uh, we're in session.
not_available It's important.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available l have Dana Walsh out here.
not_available She says it's important.
not_available You're not leaving this room until you tell me the truth, no matter how long it takes.
not_available l'm sorry to bother you, sir, but l didn't think that this could wait.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Come on.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available l spoke with the dispatcher at the cab company.
not_available Îis driver logged the drop
not_available off at West 23rd Street at the northwest corner of Broadway in Queens.
not_available Anything more specific? An apartment number, an address? Not from the dispatcher, but I'll keep sifting through the aerial footage.
not_available Okay.
not_available Broadway and West 23rd.
not_available l'll call you when I get there.
not_available Hands in the air.
not_available Now! Against the wall.
not_available Don't move.
not_available He had this, sir.
not_available We'll take it from here.
not_available Stand down.
not_available l told you to leave this alone.
not_available Chloe tracked the man in the surveillance photo to a second location.
not_available We didn't think you'd follow through with an investigation.
not_available So you had no choice except to steal weapons from the armory.
not_available Would you have followed through with an investigation if l'd asked? l'm not debating this anymore.
not_available You shut down a lead before you could even assess whether it was good or bad.
not_available Take him to detention.
not_available Take him! 
not_available Let's go.
not_available l'm sure President Î¤aylor's gonna be very interested to find out what happened to my informant when I tried to deliver him to you.
not_available Excuse me? Cole tried to secure that landing zone with more men, but instead you sent a drone, which failed to detect the missile that killed my informant and two of your men.
not_available Cole hasn't said anything about it.
not_available And neither will l, as long as you let me pursue this.
not_available So now you're blackmailing me? You forced my hand.
not_available Now l'm forcing yours.
not_available You don't want to be doing this, Bauer.
not_available No, l don't.
not_available l wanna be on a plane to Los Angeles with my family, but you're not giving me another choice.
not_available You want to waste your time chasing ghosts? Knock yourself out.
not_available l've got to stop an assassination plot.
not_available Give him the bag.
not_available l need Chloe to run ops.
not_available Fine.
not_available She's alI yours.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Anything to what he's talking about? The only viable lead is sitting in our interrogation room, and she's the only way we're going to get to the assassin.
not_available What's going on, Mikey? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Listen, um, something came up.
not_available l can't make my shift tomorrow, so l was wondering if we could swap.
not_available Oh, l'd be happy to, except Maggie and me have a meeting with Sean's teacher tomorrow.
not_available She said he's acting out in cIass, but I don't believe it.
not_available Jim keeps making excuses for him, but if he needs help, I want to give it to him.
not_available Where is he? He's at his grandma's tonight.
not_available l'm not making excuses.
not_available So, what are you saying? You can't trade shifts with me? This is kind of important, so I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available Whoa, Mikey.
not_available What
not_available Maggie, I want you to sit down.
not_available Jim, there's a roll of tape in my bag.
not_available Î¤ear off a strip and put it over Maggie's mouth.
not_available Do it.
not_available l'm sorry, baby.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Now, pick up the phone.
not_available Call Captain Ravello.
not_available Tell him you're sick and I'm filling in for you.
not_available Now, listen, you son of a bitch, there's no way
not_available Oh! Oh, what's the matter with you? What are you doing? Next time I won't miss the bone.
not_available Make the call.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, I'll call.
not_available Please, just leave my wife alone, all right?
