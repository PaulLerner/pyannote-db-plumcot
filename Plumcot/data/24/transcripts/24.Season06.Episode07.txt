not_available I need Karen Hayes to go away.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available I need the president to sign off on my proposals.
not_available She has gone from being an irritant to an obstacle.
not_available I wanna talk about your husband's incompetence and your covering it up.
not_available I did nothing illegal or incorrect.
not_available Your resignation within the hour.
not_available Mr President, I am tendering my resignation.
not_available Is there anything I can do to change your mind? No, sir.
not_available There is not.
not_available Walid has earned their trust.
not_available These men know something about the bombs that we don't.
not_available These guys aren't connected to anyone.
not_available They're not terrorists.
not_available I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.
not_available You spied on us? You're worse than they are! Son of a bitch! A nuclear bomb just went off, like, 25 miles from here.
not_available When I'm done with this deal, I may just buy you a small country.
not_available Have you found an engineer? 
not_available I told you I would.
not_available Now I will.
not_available It's just taking longer.
not_available Start talking, Gray.
not_available I made a mess.
not_available Dad's trying to clean it up.
not_available What happened? I hired McCarthy to oversee the job.
not_available The nukes the terrorists are in possession of, including the one detonated in Valencia, were supplied by McCarthy and stolen from you? Yes.
not_available Heading to McCarthy's office in Simi Valley.
not_available Teams are standing by.
not_available Stop.
not_available He's my son.
not_available What are you doing here, Jack? 
not_available I know you're covering up.
not_available Gray told me.
not_available McCarthy's not here.
not_available Hey! What are you doing? Put the gun down.
not_available You work for me.
not_available No, Dad, he doesn't.
not_available You don't think I'd let you loose without keeping an eye on you? This is insane.
not_available I am at the edge of the safe zone and behind me is the nuclear blast.
not_available Emergency teams are overwhelmed by the number of injured in what President Palmer has confirmed was a tactical nuclear weapon detonated two hours ago in this Valencia neighbourhood north of Los Angeles.
not_available More than 12,000 people are estimated to have perished in the blast.
not_available LAPD is spread thin but, on an encouraging note, we've heard that they are I just heard about Karen's resignation.
not_available I'm sorry for the loss.
not_available Are you really sorry? Because your worry seems somewhat hollow to me.
not_available Karen and I have butted heads the last few weeks.
not_available Nevertheless, I respected her as an adversary.
not_available She never gave me a reason why she resigned, but there was something she wasn't telling me.
not_available This may have something to do with it.
not_available This is the executive order I presented this morning.
not_available Karen found out I was going to resubmit it to you.
not_available So she quit? That makes absolutely no sense to me, Tom.
not_available She's never been afraid of a fight.
not_available Maybe she finally realised her arguments are invalid and that this is the only possible response to the danger we're facing.
not_available Why would I sign off on something I rejected six hours ago? Because six hours ago we didn't know Fayed had nukes.
not_available Even so, you're talking about suspending habeas corpus, expanding the length and broadening the criteria for those detention centres.
not_available Those actions would constitute an abuse of executive power.
not_available Those actions will degrade Fayed's network, limiting his ability to make use of these remaining nuclear weapons.
not_available Sir, Fayed's sole intention here is the destruction of our country, its infrastructure, social order, entire way of life.
not_available He has the will and means to make good on that threat.
not_available Have you stopped to think that I would be forcing the people who elected me to give up their rights that define the essence of this country? Sir, if one more nuke goes off, it will have been Fayed who has redefined our country.
not_available Pass this out to the cabinet.
not_available We'll convene in 30 minutes.
not_available You're doing the right thing, Mr President.
not_available Reed.
not_available Call the cabinet in for a session.
not_available We are ramping up.
not_available Is the president signing off on this? He wouldn't convene the cabinet unless he was.
not_available Good work, Reed.
not_available I'm just doing what needs to be done.
not_available Getting rid of Karen was unpleasant but she left us no choice.
not_available Hayes.
not_available Sorry I'm late with the briefing.
not_available We're tracking Fayed through McCarthy.
not_available Bill.
not_available I've just had to resign.
not_available Resign? What are you taking about? I can't get into it now, but I've asked to be reassigned to CTU as an on
not_available site liaison.
not_available Karen, you can't leave the president today.
not_available Bill, do you think that I would do this if I had any other choice? 
not_available Lennox had something to do with this.
not_available I cannot talk about this right now.
not_available I will see you in a few hours, OK? Karen Mr Buchanan? What is it, Chloe? 
not_available Jack's not answering his cell phone.
not_available Try his backup teams.
not_available I tried.
not_available They're not answering either.
not_available Maybe he had them all go dark.
not_available He wouldn't do that without telling us first.
not_available Send in a support unit.
not_available Fine.
not_available And keep trying Jack.
not_available All right.
not_available Where do you want us to meet? 
not_available I'll be here an hour dumping hard drives.
not_available We'll meet you back at the house.
not_available Make sure it goes according to plan.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's my job to worry.
not_available It was all for you, Jack.
not_available Everything I worked for, everything I built.
not_available It was all for you.
not_available After you left, I tried to convince myself that Graem was capable of heading the family, protecting the company.
not_available I guess on some level I always knew the truth about him.
not_available I just wasn't willing to admit it to myself.
not_available I don't know what you want me to say.
not_available I want you to understand.
not_available After you left, Graem was all I had.
not_available He pushed you away, didn't he? I'm really sorry.
not_available Get out.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't do this, Irv.
not_available Whatever Graem's paying you, I'll double it.
not_available Just keep it moving.
not_available Get down on your knees, both of you.
not_available No.
not_available You son of a bitch, at least have the guts to look me in the eye.
not_available I needed to question him.
not_available They were gonna kill us, Jack! Search his pockets for the keys.
not_available Dammit! Buchanan.
not_available Bill, it's Jack.
not_available We couldn't reach you.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I'm fine but the backup team has been killed.
not_available Have you found McCarthy? 
not_available I know how to get to him.
not_available How? 
not_available My brother.
not_available You said your brother wasn't involved.
not_available He lied to me.
not_available He didn't tell us everything.
not_available Based on what? He tried to have me and my dad killed.
not_available I need you to set up a perimeter around his house.
not_available I'll send a field team right away.
not_available Have them do an immediate recon.
not_available I want Burke standing by with an interrogation kit.
not_available Jack.
not_available What? McCarthy is our only lead to Fayed.
not_available We need to find Fayed before he arms the nukes.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I make contact with the field teams.
not_available We need to go.
not_available Rita? Where do you think you're going? 
not_available There's a candy machine in the lobby.
not_available We'll be leaving soon.
not_available You said that an hour ago.
not_available Sit down, Rita.
not_available Yes? Good news.
not_available I've found someone to program the trigger codes for your bombs.
not_available Who? 
not_available I just sent you his profile.
not_available Employment record, education, the whole CV.
not_available You should have it on your screen.
not_available I'm looking at it now.
not_available He seems qualified.
not_available He'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly.
not_available He'll need to be coerced.
not_available OK.
not_available When will you have him? 
not_available Within the hour.
not_available Call me when you do.
not_available Mr Buchanan, you need to listen to this.
not_available What? NSA intercepted a stream of chatter.
not_available Part of it's an audio recording.
not_available They've identified one of the voices as belonging to Fayed.
not_available I've found someone to program the trigger codes on your bombs.
not_available Who? 
not_available I just sent you his profile.
not_available Employment record, education, the whole CV.
not_available It should be on your screen.
not_available I'm looking at it now.
not_available He seems qualified.
not_available He'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly.
not_available He'll need to be coerced.
not_available OK.
not_available When will you have him? 
not_available Within the hour.
not_available The second voice matches the sample from McCarthy's voicemail.
not_available They lost Numair in the explosion, so McCarthy found someone to arm the nukes.
not_available Have audio forensics scan for background artefacts that could give us a location.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I got Morris working on something.
not_available We also found an image file inside the data stream.
not_available It might be a photo of the engineer.
not_available This it? 
not_available It got all corrupted during the intercept.
not_available I'm writing a salvage utility.
not_available Recovering this may be our only way to stop those nukes.
not_available Give me an estimate.
not_available Could be ten minutes, could be an hour.
not_available All teams confirm.
not_available Who's the agent in charge? 
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Mr Bauer, I'm Al Turner.
not_available I'll be on point.
not_available Are your men in position? 
not_available We've sealed off one block and recon has confirmed your brother's inside.
not_available His wife and son are in there as well.
not_available Use nonlethal force.
not_available We need to take my brother alive.
not_available Understood.
not_available Attention 
not_available Let me go in with you.
not_available No.
not_available You wait here.
not_available I need to question Graem alone.
not_available What are you gonna do to him? Whatever it takes to find out what he knows.
not_available I'm not stupid.
not_available I know something is wrong.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available You're a lousy liar.
not_available You always have been.
not_available Why don't you make some coffee? 
not_available Make your own coffee! Will you two stop fighting? All you guys ever do is fight.
not_available I'm sorry, honey.
not_available We're just all a little tense today.
not_available What's going on? Nothing.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Why don't why don't we leave your father alone? He needs to work.
not_available Put the weapon down! Drop the gun! What the hell is this, Jack? 
not_available Put it down! Do it.
not_available Get on the floor.
not_available Get on the floor! Take it easy! 
not_available Take him into the next room.
not_available Have Burke prep him for questioning.
not_available I want every drive in this house uploaded and sent over to CTU.
not_available Pick him up.
not_available Go.
not_available Go! What are you doing to my dad? 
not_available I'll explain as soon as I can.
not_available Please, just take a seat.
not_available Please, come on.
not_available Let go of me! Stop looking at me like this has something to do with us.
not_available It doesn't.
not_available Gray tried to have me and our father killed.
not_available Why? Why would he try and kill you? The nuclear bomb that was detonated today was acquired from the family's company.
not_available Gray's been trying to cover it up.
not_available I'm sorry, Marilyn.
not_available I understand how difficult this must be for you to believe.
not_available It's not.
not_available I may not know the details of what he's done but I know what he's capable of.
not_available There are four more other bombs out there.
not_available Is there anything that you can tell me? Like what? Did Gray talk about a man named McCarthy? 
not_available No.
not_available Are you sure? He hasn't confided in me in years.
not_available He probably never did.
not_available Marilyn, thousands of lives are at stake.
not_available Please, just think.
not_available I wish I knew something, I wish I did, but I don't know anything.
not_available Josh doesn't know anything and he doesn't need to know.
not_available I'll do everything I can to protect him.
not_available No! No, I've seen what happens when you try and protect people.
not_available I just wanna get my son and I wanna get outta here! Marilyn! 
not_available Sir.
not_available We found two computers.
not_available He was trying to erase files.
not_available We're sending what's left over to CTU.
not_available OK, good.
not_available My sisterin
not_available law and my nephew don't need to stay here.
not_available Have them transported to CTU.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Ms Bauer, we're taking you and your son back to CTU.
not_available Josh? 
not_available Grandpa.
not_available Are you OK? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Wait in the car, baby.
not_available Jack told me what Graem did, what he was involved with.
not_available Is it true? 
not_available It's complicated.
not_available But it's true.
not_available You make sure he keeps Josh out of this.
not_available I panicked, Jack.
not_available That's all there is to it.
not_available You panicked? That's your excuse? You panicked?! You tried to kill me and our father.
not_available I was backed into a corner.
not_available I was protecting my ass.
not_available You knew about a tactical nuclear weapon on American soil.
not_available You were responsible for the death of thousands.
not_available You think I wanted that bomb to go off? I think you knew more about McCarthy than you told me.
not_available How do I find him? 
not_available I don't have a clue.
not_available How do I find him?! 
not_available I just told you, I don't know.
not_available There are four more bombs out there.
not_available This isn't ajoke, Gray.
not_available Tell me now, how do I find McCarthy? 
not_available I've told you everything I know, Jack.
not_available Perspiration and temperature patterns indicate deception, especially his last reply.
not_available Set up the interrogation package.
not_available You don't wanna make me do this, Gray.
not_available We grew up together, Jack.
not_available In all those years I could never make you do anything you didn't wanna do.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's Morris's brother.
not_available Timothy? He's on his way to Horizon Regional Hospital.
not_available On
not_available site paramedics confirmed he has severe radiation exposure.
not_available It says he's in critical condition.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available Chloe.
not_available I think we should hold off.
not_available Why? Morris is our best hope for restoring that file.
not_available If we drop this on him now, he might shut down.
not_available It's his brother.
not_available We can't keep it a secret.
not_available I understand this might sound insensitive, but put aside your personal feelings for Morris and consider what's at stake.
not_available We need him to finish that salvage utility.
not_available I know Morris.
not_available He can handle it.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Morris.
not_available Yes, darling? I have some bad news.
not_available It's about Timothy.
not_available He's been taken to the hospital.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This can't be right.
not_available It says he was pulled from his car by rescue workers north of Valencia.
not_available Could you connect me with Horizon Regional Hospital? What was he doing in Valencia? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All circuits are busy.
not_available I realise the lines are busy.
not_available This is CTU.
not_available I need an emergency breakthrough.
not_available I can't help you at this time, sir.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to go out there.
not_available Morris, hey.
not_available I know it's hard.
not_available We are in the middle of a crisis.
not_available We need to find the engineer before Fayed does.
not_available You can't leave.
not_available You can't expect me to sit there while my little brother is dying in a hospital.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Morris, listen.
not_available an engineer, it'll be many, many more.
not_available Four bombs is about a million people.
not_available Think about this.
not_available You can finish writing the program.
not_available Yes, I can, but you started already.
not_available It'll take me half an hour to figure out what you've done.
not_available You need to stay here and do yourjob.
not_available Please.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Did Chloe pull anything off the hard drives? She came up empty, but the NSA picked up a conversation between McCarthy and Fayed.
not_available McCarthy's found another engineer to arm the four remaining nukes.
not_available He's delivering him within the hour.
not_available The nukes will be operational in 45 minutes? I'll get back to you.
not_available CTU confirmed that McCarthy is looking for an engineer for Fayed.
not_available They'll arm the nukes.
not_available You're wasting time talking to me.
not_available You're holding something back.
not_available I told you everything I know.
not_available That's hyoscine pentothal.
not_available It's a neuroinflammatory designed to induce pain.
not_available All you have to do to stop me from using it is tell me how to find McCarthy.
not_available Your guess is as good as mine.
not_available Two ccs.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available I can take this to seven ccs.
not_available You will experience pain I can't even describe.
not_available At eight ccs I run the risk of inducing a heart attack.
not_available Gray, make no mistake about it, I will go there if I have to.
not_available Please, just tell me what I need to know.
not_available Please.
not_available I don't wanna hurt you.
not_available Oh, you sure about that, Jack? Please, Gray, just tell me what I need to know.
not_available How do I find McCarthy?! Do it.
not_available Two ccs.
not_available Breathe.
not_available Just breathe.
not_available Just breathe.
not_available Please, just tell me what I need to know.
not_available How do I find McCarthy?! Damn you.
not_available Damn you.
not_available Four ccs.
not_available That's eight ccs total.
not_available His vitals are spiking across the line.
not_available Four ccs! 
not_available Jack, don't! The machine knows you're lying! I know you're lying! Tell me the truth! Tell me the truth! This has nothing to do with McCarthy.
not_available It has to do with Palmer.
not_available David Palmer? Yeah.
not_available I gave the order for his assassination, and Agent Tony Almeida and Agent Michelle Dessler, your co
not_available workers.
not_available They're all dead because of me.
not_available I arranged everything.
not_available I set the timetable.
not_available I
not_available I paid off the killers.
not_available I even lured you out of hiding to take the fall.
not_available Today wasn't the first time I've tried to have you killed, Jack.
not_available Why? Because I love my country! And in the real world, sometimes that means you have to do things, terrible things, even unforgivable things, for the sake of your country.
not_available But you know all about that, don't you, brother? We're the same.
not_available I mean, look at me.
not_available We're the same! We are not the same! You want me to kill you? Do it! 
not_available I'm gonna do it my way.
not_available Four more ccs.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Pick up the syringe.
not_available Do it! Now! Son of a bitch! 
not_available Get me somebody in here now! Do you wanna die? Drop your weapon! Drop it! You're gonna die.
not_available Shut down the IV.
not_available Shut it down.
not_available I'm here, baby.
not_available I'm ashamed.
not_available What do you mean, you're ashamed? For spying on those men.
not_available I thought I was doing the right thing, but I was wrong.
not_available You did the only thing that you could do, OK? And that was the right thing.
not_available Look, you're the bravest, most principled man I've ever known.
not_available You get some rest, OK? Hello? Sandra, it's Wayne.
not_available I just heard what happened to Walid.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Is he gonna be all right? Yeah, I think so.
not_available What they told me is confusing.
not_available They said Walid was working undercover to expose some plot? There was no plot.
not_available The men weren't part of any conspiracy.
not_available They were just bystanders.
not_available They told me these men had information about the nuclear weapons.
not_available One of the men pulled it from the internet.
not_available Sandra, they should've reported that.
not_available They were afraid they were gonna get into more trouble than they're already in.
not_available Most of these men were pulled from theirjobs and their homes on trumped
not_available up immigration charges, and now they're facing deportation.
not_available Wayne, you are detaining without due process the people whose help you need the most.
not_available How do you expect for them to help if they don't have any legal protection? Wayne, I'm scared.
not_available I know.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right.
not_available What's the status? 
not_available I ran the program but this is all we got.
not_available I still don't have a clear image.
not_available What are you doing? I'm downloading an application from a hacker's site.
not_available It might kick
not_available start things.
not_available It could corrupt the file.
not_available I know these guys.
not_available They write really good code, when they're not serving time.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available That's what Graem was holding back? He was responsible for Palmer's assassination.
not_available He directed the conspiracy.
not_available He was trying to protect the company.
not_available He's trying to do that now.
not_available Incredible.
not_available I wish it got us closer to the nukes.
not_available He doesn't know where McCarthy is.
not_available Were you able to pick up anything on chatter? 
not_available Maybe an image of McCarthy's engineer.
not_available How long till you know? The file's corrupted.
not_available Morris is working on it now.
not_available As soon as my brother is ready, I want him sent back to CTU.
not_available I've redirected a chopper to Jackson Middle School.
not_available Thanks, Bill.
not_available Dad, Graem made his own choices after you let him start running the company.
not_available You can't make yourself responsible for that.
not_available It's not fair.
not_available I'll tell you what isn't fair.
not_available You deserved a better family, Jack.
not_available Not this.
not_available Not us.
not_available I can just imagine what you must be feeling.
not_available All that time we lost.
not_available What I wouldn't give to have some of it back.
not_available Me too.
not_available Your brother's been stabilised.
not_available He'll be ready to move in ten minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dad, I want you to go back to CTU.
not_available OK.
not_available I need a few minutes.
not_available Of course.
not_available They're sending a chopper for me.
not_available I have to go.
not_available There.
not_available What? The plug
not_available in's working.
not_available How long is it gonna take? You'll have a photo of the engineer in two minutes.
not_available Just don't touch anything.
not_available I have got to find out what's happening to my brother.
not_available Save it.
not_available Thanks for trying to help.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available Watch my station, OK? 
not_available Call me when you find out about Timothy.
not_available I will.
not_available Congratulations, Tom, it's an excellent plan.
not_available Thank you very much, Mr Vice President.
not_available It's about time someone in this administration stood up to these people.
not_available To be honest, I didn't think this president had the stomach for the cure.
not_available I think we're about ready for kickoff here, sir.
not_available I'll put you on speakerphone.
not_available Is the vice president with us? 
not_available I'm here, Mr President.
not_available I'm assuming everyone here has read Executive Order 1066.
not_available Tom first proposed his plan to me very early this morning, and I rejected it.
not_available Sacrificing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution seemed like like too steep a price, even for the promise of security.
not_available But then Fayed murdered 12,000 innocent Americans with a nuclear weapon.
not_available I felt compelled to revisit my earlier position.
not_available After careful reconsideration I remain convinced that my initial response was in fact the right one 
not_available that implementing this plan would be a terrible mistake.
not_available Now, I cannot and I will not endorse these actions.
not_available Some of you seem to feel that the Constitution is somehow valid only during times of peace, but not during wartime.
not_available That is not what the founders intended.
not_available With your indulgence, sir, George Washington's enemies wore bright red coats and marched in a straight line.
not_available The founders could never have conceived of a stateless enemy hiding among us that targets not our soldiers but our civilisation.
not_available Your plan would only hinder the efforts of law enforcement to stop Fayed.
not_available How does my plan hinder law enforcement, sir? By marginalising and thereby radicalising the very people whose help they need to enlist.
not_available The American Muslim community is our best line of defence against these terrorists.
not_available But we Americans need to demonstrate that we are governed by the rule of law and never, never by the politics of fear.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Yes, Noah? Before you make unilateral decisions, maybe you should hear some other people's thoughts.
not_available I'm sorry, Noah.
not_available The discussion on this matter is over.
not_available This better work.
not_available Jack's on his way.
not_available I want Holding A and B prepped for interrogation and put together a clearance package for him, no restrictions.
not_available Do you have it yet? 
not_available A few more seconds.
not_available As soon as we ID the engineer, post it on the interagency subnet.
not_available We need all eyes on this.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It's Morris.
not_available His clearance level, personal history, everything.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available On his way to the hospital.
not_available We got a call that his brother was hurt in the blast.
not_available He just left.
not_available This is Buchanan.
not_available Has Morris O'Brian left the parking lot? 
not_available He just drove out, sir.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Milo, contact LAPD.
not_available Put an APB out on his car.
not_available Chloe, see if you can raise him on his cell phone.
not_available Bauer.
not_available We just ID'd the engineer.
not_available It's Morris O'Brian.
not_available Morris? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The file we intercepted was Morris's photo and CV.
not_available McCarthy was sending it to Fayed.
not_available There is no doubt.
not_available Fine, put him under a protective watch.
not_available We can't.
not_available He's gone.
not_available He got a call claiming his brother was in the hospital.
not_available We're trying to raise him on his cell.
not_available Morris, hold on! He's on line one.
not_available We got him, Jack.
not_available Patch me through.
not_available Morris, it's Bill Buchanan with Jack Bauer.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available On my way to the hospital.
not_available Come back to CTU immediately.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available This is Jack.
