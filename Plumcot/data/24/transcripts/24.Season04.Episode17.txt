not_available It's not here.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Agent Drake? Drop the weapon now! 
not_available Jack's on the line.
not_available Jack, what is it? I pulled data off a hard drive in Anderson's apartment.
not_available I believe Mitch Anderson's trying to steal a Stealth fighter.
not_available We have reason to believe a Stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist.
not_available It's in your airspace as we speak.
not_available Just how sure are we about this? It's a near certainty, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available This is a Stealth aircraft.
not_available If he finds you, he may be on you before your fighter escort can react.
not_available Mitch Anderson, we know who you are, we know what you're trying to do.
not_available Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson? We've been cut off.
not_available Is there an override channel? He cut off all communication circuits.
not_available We can't do anything.
not_available Dad.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available Air Force One has been fired on.
not_available Repeat, Air Force One has been fired on.
not_available Oh, my God.

not_available Alert them of the situation.
not_available On it.
not_available Tony, do we have any CTU support teams in the area? The Las Vegas office has two satellite teams available.
not_available I'm gonna dispatch coordinates to all teams in LA and Vegas so they can start for the site now.
not_available Steady glide.
not_available Left wing flaps damaged.
not_available Edgar, pull up satellite on the national park.
not_available Pinpoint any possible landing scenarios.
not_available Chloe, what's happening? We've lost the signal.

not_available Going through 7500 at 210 knots.
not_available Roger, 210 knots.

not_available They're making the turn.
not_available Roger, I'm close to a stall.
not_available We are putting her down.
not_available No gears deployed.
not_available We are still hard and fast.
not_available OK.

not_available Air Force One? Air Force One, do you read? Air Force One is down.
not_available I got a confirm of scattered ground flashes from the DOD satellite.
not_available Edgar, bring that up.
not_available What's the status? 
not_available It's down.
not_available What's its crash like? 
not_available Rough.
not_available We don't know if there are survivors.
not_available Patch coordinates to all agencies.
not_available Got it.
not_available Anybody try subchannel comm stat?

not_available I can't move.
not_available Agent Patterson, my name is Bauer, I'm with CTU.
not_available Rescue units are en route.
not_available What else can you tell me? I see some bodies.
not_available I think we have some survivors.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, I've just received confirmation.
not_available Air Force One sustained a hit from an airto
not_available air missile fired from the stolen Stealth fighter.
not_available Is the president alive? 
not_available We don't know at this time.
not_available When will we know? 
not_available Hopefully within the next few minutes.
not_available Charles.
not_available We've known each other for 15 years.
not_available If I can offer some advice? Of course.
not_available We all hope President Keeler is alive, but even if he is, it's very likely he won't be in any shape to run the country.
not_available You need to make arrangements to be sworn in to office as soon as possible, and the media should provide live coverage.
not_available The American people need to be reassured that their leadership is intact.
not_available That's good advice, Mike.
not_available I'll take it under consideration, but I don't want to act prematurely.
not_available I understand.
not_available Well, we have to get to the White House.
not_available I've arranged for a security briefing with the Pentagon.
not_available That's good.
not_available By now you all know Air Force One has been shot down.
not_available One of the pilots following Air Force One managed to get a visual of the fighter used.
not_available Pilot engaged and shot down the Stealth.
not_available The status of the president is unclear at this time.
not_available Rescue teams are minutes away.
not_available We'll know very soon.
not_available The man responsible for what has transpired today, Habib Marwan, is still out there, and likely planning further attacks.
not_available I want every one of you to rededicate yourselves to finding Marwan.
not_available I don't want a single lead ignored, or shred of evidence missed.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available Michelle, let me talk to you.
not_available Uplink leads to a station so we can start work on a priority list.
not_available We might not know exactly where Marwan is, but he has to be in a 50 mile radius Jack, I'm sorry, I just got off the phone with the secretary of defense, and there's a higher priority than Marwan.
not_available What? 
not_available Recovering the nuclear football.
not_available Didn't it go down with Air Force One? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available The missile inflicted enough damage that it left debris.
not_available A lot was sucked out, including the football.
not_available There's a transponder in the casing so we know its location.
not_available Then the retrieval team should have no problem.
not_available The secretary wants you to head that team.
not_available Why? 
not_available It's his top priority.
not_available That case contains the codes and locations of our entire nuclear arsenal.
not_available Nothing is more critical than getting it back, and as quickly as possible.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll organize your team, mobilize the units.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's the location of the football? 
not_available 40 miles northeast of here, in the desert.
not_available Hey! Hey.
not_available What's wrong? What else is happening? Paul may have to go back into surgery.
not_available Apparently the bullet did more damage than they thought.
not_available Sorry.
not_available If I had handled things differently, if I had trusted him Audrey, you are not responsible for this.
not_available I, and I alone, made the decision on how to handle Paul.
not_available If you want to remain effective, to be able to do your job, you have to let it go.
not_available Jack, that's your gift.
not_available You're able to block things out.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Jack, the chopper's waiting.
not_available I have to change and get ready.
not_available All right.
not_available Honey? What's wrong? I don't know.
not_available Something woke me.
not_available It sounded like some kind of explosion or something.
not_available Explosion? Nearby? I'm not sure.
not_available It was probably just a bad dream.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're still stressed, aren't you? I want you to try and forget about work, OK? Just focus on what we came out here for.
not_available To relax, and to make a baby.
not_available Look.
not_available What? 
not_available Watch your step.
not_available OK.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Kelly! What is it? If the president is unable to fulfill his duties, Vice President Logan will assume office.
not_available Cabinet will need to be briefed on the crash.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Not all members are equal.
not_available State and Defense need more detail than, say, agriculture.
not_available Yeah, I can handle it.
not_available I want to make sure the transition is smooth.
not_available I understand, but I do know what to do.
not_available All right.
not_available Tony.
not_available I've noticed a little hostility on your part.
not_available If it's because of me and Michelle It's none of my business.
not_available And as far as the hostility goes, I can promise you it's over with.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available One more thing.
not_available I think the world of Michelle.
not_available Loved working with her.
not_available Outside work, we never got off the ground.
not_available She never said why, but it didn't take a genius to figure it out.
not_available She cared about you.
not_available If you ask me, she still does.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, rescue teams are inside Air Force One.
not_available We're picking up a live feed now.
not_available There's damage to the fuselage and hatch.
not_available Go and check check to see if he's alive.
not_available Check him.
not_available See if he's alive.
not_available Got a body here.
not_available She's dead too.
not_available The president was in the conference room.
not_available Copy.
not_available He was in the conference room.
not_available What? 
not_available Got a survivor! I'm going in.
not_available Keep close.
not_available Looks like the president's son.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Where's the president? 
not_available This may be him.
not_available Wait, hold on.
not_available This may be him.
not_available It's the president.
not_available He's still alive.
not_available I repeat, the president is alive.
not_available We need medevac teams in here ASAP.
not_available Do you read that? We need medevac teams here.
not_available Novick.
not_available I have Buchanan.
not_available Yes, he's right here.
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available Bill.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available I'm in direct contact with the teams at the crash site of Air Force One.
not_available President Keeler is alive.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available But he's in critical condition.
not_available He's unconscious, he's lost blood, there's no chance he'll be able to lead this country, not for days, and probably much longer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President? 
not_available Yes, I'm here.
not_available This is all confirmed? The president is being medevacked to the emergency centre as we speak.
not_available Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th Amendment and take control of things as soon as possible.
not_available I understand.
not_available Thank you, Bill.
not_available Keeler's alive, but he's incapacitated.
not_available We should probably contact the cabinet members.
not_available Actually, I've already put that in motion.
not_available Most are standing by, the others will be very soon.
not_available You did that without my permission? 
not_available You had enough to worry about.
not_available I thought it best to be prepared.
not_available Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Shall I begin the process of collecting votes? Yes, go ahead.
not_available I can't get a signal.
not_available Try up here.
not_available Got it.
not_available Kelly, look at this.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I'm not sure, but if it's what I think it is I read this article, it's a funny name I can't remember, but it's got our nuclear codes.
not_available It goes everywhere the president goes.
not_available He can launch an attack from it.
not_available We gotta call somebody.
not_available Who are you gonna call? I'll start with the police, I guess.
not_available They'll put us through to the right people.
not_available The football transponder's signals still strong.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Hey.
not_available When I walked away from you at CTU, I felt like you didn't understand what I was trying to say.
not_available I'm not telling you that you shouldn't care.
not_available I care.
not_available I care about you, I care about what happened to Paul.
not_available I feel responsible.
not_available But this country is under attack.
not_available I've got a job to do.
not_available I don't have a choice.
not_available Jack, I understand what you have to do is very important.
not_available I just didn't want us to leave things like that.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available I gotta take this call.
not_available Wait, Jack.
not_available Take the call, all right? Stay focused on what you have to do.
not_available Yeah, I'll talk to you in a little while.
not_available Bye.
not_available OK.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Tony.
not_available I got a guy the police put through.
not_available He's in the desert, says he found a case.
not_available Jack, this guy found the football.
not_available OK, let me speak to him.
not_available His name's Jason Gerard.
not_available We're running a check.
not_available I'm patching him through now.
not_available OK, Tony, stay on the other line.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gerard? 
not_available Call me Jason.
not_available I'm with my wife, Kelly.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm an agent with the Department of Defense.
not_available My colleague says you found what we refer to as the football.
not_available It looks that way.
not_available I don't know much about this sort of thing.
not_available My wife and I are here on a camping trip.
not_available Why don't you describe what you found? Sure.
not_available It's a black leather briefcase, it's got a number panelling over by the handle.
not_available It was in a case with the presidential seal on it.
not_available That sounds like it.
not_available Right now I'm in a helicopter.
not_available I'm about 20 minutes away.
not_available Look, I just want you to hang out there and wait for me.
not_available I think someone beat you to the punch.
not_available I see headlights.
not_available How far away? 
not_available It's hard to tell.
not_available A few miles.
not_available OK, just hold on a second, Jason.
not_available Tony, this kid says he's got headlights headed towards him.
not_available Do we have any ground units in his vicinity? 
not_available No.
not_available Highway patrol, park rangers? 
not_available No.
not_available How can that be? We're spread thin, Jack.
not_available All state agencies are still assisting with the evacuation.
not_available Jason, are the headlights headed for you? 
not_available Yeah, they're coming this way.
not_available Dammit! This situation just got a lot more complicated.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available The football has a transponder.
not_available It allows anyone to pinpoint its location, as long as they've got the frequency.
not_available You think someone's got it who's not supposed to.
not_available We have to make that assumption.
not_available Who do you think it is? The terrorists who carried out today's attacks.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available Remove the transponder and take the football and get away from there as far as you can.
not_available All right.
not_available Flashlight.
not_available I need your light.
not_available OK, go ahead.
not_available The transponder's tiny and it's hidden in the case.
not_available It's designed not to be found.
not_available How will I find it? Do you have a compass and a flashlight? 
not_available Uh, yeah.
not_available Get the compass.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available I want you to move the compass over the surface of the case, slowly.
not_available The transponder puts out an electromagnetic field.
not_available It should move the needle.
not_available Just move the compass over the surface of the case and watch the needle.
not_available Here, here, here, here.
not_available Keep the beam on the compass.
not_available OK.
not_available I think I got it.
not_available I found it.
not_available I found it.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Take a knife or a sharp rock and start scratching the surface, hard.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Dammit! 
not_available Jason, they're coming.
not_available Come on, Jason.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available I am working on it.
not_available OK.
not_available I think I got it.
not_available OK.
not_available Take the compass, put it over the scraped area and tell me, is the needle moving? 
not_available No.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available You've disabled it.
not_available How far is the vehicle? 
not_available Not far.
not_available OK.
not_available Take the football and start moving.
not_available I don't care which direction, start moving now.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available We gotta go.
not_available We gotta go now! Tony, I'm going to need surveillance of the entire area put up to my screen.
not_available Why are we stopping? 
not_available We've lost the signal.
not_available How is that possible? 
not_available Maybe it was damaged on impact.
not_available And it just happens to malfunction now that we're getting closer? Scan the area for cell phones.
not_available Active and passive signals.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Jason.
not_available We found a reserve power station half a mile north of you.
not_available That's right.
not_available I remember it from the map.
not_available I want you to go there.
not_available OK, yeah.
not_available We'll get there.
not_available The station's a large, unmanned facility.
not_available I want you to break in and hide.
not_available Avoid using your flashlight, and as soon as you hang up, 
not_available take your cell batteries out.
not_available The batteries? It'll prevent passive triangulation.
not_available In other words, it'll stop you from being followed.
not_available What if I need to contact you? 
not_available Put them back in, but only if you have to.
not_available I'm gonna give you my direct line.
not_available Have you got a pen? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available 310 "781." OK, yeah, I got it.
not_available Start moving now! 
not_available OK.
not_available He said to take the battery out of the cell phone.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available I had a cell phone signal for a few seconds.
not_available It was moving, but it's gone now.
not_available Did it move enough to yield a vector? 
not_available Wait.
not_available Yes.
not_available It was headed a few degrees west of north just before it cut out.
not_available Check the map.
not_available See if there's anything near there.
not_available There's a reserve power plant.
not_available A kilometer away, maybe less.
not_available Whoever has the football, that's where they're heading.
not_available This is it.
not_available Stay back.
not_available We're not in any danger, right? I mean, how could anyone even know that we're here? We're just being safe.
not_available A nice, relaxing weekend in the desert, just like I said.
not_available They're here.
not_available I gotta call Jack.
not_available Come on.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available It's Jason.
not_available These terrorists, they're here.
not_available How many? 
not_available I just saw two Jeeps.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Inside the plant.
not_available When will you get here? 
not_available Soon.
not_available Just stand by.
not_available Go, baby.
not_available Go! Come on.
not_available Just keep moving.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available We're out of time.
not_available We need schematics for the plant now.
not_available Yeah, it should be on your screen in a few seconds.
not_available OK, I got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Jason, are you still with me? 
not_available I'm with you.
not_available Which side of the building did you enter? 
not_available Uh, the south side.
not_available This is a large facility.
not_available I want you to go to the lower level, southeast corner.
not_available I'll find you there as soon as we land.
not_available OK.
not_available Hey, Agent Bauer? Please hurry.
not_available We are.
not_available Find them.
not_available There's got to be stairs somewhere.
not_available Come on.
not_available There.
not_available There they are.
not_available Wait.
not_available What if it's a dead end? Keep going! 
not_available A man and a woman.
not_available Where? This way.
not_available They went down here.
not_available Follow them and flush them out.
not_available Go around and cut off the exits.
not_available Come on.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go up there.
not_available Go up there.
not_available Go on! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, come on, come on! 
not_available OK.
not_available Anything? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Helicopter.
not_available Intercept it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Jason.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available We've just landed.
not_available Where are you? Inside the plant, on the lower level.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack! Are you there? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available They're inside.
not_available We cannot keep hiding, they're gonna find us.
not_available I know.
not_available You gotta keep moving.
not_available I'll get right back to you.
not_available Stiles.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I need to speak to Audrey, now! 
not_available Ms Raines, Jack's on line one.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'm taking fire.
not_available The other agent's dead.
not_available I need the code for the football.
not_available All right, hang on.
not_available Just take the football.
not_available Take the football.
not_available Come on! Come on! 
not_available Jack, *76114.
not_available I got it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Jason.
not_available I need you to open the case.
not_available The combination is *76114.
not_available Why? What is the point of this? 
not_available Just do it.
not_available *76114.
not_available He wants us to open the briefcase.
not_available *76114.
not_available OK, it's open.
not_available OK.
not_available Inside should be a phone, a control board, and the playbook.
not_available I want you to remove the book, give the case back to your wife.
not_available The two need to stay separate.
not_available Why? 
not_available The board is useless without the playbook.
not_available I need you to split up.
not_available He wants us to split up.
not_available I can hear him.
not_available I am not leaving my wife.
not_available You have to.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Jason, please.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I know how scared you are, but if he gets what he wants, he'll kill both of you.
not_available Right now, the only chance you have to survive is to separate.
not_available Do you understand? It's OK, Jason.
not_available He's kept us alive this far.
not_available Let's just do what he says.
not_available Just get here as fast as you can.
not_available I will.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you.
not_available Give me the backpack.
not_available Listen.
not_available Here, you take the phone.
not_available OK.
not_available I want you to go to that top level there, all right? I'm going to stay down here.
not_available You just find a place to hide, all right? 
not_available OK.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Go! Go! Go! Hide! Hide! Hey! I've got him.
not_available He's clean.
not_available Where's the control board? I don't know what you're talking 
not_available Tell me what I want to know.
not_available I swear, I don't know.
not_available Please.
not_available It doesn't have to be this painful.
not_available Bauer.
not_available They got my husband.
not_available Where are you? I'm on the lower level.
not_available We had to leave.
not_available We're on the second floor.
not_available I don't know where.
not_available OK, I'm on my way.
not_available They're gonna kill him.
not_available Kelly, stay on the phone.
not_available Keep talking to me.
not_available I can't.
not_available Kelly! Oh, please! 
not_available Where is the control board? Stop! I have what you want.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available First you let my husband go.
not_available No! OK.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll give it to you if you promise not to kill us.
not_available I won't kill you.
not_available I promise.
not_available It's over there.
not_available It's behind the pillar.
not_available It's locked.
not_available What is the code? It's, uh star 7611
not_available 4.
not_available It's here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Kill them.
not_available No! This is Jack Bauer, I need a medic.
not_available Second level, north end of the building.
not_available On our way there now.
not_available It's all right.
not_available He's gonna be OK.
not_available Help is on the way.
not_available Where is the football? They have it.
not_available They went out that door.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available You did great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Air support, two hostiles left the building.
not_available I do not have possession of the football.
not_available Repeat, I do not have the football.
not_available Air support, football is in the lead Jeep, headed north.
not_available Take it out.
not_available I repeat, take it out.
not_available Put your hands where I can see them.
not_available Air support, I cannot see the football in the vehicle.
not_available Shine your spotlight on me.
not_available And follow.
not_available Air support, I'm in possession of the football.
not_available Go after the other Jeep.
not_available Almeida.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I've got the football.
not_available Three hostiles down, one escaped.
not_available I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.
not_available I'm sorry, but I had to make a choice.
not_available Marwan gave us the football to buy his freedom? 
not_available Yeah, that doesn't sound right.
not_available What are you thinking? I don't know.
not_available Let me ask you something.
not_available Is anything missing? No.
not_available All the components are here.
not_available Hold on one second.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available There are pages missing.
not_available Look, the sections are color
not_available coded.
not_available What's missing? Red chapter, section three.
not_available Get Audrey.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll call you right back.
not_available All right, take care of it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You're worried about him.
not_available I am.
not_available He seems unsure of himself.
not_available Oh, Mike, trust me.
not_available He's spent his whole life preparing for this.
not_available He's just being cautious, feeling his way along.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The call came in, all in favor.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available The vote was unanimous.
not_available The 25th Amendment's been officially invoked.
not_available Tell the press we're ready.
not_available Let's get this done.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, the 25th Amendment is in effect.
not_available Any dissenting votes? 
not_available None.
not_available We should proceed with the swearing in.
not_available Yes.
not_available The ceremony will take a minute, then you can address the nation.
not_available I'm still not certain a live address makes sense this time of night.
not_available After what's happened, an awful lot of people are wide awake.
not_available I'm sure they'd like to hear from you directly.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available We're ready, sir.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, it's Tony.
not_available Is Audrey there? 
not_available Jack, I'm here.
not_available Tell me the contents of the pages.
not_available It's the section which contains warhead locations and activation codes.
not_available We started canceling codes as soon as Air Force One went down.
not_available But there are thousands of warheads.
not_available It's gonna take an hour.
not_available In the meantime, if they get a hold of a warhead and a matching code, we will not be able to stop them.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Novick's office.
not_available Let me speak to Novick.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Right away.
not_available I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the president, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I appreciate it.
not_available I appreciate you coming.
not_available As most of you know 
not_available Novick.
not_available Mike, it's Jack.
not_available We got a problem.
not_available ..
not_available this oath under tragic circumstances.
not_available Words cannot express the sense The football's been compromised.
not_available Yes, I'll tell him.
not_available ..
not_available due to injuries sustained during the crash.
not_available He is in our prayers, as well as our hearts.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I've just received a phone call from CTU.
not_available Yes? I'm sorry, sir, but it appears at least part of the nuclear football has fallen into the hands of terrorists.
