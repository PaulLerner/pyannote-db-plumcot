
not_available I need to speak with the president.
not_available They can't diffuse it.
not_available We'll have to fly it out.
not_available Ground zero has to be a precise location.
not_available A pilot will have to go down with the plane.
not_available It's a suicide mission.
not_available Who ended up flying the plane? 
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available GetAir Force One ready as soon as possible.
not_available Do you mind if I ask where you're going? Los Angeles.
not_available Who's he? 
not_available His name is Yusuf Auda.
not_available His government assigned him as a liaison.
not_available They helped us get the hard drive from Ali.
not_available It's a recording of a conversation that took place four months ago.
not_available Conversation between who? Ali and high
not_available ranking government officials.
not_available These countries not only knew about the bomb, but they bought it and supplied it to Ali? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Kim? 
not_available Daddy.
not_available What's that noise? Where are you? I'm in a plane.
not_available We found the bomb.
not_available We needed someone to fly it over the desert, so when it exploded nobody would get killed.
not_available That someone turned out to be me.
not_available No, Daddy.
not_available I love you more than anything in the world.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available George, what the hell are you doing here? 
not_available Brought something for ya.
not_available It's a parachute.
not_available I already told you, I'm taking this plane in.
not_available You still got a life, Jack.
not_available What's left but going straight and level and taking it into a dive? Am I right? You really think you can do this? 
not_available Jack, I'm supposed to do this.
not_available Oh, Dad.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available My orders are to take you backto CTU, sir.
not_available That's affirmative.
not_available Lieutenant, I need you to get ahold of Tony Almeida over at CTU.
not_available Tell him that I made it.
not_available He needs to get ahold of my daughter, tell her I'm alive.
not_available Radio transmissions are a no
not_available go, and cell sites are down for miles.
not_available You'll have to wait till we get there.
not_available Copy.
not_available Would everyone gather around, please? This will just take a minute.
not_available George Mason asked me in advance to thank you all for your dedication.
not_available Thanks to his sacrifice and your hard work, millions of lives were saved.
not_available And that's a result that we can be proud of.
not_available To say that this has been a long day would be an understatement, and I know you're all tired, but this isn't over yet.
not_available We still got a lot of workto do.
not_available The Cyprus recording is our primary focus.
not_available And that's critical to any military response that Washington's considering.
not_available So let's get back at it, huh? Mr Almeida? I'm supposed to update my office right now.
not_available But I've got nothing to report except that I've been excluded from this investigation.
not_available Look, I'll tell you what I can when I can.
not_available My country permitted your operatives to raid Ali's apartment on condition that I would be involved in this investigation.
not_available I understand your frustration, Mr Auda.
not_available You can call your office and tell them anything you like.
not_available But we've got workto do here.
not_available You're simply not authorised to be part of it.
not_available He doesn't looktoo happy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are the audio guys ready? They're waiting for you.
not_available Where's Michelle? 
not_available Interrogating Ali.
not_available Why? To see if he can shed any light on the recording.
not_available We have a meeting.
not_available The president's waiting for confirmation on the recording's authenticity.
not_available Take care of it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This tape was recovered from the hard drive in your apartment.
not_available It's a record of a meeting you had with these three men on April 5 in Cyprus.
not_available They're all high
not_available ranking officials from three Arab countries, one of them your own.
not_available The tape proves you conspired with these men to detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil.
not_available Were there others present who didn't speak? You'll tell the interrogators in Guantanamo, under much less comfortable circumstances.
not_available I'll ask you one more time.
not_available Tell me whatyou want me to say, I'll say it.
not_available I want the truth.
not_available What does the truth matter when you have this recording? 
not_available Explain what that means.
not_available I never spoke to any of these men.
not_available Are you denying that the meeting took place? There was never a meeting.
not_available I was not even in Cyprus in April.
not_available Where were you? 
not_available Berlin.
not_available They'll find out the truth in Guantanamo.
not_available Why would I lie about this, when I told you the truth about the bomb? To protectyour country.
not_available The bomb was a Second Wave operation only.
not_available I have never met those men.
not_available Agent Gibson, your team has finished the analysis of the Cyprus recording? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Could you walk us through it, please? We began by obtaining voice samples for Ali and the three government officials.
not_available We deconstructed sound waves and isolated unique qualities.
not_available The voices on the Cyprus audio are in fact those of Syed Ali and the three government ministers in question.
not_available The recording could have been created by putting pieces of conversations together? Yes, but reconstruction always leaves artefacts, mismatched acoustical signatures or altered cadences.
not_available We found no such artefacts.
not_available Is there any chance that it could have been doctored in a way we couldn't detect? Anything's theoretically possible.
not_available But I can say with absolute certainty that the finest experts, using the best equipment, cannot find any evidence that this recording is anything but a genuine and accurate record of an actual conversation.
not_available A conversation in which these four men sat in the same room and conspired to detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil? Yes, sir.
not_available I just finished talking with Ali.
not_available He claims that he's never even spoken to any of the men in the recording.
not_available He says it's a complete fabrication, and that he was in Berlin on April 5, not Cyprus.
not_available He could be telling the truth.
not_available He still thinks we killed one of his sons.
not_available He's trying to save his family by denying that his country's behind the nuke.
not_available I agree he has a motive to lie, but if there's any possibility he's telling the truth, 
not_available I think we need to investigate.
not_available But he's not.
not_available I mean, it's obvious.
not_available It's not obvious to me.
not_available The evidence versus the word of an attempted mass murderer? It's clear which wins.
not_available Carrie.
not_available And, no offence, Michelle, butyour experience as an interrogator is limited.
not_available That's enough.
not_available I sat three feet away from him, and I believe he is a broken man without the strength or resolve to lie.
not_available I'll tell the president whatAli said when I call him to pass on Agent Gibson's findings.
not_available Now, if we don't have anything else here, I think we're finished, right? Thank you.
not_available CTU managed to detonate the bomb within a few metres of the coordinates.
not_available I'm going over the field report now.
not_available I'm not seeing any casualty estimates.
not_available We expect zero direct casualties, or close to it.
not_available Hmm.
not_available I want to give Bauer's daughter personal condolences.
not_available You won't have to, sir.
not_available Bauer wasn't on the plane at the time the bomb was detonated.
not_available Do we know howthis happened? 
not_available Another man ended up piloting the plane.
not_available We're still getting the details.
not_available Sir? We just got word from CTU.
not_available They finished their analysis of the Cyprus audio.
not_available It's real.
not_available And we have proof that Syed Ali, the man behind the bomb, was given support from the three different countries.
not_available Here's the transcript of their analysis including margins of error.
not_available Do we have any reason to doubt the veracity of this? Ali is denying it, but I suppose that's to be expected.
not_available Are the Joint Chiefs ready? 
not_available General Bowden has them on standby.
not_available Given the evidence, we don't have the option of not responding.
not_available I don't see any way around this.
not_available Do you? I want to issue a statement that there was a nuclear weapon, but there were no casualties.
not_available I will alert the networks, sir.
not_available And contact the Hill.
not_available Let them know I'll be calling for an emergency session of Congress.
not_available During which, I'll be asking them for a formal declaration of war.
not_available Chappelle wants to see your report.
not_available I'm ordering more data points.
not_available I need another 15 minutes.
not_available Fine.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Just a little tired, like everyone else.
not_available No, I mean, about before.
not_available It got tense between you and Carrie.
not_available I can handle Carrie.
not_available You don't have the training or the experience to read a guy like Ali.
not_available I shouldn't have putyou in that position.
not_available We should press him.
not_available They will in Guantanamo.
not_available It may be too late.
not_available We're sending him now.
not_available I'm heading over to make sure the hand
not_available off goes as planned.
not_available OK.
not_available General Bowden, my understanding is it'll take between eight and ten weeks to call up reserve troops and redeploy forces for a full
not_available scale ground assault.
not_available We have the resources in place to initiate a rolling start immediately.
not_available Rolling start? Surgical strikes against earlywarning radar and anti
not_available aircraft installations, followed immediately by bombing of targets that will degrade their military and telecommunications capabilities.
not_available Can these first strikes be underway by the time I address the nation this morning? When are you scheduled to go on the air? 
not_available Six hours from now.
not_available We'll be ready, sir.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Gentlemen, ladies, would you hold, please? Deputy Prime Minister Barghouti is calling.
not_available It's his second call since the bomb was detonated.
not_available We're well past the point of words.
not_available We're about to invade his country.
not_available But he doesn't knowthatyet.
not_available If you don't take his call, he may read between the lines.
not_available Mr Deputy Prime Minister.
not_available Thank you for taking my call.
not_available The Prime Minister wanted me to express his outrage for what has occurred.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thatyou found the bomb is truly a miracle.
not_available I'm not sure I believe in miracles, sir.
not_available My people are good at what they do.
not_available Indeed they are.
not_available I'm sure you're aware that we've arrested one of your citizens in connection to it.
not_available Syed Ali.
not_available An outlaw.
not_available He has eluded us for years.
not_available Expect our full cooperation with his punishment.
not_available I would expect nothing less.
not_available I realise we've had our differences, and today has been an especially trying day, but we are both fighting the same battle.
not_available My government remains dedicated to the destruction of Second Wave, as well as any other terrorist organisation that may have been responsible for this atrocity.
not_available That's good to know.
not_available I understand you will be under a great deal of political pressure to respond to what has happened.
not_available I'm confident thatyou have the strength to resist.
not_available Don't be concerned about a rush to judgment.
not_available We're merely gathering evidence.
not_available I appreciate your candour, Mr President.
not_available And I appreciate your solidarity.
not_available Of course.
not_available You'll hear from me soon.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available I'm glad you're OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll get out of your way.
not_available How can I get ahold of Kim? I spoke to a Sergeant Griggs with the San Jose Sheriffs Department.
not_available He sent a man to your sisterin
not_available law's to meet Kim.
not_available That's his number.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available George told me he putyou in charge.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How about that, huh? Trial by fire, right? 
not_available You're gonna do great.
not_available Look, we'll catch up later, all right? Yeah.
not_available Sheriff's Department.
not_available Is Griggs there? 
not_available I can help.
not_available I need to speak with him.
not_available He's not here.
not_available Is this not his personal line? What is this regarding? 
not_available I'm Jack Bauer.
not_available It's regarding my daughter.
not_available Sergeant Griggs isn't available.
not_available If your daughter is in any danger, let me assistyou.
not_available No, she's not in any immediate danger.
not_available Listen, ma'am Fine, just give me the number.
not_available Same area code, 555
not_available 9464.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm glad you're OK, Jack.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I know Tony's running things, and I don't want to speak out of turn, but 
not_available I don't know who to talkto.
not_available About what? The president's planning military action based on a recording from Ali's apartment.
not_available It links officials from three governments to the nuke.
not_available The problem is Ali claims it was a fake.
not_available And you believe him.
not_available I don't know.
not_available We ought to be sure before we retaliate against them.
not_available That's Tony's call.
not_available I'm trying to get ahold of my daughter.
not_available I understand, butyou're the one who broke Ali.
not_available You can read him better than anyone here.
not_available Please, Jack, before Ali is gone.
not_available Only he can prove whether the recording is real.
not_available Fine, I'll talkto him.
not_available See if you can get ahold of this Sergeant Griggs.
not_available Tell him it's regarding my daughter.
not_available Sheriff's Department.
not_available This is Michelle Dessler over at CTU.
not_available I'm looking for Sergeant Griggs.
not_available Please hold.
not_available There you go.
not_available Bring him out.
not_available I just wanna talkto him before they get him to Guantanamo.
not_available Gentlemen hold up.
not_available Let me have a word with the prisoner.
not_available I wantyou to know we didn't kill your son.
not_available We staged it.
not_available When you get to Guantanamo, they'll letyou speak with your family.
not_available I need to know something.
not_available The Cyprus recording, is it fake? What I told the woman was true.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We got shots fired on the north roof! Get back here.
not_available He's dead.
not_available You got a radio on you? Tell them inside, Syed Ali has just been shot.
not_available We've got a shooter on one of the southwest roofs.
not_available Tell 'em now! This is Primary Escort.
not_available We have a prisoner down and a sniper on the roof.
not_available Would you take care of that for me? 
not_available LAPD say the perimeter's set up.
not_available How'd anybody know we were moving him? Intelligence knew we had him.
not_available The leak could have come from anywhere.
not_available Shooter's gotta be connected to a country implicated on the recording.
not_available Maybe.
not_available They had the most to lose by Ali talking.
not_available Who else would it have been? 
not_available Ali might have been telling the truth.
not_available You talked to Michelle.
not_available No, I talked to Ali.
not_available Captain Raskind from LAPD for you.
not_available One minute, please.
not_available You're taking Syed Ali's word over every expert we have? Tony, Ali was killed for a reason.
not_available Find out if it was cos he could prove the recording was fabricated.
not_available Our best people have verified it.
not_available Fine.
not_available Keep the door open, assign men to it.
not_available I don't have any men to spare.
not_available We're processing intel from nine countries, and I thinkthis is a dead end.
not_available Captain Raskind wants to know 
not_available Could you give me a minute? Thank you.
not_available Tony, the president is gonna make some very, very serious decisions based on the information that he got from that recording.
not_available If it's not genuine, you have a responsibility You're gonna lecture me on responsibility? We both know how you work.
not_available You consider going against the grain some kind of a virtue.
not_available Why are you talking to me like this? 
not_available I got a job to do, I don't wanna be told how.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available I don't need your help, Jack.
not_available Don't get me wrong, I appreciate everything you've done for us today.
not_available But I think it's time you go getyour daughter, let us handle the rest of this.
not_available Yeah, fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr Almeida All circuits are busy.
not_available Please try your call again.
not_available Some kind of problem? Can I just use the bathroom? 
not_available Please, I'll be quick.
not_available All right, come on.
not_available In the back, on your left.
not_available Watch your step.
not_available Casualty estimates for the initial air campaign are minimal.
not_available A dozen at most.
not_available And the ground campaign? 
not_available There are numerous scenarios, depending on how long the campaign lasts, if chemical or biological weapons are deployed against our troops.
not_available Which, frankly, I thinkthey will be.
not_available OK, take that all into account, then give me a number, General.
not_available A simultaneous ground assault against the three countries, which lasts five weeks, will result in ten to thirty thousand American casualties.
not_available And if China and Russia enter the conflict against us? There's no upper limit to that number, Mr President.
not_available But it's unlikely.
not_available They'll want to insinuate themselves into control of the oil fields.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have Jack Bauer.
not_available It's an emergency.
not_available One moment.
not_available Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you.
not_available Excuse me again.
not_available It's good to hear your voice, but I'm in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
not_available I felt this was important enough to interruptyou.
not_available Syed Ali has just been assassinated.
not_available CTU was transferring him over to Guantanamo when it happened.
not_available What are you talking about? By whom? 
not_available We don't know yet, sir.
not_available I think it has to do with the conversation recorded in Cyprus.
not_available Mr President, I don't believe it's genuine.
not_available That recording was authenticated.
not_available Sir, authentication is never 100 per cent.
not_available Do you have evidence? Ali said he was in Berlin when the conversation took place.
not_available He said the recording was fabricated.
not_available OK, I'm aware of his denials.
not_available Mr President, I'm worried that someone is trying to manipulate you into taking the kind of military action I assume you're about to take.
not_available Look, the fact that Syed Ali was killed does not prove that the recording was fabricated.
not_available No, sir.
not_available I knowthat.
not_available I know it doesn't.
not_available But I feel a responsibility to tell you I believe he was assassinated because he was in fact telling the truth.
not_available Do you have any hard evidence, Jack? Aside from Ali's denials, no, sir.
not_available Nothing concrete.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I don't wanna initiate a military action based on erroneous information.
not_available But I can't stop it based on conjecture.
not_available I understand, sir, I do.
not_available If I were to getyou proof, how much time would I have? Our military response is only hours away, Jack.
not_available You better do it soon.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available We don't have any updates.
not_available As soon as we do, we'll patch them through to you.
not_available This is Dessler.
not_available Michelle, it's Jack.
not_available I wantyou to keep this information between us, OK? I talked to the president.
not_available He will not halt any military action unless we provide proof.
not_available Ali was our only proof.
not_available There's gotta be another way to establish Ali's presence at that time.
not_available Other foreign agencies must have been tracking him.
not_available An official from a target country is here.
not_available What? Here at CTU? Why? We struck an agreement earlier today.
not_available He's the one who escorted evidence from Ali's apartment.
not_available Think he knows something? 
not_available He might.
not_available Tony doesn't want him talking to anyone.
not_available OK, fine, what's his name? 
not_available Yusuf Auda.
not_available AUD
not_available A.
not_available I'll pull up his CV and run a background check.
not_available I'll get backto you.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Kate.
not_available I didn't think I thoughtyou weren't coming back.
not_available I didn't think I was either.
not_available How? 
not_available It's a long story.
not_available But everything's OK, right? They said the bomb was detonated safely.
not_available No.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available It's gonna be fine.
not_available How are you? Are you OK? Yeah.
not_available My dad's still a little shaken up.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Miss Warner.
not_available I have to go.
not_available She needs to be debriefed.
not_available OK.
not_available We'll see you in a little while.
not_available I'm really glad you're OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available The Joint Chiefs are revising down their material estimate between 10 and 20 per cent.
not_available That's good news, sir.
not_available None of this is good news, Mike.
not_available General Bowden is ready to walk you through the strategy statement.
not_available I need a few more minutes.
not_available How long should I tell him? When I'm ready, Mike.
not_available What is it, Mr President? The telephone conversation with Jack Bauer keeps playing in my head.
not_available I'm worried that we may be moving too fast.
not_available Mr President, your ability to analyse a situation is your strongest asset.
not_available But it's also your greatest liability.
not_available I don't wanna make a mistake that our children and their children will pay for.
not_available Sir, we have evidence that's been confirmed by every military and intelligence expert on the payroll.
not_available Everyone except Jack Bauer.
not_available It's natural for you to be having doubts.
not_available I'd be worried if you weren't having doubts.
not_available But when the public learns what happened, they'll want a decisive response.
not_available They'll demand it.
not_available We're not responding to satisfy bloodlust.
not_available No, sir, we're not.
not_available We're responding because three countries colluded with a terrorist group to explode a nuclear bomb on our soil.
not_available And we have proof.
not_available What if the proof is a lie? 
not_available It isn't.
not_available Are you sure, Mike? Are you sure? I'll tell General Bowden you'll call when you're ready.
not_available Mr Auda, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Don't give me another excuse.
not_available I need to ask you a few questions about the evidence taken from Syed Ali's apartment.
not_available How would I know what was found? You people refuse to include me.
not_available Askthem.
not_available My colleagues might not be interested in the same questions that I am.
not_available I'm trying to determine whether or not the evidence could've been compromised.
not_available Before I tell you anything, tell me whatyou know.
not_available Whatever was found, they're keeping it from me, suggesting it incriminates my country.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You and I are not even supposed to be talking.
not_available You're asking me to help, offering nothing in return.
not_available I know I'm asking a lot.
not_available Asking too much.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available Who is this? The only person who can prove Syed Ali was not in Cyprus in April, meeting Arab leaders.
not_available The recording they found, in case you haven't figured it out, is bogus.
not_available How do you knowthat? 
not_available Because I'm the one who planted it.
not_available On April 5, I placed it in Ali's apartment.
not_available And I'm supposed to believe you? You don't have a choice.
not_available That's why I killed Ali, so you'd have to deal with me.
not_available How do I know you killed him? 
not_available I almost had to take you out too.
not_available Butyou moved.
not_available I'm dying to know whatyou two were talking about.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Kate Warner.
not_available Why? Why do you want her? Get her out of CTU.
not_available Bring her to the intersection of Meridian and Moorpark.
not_available There's a warehouse.
not_available Look for a door under a neon sign.
not_available My access at CTU is limited at best.
not_available You're resourceful.
not_available You'll find a way.
not_available You didn't answer.
not_available Why do you want her? 
not_available Don't worry about that now.
not_available She hasn't been released.
not_available She's in debriefing.
not_available You got 30 minutes.
not_available Bring her to the warehouse.
not_available You'll have a problem if you don't get out.
not_available I'll call the cops.
not_available It's nothing like that! I just need a fewthings! Will you lighten up? My wife's pregnant.
not_available Here's some money.
not_available I'll be quick.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available You have to help me.
not_available Sorry, I can't do anything.
not_available I'll pay you, all right? How much? I don't Don't walk away! 
not_available Just find another store.
not_available How hard would it be to open up for one minute?! There's another store ten miles down the road, west on Route 14.
not_available No, we're going to the mountains! 
not_available I'm closed.
not_available I'm not gonna tell you again.
not_available Don'tyou know what's going on?! 
not_available I'm calling the cops.
not_available Look, I have cash.
not_available I'll pay you double.
not_available I already closed out the register.
not_available Please, tell him to let me in.
not_available My wife's pregnant.
not_available She can't be here.
not_available Look, open the damn door! 
not_available That's it.
not_available That is it.
not_available Come on! 
not_available 911? Some guy's trying to bust into my store.
not_available Is the store open? 
not_available No, but he's threatening me.
not_available What's your location? 
not_available It's King's Liquor, Soledad Canyon Road.
not_available Offiicers are on their way.
not_available They always come out at night.
not_available All kinds of crazy people.
not_available It's starting.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Don't give me that.
not_available "It's starting." What the hell's that supposed to mean? No! Stop it! Stop! You should have let me in.
not_available I told you to let me in! 
not_available Now get out of here! I didn't mean for this to happen.
not_available I'm just trying to get to the mountains.
not_available I said, go! Give me the gun.
not_available I'm not gonna hurt anyone, I promise.
not_available Just go.
not_available Go! 
not_available Michelle Dessler.
not_available Hey, it's me, Jack.
not_available Was Yusuf Auda helpful? 
not_available No, notyet.
not_available He's got some trust issues.
not_available I'm right behind you.
not_available I thinkthere's another way to prove that the Cyprus recording was faked.
not_available But I'm gonna need your help 
not_available you're gonna have to trust me.
not_available Yeah, whatever you need.
not_available OK, I'll get backto you in a minute.
not_available You should have let me in when I asked you.
not_available My wife is seven months pregnant.
not_available I didn't want to hurt anyone.
not_available Just go.
not_available After I pay.
not_available I told you I had money, I didn't come here to steal.
not_available I said, I wanna pay!
