not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Livy, it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement.
not_available In the meantime, I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff.
not_available I'd like that to be you.
not_available I have Larry Moss calling for you.
not_available Ma'am, we have evidence Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala as a base to manufacture biological weapons.
not_available You saying these weapons are on U.S.
not_available Soil? We suspect they're at the Starkwood headquarters in Virginia.
not_available You're not suggesting Starkwood intends to use those weapons to attack this country? Given their actions today, we need to move on Starkwood immediately.
not_available They're coming.
not_available And they'll be coming with everything they've got.
not_available And the only thing that's gonna stop them is getting these weapons ready to deploy.
not_available Tell me what the F.B.I.
not_available Knows.
not_available I don't know anything, Mr.
not_available Hodges.
not_available Get him out ofhere and do what you have to do.
not_available I'm not spending the rest of my life in prison becauseJonas Hodges has lost his mind.
not_available You know where the weapons are? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Larry, where's Jack? He managed to secure the weapons, but Starkwood got 'em back.
not_available Jack was exposed.
not_available But there has to be something that you can do to help him.
not_available There's no cure.
not_available We've got a location on the weapon.
not_available We're getting ready to stage a raid on the compound.
not_available I want to go.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't allow it.
not_available I'm the only one who's seen the canisters.
not_available I know exactly what we're looking for.
not_available But you're sick.
not_available We have no idea when you're gonna start showing symptoms.
not_available You're right.
not_available Where are the damn weapons? He played me.
not_available Little old Seaton bought us some time.
not_available We're gonna do a pointby
not_available point search of this entire compound.
not_available There are biological weapons on this facility.
not_available We're not going anywhere without them.
not_available You try to advance any farther, you will be fired upon.
not_available The following takes place between 12:00 a.m.
not_available And 1:00 a.m.
not_available I count three platoons at least.
not_available Everything MI L
not_available SPEC.
not_available Yeah, they were waiting for us.
not_available This was one big trap.
not_available Renee, we could really use those satellite overheads.
not_available Copy, Larry.
not_available What have we got? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Subnet's been crashing.
not_available Okay, wait, wait, wait.
not_available Here we go.
not_available I've got Sat 5 retasking now.
not_available Somebody talk to me.
not_available What are you seeing? Larry, you've got hostiles on all sides.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Find me an opening.
not_available I'm looking, but there's no way through.
not_available Okay, heads up.
not_available Is everybody seeing this? Larry? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, we're seeing it.
not_available That's Hodges.
not_available The men are at the ready, sir.
not_available Appreciate your presence.
not_available Where else would I be? Who's in charge here? 
not_available I am.
not_available Agent Moss.
not_available You need to move your men and allow us to proceed.
not_available I want you off our property and I want you to release my man.
not_available You have no right to take him hostage.
not_available I have an order from the president of the United States.
not_available To search this building for weapons that do not exist.
not_available Have you looked? Are there weapons of mass destruction? Are there weapons of any kind? Is there anything in here at all? Agent Moss who dreamed up this charade? Give me a name.
not_available Let's get to the bottom of this.
not_available You wanna talk to me, Mr.
not_available Hodges, get these guns off of my head.
not_available You think you have a gun at your head? You know what I've got? I've got the United States government sending SWAT teams and attack helicopters in the middle of the night.
not_available I've got a government that I served faithfully for 30 years dreaming up B.S.
not_available Accusations so politicians too cowardly to show their faces can dismantle my company.
not_available That's what I've got.
not_available You've got five minutes to get these
not_available these helicopters flying out of here with all of you on board.
not_available You don't wanna do this.
not_available Five minutes.
not_available And I want my man back.
not_available Renee, you get that? 
not_available Yeah, we did.
not_available What options do we have? 
not_available In five minutes? I know there's no time to bring in more tac support, so give me something else.
not_available All right, Larry, give me a second.
not_available Stand by.
not_available That's it.
not_available I wanna show you something.
not_available Hodges just gave us five minutes to clear the base.
not_available We lost that situation.
not_available We were outmaneuvered.
not_available But I think I found us a new way in.
not_available Look.
not_available These are Senator Mayer's files.
not_available This is Douglas Knowles.
not_available He's the chairman of Starkwood.
not_available He was actually helping the senator with the investigation.
not_available He's the one who brokered the deal to open the company's books.
not_available What, another insider? Didn't we just get burned? 
not_available Just listen.
not_available Knowles was loyal to Hodges for almost 20 years and now he's secretly helping the senator take down Starkwood? He's scared of something.
not_available This man wants to help us.
not_available It's worth a shot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Make the call.
not_available Knowles.
not_available Mr.
not_available Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I got your number from Senator Mayer.
not_available Senator Mayer is dead.
not_available Yes, sir, I know.
not_available I was with him when he was killed
not_available by one of your employees, a man named John Quinn.
not_available You have no idea how much I was hoping someone would call.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Things are very out of control.
not_available Are you aware of what's happening on your base? I'm watching it with my own eyes.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Is pinned down.
not_available They say they're looking for bioweapons.
not_available Sir, Jonas Hodges is in possession of a military grade bioweapon a prion variant developed in Africa with GeneralJuma.
not_available Well, it's not where they think it is.
not_available They're all standing in front of an empty hangar.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Was deliberately led to the wrong location by a man named Seaton but I promise you, sir, the weapon is on your base.
not_available I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters.
not_available They were ferried back to Starkwood approximately 90 minutes ago.
not_available Ninety minutes agoJonas was handing down his new strategy to the board
not_available stonewall the government, no cooperation whatsoever.
not_available Can't believe this is happening.
not_available Sir, this is happening, and I promise you the weapons are on your base.
not_available Do you have any idea where they might be? Think I might.
not_available Mr.
not_available Knowles, I wanna put you in touch with one of my men in the field.
not_available Can I call you right back? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Go.
not_available Some of the men weren't happy drawing down on federal agents.
not_available It's understandable.
not_available I had hoped not to include the rank and file.
not_available I mean, you can count on 'em.
not_available Let's show our guests the door.
not_available Let's move! Into position! 
not_available Jack, I'm on comm.
not_available You're on with me and Agent Walker.
not_available Hodges and his men have repositioned themselves.
not_available We're gonna have to move fast.
not_available Larry, I want you and your men to pull out on Hodges's timetable.
not_available Tony, you're gonna need to find a way to stay behind.
not_available We're gonna get your vectors over to a man that we contacted inside Starkwood.
not_available His name is Douglas Knowles.
not_available He believes he knows where the weapons are.
not_available Isn't this how we got into this mess
not_available Almeida and some supposedly friendly contact? Knowles is chairman of the Starkwood board but he was cooperating with Senator Mayer's investigation of the company.
not_available Larry, he is all that we've got.
not_available All right.
not_available I got 400 eyeballs trained on me right now.
not_available How the hell are we supposed to get Almeida to stay behind? Larry, I need you and your men to create a diversion to cover Tony's escape.
not_available Look, we need to make this work.
not_available If you all get on those helicopters together, we are gonna lose this weapon for good.
not_available Larry, are you on board with this? We gotta go.
not_available Larry, we need to know.
not_available Are you on board? I'll do what I can.
not_available Take his bag.
not_available All right, let's go! We're standing down! 
not_available You're coming with me.
not_available Hey, wait a minute.
not_available This wasn't part of the deal.
not_available What deal? Far as I could tell, they couldn't care about you one way or the other.
not_available Moss, you take these handcuffs off of me, or it's gonna get really ugly.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Soldier! Get the hell outta here, Moss.
not_available You don't wanna test us.
not_available Let's go! 
not_available Don't move.
not_available No! Doug Knowles.
not_available Jack Bauer sent me.
not_available Come on.
not_available The street's solid security cameras.
not_available I'll take you to a restricted area.
not_available It's on the east perimeter.
not_available It's a good chance the weapons are there.
not_available Place is crawlin'.
not_available I don't know how we're gonna make it.
not_available I'll take care of that.
not_available Jack, I'm with Knowles.
not_available I'm gonna need satellite support on the east perimeter.
not_available Jack, I need support.
not_available Do you copy? Jack.
not_available Renee! Anybody! 
not_available Copy, Tony.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I've got you just off the landing pad.
not_available No hostiles in your immediate vicinity.
not_available Proceed at your own discretion.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Which way? Come on.
not_available Jack.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Tony and Knowles have connected.
not_available We're good.
not_available It's time to call the White House with an update.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Madam President, excuse the interruption.
not_available Jack Bauer's on line seven.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, tell me you have the bioweapon.
not_available Madam President, I'm afraid that's not the case.
not_available Our search was stopped by armed mercenaries on Starkwood's base.
not_available Agent Moss and his men were forced to withdraw from a firefight they most certainly would have lost.
not_available Are you saying Hodges's men were ready to fire on federal agents? 
not_available Yes, ma'am, that's correct.
not_available My God! Who does he think he is? Madam President, despite the setback, I am confident the weapons are still there.
not_available I reached out to Starkwood's chairman.
not_available He is willing to cooperate.
not_available He's with Tony Almeida now.
not_available They are moving towards a secure area on the base 
not_available where we believe the weapons are being held.
not_available Very good.
not_available Tim, what's our troop status? 
not_available Mobilizing.
not_available Secretary of defense says they're still several hours out.
not_available At which point we have a war on our hands against 1,500 mercenaries armed with bioweapons.
not_available Madam President, I do believe that a surgical air strike will work as long as we can pinpoint the exact location of the weapon.
not_available And you can do that? 
not_available Yes, I believe we can.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, you've seen the canisters containing the bioweapons.
not_available You know what they look like.
not_available Is that correct? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Then we'll need you to verify the canisters once Almeida has located them.
not_available No more mistakes.
not_available We're gonna need visual confirmation from you, Bauer
not_available eyes on.
not_available Jack, we have got to get this part right.
not_available I understand.
not_available Anything else? Jack, I have been told that you were exposed to the pathogen.
not_available How you doing? Right now I'm fine, Madam President.
not_available Thank you for asking.
not_available Thank you for your service.
not_available I'm not giving up on you.
not_available Keep me informed.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I don't have a lot of time.
not_available What's going on? That's what I've been trying to ask you.
not_available I've called three times.
not_available It's kinda crazy here right now.
not_available Unless it's urgent, I gotta call you back.
not_available I'm hearing rumors that theJoint Chiefs have been called in.
not_available It's not a big deal.
not_available They're just doing a final assessment before lowering the alert level.
not_available Olivia, don't do this.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm telling you the truth.
not_available Really? Because I've got a source in the port authority container yard who's using terms like weapons of mass destruction.
not_available So naturally I'm wondering if that's why theJoint Chiefs are having a meeting.
not_available Look, I can't talk about it.
not_available It's obviously a question of national security.
not_available But you have my word.
not_available I'll tell you as soon as I can.
not_available I wanna know now.
not_available I just gave you a big story, Ken.
not_available You'll have to wait.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Don't hang up on me, Olivia.
not_available That'd be a big mistake.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? All right, you want me to say it? Fine, I'll say it.
not_available Think how your mother will feel when she hears that you forced out her chief of staff so you could take over his position.
not_available He was incompetent.
not_available Yeah, well, it won't play that way on the morning news.
not_available So talk to me.
not_available Now.
not_available I can't talk here.
not_available I'm in the Roosevelt Continental, Room 1271.
not_available You've got half an hour.
not_available Agent Pierce, please get a car ready.
not_available I have to make a quick run.
not_available All right, Jack, we're here.
not_available Knowles says there's been increased activity in this area for several days now.
not_available I'm looking at about a half a dozen buildings.
not_available Could be any one of'em.
not_available Copy that, Tony.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We're getting infrared up now.
not_available I'm counting seven buildings in your immediate vicinity.
not_available The building directly southeast of your current position is showing no infrared signal.
not_available I'm guessing they're using a blackout shield.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll try there first.
not_available You see any patrols coming our way? Negative.
not_available You're clear.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Jack, Knowles's key card isn't working.
not_available We're gonna need electronic support here.
not_available There should be an R
not_available 6 interface module on the back of your comm device.
not_available It's a card key.
not_available Yeah, I know what that is.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Plugging in now.
not_available Okay, we're up.
not_available Cormac Z series.
not_available We're looking at a five
not_available digit key protected by an A.E.S.
not_available Block cipher.
not_available Running combinations.
not_available Okay, Tony, you've got a vehicle coming your way.
not_available It's east of you, about a hundred yards.
not_available Take cover down there.
not_available How much longer? How much more time do you need? 
not_available I only have two out of five digits.
not_available We're pretty exposed here.
not_available Jack? 
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stay down.
not_available Two more numbers, Tony.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available We still got two digits to go.
not_available Pull around.
not_available Take a closer look.
not_available We're not gonna make it.
not_available Sit tight.
not_available Doug, where are you
not_available Doug! Whoa, whoa.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa! 
not_available Hold your position.
not_available May I see some I.D.
not_available Doug Knowles.
not_available Damn it.
not_available One to go.
not_available I apologize, Mr.
not_available Knowles.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges has ordered the base cleared of all nonessential personnel.
not_available Nonessential personnel? Chairman of the board.
not_available I realize that, but we're dealing with a heightened security situation here so I'll need to know what you're doing in this area.
not_available Jonas called a late
not_available night board meeting.
not_available That's what I'm doing here.
not_available Sir, that meeting ended nearly two hours ago.
not_available Got it.
not_available We're in.
not_available I don't have to explain myself to you, you know.
not_available I'm sorry, sir, but you do.
not_available Sir, I don't believe you're hearing me.
not_available No, I don't think you're hearing me! I built this company, and I don't need you telling me where I can and cannot walk! Understood? I need you to come with me, sir.
not_available Right this way.
not_available I'm in, but they got Knowles.
not_available Do you think he's gonna say anything? I don't know.
not_available But I'd better get in and out as fast as possible just in case he does.
not_available Tony, the president needs a visual on the weapons before she'll launch an attack.
not_available She needs your eyes on the canisters and a confirmation byJack.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'm moving.
not_available Good.
not_available Jack? 
not_available S
not_available Stay here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Jack? Jack! Jack? Jack! Jack! Jack.
not_available Get me the medic! 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We just found Mr.
not_available Knowles alone, just outside the restricted zone.
not_available Did he have an explanation? Yes, sir.
not_available He said he was walking.
not_available Walking.
not_available Should I take him to Stokes for interrogation, sir? You're suggesting what, soldier
not_available that we strap him down, extract a confession because he was walking? He's the chairman of the board.
not_available Uh, I was just requesting instructions, sir, what you'd like done.
not_available I'd like you to take him to his office make sure he's comfortable and stay with him until I arrive.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Will that be all? Call zone nine.
not_available Have them double down security.
not_available Let's make sure that Mr.
not_available Knowles was, in fact, alone.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available Half an hour.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll need to know the minute it's done.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Aaron, I'd like you to wait in the hall, if that's okay.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor, you tasked me with handling your security.
not_available Can't allow you to enter a hotel room I haven't vetted.
not_available Aaron, I appreciate the concern but you can see the door from here I have you on speed dial and I can scream very loudly when the occasion demands.
not_available I just need two minutes to wrangle a reporter.
not_available Really, I'll be fine.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be here if you need me.
not_available Want a drink? No.
not_available I assume you don't mind if I do.
not_available It's been a day.
not_available I gotta tell you, I don't like being threatened.
not_available That was unfortunate.
not_available I apologize.
not_available We've known each other a long time, Ken.
not_available I thought we had an understanding.
not_available We do.
not_available I wanna keep it that way.
not_available We both do.
not_available Am I right? Okay, so, told you I have this source
not_available cop out at the port authority container yard.
not_available Okay.
not_available He told me he saw these professional assassin types get into an intense firefight out there a couple hours ago.
not_available According to him, someone hijacked a W.M.D.
not_available Out to God knows where.
not_available That's true.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh, I want to know all about it.
not_available Look, if you think all you've gotta do is nod your head, confirming what I already know then we've got a problem.
not_available It's national security, Ken.
not_available I can't tell you.
not_available I'm saying you can.
not_available If this story breaks, it would create a panic.
not_available People would be hurt.
not_available If you knew what it was, you'd understand why it's gotta stay a secret.
not_available Right.
not_available Exactly.
not_available I'd understand.
not_available Have a little faith, okay? All right.
not_available There is a bioweapon in the container yard.
not_available That's what they were fighting over.
not_available It was developed by Starkwood in Africa.
not_available Starkwood? 
not_available Right.
not_available They moved it to their base about 30 miles from here.
not_available So it's there right now.
not_available So this is what theJoint Chiefs are discussing
not_available what to do about that.
not_available Olivia.
not_available The president ordered an air strike as soon as the exact location of the canisters was known.
not_available So you see why you can't run with this.
not_available Really, Ken, you can't.
not_available A lot of lives are at stake.
not_available The entire plan depends on surprise.
not_available You get that, right? Maybe you're right.
not_available Maybe I need to kill this story.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What I mean is maybe somebody could convince me.
not_available What are you saying? Y
not_available You know what I'm saying.
not_available You're beautiful when you get all patriotic.
not_available I ever tell you that? 
not_available That's over.
not_available We agreed.
not_available Well, you agreed.
not_available Really.
not_available I don't want to do this.
not_available N
not_available Ken.
not_available Then say no.
not_available This is pan
not_available dopamine.
not_available It should control the shaking.
not_available Here, apply pressure.
not_available You can give yourself an injection once every two hours.
not_available More if needed.
not_available Think I'll need more? 
not_available In all likelihood, yes.
not_available The onset of symptoms so soon after exposure suggests bio
not_available agent is more virulent than we thought.
not_available All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.
not_available I understand.
not_available There's something you may want to consider though.
not_available What's that? Bryden University has been funding some studies on prion diseases.
not_available The work is purely experimental at this point, but it does suggest treatment.
not_available That's good news.
not_available I don't want to get anyone's hopes up here.
not_available We're talking a slight chance a possible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor.
not_available An immediate family member would make the best donor candidate.
not_available I saw your file.
not_available It says you have a daughter, right? 
not_available I don't want my daughter involved in this.
not_available Jack, if there's a chance
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer
not_available Doctor, thank you for everything you've done.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I need to get back to work.
not_available Jack.
not_available This is none of your business.
not_available It's my business when you're having a seizure in the middle of the F.B.I.
not_available You heard the doctor.
not_available The medication will mask the symptoms.
not_available Why won't you even talk about this? Talk about what? 
not_available The experimental procedure.
not_available Because there's nothing to talk about.
not_available She's your daughter, and you're not even gonna let her know? 
not_available That's right.
not_available So you're just not even gonna try.
not_available Renee, I know you're trying to help, but you don't know what you're talking about here.
not_available My daughter and I, we don't talk, okay? So please just let it go.
not_available It should be her choice.
not_available Well, it's not.
not_available I'm the one who's dying.
not_available It's my choice.
not_available No sign of the target yet, but Tony's working on it.
not_available You look better.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tony, can you hear me? 
not_available Jack, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Okay, Tony, we're seeing new activity outside the building.
not_available Two vehicles, eight hostiles.
not_available Looks like a security detail.
not_available You think Knowles gave him up? 
not_available Tony, they're moving straight for your point of entry.
not_available Eight hostiles and closing.
not_available Yeah, I hear 'em.
not_available You wanna regroup? 
not_available No, I wanna get this over with.
not_available It's clear.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Clear.
not_available Point! Point! We're clear.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Team Three, we're clear.
not_available Copy that, Three.
not_available Proceed.
not_available Haven't seen you here before.
not_available They just sent eight of us over here, sir.
not_available Why? Is something wrong? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Just, you know, precautions.
not_available Quite right.
not_available Can't be paranoid enough.
not_available I'm in the main building.
not_available Copy.
not_available We're with you.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available I've got you at 125 feet M.S.L., approximately That's right.
not_available I'm four floors down.
not_available Got no information on any kind of subterranean floors for that building.
not_available Believe me, they're here.
not_available Epoxyhardened walls, poured
not_available concrete ceilings.
not_available I have a visual on the weapon.
not_available Sending images for verification now.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Those are the canisters.
not_available I'll notify Admiral Smith.
not_available Target is located and confirmed.
not_available Tony, those are the canisters.
not_available Jack, it looks like they're transferring the pathogens from the canisters into some sort of delivery system.
not_available It's on the move.
not_available Copy that.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Renee's phoning in the coordinates.
not_available Everything's gonna be dust in the next 10 minutes.
not_available Get outta there now.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Withdrawing.
not_available Okay, men.
not_available You wanna explain this, Jonas? I'm arrested by our own security force held captive in my own office like a prisoner.
not_available They won't allow me a phone call, even to you to find out what the hell is going on! Well.
not_available That's a lot of complaints, Doug.
not_available You done? You were supposed to be home hours ago.
not_available Why'd they find you snooping around? I saw the F.B.I.
not_available Raid.
not_available They say we have bioweapons.
not_available Which they did not find.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available Is it true? You remember when I first brought you out here, 20 years ago? There was nothing here.
not_available Nothing.
not_available And out of the damned mud, we built this place
not_available the largest private army in the hemisphere, maybe the world.
not_available And we pulled America's ass out of the fire again and again and again.
not_available Answer the question! I am.
not_available Every day we've done things that the government itself could not or would not do.
not_available "Get this done." That's what they said.
not_available "Here's your mission." Nobody asked how anything was gonna be done.
not_available Nobody wanted to know.
not_available All anyone wanted was results, and we delivered.
not_available No one's questioning that.
not_available No one's questioning that? You're not insane, are you? The Senate.
not_available The committees.
not_available The president! Every chattering nonentity in Washington is out there with their standard operating procedures saying, "How was this done? '" "How was that done? '" Tearing at us, trying to bring us down, every one of them.
not_available I kept this country strong, I kept it safe and I will not be persecuted for that.
not_available Jonas, you cannot start a war against the people you're supposed to protect.
not_available We were at war, Doug the moment they decided to dismantle us.
not_available And as for particular weapons as for your question, let me rephrase it.
not_available Are we prepared to defend ourselves? We are.
not_available Jonas.
not_available You can't take on the federal government.
not_available Yeah, well you never were one for thinking big.
not_available Twenty years.
not_available I treated you like a son.
not_available Twenty years.
not_available A little loyalty.
not_available Wasn't that the least I deserved? 
not_available Yes? Sir, we just got an alert from one of our radar intercepts.
not_available There's a squadron of F
not_available 18s headed our way out of Virginia Beach.
not_available Sir? 
not_available What's the E.T.A.
not_available Less than 10 minutes.
not_available What's our readiness? 
not_available How many? There are three loaded.
not_available You place a call to the president.
not_available I'll be there momentarily.
not_available You probably think I'm the scum of the earth right now.
not_available All I care about is that you don't run the Starkwood story.
not_available Oh, you're a real sport, taking one for the team like this.
not_available Look at me.
not_available You won't run it, right? 
not_available I'm sorry, Livy.
not_available What? I have to run it.
not_available Breaking something this big'll put me over the top in New York.
not_available I'll make sure nobody knows any of it came from you.
not_available You lying son of a bitch.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available I did what I needed to do to get ahead, just like you.
not_available There's no comparison.
not_available Running that story will harm the country.
not_available I've been in Washington a lot longer than you.
not_available You'll see.
not_available This is how the game is played.
not_available Actually, Ken, this is how the game is played.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available You run that story or ever try to blackmail me again and I'll make sure everyone knows just how you get your leads.
not_available I think your wife will be especially interested.
not_available From everything you've told me, that's gonna be one nasty divorce.
not_available You bitch.
not_available Find a new beat, Ken.
not_available I don't wanna see you around the White House again.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Gotta take this.
not_available Hi.
not_available Where in the world are you? I'm sorry.
not_available I had a meeting on K Street.
not_available I had to run interference with a reporter.
not_available Are the press onto this? 
not_available Not anymore.
not_available I took care of it.
not_available I need you here, Livy.
not_available We've had confirmation of the bioweapons and the air strike is happening now.
not_available I'll be there in five minutes.
not_available Tenhut! Where are we, Admiral? The F18s have been loaded with bunker
not_available buster ordnance and will be in range in seven minutes.
not_available What's the risk of the pathogen spreading to the surrounding areas? Minimal.
not_available We're using white phosphorous charges, which burn at 5,000 degrees
not_available more than enough to incinerate the pathogen.
not_available And that's been confirmed by the C.D.C.
not_available It has.
not_available Weapons are ready? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Call to the president? The call is in process.
not_available It's an historic day, gentlemen
not_available a great day for Starkwood.
not_available Too bad Mr.
not_available Knowles can't be joining us.
not_available Weapons control status: Yellow/tight.
not_available Fighters entering the I.P.
not_available Engage airspace coordination area.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Madam President, command and control is reporting a phased array radar system is active inside the Starkwood compound.
not_available Meaning what, exactly? They know we're coming.
not_available Is there any evidence of an antiaircraft artillery threat? Intelligence is indicating no such capability on the ground.
not_available Madam President, there's a phone call for you.
not_available It's Jonas Hodges.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available Ma'am, he's requested a private conversation.
not_available He says he's established a proprietary line in the ops room.
not_available A proprietary line? How did he manage that? L
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Hello? Madam President, let me begin by saying that I'm truly sorry it's come to this but I have to insist that you turn your planes around immediately.
not_available You're in no position to issue ultimatums, Mr.
not_available Hodges.
not_available Well, maybe I am.
not_available You remember several years ago, Madam President Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan? I remember it very well.
not_available I fought that deployment.
not_available And you lost.
not_available You'll also recall that we requisitioned a missile system at that time
not_available Python 5s.
not_available Well, three of those missiles are now loaded with the pathogen and aimed at cities on our Eastern Seaboard.
not_available You're bluffing.
not_available As a sign of good faith I'm willing to show you that I'm
not_available that I'm not bluffing.
not_available You see that, Madam President? Hmm? You call this good faith? You are waging war on your own country, Jonas.
not_available Well, of course I wouldn't see it that way.
not_available What do you want? Well, we can have that conversation a little later on at the White House.
not_available You think we're going to just sit down and discuss this? Yes, I do
not_available in the Oval Office, in confidence, within the hour.
not_available But in the meantime, I think it is to both of our advantage that the American people do not know the exact circumstance of this standoff and so you will keep this conversation to yourself and turn the planes around.
not_available And if you do not comply, Madam President I will have no choice but to launch those missiles.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges
not_available And remember, I can detect any action you take against our facility.
not_available You have 30 seconds.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges? Mr.
not_available Hodges? Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.
not_available Madam President
not_available Just do as I say.
not_available Ma'am, with all respect
not_available Damn it, Admiral! Abort the air strike immediately! This is Admiral Smith.
not_available I have an abort order from the president.
not_available Take fighters off target.
not_available Repeat: Take fighters off target.
not_available Stand by for confirmation.
not_available Roger that.
not_available We're standing down, Madam President.
