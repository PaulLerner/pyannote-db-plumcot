not_available Excuse me, Miss Driscoll.
not_available What is it, Chloe? Intelligence indicated the possibility of an attack at eight this morning.
not_available A Turkish national on the FBI watch list, Tomas Sherek, was last seen in the city.
not_available It's Tomas.
not_available Did Dar get the briefcase? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's on his way to you now.
not_available So far, everything is on schedule.
not_available The briefcase is on its way.
not_available When it gets here, you'll take it to the warehouse.
not_available What we will accomplish today will change the world.
not_available We're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this.
not_available I found something on the Net I think you should know about.
not_available I think someone's positioning code for a major Internet attack.
not_available The thing is, not all the code remarks are in English.
not_available What language were they in? 
not_available Arabic or Turkish, maybe.
not_available What did you find? 
not_available It was my friend, not me.
not_available What's his name? Andrew Paige.
not_available Is it gonna be uncomfortable? 
not_available What? Going back to CTU.
not_available Seeing Driscoll again.
not_available I don't blame her for her decision.
not_available She forced you out of CTU.
not_available I could have joined other agencies if I still wanted to do field work.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available I know this guy.
not_available Fortunately for you, Jack, it's our problem, not yours.
not_available Erin, listen to me.
not_available This doesn't make sense.
not_available He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the US for a train bombing.
not_available It's not big enough.
not_available We'll consider that when we interrogate him.
not_available I am not messing with you.
not_available You are gonna tell me.
not_available What is happening at eight o'clock? Jack! 
not_available What is your primary objective? Secretary of Defense! Heller.
not_available Did it ever occur to you that these people are using you? Don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason? Because you are my son! Audrey, it's Jack.
not_available Are you still at Richard's? Get your father out of there now! Your father is the real target.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Jack! Audrey? Audrey! Richard Heller? They took my father and my sister.
not_available Come on! It's been over five minutes.
not_available You need to widen your perimeter.
not_available You're not listening to me.
not_available I'm not interested in local law enforcement.
not_available Get Secret Service.
not_available Good.
not_available Get back to me.
not_available Everyone.
not_available Everyone, please listen up.
not_available Secretary of Defense Heller was abducted a few minutes ago, along with his senior policy analyst, Audrey Raines.
not_available He was at his son Richard's house when he was taken.
not_available LAPD is bringing Richard in for questioning.
not_available This is a top
not_available priority situation.
not_available I want all interagency protocols activated immediately.
not_available Move off that page.
not_available Link up to the Secret Service channel.
not_available It's not that simple.
not_available We're locked out.
not_available Why? 
not_available They're sequestering the cabinet.
not_available Driscoll wants the protocols activated.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Break through those channels.
not_available Hack in.
not_available Chloe, move everything from the bombing to the secondary server.
not_available I did that already.
not_available Then sync up the kidnapping and bombing.
not_available I did that too, but I haven't opened a pipe to the Army Criminal Investigation Division yet.
not_available Do it.
not_available On my way to.
not_available I'm looking at it.
not_available They widened the perimeter.
not_available Any ID on transportation? I'm working on it 
not_available I'm gonna have to get back to you.
not_available I need to speak to you.
not_available You're done here.
not_available I'm detaining you.
not_available Erin, listen! Heller is my responsibility.
not_available I need you to reinstate me on a provisional basis 
not_available until I get him back.
not_available You don't give me orders, Jack.
not_available I'm detaining you until an investigator can take your statement.
not_available I'll recommend you're arrested for torturing a suspect and rendering him useless.
not_available You were getting nowhere.
not_available Because of me, Sherek told you all he knows.
not_available You'd better hope so.
not_available Would you please escort Mr.
not_available Bauer to a vacant office until Division gets here? I'm fine.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available President Keeler.
not_available What about him? 
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available All right.
not_available This is Erin Driscoll.
not_available Please hold for the president.
not_available Tell me about the attack on the secretary.
not_available We know that he was taken approximately ten minutes ago.
not_available You had any contact from the kidnappers? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available We have not.
not_available How is it that Secret Service wasn't able to protect him? I understand that he broke his schedule to visit his son.
not_available Somehow, the kidnappers had access to that information.
not_available We're looking into that now.
not_available All right.
not_available We're going to go to an elevated level of security.
not_available Take the appropriate measures.
not_available I understand.
not_available Get them back, Erin.
not_available We're doing everything we can, sir.
not_available Hello.
not_available Mom? 
not_available Hi, sweetie.
not_available I didn't 
not_available Mom, listen.
not_available Get out of the house now.
not_available What are you talking about? Someone's looking for me and they might come for you next.
not_available What kind of trouble are you in? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I found something on the Net.
not_available Now these people are after me.
not_available Andrew, you are being paranoid.
not_available Mom, they killed Melanie.
not_available They killed everybody in the office.
not_available What? 
not_available They shot 'em.
not_available Mom, I'm really scared.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm gonna call the police.
not_available Just get outta there! Get to one of your friends' houses and stay there! Go! Go now! Andrew! 
not_available I said Driscoll wanted me to question you.
not_available What's going on? What are you doing? I'll probably get in trouble, but I don't care.
not_available I may have a way to find Heller.
not_available Why are you telling me? I don't think Driscoll's handling this the right way and I don't trust her, I trust you.
not_available Sit down.
not_available A friend of mine called about 40 minutes ago, someone I went to school with.
not_available He wouldn't call me unless it was serious.
not_available What is it? He noticed computer code planted on the Internet.
not_available How is that connected to Heller? It originated in Turkey, like everything else, 
not_available Sherek, the train bombing.
not_available Where is your friend now? You can see them taking Secretary Heller's son away from the scene now.
not_available That's being done for his own protection, according to police sources.
not_available Those same sources tell us that at least five Secret Service agents were shot 
not_available Hello.
not_available Andrew, it's me.
not_available What did you do, Chloe? Who did you tell? 
not_available What do you mean? Everyone's dead.
not_available They're dead.
not_available Now they're trying to kill me.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Who's dead? What happened? 
not_available Everyone's dead.
not_available They're dead.
not_available After I called you, I went back to my office.
not_available There was a guy there torturing Melanie.
not_available He wanted to know who hacked into their system.
not_available And then he shot her.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Who shot her? 
not_available Who's this? Jack Bauer.
not_available I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.
not_available Andrew, we need your help.
not_available What? Heller was kidnapped less than half an hour ago.
not_available I believe the same people that kidnapped him are chasing you now.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available Son, you've been targeted for a reason.
not_available You know more than you think.
not_available What do I do? 
not_available Where are you? I'm at Union Station.
not_available I'm getting outta town.
not_available No.
not_available You stay put.
not_available The best thing you can do right now is let me bring you in.
not_available Chloe, what should I do? 
not_available You can trust Jack.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll be next to track three at the bottom of the ramp.
not_available Andrew, what are you wearing? Blue jeans, brown jacket and a black bag.
not_available OK, you stay put.
not_available I'll be there in about 30 minutes.
not_available OK.
not_available This is all my fault.
not_available I shouldn't have let Driscoll talk me in to handing it to the FBI.
not_available She did what? 
not_available She told me to give it to the FBI.
not_available Yes.
not_available I found out who stumbled onto our server.
not_available Is he with you now? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll have him shortly.
not_available Find out who he's talked to.
not_available Of course.
not_available And then kill him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is everything in there? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where's Behrooz? 
not_available Upstairs, checking traffic on line.
not_available It's almost time for him to go.
not_available Are you sure you don't want me to take the briefcase to Omar? The plan is in place.
not_available I don't want to deviate.
not_available Why? This is the key to everything we're doing today.
not_available It's a lot to entrust to a teenager.
not_available I told you.
not_available Our whereabouts have to be accounted for today.
not_available Besides, it's because he's a teenager that he won't arouse suspicion.
not_available You're right.
not_available Don't worry, Dina.
not_available We prepared well for today.
not_available The train.
not_available The kidnapping.
not_available It's all gone as expected.
not_available I spoke with Omar.
not_available He's happy.
not_available And he knows Behrooz is the one who will deliver the device? Yes, he knows.
not_available Behrooz will be fine.
not_available We're looking to find a connection between the bombing and Heller's abduction.
not_available Sarah.
not_available NTSB has given us a full passenger list.
not_available We're processing those names now.
not_available What about Heller's son? Is it possible he had something to do with this? We're not counting anything out.
not_available He's being brought here for questioning now.
not_available Erin, I need to speak with you.
not_available Privately, please.
not_available You're testing me, Jack.
not_available Erin, please.
not_available Curtis will hand out assignment protocols.
not_available I want status reports every 15 minutes.
not_available I have information you ignored that seems to be connected to the bombing and kidnapping.
not_available What information? 
not_available A computer programmer, Andrew Paige, accidentally came across a possible Internet strike.
not_available I know.
not_available It was passed on to the FBI.
not_available Yes.
not_available Against CTU protocol.
not_available You abandoned an active investigation during a terrorist strike.
not_available I got confirmation from the LAPD that Andrew Paige's co
not_available workers were all found dead less than 20 minutes ago.
not_available I'll coordinate with FBI and we'll investigate that.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available I talked to the kid.
not_available I'm the only one who knows where he is.
not_available You want that kid picked up, you're gonna have to reinstate me.
not_available I'm having you locked up for impeding me.
not_available You do that and I'll tell the president that you had Sherek in custody over half an hour before Heller was even kidnapped, and you couldn't break him, I did.
not_available Are you threatening me, Jack? I am asking you to let me help rescue Secretary Heller.
not_available This is how it's gonna work.
not_available I'll reinstate your commission on a temporary basis until Heller is safe.
not_available You will not make any unilateral decisions.
not_available You will work as an auxiliary agent under the authority of Ronnie Lobell.
not_available And then I'll hand you over to Division.
not_available What are they gonna do? 
not_available I don't know, but if they wanted me dead, they would have killed me at Richard's house.
not_available Richard.
not_available God.
not_available He was still in the house.
not_available I don't think they went in there.
not_available Listen to me, Audy.
not_available No matter what happens to me, they have no reason to hurt you.
not_available They don't need a reason.
not_available And I don't want you to give 'em one.
not_available Do what they say.
not_available Whatever happens to me, don't provoke them.
not_available If they threaten me, if they hurt me, even if they kill me do what they say.
not_available I only asked for Heller.
not_available I didn't want to kill her without your permission.
not_available Dad! Leave her alone! Don't you touch her! So help me God, I will kill you! Dad! Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! 
not_available Omar! Yes or no? Do not do this! Leave her alone.
not_available Not yet.
not_available We may be able to use her.
not_available Take them away.
not_available Dad.
not_available Dad.
not_available I'm going with Ronnie to pick up Andrew.
not_available Has Driscoll cleared you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's unlike her.
not_available I hope you didn't tell her I gave you the information.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Have we heard anything from any agents that survived the kidnapping? 
not_available There's one.
not_available He's in surgery.
not_available Any other witnesses? The son, Richard.
not_available They're bringing him in now.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you've got anything on Heller or Audrey.
not_available Sure.
not_available Bad luck about Audrey being there when her dad got kidnapped.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm going to my car to get my things.
not_available OK, so let me understand this.
not_available Bauer illegally shoots a suspect and you let him back in the field? He'll only give us the location if I let him work it.
not_available He can't hold back information, Erin.
not_available We don't have time to interrogate him.
not_available It's a simple job.
not_available You pick up the subject and bring him in.
not_available Bauer has not been in the field for a year and a half.
not_available That has consequences Which is why I need you to keep him on a tight leash.
not_available It's not optional, it's an order.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm ready to go.
not_available This is a simple task, Behrooz.
not_available But these are the ones where mistakes can be made.
not_available Drive carefully.
not_available If there is anyone in the area who looks suspicious, drive away and call us.
not_available Understood? Yes.
not_available Hello.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Araz, this is Debbie.
not_available Yes, Debbie, what can I do for you? Can I please talk to Behrooz? 
not_available Let me see if he's here.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What does she want? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Debbie? I've left messages on your cell phone.
not_available Why haven't you called? 
not_available I'm sorry, I've been busy.
not_available Doing what? Working for my father.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available If you're seeing someone else, at least have the decency to tell me.
not_available I'm not seeing anyone else.
not_available Then why are you avoiding me? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available This isn't the right time to do this.
not_available That's what I mean.
not_available You're still avoiding me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Then why can't we talk now? Because I can't.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available Behrooz! Behrooz.
not_available That's not the right way to deal with this situation.
not_available This girl needs to know it's over and that there will be no more phone calls.
not_available I'll take care of it later.
not_available I don't wanna be late getting this to Omar.
not_available You sent Jack Bauer out in the field? 
not_available He'll be with Ronnie.
not_available Yeah, but why? 
not_available He knows our procedures.
not_available And he may have information about Heller.
not_available What is it, Chloe? Curtis, you wanted to know when Richard Heller arrived.
not_available He's on his way to Holding.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Do you want me to choreograph the jurisdictions? No, I'll do it.
not_available Find out what the son knows.
not_available Chloe, I'd like to talk to you.
not_available Has it occurred to you that we might be farther along if you trusted me half as much as you trust Jack Bauer? Miss Driscoll, I'm not in the mood to play the scared student at the principals office.
not_available I came to you with information that my friend Andrew gave to me and you chose to not respond to it.
not_available When you came to me with the information, we were looking for Sherek, were we not? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Wasn't he our most important lead then? 
not_available I guess.
not_available Then my question to you is once we had Sherek in custody, if you felt that your Internet lead was still valuable, why didn't you reprise it? You're right.
not_available I felt more comfortable going to Jack.
not_available Well, at least that's honest.
not_available You can go back to work now.
not_available Check that, please.
not_available For the record, I think Driscoll made a mistake letting you come.
not_available All right.
not_available And just so we're clear, I give the orders.
not_available I'm fine with that.
not_available What happened earlier in Holding with Sherek, I had intel and had no time to do it another way.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available But if you try to exceed my authority again, I will stop you cold.
not_available Fine.
not_available Have Marcy isolate all the death threats Heller's received over the last six months.
not_available I want phone calls, emails, snail mail, everything sent over to CTU for analysis.
not_available Well, for the time being, I'm working with them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, good, thanks.
not_available Has Heller had a lot of death threats lately? 
not_available No more than anyone else in the cabinet.
not_available So what's it like working in DC? For the most part, we solve problems in theory that'll never come into play.
not_available Then why do it? 
not_available I've got my reasons.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available I'm just trying to make some conversation.
not_available I read your file.
not_available It must have really burned you up when Driscoll fired you.
not_available She did me a favor.
not_available I wanted to get my life back.
not_available I wouldn't have been able to if I was still doing field work.
not_available How's the master plan going? Do you have a life yet? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I got a life.
not_available We'll be fine, Audy.
not_available We're still on US soil.
not_available That's not gonna help us if this is some sort of suicide mission.
not_available You said Jack tried to warn you before they grabbed us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's right.
not_available That means he must have a reliable source, which means our chances are good.
not_available Audy, sit down.
not_available I am your father.
not_available Do you trust me? 
not_available Of course I do.
not_available Then listen.
not_available You cannot allow a negative thought to enter your head now.
not_available They will find us.
not_available We will be rescued.
not_available Say it.
not_available Please, Dad, don't.
not_available We will be rescued.
not_available Say it, Audy.
not_available We will be rescued.
not_available We will be rescued.
not_available Take off your clothes.
not_available You first.
not_available Take off your clothes.
not_available OK.
not_available Go to hell.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Dad.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available It's Behrooz.
not_available Behrooz.
not_available Good job, Behrooz.
not_available Debbie, what are you doing here? 
not_available I followed you.
not_available Why? 
not_available Cos I didn't believe you.
not_available I thought you were seeing someone else.
not_available Look around.
not_available Does it look like I'm seeing anybody else? You shouldn't be here.
not_available I'm working for my father.
not_available He doesn't like me socializing at work.
not_available OK.
not_available I get it.
not_available That doesn't explain why you stopped calling me.
not_available It's my parents.
not_available They've got a problem with me seeing someone that's Not Muslim? Yeah.
not_available And that's it? Whatever they say, you do? 
not_available No.
not_available Then what's going on between us? Do you wanna be with me or not? I do, but 
not_available But what? Debbie, I wanna straighten things out, but I can't do it now.
not_available We'll get together later.
not_available Debbie, please.
not_available Is everything ready for Richard Heller? 
not_available Just about.
not_available They're starting to hook him up.
not_available Then let's do it.
not_available Does Driscoll know you're subjecting Heller's son to a lie detector? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is he a suspect? Not exactly, but he's on very poor terms with his father.
not_available I wouldn't wanna rule anything out.
not_available You want to be in the room on this? No, I'll observe through the one
not_available way.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing? 
not_available We wanna make sure you're telling the truth.
not_available Why would I lie to you? My father and my sister have just been kidnapped.
not_available Please sit back, Richard, or I'll have to sedate you.
not_available You can't do this to me.
not_available My father is the secretary of defense.
not_available I understand.
not_available But according to my information, you were about to unleash personal attacks on your father at a rally at Lockheed.
not_available Are you insane? This is America.
not_available I can say what I want in public.
not_available How dare you treat me like a criminal.
not_available I'm not.
not_available You wanna be constructive? Find my father and my sister.
not_available We intend to.
not_available By treating me like I'm guilty of something! Richard, right now, you are the only witness to your father and your sister's kidnapping.
not_available We need your help.
not_available Then get these things off of me and start talking to me like a normal human being.
not_available You don't have anything to hide, do you? 
not_available No.
not_available How's the polygraph? Father.
not_available How did everything go? It went fine.
not_available Omar said one of his men saw you with someone outside the compound.
not_available A young woman.
not_available I was going to tell you.
not_available Who was it? 
not_available Debbie.
not_available Where is she now? 
not_available She didn't see anything.
not_available She saw you at the compound.
not_available It's enough.
not_available We've spent years planning for this, waiting for this day to come.
not_available Now it's here and you've compromised everything.
not_available She didn't see anything.
not_available I made sure of it.
not_available We'll see how much she knows.
not_available Call her and tell her to come here.
not_available Please don't do this.
not_available It's not necessary.
not_available I decide what's necessary, not you.
not_available What are you going to do to her? 
not_available Since when do you question me? How long have we lived in this country, preparing for this day? How long? Four years.
not_available Almost five.
not_available That's how much time can be erased by a simple mistake.
not_available Call her.
not_available Now! Yes, sir.
not_available Tim Felson.
not_available MTA.
not_available Ronnie Lobell.
not_available CTU.
not_available Head of field ops.
not_available Where's track three? 
not_available East entrance.
not_available My guys can lock it down.
not_available We don't wanna draw attention to anything.
not_available The platform's just at the end of this hall.
not_available Hello.
not_available Andrew, it's me.
not_available Where are they? 
not_available On site.
not_available They'll be there any minute.
not_available All right.
not_available Tell 'em to hurry up.
not_available It doesn't work that way.
not_available Stay where you are and I'll talk to you when they bring you in.
not_available Andrew.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you Jack Bauer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Where are we going? I'll explain later.
not_available It's not safe here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Just around the corner.
not_available You sure he said the bottom of the ramp? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hello.
not_available Andrew.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available It's Jack Bauer.
not_available Where are you? Andrew? I can't really talk.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Andrew.
not_available Andrew.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available They got to him before we did.
not_available How did they know where he would be? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available I'll kill you if you don't follow my orders.
not_available Felson, come on.
not_available Alert your MTAs.
not_available Tell 'em we've got a Caucasian male, early 20s, wearing a brown jacket, being taken from here against his will.
not_available Tell your men not to engage the target.
not_available I want a visual and a location.
not_available That's it.
not_available Now.
not_available Where are you taking me? 
not_available This is Marx.
not_available I see the target.
not_available What's your 20? I'm on the train platform.
not_available Target is on the easternmost periphery.
not_available Second
not_available level parking.
not_available Open the door.
not_available They're in a dark blue Lexus.
not_available What's the fastest way? 
not_available Out the back.
not_available Tell your men to stay out of sight.
not_available Stay on the guy, but make sure he doesn't see you.
not_available Lay down.
not_available There he is.
not_available You get the gate.
not_available I'll get the kid out of the car.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait for what? 
not_available This isn't the right play.
not_available What? 
not_available If we follow him, he may lead us to Heller.
not_available Or maybe he won't, but he'll kill the kid.
not_available Right now, this hostile's our best chance to find Secretary Heller.
not_available We'll break him back at CTU.
not_available You don't know if you can break him in time.
not_available This is not a field ops call, Jack.
not_available We need authorization.
not_available I can't take the chance of Driscoll resisting me.
not_available I told you not to go against me, Jack.
not_available Ronnie, please.
not_available You get up.
not_available Interlace your hands behind your head.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Gate four, he's leaving the parking lot.
not_available What do you want me to do? This is Lobell.
not_available I'm moving in now.
not_available Let the front car go ahead and lock in the hostile.
not_available Ronnie.
not_available Ronnie, where you been hit? Can you move? Ronnie.
not_available Give me the keys to the cuffs.
