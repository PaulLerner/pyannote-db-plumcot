not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Hassan's security forces in the Islamic Republic are sweeping through the capital, arresting opposition leaders.
not_available And if he continues, it may deIegitimize the peace accord.
not_available I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr.
not_available President, if you renege on your human rights obligations.
not_available My brother tried to kill me, helped by elements within my own government.
not_available Apparently, killing President Îassan was only part of his brother's plan.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available now believes he's also trying to acquire weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available When can l take possession of the rods? As soon as we have the money.
not_available I found a doctor who can treat him.
not_available No doctors.
not_available Î¤he authorities know about the nuclear material.
not_available Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.
not_available Dr.
not_available Levine.
not_available How did you get in here? 
not_available My brother is sick.
not_available l'm gonna call you an ambulance.
not_available No.
not_available No one can know about this.
not_available No, no.
not_available What do you want from me? You're a data analyst for C.T.U.
not_available You got access to all sorts of good stuff.
not_available Yeah, but not unrestricted access.
not_available Payout's got to be at least six figures.
not_available You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob.
not_available You asking me to go back in? Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her.
not_available It turned violent.
not_available Did he rape her? 
not_available lt looks like he tried a couple of times.
not_available Can we talk about this deal now? l wish it were that simple.
not_available Tie her up.
not_available What? Look, you're making a mistake.
not_available This is the chance of a lifetime.
not_available This operation's over.
not_available Vladimir didn't take the bait.
not_available Renee, it's Jack.
not_available I know you can hear me.
not_available I'm on my way now.
not_available You don't want to do this deal, then you might as well just kill me, because this deal is the only thing that I have.
not_available Do it! Pull the trigger! l had to be sure.
not_available Jack, are you there? What's going on? She's in.
not_available They bought her cover.
not_available The following takes place between 9:00 p.m.
not_available and 10:00 p.m.
not_available Renee, I've got a visual on you.
not_available I'm going offcomm for a minute.
not_available You all right? 
not_available C.Î¤.U., O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available l want you to monitor Renee's comm.
not_available I need to speak to Hastings.
not_available Okay, l'll put you through.
not_available I'm here, Jack.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We need to pull Renee Walker out now.
not_available Based on what? Because she's a danger to herself and this mission.
not_available Ten minutes ago, Laitanan threatened to execute her and she said she was sick of living and wanted to die and she meant it.
not_available She must've been playing him.
not_available No.
not_available She doesn't care what happens to her.
not_available That's what makes her dangerous.
not_available She's like a bomb ready to go off.
not_available We need to get her out of there before that happens.
not_available I understand your concern.
not_available But we can't just roll up this operation before we find those nuclear rods.
not_available We can arrest Laitanan.
not_available If he knows how to find the rods, I will make him talk.
not_available lf you're saying what l think you are, we don't do that anymore.
not_available Î¤hen you people do what you do welI
not_available offer him immunity or something.
not_available Î¤his is the Russian syndicate.
not_available Î¤hey're very secretive.
not_available They protect their own.
not_available lt is highly unlikely that Laitanan would cooperate.
not_available Î¤hen find another way.
not_available I am not gonna let Renee die because C.T.U.
not_available did their job badly.
not_available I will not let that happen.
not_available Do you understand me? Jack, if you can think of something, I will listen.
not_available But right now, Renee's the only hope we have of neutralizing this threat.
not_available And on my order, she stays in play.
not_available Jack? l'll find a way to get her out when I go in as the buyer.
not_available I'll stay under in her place.
not_available Do we have a deal? As long as you can do it without risking the mission.
not_available l give you my word.
not_available Agent Ortiz will meet you at the staging area with a tac team.
not_available He'll have everything you need for your cover.
not_available Hold on.
not_available They're moving.
not_available l need to get back on comm.
not_available We'll go back to my shop, and we wiIl discuss this buyer of yours.
not_available Dana.
not_available Start forwarding mission status reports to the Nuclear Emergency Team at Fort Hamilton.
not_available l want them ready to go in as soon as we find these nuclear rods.
not_available l'm on it, sir.
not_available President Hassan was not harmed in the attack.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's me.
not_available I've got something.
not_available Damn, you're fast.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available Let's hear it.
not_available lt's an N.Y.P.D.
not_available evidence lockup.
not_available According to the manifest, a local vice group just impounded a stash of drug money.
not_available lt'll be held there for the next 48 hours.
not_available How much? All right, what's the plan? You go in and take it.
not_available What do you mean, break into a police station? What, are you out of your mind? lt's not a police station.
not_available It's a warehouse.
not_available Most of the security is automated.
not_available l can manipulate it from here.
not_available You walk in, you walk out with the cash.
not_available I'll talk you through it.
not_available I need to access their security codes, work up a key card to get you inside the warehouse.
not_available How long? 
not_available Meet me outside C.Î¤.U.
not_available in 30 minutes.
not_available Did you take care ofyour situation? Situation? The big mystery you had to leave work for.
not_available Oh, yeah, it's fine.
not_available What do you need, Arlo? l'm getting five percent lag in my drone's A.B.S.
not_available controls.
not_available With everything going on, l think l'm just running hot.
not_available Okay.
not_available l'll make sure to free up some memory space on the auxiliary servers.
not_available Î¤hanks.
not_available You know, if there's something bothering you, you've always got my shoulder to cry on, or any other body part.
not_available l will keep that in mind.
not_available But for now, why don't you focus on running aerial support for Walker and Bauer.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Lugo, take a break.
not_available l want to talk to her alone.
not_available All right, you have my attention.
not_available Tell me about this buyer.
not_available Îis name's Ernst Meier.
not_available German arms dealer.
not_available Never heard of him.
not_available He does most of his business in Asia.
not_available Hejust started branching out into North America.
not_available What's he looking to buy? Weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available You're serious.
not_available Very.
not_available Someone in the Russian syndicate smuggled nuclear fuel rods out of the Ukraine.
not_available They're planning on selling them on the open market.
not_available l have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available I don't, Renee.
not_available But you can find out.
not_available You're very well connected.
not_available l have always admired your ambition, but you're chasing the devil.
not_available Dealing AK47s
not_available no one really cares.
not_available But nuclear material? But the profit is worth it.
not_available You need money, huh? You can always come work for me.
not_available No, I'm doing this so l don't ever have to work for anyone.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available lf I could find out, what would it be worth? I don't have to tell you, that is more money than you could possibly know what to do with.
not_available Look, Meier says these rods are going to be sold soon, so if we want to make a counter bid it has to happen fast.
not_available lf you don't know anything, tell me so l can go somewhere else.
not_available Îow well do you know this man? Do you trust him? Î¤here's no one l trust more.
not_available l've been with him for two years.
not_available What do you mean "with"? 
not_available It's professional.
not_available Can you help us or not? l'll make a few calls, see what I can find out.
not_available But, uh, l'm going to have to meet this Meier.
not_available And l'd need a good faith payment up front.
not_available How much? Five million.
not_available Î¤hat's a lot of money, Vlad.
not_available Look, l'm taking big risk just making these calls.
not_available Besides, five million is nothing compared to what your buyer will have to pay for nucIear fueI rods.
not_available Fine.
not_available l'll ask him, but I can't make any promises.
not_available lf he wants my help, that's the price of admission.
not_available Okay.
not_available There's a parking garage on the corner of 1 2th and Market Street.
not_available Someone will meet him there, on the roof.
not_available Once the money is in our account, they'Il bring him back here, we will talk.
not_available l'll give him a call.
not_available lt's good to see you.
not_available You're going to make me start losing sleep again.
not_available l'll let you know what Meier says.
not_available l'll tell my men.
not_available l'll give you privacy for your call.
not_available Jack, were you listening? 
not_available Yeah, we're ready to wire the money to his account.
not_available When can you be there? As soon as I finish prepping my cover.
not_available l'm almost at the staging area.
not_available Thirty minutes tops.
not_available How you holding up? It's hard to be in the same room with the son of a bitch.
not_available But l can handle it.
not_available I'll be there as soon as I can.
not_available Okay.
not_available Morphine will take effect in just a few moments.
not_available Don't worry, Oleg.
not_available You're going to be fine.
not_available lt, uh
not_available lt might help me if l knew exactly what happened to your brother.
not_available Îow did he get exposed to weapons
not_available grade uranium? Don't worry about that.
not_available Just make sure he lives.
not_available It's him again, isn't it? Î¤he second time he's called.
not_available You should answer it.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Why aren't you picking up your phone? l called you twice.
not_available Must have been in the tunnel.
not_available Ulana says you're not at the house yet.
not_available Where are you? Stuck in traffic.
not_available Tell her it's going to be a while.
not_available How's Oleg? He's okay.
not_available Sleeping.
not_available Let me know when you get to the house.
not_available I will.
not_available lt was him, wasn't it? Hey.
not_available Don't worry, okay? By the time he finds out, you'll already have been treated.
not_available Then it won't matter.
not_available l
not_available lt's just your brother's test results.
not_available Okay.
not_available You say or do anything that l don't like, and my men will kill your wife and daughter.
not_available Open the door.
not_available The blood work you ordered, Doctor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Uh, l noticed there was no patient name.
not_available Uh, yeah, you're right.
not_available I forgot to put that down.
not_available Oh, I can do it for you.
not_available No, l'll take care of it later.
not_available Is everything okay, Doctor? Fine.
not_available I'm just working a IittIe later than I expected.
not_available Okay.
not_available You did good.
not_available What does it say? Your brother has been exposed to at least 400 rems, and the chemical toxicity of the radiation is causing renal failure.
not_available l know it's serious.
not_available Can you help him or not? He needs a bone marrow transplant.
not_available Î¤hat requires a six
not_available man surgical team in a fully equipped facility.
not_available There has to be something you can do right here, right now.
not_available Î¤here are some drugs I could give him that will help flush out the radiation and stimuIate white blood cell repair, but that's a haIf measure.
not_available l can't guarantee he'll recover.
not_available My brother is not going to die.
not_available lt's up to you, Doctor.
not_available Now get to work.
not_available Okay, got it.
not_available Î¤hat was C.Î¤.U.
not_available Your offshore account's in place.
not_available They're forwarding instructions to your P.D.A.
not_available on how to wire the money.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I spoke with Hastings.
not_available He said as soon as you're under and we have confirmation that Laitanan can get us to the nuclear rods, we're pulling Renee Walker out.
not_available That's right.
not_available What's going on, Jack? Îastings said something about her being unstable.
not_available I don't have time to explain it.
not_available Just follow my lead.
not_available How do you want to work this without breaking cover? l don't know yet.
not_available All right.
not_available I got two teams running coordinated drive
not_available bys.
not_available They'll extract her when she's clear.
not_available No.
not_available Î¤hese guys own this neighborhood.
not_available Î¤hey'll have eyes everywhere.
not_available Your men will run the risk of being spotted.
not_available l've done this before, Jack.
not_available l ran an operation just like it in Fallujah.
not_available And l'm in command.
not_available You're going to do exactly what I tell you.
not_available Jack, stand by.
not_available I hear him coming.
not_available Laitanan's back.
not_available l need to listen to this.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Renee.
not_available l spoke to my men.
not_available Did you get your buyer on the phone? Îe agreed to the money.
not_available Îe'll be at the parking garage in 20 minutes.
not_available Very good.
not_available We have a little time to catch up.
not_available Do you still like your single malts? Not right now.
not_available You sure? It's 30
not_available year.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available What you said earlier, down at the river
not_available tired of living, wanting to die.
not_available What happened to you? 
not_available lt's not important.
not_available It is to me.
not_available Look, you don't have to worry about it.
not_available Once I make this deal, none of it will matter.
not_available Well, you're not the only one who's been suffering these past few years.
not_available lt's hard for me to admit, but, uh, l never forgave myself for what I did to you.
not_available lt's in the past.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I don't want to forget it.
not_available I had too much to drink that night.
not_available I
not_available I wasn't thinking clearly.
not_available Wow.
not_available l've never heard you apologize for anything.
not_available It's definitely a first.
not_available l'm just trying to make things right.
not_available You don't have to be such a bitch about it.
not_available Was l being a bitch? Maybe I should apologize.
not_available Oh, you're something else.
not_available You never back down, do you? l've missed our little arguments.
not_available You're still nervous around me.
not_available l shouldn't be surprised.
not_available lt's not you.
not_available Someone else? No.
not_available What is it, then? Look, I'm just
not_available l'm just nervous about the deal.
not_available Could be a lot of money at stake.
not_available There's more for you here than just money, if you want it.
not_available Look l didn't come here for this.
not_available Really.
not_available All the people you could've gone to, you knocked on my door.
not_available Because you're connected.
not_available Î¤hat's the only reason? Yes.
not_available l don't believe you.
not_available Î¤hat's your problem.
not_available You should watch your tongue.
not_available You might lose it one day.
not_available Uh, you said that I could get cleaned up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Bathroom has a shower.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Agent Ortiz, we need to move now.
not_available Now! 
not_available Renee called her buyer.
not_available Îe agreed to pay the $5 million up front.
not_available l want you to meet with him.
not_available Take a couple men.
not_available This is a mistake, Vlad.
not_available Getting involved in nuclear arms
not_available lt doesn't matter how much money is at stake.
not_available l have no intention of pursuing this deal.
not_available What do you mean? When you've picked up the buyer, when the money has been transferred into our account, you kill him, put him in the river, keep the money for ourselves.
not_available And what about Renee? She'll be working with us from now on.
not_available We are going to kill her buyer.
not_available She's not going to be happy about that.
not_available You heard what she said.
not_available She's got nothing left.
not_available Nowhere to go.
not_available Desperate woman.
not_available l give her reason to live.
not_available Okay? l'll take care of it.
not_available President Hassan's security forces
not_available still cracking down on the opposition and not showing any signs of letting up.
not_available I'm afraid your warning to President Hassan has fallen on deaf ears, Madam President.
not_available Who filmed this? 
not_available Stringer for the B.B.C.
not_available bought it from an eyewitness.
not_available They've already seen it in Downing Street? Î¤hat's why Ethan wanted you to see this now.
not_available The rumors have already started that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord.
not_available Then l need to talk to the prime minister.
not_available lt's not just the British, Madam President.
not_available Î¤he Germans and Egyptians are also positioning themselves to pull out.
not_available And if we lose their support
not_available The peace deal is dead.
not_available Maybe if they understood the circumstances, that Îassan is trying to prevent his brother from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
not_available With respect, Madam President, sharing that intelligence with the delegates might spread a panic.
not_available You're right.
not_available But I still need to buy some time.
not_available Assemble the representatives from every signatory country attending the conference.
not_available l want to appeal to them myself to stay the course.
not_available What about President Îassan? Shouldn't we include him? Not until l've taken the temperature of the other delegates.
not_available l don't want to push him too hard.
not_available What is it? As you requested, these are backgrounds on all the detainees.
not_available Our security police have completed their initial sweep of the capital city.
not_available Sixty
not_available five known members of the opposition have been arrested and are being questioned.
not_available Îave you learned anything? Were any of them working with my brother? lt's too early to tell.
not_available What's wrong, sir? One of the suspects has family connections to a member of my delegation here at the U.N.
not_available Who? Jamot.
not_available They are cousins.
not_available That doesn't mean that Jamot is involved in any of this.
not_available We need to make sure.
not_available We'll check his phone records and other recent activities for any suspicious behavior.
not_available Good.
not_available But l also want him taken into custody.
not_available Sir? Arrest him.
not_available Î¤ake him to our embassy for interrogation.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, with respect, Jamot is a trusted member of your inner circle.
not_available The evidence against him is purely circumstantial.
not_available l trusted my brother as well.
not_available Are you sure this is what you want? Îe is a public official.
not_available lt will not go unnoticed.
not_available l don't care! l don't care what anyone thinks.
not_available l was almost killed today.
not_available Or have you forgotten? l was in the car with you, sir.
not_available Then you should know what needs to be done.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Forget about me? What? My name's Arlo Glass.
not_available l'm one of your coworkers at C.T.U.
not_available You said you'd free up some memory space on the auxiliary servers.
not_available l'm getting to it.
not_available In which century? We're in the middle of an operation and my aerial feed is running in slow
not_available motion.
not_available lt's next on my Iist, Arlo.
not_available Where are you going now? To the bathroom.
not_available Is that okay with you? Hey, O'Brian, you notice anything weird about Dana? Miss Perfect? 
not_available Seems distracted.
not_available Always making excuses to leave.
not_available Maybe she's avoiding you.
not_available What? That's what l would do if someone were drooling over me all day.
not_available You're lucky she hasn't reported you to Human Resources.
not_available lf you weren't so jealous, you'd see l was asking you a serious question.
not_available Oh, yeah, l'm jealous.
not_available Please, won't you stare at my ass as I walk away? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Stay here.
not_available This has the address and schematic of the evidence lockup.
not_available You'll go through the southeast entrance.
not_available This key card will get you access.
not_available Îow do we find the money? The evidence bins are numbered.
not_available You're looking for 4301.
not_available This is a dedicated comm unit.
not_available lt's an earpiece.
not_available You'll be able to hear me.
not_available Do exactly what l tell you to do and you'll be in and out.
not_available No one will know you were there.
not_available Listen, I help you do this and you never call me again.
not_available Î¤hat's the deal, right? Sure, Jen.
not_available That's the deal.
not_available l'll call you when we get to the lockup.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available You look thin.
not_available Be out in a minute.
not_available l don't want to wait that long.
not_available Vladimir, please, just let me get dressed.
not_available Why waste the energy? l'll just have to get you undressed all over again.
not_available Look, l already told you I didn't come here for this.
not_available That's what you say, but part of you came here to see me.
not_available Admit it.
not_available There's nothing to admit.
not_available Why is it so hard for you to admit the truth? 
not_available You want this just as much as I do.
not_available I'm not gonna tell you again.
not_available Leave me alone and let me get dressed.
not_available Come here.
not_available l said come here.
not_available Come here or get out! I call my men and the deal's off.
not_available l'll, um
not_available I'll take that drink now.
not_available Dry yourself off.
not_available Come out when you're ready.
not_available Renee, do you copy? Yeah, Jack.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available l've got a team standing by.
not_available We can get you out of there now.
not_available Where would that leave us? I've got to stay under.
not_available We'll find another way.
not_available There is no other way.
not_available Renee, don't do this.
not_available Renee
not_available Go meet Vlad's men.
not_available I'll see you when you get here.
not_available Why won't you listen to me? I'm going dark.
not_available Renee, wait
not_available These arrests are making it very difficult for my government to continue to support the peace agreement.
not_available President Hassan can't ignore the repercussions of what he's doing.
not_available l know President Hassan.
not_available He is a rational man, a good man.
not_available There must be a reason for these actions, and l'm not just speaking as his delegate but as his friend.
not_available Well, as his friend, you need to let him know that my government is not the only one with grave concerns.
not_available This conference is at risk of falling apart.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jamot, may I speak with you privately? Yes, of course.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Of course.
not_available What is it? l've been ordered to escort you to the embassy to answer some questions.
not_available Regarding? An internal security matter.
not_available Please come with us.
not_available Well, I
not_available l would like to know what this is about.
not_available We'll explain at the embassy.
not_available Well, it will have to wait.
not_available I am about to go into a meeting.
not_available It cannot wait, sir.
not_available We need to go right now.
not_available Are you arresting me? lt would be best if we kept this discreet.
not_available This is outrageous.
not_available l demand to speak with President Hassan.
not_available President Hassan is the one who gave this order.
not_available I will not ask you again.
not_available Come with us.
not_available Very welI.
not_available Take him to the car.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available ls everything all right? Everything is fine, sir.
not_available Please excuse me.
not_available Hello.
not_available It's me.
not_available Are you alone? Yes.
not_available What's wrong? You sound upset.
not_available l didn't want to burden you with this, but I need to speak with you about your father.
not_available What is it? I have to go to the embassy right now.
not_available l'll meet you in private when I get back.
not_available You're going to give him vindesine twice daily, morning and night.
not_available lnject it right into the I.V.
not_available bag, just like I'm doing.
not_available You're going to want to be careful.
not_available Radiation poisoning is transferable through bodily fluids.
not_available Are you paying attention? Yes.
not_available I see.
not_available Îe's also going to get cisplatin every other day, but he can take that in pill form.
not_available l'm going to give you three weeks' worth.
not_available How will I know if he's getting better? lf the treatment's working, his symptoms wilI begin to subside in seven to 1 0 days.
not_available We're going to be leaving soon.
not_available Where? To the country house.
not_available The doctor's giving me everything I need to treat you.
not_available You're going to get better, Oleg.
not_available That's the nurse with the rest of the medicine.
not_available Î¤hrow down your weapon, Josef.
not_available Do what l said.
not_available Don't make this worse than it is.
not_available Drop it! You son of a bitch.
not_available Who else knows about Oleg's sickness? Who else knows? Just the doctor.
not_available Are you sure? I'm sure.
not_available Undo him.
not_available Îey, wait, stop.
not_available What are you doing? Your father sent us to bring you home now, Josef.
not_available Josef, it's okay.
not_available Just do what he says.
not_available l have him.
not_available We found them.
not_available Where were they? A clinic in Mount Vernon.
not_available Îow many people found out about Oleg? Only one
not_available a doctor.
not_available But we've taken care of him.
not_available Nobody will know we were here.
not_available Good.
not_available Now bring my sons to me.
not_available Da.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Meier? 
not_available That's right.
not_available You are from Germany.
not_available Bremen.
not_available But l grew up traveling with my father.
not_available Are we going to do business or not? Where is the $5 million? You don't see any money until I talk to Laitanan.

not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available I'm not a fool.
not_available l'm not about to get involved with the kind of people who traffic in nuclear arms.
not_available Vladimir, you can't do this.
not_available Why? This man means something to you? No, but l've worked for more than a year to make this deal.
not_available l'm not just going to let it go because you don't have the guts to see it through.
not_available Îey, this isn't about guts.
not_available This is about being smart.

not_available You're more than all this.
not_available l know it.
not_available lt's why l brought this deal to you.
not_available We can do this.
not_available Î¤ogether.
not_available Once we've made the deal and we have the money, we can be together.

not_available Meier.
not_available You really think you can roll me for $5 million? Where's Renee? She's right here.
not_available She's fine.
not_available l want proof now! Say something to your partner.
not_available Meier, are you okay? Satisfied? Renee told me you were ready to take your organization to the next level.
not_available Apparently she was wrong.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available l'm willing to reconsider the situation.
not_available The only thing you should consider yourself is lucky that I still want this deal to happen.
not_available Otherwise, you'd be dead.

not_available Do you think this is any easier for me? lt would've worked.
not_available The doctor was treating him.
not_available You disobeyed me, Josef.
not_available You put this family at risk.
not_available You put this family at risk when you sent those men into the clinic.
not_available They killed three people! What do you think's gonna happen when the police start to investigate? Who are you to question my judgment? You are my firstborn.
not_available You, of all people, should give me respect.
not_available l do respect you.
not_available But this time you're wrong.
not_available The doctor said that Oleg could be treated.
not_available He showed me how! All we need is the medicine! There are rules, Josef.

not_available And he was visiting Dana Walsh.
not_available And did he say that he was a friend
not_available I gotta go.
not_available What the hell are you doing? 
not_available This is not what it looks like.

not_available and you're slacking.
not_available Have you even coordinated with Metro Control? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Just look at this.
not_available Dana's been visited twice today by this guy with really questionable facial hair, and for some reason, she's covering it up.
not_available l don't wanna see that.
not_available Did she say anything to you about this guy? Yeah.
not_available When we were in the bathroom braiding each other's hair.
not_available You seriously think this is how you get girls? But ifyou're that desperate, let me give you a little advice.
not_available Girls appreciate flowers.
not_available Romantic gestures.
not_available Îave you tried online dating? Calibrating traffic cams now.
not_available I just need to free up some bandwidth.
not_available l'll check with Dana to see if Cole's called in yet.
