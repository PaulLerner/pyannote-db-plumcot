
not_available I know Tony's running things.
not_available I don't want to speak out of turn.
not_available I don't know who else to talkto.
not_available About what? The president's planning military action based on a recording from Ali's apartment.
not_available Ali claims it was a fake.
not_available And you believe him.
not_available Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you.
not_available I regret to inform you, Syed Ali has just been assassinated.
not_available I think it has to do with the conversation recorded in Cyprus.
not_available I don't believe it's genuine.
not_available OK, I'm aware of his denials.
not_available I'm worried that someone is trying to manipulate you into taking the kind of military action I assume you're about to take.
not_available I told you I had money.
not_available I didn't come here to steal.
not_available I didn't want to hurt anyone.
not_available Give me the gun.
not_available No.
not_available We've got the store surrounded.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available No.
not_available Put the gun down and come out.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available The recording they found, in case you haven't figured it out, is bogus.
not_available How do you knowthat? 
not_available I'm the one who planted it.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Kate Warner.
not_available You got 30 minutes.
not_available Bring her to the warehouse, just the two of you.
not_available Where the hell you going? 
not_available I don't have time to explain.
not_available Let's find the time.
not_available Put the gun down.
not_available Kate, come on, we gotta go.
not_available Now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Wait, Jack.
not_available Tell me what's going on.
not_available Do you trust me? Kate, do you trust me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I will explain everything to you in the car, but we've gotta go now.
not_available Carrie! Tony! What happened? 
not_available It was Jack.
not_available I tried to stop him from taking Kate Warner out of here.
not_available What is it? 
not_available My ankle.
not_available I'll get the medic.
not_available Call Security.
not_available Make sure they stop Jack.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Security.
not_available He's at the gate.
not_available Stop that vehicle! Hey! Stop! You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I didn't mean to frighten you backthere.
not_available Let me try and explain everything to you.
not_available The US is preparing to retaliate against the Middle East for what happened tonight.
not_available In a few hours, we'll be involved in a war which'll affect every country on this planet.
not_available What does that have to do with me? Ten minutes ago a man called me.
not_available Said he had proof the evidence the president was basing his decisions on was forged.
not_available He wouldn't give me any other information unless I broughtyou to him.
not_available Who is this man? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available That's the problem, Kate.
not_available I don't know who he is.
not_available What would he want with me? 
not_available We've gotta find out.
not_available If I can provide concrete proof that the Cyprus recording was fake, we can stop a war.
not_available I will do what I can to protectyou, butyou have to decide now.
not_available You have to decide whether or not you want to accept the risk.
not_available Do you really think we can do this? I'm not gonna lie to you.
not_available This is very, very dangerous.
not_available I'm sorry, I don't know what else to do.
not_available I'm running out of time.
not_available Did they stop him? 
not_available He drove through the gate.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available My ankle.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available Did you call LAPD? 
not_available And the FBI.
not_available They're all looking for him.
not_available Could be a torn ligament, maybe a sprain.
not_available It's not broken.
not_available We've gotta getyou an x
not_available ray.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll be right back with a first
not_available aid kit.
not_available You said Jacktook Kate with him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't think he was working alone.
not_available What do you mean? Baker was keeping an eye on Kate.
not_available Michelle distracted him just before I found you.
not_available Distracted him how? 
not_available She called him away on paperwork.
not_available That doesn't mean they were working together.
not_available I think it does.
not_available Michelle was talking to Jack right before she went to Baker.
not_available He might have been setting her up.
not_available It didn't appear that way.
not_available The vice president's ready for your call, sir.
not_available When's he meet the British ambassador? 
not_available Right after he speaks with you.
not_available The vice president will wantyou to authorise him to inform the ambassador of our deployment.
not_available He told you that? 
not_available You know where Jim stands on this.
not_available He'll want to let everyone know we're on a war footing.
not_available Especially the British.
not_available What's your position, sir? Once we bring our allies in on this, it'll make it much harder to recall those planes.
not_available Put him through.
not_available The president is ready to speak with him.
not_available Right away.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello, Jim.
not_available What's the British reaction to the bombing? Everyone is stunned.
not_available Their military is on high alert.
not_available The British ambassador? 
not_available He's waiting to hear from us.
not_available After this conversation, I'm free to inform him about the Stealth bombers? Not justyet, Jim.
not_available It's still premature.
not_available Those planes are due to drop their payloads in a little over four hours.
not_available We're holding off notifying our allies because there's a possibility we may not go through with the attack.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I have reason to believe the Cyprus audio implicating the target countries was fabricated.
not_available I thought we proved it was real.
not_available As did I.
not_available CTU LA is in the process of obtaining intelligence that may show otherwise.
not_available In the process? 
not_available Meaning they don't have any proof yet.
not_available Correct.
not_available Did you run it by CIA? Did they have any indication this thing's a fraud? Not as of yet.
not_available Mr President, you authorised this military action, and justifiably so.
not_available With all due respect, it's too late for second thoughts.
not_available We will not start a war on false or incomplete information.
not_available Say nothing to the ambassador.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Mr President I know you trust Jack Bauer implicitly, but to equivocate our response in a matter of this importance because of one man's reservations makes me very uncomfortable.
not_available I'm afraid I'm with Mike on this one, sir.
not_available Noted.
not_available This is Deputy Raynes.
not_available Mr Garcia, we have offiicers surrounding the building.
not_available Your only option is to throw your weapon out and come out with your hands on your head.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available No.
not_available No! I can't stop the bleeding.
not_available We need to get him to a hospital.
not_available Please don't let him die.
not_available We need you to respond.
not_available You need to talkto the police.
not_available Tell them you'll give up.
not_available We gotta let them in here right now.
not_available No, I didn't mean for this to happen.
not_available A bomb went off.
not_available There's gonna be a war.
not_available I was just trying to protect my wife.
not_available She's pregnant.
not_available I will tell the police that.
not_available We gotta get out of here! 
not_available Mr Garcia, please respond.
not_available Do you have someone in there who needs medical attention? 
not_available We can work this out.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available But firstyou have to put the weapon down and come out.
not_available Let's walk out of here.
not_available Come out, Mr Garcia.
not_available You're only making things worse by prolonging it.
not_available No! We can work this out, butyou have to work with us.
not_available Oh, please don't die.
not_available Please don't let him die.
not_available Please respond.
not_available Why won't they help you, back at CTU? Tony Almeida's in charge.
not_available He's under pressure.
not_available He doesn't think it's a forgery, so he's following the proper protocol.
not_available He's doing what he thinks is right.
not_available Where are we supposed to meet him? 
not_available A small warehouse in Studio City.
not_available What is it? 
not_available We're being followed.
not_available Who do you think it is? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Turn the ignition off! Putyour hands on the wheel! Putyour hands on the wheel! You alone? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why did you follow me from CTU? 
not_available No one's given me any information.
not_available I told you at CTU that my country is being implicated.
not_available I don't know who I can trust.
not_available I saw you take out Tony, who's in charge.
not_available You don't wantyour country to invade mine.
not_available My agenda is not to help your country.
not_available My responsibility is to make sure the president 
not_available makes his decisions based on fact.
not_available My country's not responsible.
not_available Maybe, butAli is a citizen of your country.
not_available He runs his terrorist network from there.
not_available Yes, which means he's a criminal to my government just as much as yours.
not_available Why would my country deliberately provoke an attackthat would decimate us? We have everything to lose, nothing to gain.
not_available What do you want? When you broke out, you isolated yourself.
not_available You'll need help.
not_available Tony.
not_available Yeah? What did the doctor say? 
not_available I don't know, they think I tore a ligament.
not_available Look Carrie told me that she saw you talking to Jack, right before he took Kate Warner out of CTU.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is that a problem? 
not_available It depends whatyou were talking about.
not_available What were you talking about? Are you interrogating me? Did you help Jack take Kate Warner out of here? Of course not.
not_available Is that what Carrie told you? I'm in collusion with Jack? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't know what to tell you.
not_available She doesn't know what she's talking about.
not_available Look, Michelle.
not_available It doesn't matter whether you think Jack is right or wrong.
not_available The fact is, this is my command, and what happens here is my responsibility.
not_available I knowthat.
not_available So I need you to be honest with me now.
not_available Did you intentionally draw Agent Baker away from Kate Warner? No.
not_available I did not.
not_available So why would Carrie tell me you did? 
not_available Because she'd like to see me out of here.
not_available And why's that? 
not_available Because I don't like her, and she knows it.
not_available You wanna tell me about it? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available If it's interfering with your work 
not_available It's not interfering with my work.
not_available It's not.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mr Garcia, we are contacting you by phone.
not_available Please answer.
not_available What have I done?! I'm going to prison for the rest of my life.
not_available You don't knowthat.
not_available I killed a man! It was an accident.
not_available I saw it.
not_available If you turn yourself in now, they'll consider that.
not_available If you don't, it'll get worse.
not_available I've got to get out of here.
not_available Hey! Don't touch that phone.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Mr Garcia, this is Deputy Raynes.
not_available Now, whatever the problem is, we can workthis out.
not_available Now, who's in there with you? 
not_available A customer.
not_available A girl.
not_available OK, is she hurt? 
not_available No.
not_available It's the owner.
not_available OK, we have to get him out of there.
not_available It's too late.
not_available Look, I didn't mean it.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Now, that's OK.
not_available Let's talk about it.
not_available It's because of the bomb.
not_available Look, there's gonna be a war.
not_available I'm trying to get my wife out of the city.
not_available You understand that, right? Your wife is right here.
not_available She's worried aboutyou.
not_available Put her on the phone.
not_available I wanna talkto her.
not_available Ramon, are you OK? Why are you still in there? 
not_available Mija I killed a man.
not_available No! It was an accident, but they won't believe me.
not_available You and the baby have to leave now.
not_available It's not safe to be in the city.
not_available Ramon, mijo, come out.
not_available No, notyet.
not_available OK, look, I'm gonna tell the police to take you where you'll be safe.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available All right, Mr Garcia, you talked to your wife.
not_available We'd like you to come out.
not_available OK, but I wantyou to do one thing for me first.
not_available What's that? Take her to Monterey.
not_available She's got a sister there.
not_available When she gets there, I'll let the girl go, and then I'll come out.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available I wantyou to stay here.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available If you need to get in touch, there's a cellphone in the centre console.
not_available Press one.
not_available Kate, you OK? Don't forget, I will do everything I have to to protectyou, OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just stay put.
not_available Drop the weapon.
not_available Put the weapon down! All right.
not_available My weapons are there on that table.
not_available I'm unarmed.
not_available Putyour hands behind your head, interlock your fingers.
not_available You knowthe drill.
not_available If that's a Dunlop, it'll pick up a piece of shrapnel that's still in my rib cage.
not_available Yep, see? Take a seat.
not_available Who are you? Jonathan Wallace, 7th Light Armoured Reconnaissance Battalion, Third Marine Division, Special Ops Detachment Delta, Fort Benning.
not_available Slowly raise your right arm.
not_available Showthe inside of your forearm to me.
not_available Coral Snake Unit.
not_available That's right.
not_available So you're the seventh man.
not_available You took outyour unit that was tracking the bomb so they couldn't stop it.
not_available Why? I was responsible for two things: making sure the bomb went off, planting the recording to blame it on the three countries.
not_available To what end? 
not_available What else, Jack? To start a war.
not_available The end game was always to get the US to attackthe Middle East.
not_available Why? They didn't tell me, but they didn't have to.
not_available These men control oil in the Caspian Sea.
not_available If there's a war, their holdings quadruple in value for at least a decade.
not_available At the cost of detonating a nuclear device in the centre of LA? You got it.
not_available What do you want with Kate Warner? About an hour ago, the people who hired me tried to have me killed.
not_available Obviously, they didn't succeed, but they took out my transport team.
not_available I need an alternate way out of the country.
not_available Warner Industries has DOD variance.
not_available She can authorise a departure.
not_available So, evidence against the Cyprus recording for your departure.
not_available That's the deal? Yep.
not_available Keep your mouth shut and get out of the car.
not_available Unlockthe door.
not_available Do it now! Come on, get out of the car! You OK? So where's the Warner girl? 
not_available When we're done.
not_available How does the evidence prove the recording was forged? I have the source recordings.
not_available Before they were mixed down to create the fake tape.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There was another guy.
not_available I took care of him.
not_available Is he there? It's for you.
not_available Hello? The man you sent to pick up Kate Warner is unconscious.
not_available He's out.
not_available You're lying.
not_available He's six
not_available two, dark hair, pretty nasty scar on his face.
not_available OK.
not_available It doesn't change anything.
not_available I got whatyou need and I won't give it to you until you give me Kate Warner.
not_available I'll take you to her.
not_available We'll arrange your charter.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available She can't authorise a charter unless a partner is on board, and right now your people have Bob Warner in custody.
not_available So she's coming with me.
not_available What do you plan to do with her when you reach your destination? I have to dispose of her.
not_available You knowthat.
not_available I can't let that happen.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Wait.
not_available Yusuf, do you copy? 
not_available We're here.
not_available What do you want me to do? Bring her in.
not_available Lynne.
not_available Yeah, Mike? 
not_available How do I get ahold of Jack Bauer? Last I heard, he was debriefing at CTU.
not_available Why? The president's hesitating with this operation, based on a conversation he had with Bauer.
not_available I wanna to talkto him myself.
not_available Behind the president's back? That is so dangerous.
not_available If I can get some concrete information, I can support the president more effectively.
not_available And if you can't? Then I'll have the conviction to talk him through the situation.
not_available I'm in the dark.
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Lynne Lynne, this is my call.
not_available Your recommendation not to go around the president is duly noted.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mr Almeida, Mike Novick, the president's chief of staff, is on the line.
not_available Mr Novick, this is Tony Almeida.
not_available Hi, Tony.
not_available I need to reach Jack Bauer.
not_available Yeah, well, we're trying to locate him ourselves, sir.
not_available What do you mean? What's the problem? Jack was here earlier, debriefing from the day's events, when he grabbed a material witness and took her off the premises illegally.
not_available He also assaulted CTU personnel.
not_available Why would he do that? Jack's working on a hunch that the Cyprus recording was fabricated.
not_available This is what I wanted to talkto him about.
not_available The president is not giving his complete support to the military action until he hears from Bauer.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available Now, what about the witness he's taken? How does that factor in? 
not_available Her name is Kate Warner.
not_available Her sister was involved with the Second Wave terrorists.
not_available We're trying to connect the dots.
not_available That's the other reason we need to find Jack.
not_available The second you make contact with Bauer, you put him through to me.
not_available We're at District.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Turner.
not_available Carrie.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Yeah, I need to see you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yes, Tony? Where are we on Jack? 
not_available His exit wasn't picked up on satellite.
not_available He hasn't initiated contact with anyone.
not_available What about Kate Warner? Her house and her father's company are being watched, in case they go there.
not_available Good.
not_available Have you talked to Michelle? Yeah.
not_available In fact, I wanted to talkto you about that.
not_available Do you have a problem working in the same office with Michelle? Is that whatyou think? That I'd be making up stories because I have a problem working with her? She and Jack were talking before he took Kate Warner.
not_available They weren't trading recipes.
not_available It was conspiratorial.
not_available All right.
not_available I need you to put a filter on all of Michelle's communications.
not_available E
not_available mails, phone calls, open channels.
not_available I wantyou to let me know when Jacktries to contact her, all right? Done.
not_available What's going on out there? 
not_available They're taking my wife where she'll be safe.
not_available And then what? You're gonna let me go, right? 
not_available Don't push me.
not_available You got me into this.
not_available I didn't getyou into this.
not_available You pointed this gun at me.
not_available That's howthis whole thing started.
not_available What were you doing with a gun anyway? Huh? What?! Were you gonna rip this place off? No.
not_available You ruined my life.
not_available It's all your fault.
not_available Sorry, I shouldn't have taken out that gun.
not_available Yeah? Well, why did you? 
not_available I was afraid.
not_available Afraid.
not_available What do you have to be afraid of? Answer me! My daddy died tonight.
not_available The bomb that went off, he was there.
not_available What? Your wife's on her way to Monterey.
not_available Everything cool in there? It's not cool.
not_available Make sure my wife gets there.
not_available You don't need to call every five minutes.
not_available OK, Ramon, you need to stay calm.
not_available Now, we're doing exactly whatyou said.
not_available You got to thinkthis through.
not_available You'll be in custody soon.
not_available I didn't mean to kill anybody! 
not_available We know.
not_available But what would help your case is if you'd let the young lady out now.
not_available I'm not stupid! She's the only reason you haven't shotyour way in here yet.
not_available And I'll tell you something.
not_available If I see you coming in, I'll kill her! You better believe that! You're not a killer, Ramon.
not_available You've got no record.
not_available Be smart.
not_available I'll be smart.
not_available You be smart.
not_available Dammit! Get back here! No! No! Open the door! Open it! Open the door! Open it! Help me! Hurry, I'm at the back door! Help! Please! I don't wanna hurtyou, but I will! Mr Garcia, what's going on in there? Oh, my God.
not_available Mr Garcia, pick up the phone.
not_available No! No! Please respond, Mr Garcia.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Is there anyone else besides you? 
not_available Kate, lookthe other way.
not_available No, no.
not_available No one else.
not_available There's no one else.
not_available Come on.
not_available Wait, the warehouse is that way.
not_available Jack.
not_available Yeah, go ahead.
not_available I'll approach in a sweep pattern.
not_available It'll take a few minutes.
not_available Copy that.
not_available They're gonna be five minutes.
not_available And here we are without a deck of cards.
not_available You know, I was down at Benning when Samuels tried to recruityou.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He was real disappointed you turned him down.
not_available He said you were a born killer.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available Turner.
not_available I got an alarm on the backup server.
not_available Do you have one? 
not_available No.
not_available Must be on your side of the router.
not_available Want me to check the connections? No, you need C
not_available clearance for that.
not_available I'll have to do it.
not_available Right, I forgot.
not_available Will you give this to Thomkins for me? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr President, may I? 
not_available What is it, Mike? Jack Bauer took a material witness from CTU and assaulted an agent in the process.
not_available I know how much this country owes him, sir, but he's obviously suffered some kind of emotional collapse.
not_available It would be understandable, given everything he's been through.
not_available But we don't knowthat.
not_available What he did might have been necessary under the circumstances.
not_available We already have incontrovertible proof from Langley that the Cyprus recording is authentic.
not_available Finding Jack Bauer isn't going to change that.
not_available The country needs your energy and attention on what happens after those bombs drop.
not_available We need to prepare for this war.
not_available If this recording's not authentic, and Jack Bauer turns out to be right, it'd be a mistake of historic proportions.
not_available Mr President 
not_available That's all, Mike.
not_available Find Jack Bauer.
not_available She'll be here any minute.
not_available Where's the evidence? OK, here's how it's gonna go down.
not_available I take Kate with me.
not_available She sets up the plane.
not_available It picks us up at an airport of my choosing.
not_available When I'm on that plane, I'll call and tell you where the evidence is.
not_available What assurances do I have you'll even call? None.
not_available It's one of those things where you're just gonna have to trust me.
not_available Well, I don't.
not_available Jack, you're the last person in the world I want tracking me down.
not_available Jack, what's going on? 
not_available You and I are going on a little trip.
not_available Jack? You have to go with him.
not_available What aboutyou? 
not_available Jack's not coming.
not_available You gave me your word.
not_available I'm sorry it has to be done like this.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available Talkto her, Jack.
not_available Otherwise, I'm gonna have to do this differently.
not_available Kate, remember everything I said to you in the car.
not_available Do what he says, and I promise you, you will not get hurt.
not_available You're giving me up, aren'tyou? 
not_available CTU, Dessler.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Danny, what are you doing up? 
not_available I can't sleep.
not_available Are you sure it's safe here? Yeah.
not_available As far as I know, it is.
not_available As far as you know? What the hell does that mean? "As far as I know"? Danny, you know my situation.
not_available You know what, your situation sucks.
not_available You're talking about my life.
not_available The least you could do is tell me whatyou know.
not_available There's nothing to know.
not_available Stay where you are.
not_available I'll come over tomorrow.
not_available Don'tyou patronise me! Don'tyou patronise me, cos I want answers.
not_available A nuclear bomb just went off.
not_available I wanna know if it's safe to stay here in LA.
not_available What about the kids? Don'tyou care about them? Of course.
not_available If there was anything to know, I'd tell you.
not_available Is that right? You didn't tell me about the bomb.
not_available Did it slip your mind? I already explained it to you.
not_available I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.
not_available You know what? Maybe I should call Carrie.
not_available She'd tell me.
not_available I thoughtyou weren't speaking.
not_available We're not.
not_available She's a bitch.
not_available Danny, I will take care 
not_available Forget it.
not_available Don't shoot me! Please! I'm sorry! Throw the weapon out the front door, and come out with your hands behind your head.
not_available No! I need more time! My wife's gonna be safe, right? Come on, Ramon, you gotta cooperate now.
not_available You got nobody left in there.
not_available Anybody have a visual on the suspect? No.
not_available Should we hold position? No.
not_available Ever since the bomb, we got a new call every ten minutes.
not_available We gotta be done here.
not_available Please don't.
not_available Give him time.
not_available He'll come out on his own.
not_available All right, all units go.
not_available Go now, go! Drop your weapon! 
not_available No.
not_available Code 4.
not_available Send medical Medical team, go! 
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available We ready? 
not_available Yes, we are, Mike.
not_available Mr Vice President, you're on with me and Lynne because the president is being briefed by Ryan Chappelle.
not_available He asked that we go ahead without him.
not_available Fine.
not_available How did it go with the British ambassador? Not well.
not_available He knows that we're planning a retaliation against the Middle East, but he's frustrated cos we're not coordinating with them.
not_available I'm sure he'll understand once he gets the facts.
not_available What are the facts, Mike? We've got planes in the air.
not_available Either we're committed or we're not.
not_available If the evidence shows that the Cyprus recording was falsified, the president wants the option of calling those planes back.
not_available You know what it sounds like to me? An excuse to call this off.
not_available Do you believe the president's capable of doing the hard thing, Mike? The right thing? Yes, sir, I do.
not_available He's committed to this action.
not_available All he's doing is making sure every base is covered.
not_available I hope so.
not_available The president will be contacting you as soon as anything develops.
not_available All right, Mike.
not_available Mike.
not_available You thinkthe vice president is right, don'tyou? If the president turns those planes around, based on the unconfirmed speculation of a single CTU agent, it'll be a disaster.
not_available So what do we do about it? I don't know.
not_available Where are you taking me? 
not_available Get in.
not_available I'm not gonna try and escape.
not_available I said, get in.
not_available Kate.
not_available Get in the trunk, for your own safety.
not_available The tracker's in place.
not_available It's been activated.
not_available Good.
not_available Jack, it's been a real pleasure.
not_available I'll be in touch.
