
not_available This is Air Force One, declaring an emergency.
not_available We're not gonna make it.
not_available I have to put it down.
not_available Chloe, what's happening? Air Force One, you copy? 
not_available Chloe? Air Force One is down.
not_available This may be him.
not_available It's the president.
not_available He's still alive.
not_available I repeat, the president is alive.
not_available Marwan has to be in a 50 mile radius 
not_available There's a higher priority than Marwan.
not_available What? 
not_available Recovering the nuclear football.
not_available Didn't it go with Air Force One? The missile inflicted enough damage that it left debris.
not_available A lot was sucked out, including the football.
not_available That case contains the codes and locations of our entire nuclear arsenal.
not_available What's the location of the football? 
not_available 40 miles northeast of here, in the desert.
not_available Air Support, the football is in the lead Jeep, headed north.
not_available Take it out.
not_available I've got the football.
not_available Three hostiles down, one escaped.
not_available I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.
not_available There are pages missing.
not_available Tell me the contents of the pages.
not_available It's the section which contains warhead locations and activation codes.
not_available If they get a hold of a warhead and a matching code, we will not be able to stop them.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, President Keeler is alive, but he's in critical condition.
not_available Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th Amendment and take control of things.
not_available You're worried about him.
not_available I am.
not_available He seems unsure of himself.
not_available I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the president.
not_available Preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I've just received a phone call from CTU.
not_available Part of the nuclear football has fallen into the hands of terrorists.
not_available Vice President Logan has been sworn in.
not_available He is now President of the United States.
not_available His office called.
not_available They want an update in 15 minutes.
not_available We're working on several protocols.
not_available What is he gonna want to focus on? How a Stealth fighter was stolen from one of our air bases.
not_available More to the point, how it took down Air Force One with one of our missiles.
not_available Is he briefed on Marwan? 
not_available He knows he's behind today, but he's gonna want specifics on the football.
not_available Where are we on that? Jack's at the debris field.
not_available He's trying to reconstruct the stolen chapter.
not_available How? He's working with Fred Laughton from the DOD.
not_available He wrote it, he'll know what's missing.
not_available Good.
not_available Who's going to run point on this update? 
not_available You and Tony.
not_available All right, we don't have a lot of time, so fast
not_available track this.
not_available Double source all intel through Homeland Security and CIA.
not_available Skip the usual request procedures.
not_available Tie in to their data directly.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I've got Bauer on the line.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Are you still in briefing? 
not_available Yes, on speaker.
not_available What have you found? Laughton and I finished a reconstruction.
not_available We're getting that to you.
not_available Jack, it's Bill Buchanan.
not_available Summarize our exposure.
not_available What information does Marwan have in his possession? The location of our domestic nuclear arsenal.
not_available The inventory's in the thousands.
not_available Many weapons are in transit as part of standard operations.
not_available Why can't DOD secure these weapons? A number are between checkpoints.
not_available It'd take over an hour to account for all of them.
not_available Listen, we've gotta remember, Marwan only needs one.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll get on this.
not_available Get back here as soon as you can and help Audrey liaise with DOD.
not_available We need to account for every single weapon.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available The coordinates for the third one are: latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes, longitude, 115 degrees, There it is.
not_available Jefferson City, Iowa.
not_available When is the warhead due to arrive? 
not_available 7am local time.
not_available Five hours from now.
not_available That puts it somewhere 200 miles east.
not_available It's still in Illinois.
not_available We can intercept it anywhere from this point to here.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's put our people in place.
not_available Warheads in transit because of shiftand
not_available hide operations pose the biggest problem.
not_available We can verify military traffic in coastal areas from here.
not_available Find what DOD has in the Midwest.
not_available Yeah, that's already underway.
not_available Audrey said she should have it in a few minutes.
not_available Look, Tony Am I interrupting something? 
not_available No, Chloe.
not_available What is it? Are you logged on? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look.
not_available 15 minutes ago, the credit card of Eric Murphy was used at Western Gas in Torrance.
not_available Who's Eric Murphy? 
not_available His real name is Yosik Khatami.
not_available He's affiliated with Marwan.
not_available How do we know that? Our watch list.
not_available We put out a net asking for anybody connected to Habib Marwan.
not_available We didn't expect any hits so soon.
not_available Why was he so careless? Maybe he wasn't.
not_available Maybe it's a decoy.
not_available It wouldn't be much of a decoy because we don't know where he is.
not_available This was a mistake.
not_available Did the gas station have a camera? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's driving a Lexus.
not_available Are we on the satellite? Yes, we're monitoring them now.
not_available If this guy's still on the road, we'll find him.
not_available Who do we have in the area to run point? 
not_available Curtis left Division.
not_available He's headed here.
not_available Divert him.
not_available Have Field Ops meet him there.
not_available All right.
not_available Audrey.
not_available It's me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Are you on your way back here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How much weaponry's accounted for? getting confirmations from the Midwest.
not_available Why? 
not_available There were convoys shipping weapons to be dismantled under the arms reduction treaty.
not_available A lot were rerouted after the bombing this morning.
not_available Use local channels.
not_available Weapon transports check in with regional substations.
not_available Just call them directly.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll do that.
not_available How are you holding up? I'm OK.
not_available What have the doctors told you about Paul? They're having a hard time keeping him stable.
not_available Just hang in there.
not_available He'll fight through it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell Michelle I'll be there in 20 minutes.
not_available All right, will do.
not_available Bye.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Marwan, it's it's me.
not_available Is everything all right? 
not_available No.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I I made a stupid mistake.
not_available They're gonna find me.
not_available What happened? I stopped to get gas.
not_available While I was driving away, I realized I used the wrong credit card 
not_available the one with the name Murphy.
not_available The one you gave me.
not_available I told you to get rid of that one.
not_available I was in a hurry, Habib.
not_available I had to make arrangements for delivery of the warhead.
not_available When that gets flagged, they'll search the highways.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm not on the highway any more.
not_available Where are you? Inglewood.
not_available I'm on my way to Prado's now.
not_available You're closer to the marina.
not_available Go straight there, I'll have him meet you.
not_available Prado will help you get out of the country.
not_available Thank you, Habib.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it may be precipitous moving to the bunker now.
not_available Working from the Oval Office might exhibit a greater sense of confidence in our abilities to handle this crisis.
not_available The purpose of the bunker is to protect the president, is it not? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Well I feel it is always wiser to take the prudent course.
not_available Will I be able to function at 100 per cent here? 
not_available Absolutely, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available What protection does this bunker afford? Total.
not_available You're 200 feet below the surface.
not_available If the White House suffers a direct hit, everyone would be safe, as would communication infrastructure to the rest of the country.
not_available Let's hope that's not needed.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan is on the line.
not_available He's asked Mr.
not_available President, Bill Buchanan from CTU is on the line.
not_available Hello, Bill.
not_available What do you have for me? I'm here with Michelle Dessler, director of CTU Los Angeles, and Tony Almeida, heading tactical.
not_available Let's get started.
not_available Have all of our armaments referenced in the red chapter been secured? Not completely, Mr.
not_available President, but we're working with DOD on it.
not_available What else? 
not_available The man who choreographed today's events, Habib Marwan, is at large.
not_available Most likely, he is in possession of the red chapter.
not_available What are we doing? 
not_available We picked up a thread.
not_available We have a location where one of Marwan's associates was detected 20 minutes ago.
not_available That sounds promising.
not_available What else? We're sifting through intel, hoping to put together a pursuit scenario soon.
not_available So you're pretty confident you'll be able to catch this terrorist, this Habib Marwan, before he strikes again? 
not_available It's not an exact science, sir.
not_available All we can do is maximize the probability for success.
not_available There are no guarantees.
not_available Of course, I understand that.
not_available We need to get control of the situation.
not_available I can't govern from here indefinitely, but I'm not going until it's safe.
not_available Sir.
not_available Their time is better spent working up what they have.
not_available I recommend we let them get back to it.
not_available OK, Bill.
not_available Call us when you have something more concrete.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Does anybody else feel uneasy about what we just heard here? In what way? Logan's supposed to be the man who speaks to this country and exudes confidence, not fear.
not_available Air Force One was just attacked, Keeler's in critical condition.
not_available Logan was just sworn in.
not_available Give him time.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available We've got Khatami, heading toward the coast.
not_available We have him on satellite.
not_available Link this up to Curtis.
not_available I want him running point.
not_available Tell Curtis to remain discreet.
not_available I wanna know what Khatami's doing before we take him.
not_available Michelle.
not_available I was out of line a couple of hours ago about you and Bill.
not_available It's your life, and I've got no right to judge you.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Whatever tension there is between us, I want to apologize for my part in it.
not_available I'd like it if we could just let it go so we could do our jobs.
not_available Leave the past in the past, and move on.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Curtis is about to arrive at the marina.
not_available Set up a satellite, also an audio link.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You want me to run point? No, Bill and I will do that, but I want you in on this.
not_available To do what? 
not_available I'd like your tactical input.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll have Edgar transfer everything over to the situation room.
not_available Edgar.
not_available I get the feeling Tony's not entirely comfortable with the configuration today.
not_available We haven't seen each other for a long time.
not_available It's uncomfortable.
not_available The difference is you seem to be able to stay on point.
not_available I'm not so sure about him.
not_available I am.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available He's alone.
not_available What's he doing? Looks like a meet.
not_available He's waiting for someone.
not_available Is the marine unit in place? 
not_available They're behind the jetty.
not_available The man he's meeting's just arrived.
not_available He's walking towards him.
not_available Is it Marwan? 
not_available I can't tell.
not_available Remember, Curtis, we need them both alive.
not_available I copy.
not_available All right, teams, I'll close up for the pier.
not_available Keep them contained, but do not shoot to kill.
not_available Repeat, do not shoot to kill.
not_available Dammit! Teams, respond.
not_available Who is that? This is McKellan.
not_available It looks like a private patrol.
not_available All right, hold your positions.
not_available Yosik.
not_available Prado.
not_available You're late.
not_available I've been standing here waiting for you.
not_available I'm here now.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available What are we waiting for? 
not_available Wait.
not_available What's the matter? 
not_available Someone's here.
not_available It's Miller.
not_available U
not_available base is clear.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's just harbor security.
not_available No, something's wrong.
not_available They're onto us.
not_available Yosik, now! The man he's meeting is not Marwan.
not_available Is anybody else there besides them? 
not_available No, unless someone's on the boat.
not_available Marine units, move into position.
not_available All teams, move in.
not_available We're OK.
not_available We should just get out of here.
not_available There was a police officer there.
not_available I told you, that's harbor security.
not_available They stop by all the time.
not_available Who the hell is that? This is CTU.
not_available We have you completely surrounded.
not_available Yes.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available They found us.
not_available They're gonna get us.
not_available Yosik, you can't let that happen.
not_available You cannot allow yourself to be captured.
not_available I understand.
not_available Also you have to kill Prado.
not_available He knows too much.
not_available I'll do what's necessary.
not_available Yosik! Yosik! Shots fired! Shots fired! Move in.
not_available Come out with your hands up.
not_available You're surrounded.
not_available There's no escape.
not_available Coming out! Drop the gun! Put the gun down! 
not_available Step off the boat.
not_available Get off the boat.
not_available There's a man inside.
not_available I shot him.
not_available He was gonna kill me.
not_available He was trying to steal my boat.
not_available It was self
not_available defense.
not_available Put your hands on your head.
not_available Who are you? Who are you? 
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available My name's Joe Prado.
not_available I'm innocent.
not_available I have nothing to hide.
not_available Where's Yosik? 
not_available He's dead.
not_available His phone was lying next to him.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Secure the boat.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yosik's dead.
not_available We have the man he was meeting.
not_available He says his name is Joe Prado.
not_available Bring him in.
not_available Will do.
not_available We recovered Yosik's cell phone.
not_available I'll report to you en route.
not_available Good work, Curtis.
not_available We're standing by.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available What do you want to do? Control the situation.
not_available Make sure Prado doesn't talk to the authorities.
not_available He can hurt us.
not_available How do we get to him? 
not_available We can't.
not_available Not directly.
not_available Hello.
not_available This is Marwan.
not_available Yes, Marwan? Can you reach Amnesty Global at this hour? What do you need? 
not_available An attorney.
not_available Tell them that an innocent man is being held without charges and is about to be tortured at CTU Los Angeles.
not_available By God's grace, President Keeler survived.
not_available But more than 75 others did not.
not_available I share in your grief and anger over this tragedy.
not_available My family and I feel no differently than every one of you.
not_available We are shocked, saddened, and maybe a little afraid.
not_available These terrorists have displayed once again their indifference toward human life.
not_available They will pay for what they have done.
not_available Bill, excuse me.
not_available However, we must endure 
not_available There's a convoy missing.
not_available What? It was headed from Illinois to Iowa.
not_available It disappeared inside the border.
not_available Disappeared? 
not_available They were due to call in.
not_available They didn't.
not_available I tried on comm sat, there was no reply.
not_available Satellite? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available What was on the trucks? 
not_available A nuclear warhead.
not_available Our faith and our resolve will prevail.
not_available ..
not_available the files I sent.
not_available Have Prado's information for me as soon as I get back.
not_available OK, we've got the prints.
not_available I'll run them through our databases.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What do we know about the prisoner? Just the name he gave 
not_available Joe Prado.
not_available Curtis uploaded his prints.
not_available I'm running through them.
not_available Prep Holding so Curtis can begin interrogation.
not_available I want this man broken in minutes, not hours.
not_available Clear all directories.
not_available Put all resources into finding this warhead.
not_available Mike, I wish I'd known about this sooner too.
not_available Look, I'm not pointing fingers here.
not_available I'm on your side.
not_available But the president is not going to be happy that his statement can be invalidated.
not_available I don't know what to tell you.
not_available We're putting everything into finding this warhead.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me get back to you.
not_available Move! Inside.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Move.
not_available move, move! Get in, get in.
not_available We have it.
not_available We're heading out now.
not_available Sir.
not_available General Thomas told me we're missing a warhead.
not_available I just heard some details from Buchanan.
not_available When did this happen? 
not_available It disappeared between 1:45am and 2:15.
not_available And none of our satellites picked this up? It was mountain terrain at night.
not_available People are analyzing the imagery, but it's going to be hard to find.
not_available What will we do if we don't find Marwan? Our people are doing everything to contain him.
not_available It's going to be difficult for him to leave.
not_available It's difficult to shoot Air Force One with our own Stealth fighter, but he managed that.
not_available Who knows what they're planning? I'm sure he's gonna come after me next.
not_available There's no indication that that's his plan.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available We don't have enough information to know what his plan is.
not_available Head of Secret Service is on his way over now.
not_available He has a revised plan, and I'm certain it will ease your mind about your safety.
not_available That's the bastard from the marina, helping the terrorists.
not_available I guess.
not_available Sir, holding room B is ready.
not_available I'd like to get him in a room for a few minutes.
not_available What? He'd talk to me in about two seconds.
not_available Oh, you wanna hurt him to get revenge for your mother dying.
not_available I can understand that.
not_available ..
not_available images processed immediately.
not_available Take him to Holding.
not_available Did Edgar run the prints? 
not_available Name checks out.
not_available Joe Prado, ex
not_available marine.
not_available No criminal record.
not_available But over the last five years, no record of employment.
not_available Which means he's a criminal or a mercenary.
not_available Right.
not_available I'll find out if he knows about the warhead.
not_available All right.
not_available Tony.
not_available What have you got? I found the convoy.
not_available I just got off with Iowa Highway Patrol.
not_available Military transport was ambushed.
not_available Everyone's dead.
not_available What about the warhead? 
not_available Gone.
not_available Find out what they'd need to transport it.
not_available Tell law enforcement to put up perimeters.
not_available Check airstrips or clearings where they might put a chopper.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Remember he's an ex
not_available marine.
not_available He won't cave easily.
not_available I need to establish that even though we're in a government building, I'll go as far as it takes.
not_available How are you gonna start? 
not_available I'll use Richards.
not_available OK.
not_available I told you I'm not talking to you, pal.
not_available I haven't been charged, I haven't done anything wrong.
not_available I killed in self
not_available defense.
not_available He was stealing my boat.
not_available We both know that's a lie.
not_available So let's not waste each other's time.
not_available What do you say, Joe? 
not_available I'm not saying anything to you.
not_available Highly unlikely.
not_available What the hell is this? Yes? Where's Curtis? 
not_available He's just about to start with Prado.
not_available Tell him to stop.
not_available What? 
not_available That's an order.
not_available Come to the floor, now.
not_available It was self
not_available defense.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available Curtis.
not_available What? 
not_available Buchanan wants to see us before you start.
not_available Wait till I get back.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available This is David Weiss from Amnesty Global.
not_available I have a court order protecting the rights of Joseph Prado whom you have in custody.
not_available This US marshal is here to assure I'm taken to the prisoner immediately.
not_available Ridiculous.
not_available That's your opinion.
not_available But Mr.
not_available Prado's rights will not be violated.
not_available Take me to him now.
not_available We have no choice, Curtis.
not_available A warhead's missing.
not_available This is our only lead.
not_available I'll get into this with the Justice Department.
not_available In the meantime, do what he says.
not_available When can I expect his call? It's extremely important.
not_available I understand that, but I need to talk to the judge.
not_available Please have him call me back.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Do you have those hourlies for me? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available But I'm here on another matter.
not_available What? I heard Prado's interrogation is on hold.
not_available Why? You have a job to do.
not_available Please get back to it.
not_available I know I'm not supposed to interfere, but considering what I've been through today my mother dying because of these terrorists 
not_available I wanna know why we're letting some lawyer protect Prado.
not_available We're gonna fix it, but it's gonna take some time.
not_available That's time we don't have.
not_available Edgar, stop.
not_available I'm trying to cut you some slack, but get back to your job.
not_available You need to put all that other stuff on hold for a while, please.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Yes, I'll hold for the judge.
not_available You're supposed to be doing the hourlies.
not_available I don't know why everybody's telling me.
not_available I have a photographic memory.
not_available How could I forget? You tell me, like, every other day.
not_available I don't like what's happening 
not_available some PC lawyer's holding us up from our job.
not_available Your job is to do the hourlies.
not_available You're holding yourself up.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Have you heard about the warhead? Yeah.
not_available FBI link up with Iowa Sheriff's Department? 
not_available Yes.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Who's questioning the prisoner? Prado, the guy Curtis brought in? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No one.
not_available What are you talking about? An attorney came in with an order saying we weren't allowed to be alone with Prado.
not_available Buchanan's on the phone with the judge who signed the order.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available I disagree.
not_available This does not fall outside the boundary of the Patriot Act.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's going on? You've got a key witness.
not_available We should be pressing this guy.
not_available Judge Norton won't budge.
not_available We have to take it to an appellate judge.
not_available Does he know what the stakes are? 
not_available He does, but Prado's got no record.
not_available What about the fact he was meeting a terrorist in the middle of the night? Circumstantial.
not_available We need to interrogate this prisoner.
not_available I don't care about the order.
not_available I agree, but his attorney's with him, and a marshal protecting his rights.
not_available Where's his attorney? 
not_available Holding, with Prado.
not_available Don't make it worse.
not_available I just want to talk to him.
not_available How much longer do I have to stay? 
not_available I'm trying to get you out.
not_available My office is filing a complaint.
not_available They have nothing on me.
not_available I was alone on my boat.
not_available I don't even know this man that they were going after.
not_available Come in with me now.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Bauer, Department of Defense.
not_available And you are? David Weiss, Amnesty Global.
not_available Why is the suspect not in restraints? 
not_available Amnesty's order supersedes our authority.
not_available My client is cooperating.
not_available He's not trying to go anywhere.
not_available He wants to be treated like any US citizen.
not_available Your client aided and abetted the people who attacked the president.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available As a matter of fact, we do.
not_available Then charge him.
not_available May I speak with you privately? Get the door.
not_available You and I know your client isn't clean, and that he conspired to steal a nuclear warhead.
not_available All my client wants is due process.
not_available Mr.
not_available Weiss, these people are not gonna stop attacking us today until millions and millions of Americans are dead.
not_available I don't wanna bypass the constitution, but they're extraordinary circumstances.
not_available The constitution was born out of extraordinary circumstances, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available This plays out by the book.
not_available Not in a back room with a rubber hose.
not_available I hope you can live with that.
not_available Sir, can I help you? 
not_available No, it's all right.
not_available How'd you get here so fast? What? 
not_available Who asked you to represent Mr.
not_available Prado? 
not_available I don't have to give you that information.
not_available From his arrest, did the suspect have time to call a lawyer? No.
not_available Marwan called Amnesty Global.
not_available This is his play.
not_available That means Prado knows something Marwan doesn't want us to hear.
not_available We still can't get around that court order.
not_available We need to call the president now.
not_available We cannot have leaks regarding this missing warhead.
not_available I've contacted General Wilson in Iowa.
not_available He's sealing off the roads while we clean up the ambushed convoy.
not_available What about those Highway officers who discovered it? Wilson's brought them in and is explaining the situation.
not_available The good news is this is happening in the middle of the night.
not_available The country's still asleep.
not_available Yes? CTU Los Angeles is on the line for President Logan.
not_available They say it's urgent.
not_available Thank you, gentlemen.
not_available That'll be all.
not_available Walt.
not_available Stay.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available This is Bill Buchanan.
not_available I'm with Jack Bauer.
not_available Yes.
not_available What do you have for me? In the process of trying to track down this warhead, we've brought in a prime suspect.
not_available What have you learned? 
not_available Well, that's the problem.
not_available Our hands are tied.
not_available Amnesty Global has interceded on his behalf.
not_available Interceded? On what grounds? 
not_available He's a US citizen with no previous record.
not_available Why is he a suspect? 
not_available We found him with Yosik Khatami, a man linked to today's events.
not_available It doesn't violate any law to question a suspect.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, if I may? Go ahead, Mike.
not_available Jack, it's Mike Novick.
not_available Hi, Mike.
not_available Am I correct in assuming this suspect is unlikely to respond to the kind of Q and A his lawyer would permit? Correct.
not_available If we want information, we're gonna have to do it behind closed doors.
not_available Torture him? 
not_available I'm talking about what is necessary to stop this warhead being used against us.
not_available Give us a moment, Bill.
not_available Mike, what do you think? I think we need to do whatever it takes to find Marwan.
not_available Walt? Weigh in.
not_available Well, this makes me nervous.
not_available Why? Should this man be innocent, as he claims he is, your first act as president is to sanction his torture.
not_available That'll forever haunt your presidency.
not_available All right, gentlemen.
not_available Here's what I'll agree to.
not_available I'll call a session with members of the Justice Department, and we'll discuss this.
not_available I'll have an answer in 20 minutes.
not_available This thing could be over in 20 minutes.
not_available That's as far as I'm willing to go right now.
not_available With all due respect, sir, please let us do our jobs.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
not_available I'll have Curtis start the interrogation.
not_available We can't afford to be wasting time.
not_available You heard.
not_available He won't let us touch this guy.
not_available The president's not here.
not_available You are.
not_available If I authorize this, they'll know.
not_available We'll all be out.
not_available What if I find a way that wouldn't implicate anyone but me? 
not_available I'm not gonna authorize that, Jack.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Accept my resignation.
not_available And if I do that, what then? 
not_available Release the suspect.
not_available Release him? 
not_available We don't question him, we don't charge him.
not_available He won't need a lawyer or a marshal.
not_available You're gonna take him on as a private citizen? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How far away are you? 32 miles.
not_available When you get there, you'll meet with Morrison.
not_available Is he going to configure the detonation? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I've given him the codes.
not_available OK.
not_available You have to follow the plan exactly, Sabir.
not_available We cannot give them time to start an evacuation.
not_available Yes, Marwan.
not_available I understand.
not_available No delays.
not_available It will be done.
not_available Hey.
not_available When did you get back? 
not_available A few minutes ago.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I could use your help on the DOD interface.
not_available I can't help you now.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'll tell you when I get back.
not_available Jack? Jack? 
not_available Audrey, please.
not_available What are you trying to pull? You wanna torture me, now you're throwing me out.
not_available Right.
not_available They tried to fight the order and couldn't.
not_available No, that's not what this is.
not_available They're doing something.
not_available Don't be so paranoid.
not_available We're not interested.
not_available I want protection when I get out.
not_available The marshal can escort you back No! You know what 
not_available change of plan.
not_available I don't wanna leave here until I know I'm safe.
not_available If you don't leave, I'll have to arrest you for trespassing in a secure government building.
not_available And once that happens, not even your attorney can protect you.
not_available Correct me if I'm wrong, David.
not_available He's right.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available He's been released.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It came from Buchanan.
not_available Why are you letting him go? 
not_available Not now, please.
not_available He's with the people that killed my mother.
not_available Not now.
not_available Cheer up.
not_available You're a free man.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available The marshals gonna take you home.
not_available No! I can't go home.
not_available I gotta go somewhere public.
not_available Fine, tell him where you wanna go.
not_available Don't let anyone know you're there.
not_available Here's my card.
not_available You call me if anyone from CTU tries to bother you.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Make a sound and I will blow your brains all over the windshield.
not_available Handcuff your left arm to the dashboard, now.
not_available Now we're gonna talk.
not_available Now, you and I both know your heart isn't in this.
not_available You just wanted the money.
not_available I don't want you.
not_available AII I want is Marwan.
not_available Marwan? I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, I'm running out of time here, so why don't we just cut to the chase? What? Where's Marwan? I don't know! Where is Marwan? Where's Marwan? 
not_available I don't know! I swear I don't know.
not_available OK, OK, OK.
not_available Marwan's Marwan's gonna be at a place called The Hub tonight.
not_available Where is it? It's It's just Where is it? 
not_available Just east of downtown.
not_available East of downtown.
not_available This will help you with the pain.
