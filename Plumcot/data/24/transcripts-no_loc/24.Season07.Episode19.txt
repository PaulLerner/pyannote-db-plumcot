not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Jack? We need a medic! Bio
not_available agent is more virulent than we thought.
not_available All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.
not_available I understand.
not_available There's something you may want to consider.
not_available What's that? Apossible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor.
not_available I saw your file.
not_available It says you have a daughter.
not_available I don't want my daughter involved in this.
not_available Daddy.
not_available Agent Walker told me that there's a chance
not_available a small chance that I could help you and you don't want me to.
not_available I'm dying, and whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening it is not worth the pain for me to let you sit there and watch me die.
not_available Jack, Hodges has 13 Python missiles armed with the bioweapons.
not_available He demanded that I recall the planes, or he would launch.
not_available Tony Almeida is still inside Starkwood.
not_available He believes he can gain access to the fuel depot and lay a series of explosive charges and take the missiles out.
not_available What do you think you're doin'? 
not_available You're gonna take me down to the fuel tanks.
not_available You're too late.
not_available Jonas, we've taken out your missiles.
not_available It's over, and you're under arrest.
not_available You can't even begin to imagine what you're up against.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available You'll find out.
not_available Agent Moss, this is Davis at auxiliary gate six.
not_available I have a Starkwood op in custody.
not_available He was carrying a canister of the bioweapon.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available I'm looking at it right now.
not_available One of the Starkwood ops.
not_available He's got a canister of the bioweapon.
not_available So I need you to close down all access roads and alert perimeter units and Metro Police.
not_available Janis, get me D.C.
not_available Metro.
not_available I'm gonna pursue from the air.
not_available Let's go! Come on! 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Tony.
not_available Tony! Oh, God.
not_available Tony.
not_available The following takes place between 2:00 a.m.
not_available And 3:00 a.m.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tricia? Matt.
not_available I just got off the phone with Secret Service.
not_available You're cleared with White House security at the south entrance.
not_available How soon do you think you can get there? 
not_available Within the half hour.
not_available Do you have any more information why Hodges was arrested? 
not_available They didn't give me a lot.
not_available Apparently, Jonas was in some kind of a policy meeting with the president and things got out of hand.
not_available And that's when he requested his favorite attorney.
not_available I'm flattered.
not_available I'll call you after I've spoken to him.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Hurry it up.
not_available Janis.
not_available We just got an I.D.
not_available On the suspect.
not_available One of Starkwood's security cameras picked him up leaving the compound.
not_available He was carrying a backpack.
not_available Robert Galvez, two
not_available year Starkwood employee.
not_available Former Special Forces.
not_available Relay that information to Larry.
not_available He needs to know who he's tracking.
not_available I've been trying.
not_available He's not answering his comm.
not_available How far away is backup? 
not_available They're still a few minutes out.
not_available But Agent Park's teams have secured a four
not_available block perimeter.
not_available The bioweapons canister is secured within the cordon.
not_available Get Galvez's picture and description out to Tactical and distribute department
not_available wide.
not_available Got it.
not_available And keep trying Larry.
not_available All units, I'm uploading a photo of the suspect to all agents'P.D.A.'s.
not_available His name is Robert Galvez.
not_available Be advised he has advanced military training, so proceed with caution.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Almeida, are you there? Are you in a secure location? I'm holed up in a storage yard near the projects on Jefferson.
not_available I just spotted a patrol.
not_available I think I better keep moving.
not_available No, don't! The F.B.I.
not_available Has got the entire perimeter locked down, and they know who you are.
not_available How? 
not_available They have a picture.
not_available Which means the search teams can I.D.
not_available You on sight.
not_available Just stay put until I can get a read on their search protocols, and I'll guide you out.
not_available I should have never let you talk me into helping you.
not_available I promise you, that canister you stole for me is worth a lot of money to the people I'm working for.
not_available Hell of a lot of good that money's gonna do me in prison.
not_available Just shut up and do what I tell you to do! Guard the canister, stay put and wait for my call! 
not_available We've got agents down.
not_available Get a med team out here now.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Almeida, can you hear me? What happened? Where's the suspect? 
not_available He ambushed us.
not_available Did you see where he went? I don't know.
not_available Renee, I just got confirmation the tac team has arrived at the scene.
not_available Do we have a 20 on Larry? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Excuse me, Agent Walker.
not_available I know you're busy.
not_available Kim.
not_available I just came to say good
not_available bye.
not_available Goodbye? Where are you going? 
not_available Back to L.A.
not_available Uh, I don't understand.
not_available You're not going through with the treatment to help your father? 
not_available I mean, it's his only chance for a cure.
not_available I know that, and so does he.
not_available But it's a slim one, and he believes it's not worth taking.
not_available So if he's gonna die, he wants it to be on his terms.
not_available Yes, but can't you change his mind? I would think you'd know by now that no one can change my father's mind when it's made up.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry that I put you in this position.
not_available No, don't be.
not_available I'm grateful to you, Agent Walker.
not_available My father and I got to say a lot of things to each other.
not_available I wish I could have said more, but I don't want to cause him any more pain.
not_available Renee, Agent Park is on the phone for you.
not_available I need to take this.
not_available I understand.
not_available Good luck.
not_available This is Walker.
not_available It's Park.
not_available Agent Moss is dead.
not_available What? 
not_available Apparently, he was killed in an ambush by the suspect.
not_available The chopper pilot too.
not_available Tony Almeida's been shot, but he's alive.
not_available I've got medical personnel working on him now.
not_available Agent Walker? Do we have any lead on Galvez? No, but the area's been cordoned off.
not_available Couldn't have gotten far.
not_available We're setting up an operations base here on the scene to coordinate the manhunt.
not_available How do you want to proceed? 
not_available Me? You're the ranking agent in charge now.
not_available Maintain the perimeter.
not_available Begin a south
not_available north sweep.
not_available I'll chopper out a team and meet you there as soon as I can.
not_available Agent Walker, I have more than enough personnel.
not_available You don't need to be involved in the search.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Keep me posted if you hear anything.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Larry? He was killed in a shoot
not_available out with the suspect.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I need you to brief the White House on what's happened.
not_available Call Dr.
not_available Macer.
not_available Have her deploy a hazmat team to the perimeter line.
not_available Assemble a team to chopper out with me.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Someone's gonna need to notify Larry's ex
not_available wife.
not_available Probably shouldn't be me.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available All right.
not_available We've debriefed on hours 8:00 a.m.
not_available To 3:00 p.
not_available M pertaining to the C.I.P.
not_available Recovery and capture of Ik√© Dubaku.
not_available Now
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, maybe you'd like to take a break.
not_available No.
not_available We need to finish this while I still can.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Now, according to your earlier statement, it was about this time it was this time you received intel regarding the imminent attack on the White House.
not_available Tony Almeida provided me with the intel but we did not know the White House was the target.
not_available And who was Mr.
not_available Almeida's source? He was interrogating a mercenary.
not_available Did Almeida give you a name? Um
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Car
not_available Cardiff.
not_available He said his name was Vincent Cardiff.
not_available Did you, yourself, question this source? No.
not_available He didn't survive Tony's interrogation.
not_available But he was the one who provided us with the intel on the upcoming attack.
not_available But we did not know that the White House was the intended target at that time.
not_available We did not know the White House was the intended target
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available You sure you don't wanna take that break? I'm repeating myself again.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Here's the data files you asked for, sir.
not_available Agent Walker's got our assignments, all right? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We are not gonna lose control of this situation.
not_available I know that most of you are tired, working double shifts but I need each and every one of you focused and alert if we are gonna locate the suspect and secure the bioweapon canister that he's carrying.
not_available While I'm out in the field, you will pass all pertinent information out of this office through Janis.
not_available Let's get to work.
not_available Adams, you and your men are with me.
not_available Renee.
not_available Renee.
not_available I'll meet you at the helipad.
not_available The bioweapon's still out there? 
not_available We have it contained.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Wait a second! Just tell me what the hell is going on.
not_available A Starkwood operative by the name of Robert Galvez got away with a canister of the pathogen.
not_available We have him trapped inside a perimeter a mile or so from Starkwood's compound.
not_available Is Larry in command of the perimeter? 
not_available He was killed in a firefight.
not_available What? 
not_available Tony was injured.
not_available He's at the scene with the advance team.
not_available Larry's dead? 
not_available We have two agents down, yes.
not_available I have to go.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available An inch to the left, the bullet might have nicked the splenic artery.
not_available You need to get yourself checked out at the hospital, sir.
not_available I can't do that right now.
not_available Let me get you something for the pain.
not_available No.
not_available I need to keep my head clear.
not_available Sweep Nine, this is Mobile Command.
not_available What's your status? 
not_available Mobile Command, this is Sweep Nine.
not_available Southeast grid 211 clear.
not_available Moving on.
not_available Copy that, Sweep Nine.
not_available Sweep Seven, what's your position? 
not_available Clearing 214.
not_available Nothing so far.
not_available No sign of him? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll find him.
not_available You should get some rest.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're sweeping north, clearing grids.
not_available You got a clear path on Jefferson, all the way up to 12th and 13th Street.
not_available That should be the last sector they're searching.
not_available Judging by their progress, it'll give you about 30 minutes.
not_available Should be plenty of time.
not_available Time for what? You still got that C4 I gave you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got it.
not_available All right.
not_available I want you to find a structure.
not_available A store or warehouse
not_available something big enough where they have to enter and search.
not_available We need to draw as many of them into the building as possible and then blow it.
not_available You want me to blow up a couple of dozen F.B.I.
not_available Agents? 
not_available You got a problem with that? They're still gonna have the perimeter locked down.
not_available I don't see how this is gonna get me out with the canister.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got that worked out.
not_available Ready to go when you're ready.
not_available Watch your step.
not_available Jack, what the hell are you doing? 
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available You're ill.
not_available If my condition interferes with your operation 
not_available I will stand down, I give you my word.
not_available Jack.
not_available You want to keep arguing about this, waste more time, fine.
not_available I'm not getting out.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Ms.
not_available Eames.
not_available You'reJonas Hodges's attorney.
not_available That's right.
not_available They told us to expect you.
not_available I just need you to place your thumb against the glass.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sergeant Cadden will escort you to the holding area.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How could this man have gotten out of Starkwood with a canister of the bioweapon? No one's sure, but he's already murdered four people including Larry Moss.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Has tracked him to a nearby residential district.
not_available They've sealed off the area and are conducting a thorough search.
not_available Mom, this man Galvez is a Starkwood operative.
not_available Clearly, Hodges is behind this.
not_available Maybe.
not_available What do you mean, "maybe"? As Hodges was taken away, he said it wasn't over.
not_available He alluded to others.
not_available Called himself a small cog in a very large machine that I wouldn't be able to stop.
not_available He was ranting.
not_available That doesn't mean he wasn't telling the truth.
not_available We need to find out what Hodges knows about this.
not_available I want him taken to the F.B.I.
not_available For interrogation.
not_available He's a sociopath, Mom.
not_available He's not going to talk.
not_available He's going to want to make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation.
not_available Mom, you're not considering that.
not_available Olivia
not_available You know what this man is, what he did to Roger.
not_available Just get him to F.B.I.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hodges, your attorney's here to see you.
not_available Well, it's about damn time.
not_available We're going to need some privacy.
not_available You're a little taller than her, but it's a good look for you.
not_available Hello, Jonas.
not_available I'm not gonna ask how you got in.
not_available But I'm definitely interested in how you're gonna get me out.
not_available Jonas, you're in a very difficult position and your actions today have put everyone else in a very difficult position.
not_available Oh, I see.
not_available I've upset the cart, have I? Everyone's bent out of shape.
not_available Where the hell were they when the government came after my company when Senator Mayer and his subpoena
not_available waving goon squad were trying to ruin me and everything I built? You would have been protected, Jonas.
not_available You and Starkwood.
not_available But you jeopardized the plan.
not_available That bioweapon that you developed for us was not intended for personal use.
not_available The consensus is that you've had some sort of psychotic break.
not_available Well, the consensus is wrong.
not_available Coming from you right now, that's not much comfort.
not_available I wanna talk to them.
not_available Get some form of communication between us.
not_available I wanna talk to them.
not_available I think it's a little late for that, Jonas.
not_available You've brought undue attention by showing your hand, exposing yourself.
not_available And I'm sure you could understand their concern that you may, in fact, expose the others as well.
not_available How can I do that? I don't know who they are.
not_available You know enough.
not_available And they need to be certain.
not_available I think we can agree that there's no reason for your family to pay for your mistakes.
not_available Is that why you're here? To threaten my family? On the contrary I came to guarantee your family's safety
not_available if you do the right thing.
not_available It'll induce a cardiac arrest and leave no trace in your system.
not_available A natural, dignified death.
not_available Without you to prosecute, the case against you and your company will be difficult likely impossible preserving at least some small part of Starkwood's legacy of patriotic service.
not_available Which I know is very important to you.
not_available Party's over, counselor.
not_available We're moving him to the Bureau.
not_available My client has invoked his right to silence and to counsel.
not_available No one speaks to him unless in my presence.
not_available Is that understood? In some countries, they'd have shot him by now.
not_available Process him out.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Step outside, sir.
not_available Hands.
not_available Yes.
not_available I met with him.
not_available And? I'm quite certain he understands our terms.
not_available They're transferring him to the F.B.I.
not_available For interrogation.
not_available Will that be a problem? Hopefully it'll just pressure him to resolve the situation sooner rather than later.
not_available I'll be happy when this is behind us.
not_available Have you heard from Almeida? 
not_available He called in before I met with Hodges.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Has he secured the canister? 
not_available Soon.
not_available He's your guy.
not_available He better not screw this up.
not_available Tony's been the one bright spot in an otherwise dreary day.
not_available I have faith he'll come through.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I found a place to set up.
not_available It's an abandoned apartment building just shy of the north perimeter line.
not_available Yeah, I see it.
not_available Sweep teams are just entering three sectors to the south.
not_available You got less than 20 minutes.
not_available That doesn't give me much time.
not_available No, it doesn't.
not_available Maybe you should get off the phone and get to it.
not_available I lost two partners in a row.
not_available Early on.
not_available I couldn't handle it.
not_available I guess that's why, over the last 10 years, I've pretty much worked alone.
not_available It's all right for you to be feeling what you're feeling.
not_available But if you can't do this tonight, that's all right too.
not_available Just don't try to pretend like you're not feeling anything.
not_available That's how you make a mistake.
not_available Please, Jack.
not_available Don't tell me what to feel and don't tell me how to feel it.
not_available Come on! Let's go! Right over there.
not_available Jack! Where is he? 
not_available Around the S.U.V.
not_available You okay? Yeah, I got lucky.
not_available The bullet went right straight through.
not_available I didn't think I'd see you out here.
not_available I'm only here for observation.
not_available You do not have to do this.
not_available Show me.
not_available Cover him up.
not_available I'm sorry about Larry.
not_available How the hell did this happen? 
not_available It all went down pretty fast.
not_available I mean
not_available We were ambushed before we got out of the helicopter.
not_available The chopper pilot was hit first and I was unarmed, so Larry laid down cover so I could get clear.
not_available I don't remember a lot, but I definitely heard auto fire.
not_available Once I was tagged, Larry came over to help me out, and that's when he was hit.
not_available I blacked out after that, but I'm pretty sure Larry saved my life.
not_available Larry was hit with heavy ordnanceshotgun rounds, armor
not_available piercing.
not_available You obviously were hit with something smaller
not_available jacketed.
not_available I treated Mr.
not_available A lmeida.
not_available His wound was consistent with a nine
not_available millimeter.
not_available You sure it wasn't a.45? 
not_available Not likely.
not_available The entry was too small.
not_available Why? Because you have spent.45 casings in evidence.
not_available Galvez had access to the weapons inside the F.B.I.
not_available Vehicle he stole.
not_available He probably switched in the middle of the fight.
not_available That many weapons? In the time frame that you described the ambush? 
not_available Doesn't add up.
not_available Okay.
not_available So what are you saying? Someone was with him.
not_available Like I said, it all happened pretty fast, but
not_available I mean, I didn't think so.
not_available I guess it makes sense.
not_available One man didn't do this alone.
not_available He had help.
not_available I'll tell Park to alert the field.
not_available You sure you're okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Hello.
not_available Did I wake you? No.
not_available Who could sleep after what happened today? How'd it go with your father? 
not_available Sweetheart? What is it? What happened? 
not_available He's dying, Stephen.
not_available What? He was exposed to something, like a biological agent.
not_available It had something to do with the attacks that took place earlier today.
not_available Kim, honey, I'm so sorry.
not_available Um, isn't there anything that they can do? No.
not_available I'm coming back home.
not_available Don't you wanna stay? Don't you wanna be with him as long as you can? My presence, with what he's going through right now, will only make things worse.
not_available Did you at least, uh
not_available Did you tell him about his granddaughter? Hi, honey.
not_available Kim.
not_available I couldn't, Stephen.
not_available I couldn't bring myself to tell him I wasn't the only person he was leaving behind.
not_available Telling him about Teri would have only made it worse.
not_available I'm gonna try and get on the 6:10.
not_available If I do, I'll be back in L.A.
not_available By 9:00.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can always leave later, if you change your mind.
not_available I won't.
not_available I love you both.
not_available We love you too.
not_available Bye.
not_available Mobile Command, this is Sweep Nine.
not_available 221 is clear.
not_available Copy, Nine.
not_available Proceed to 224.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Why has that area of the grid not been cleared? Sweep Three, why have you not cleared 219? Mobile Command, we're encountering some resistance from the neighborhood residents.
not_available They're not happy about their homes being searched without a warrant at 2:30 in the morning.
not_available I'm concerned about their safety, not their happiness.
not_available Whoever was helping Galvez may be providing him shelter in one of those houses.
not_available If those civilians are interfering in that sweep, arrest them.
not_available But get that area cleared.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Copy that.
not_available Jack.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Westbound is his point.
not_available It's my anti
not_available seizure medicine.
not_available I should have used it earlier.
not_available Jack, what are you doing out here? Why don't you go back to F.B.I.
not_available Medical and let them treat you? 
not_available There is no treatment.
not_available There's no cure.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why are you in the field? Agent Walker just lost her partner, Tony.
not_available Thought I could help.
not_available I owe her that much.
not_available Agent Stoller to Mobile Command.
not_available Code yellow.
not_available Go ahead, Agent Stoller.
not_available This is Mobile Command.
not_available Are you reporting a code yellow? Affirmative.
not_available I have a confirmed visual on the target suspect with the canister.
not_available Repeat: Confirmed visual of suspect and canister.
not_available Agent Park, may I? Agent Stoller, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available Is Galvez with someone? Agent Stoller? 
not_available Negative.
not_available He's alone.
not_available Repeat.
not_available He is alone.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What's his 20? Entering an abandoned apartment building on the south side of Rincon and 12th.
not_available I am in pursuit.
not_available Try to maintain a visual and wait for backup.
not_available Do not engage until we get there.
not_available Copy that.
not_available All primary units respond to 12th and Rincon.
not_available Suspect sighted entering building with canister.
not_available Code yellow.
not_available Agent Park.
not_available I want a secure net around the building.
not_available Agents at all exits.
not_available I want sharpshooters covering all four exposures.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Jack.
not_available I can't.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available I'll stay back.
not_available I'll watch operations.
not_available You be careful out there.
not_available I still think Galvez has a partner.
not_available You watch your back.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hellfire.
not_available You served with the 27 th in Pakistan.
not_available Two tours, sir.
not_available Did you, by any chance, encounter any Starkwood units? 
not_available There was a force protection team attached by my C.O.
not_available They fought with you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Side by side.
not_available Soldier.
not_available How would you rate their professionalism, their performance under fire? They were good men, sir.
not_available Well trained.
not_available Thank you, son.
not_available You just made my day.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Our orders are to deliver the prisoner to the rear entrance at F.B.I.
not_available White House wants to keep this low
not_available key.
not_available Sarge.
not_available This is Sergeant Cadden! Prisoner's in severe cardiac and respiratory distress! We are rerouting to West Arlington Hospital.
not_available Need emergency medical team standing by! Go, go! 
not_available Assemble the teams.
not_available Got it.
not_available Agent Stoller, this is Agent Walker.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available I copy you, Agent Walker.
not_available What is your position? East of stairwell, between the first and second floor.
not_available Suspect with canister has moved to the top floor.
not_available Do you have any indication that he's not alone? 
not_available Negative.
not_available Not at this time.
not_available All right.
not_available Stand by.
not_available We're coming to you.
not_available Agent Stoller puts the suspect somewhere on the second floor.
not_available However, there's no guarantee that he's the only hostile in the building.
not_available Therefore, we stick to S.O.P.
not_available Clearing room by room.
not_available Agent Park and I will lead two teams, east and west.
not_available Check your weapons and headsets.
not_available We move in 60 seconds.
not_available You guys are with me.
not_available You guys are with Agent Walker.
not_available Mobile Command.
not_available This is Walker.
not_available Go ahead, Agent Walker.
not_available We're about to enter the building.
not_available Have hazmat teams on alert in case the canister gets breached.
not_available How you holdin' up? 
not_available Better, thanks.
not_available Move! 
not_available Go! 
not_available We're movin'in! 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, this is Agent Mizelli.
not_available Sorry to bother you with this, but I need to follow up on something from our debrief.
not_available Agent, this isn't a good time.
not_available Some new information has come to light 
not_available and I need to clear up a discrepancy.
not_available What discrepancy? You told me Tony Almeida's source on the White House attack 
not_available was a man identified to you as Vincent Cardiff.
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Is there a possibility you misremembered the name? 
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available Are you sure? You, yourself, had voiced some concern about your own acuity.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What is this here? Agent Mizelli, I'm gonna have to get back to you.
not_available Locator codes for all units'radio transponders.
not_available Are they in real time? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Can you do a map overlay? 
not_available It'll take a minute.
not_available Get it done.
not_available What's going on, Jack? 
not_available I'm not sure yet.
not_available Second level.
not_available Clear.
not_available We can go through it.
not_available Let's see the next room.
not_available Bring it back.
not_available Clear.
not_available Heading to the third floor.
not_available To the third level.
not_available Here's the all clear! Let's go! Let's go! 
not_available Right there.
not_available There's Stoller's transponder.
not_available He's not even in the building.
not_available Agent Walker, this is Jack.
not_available Get your men out of the building.
not_available It's a trap.
not_available Jack, what? Stoller's not even in there.
not_available Get your men out now! Code blue! Repeat, code blue! 
not_available Cold blue! Move 'em out! 
not_available Move, move! 
not_available Keep back! Agent Walker! Agent Park! Get us a vehicle.
not_available Now! All perimeter teams, this is Park.
not_available Agents are down at corner of 12th and Rincon.
not_available We need assistance.
not_available Negative, negative.
not_available Disregard that order.
not_available Maintain your positions.
not_available I repeat, maintain your positions.
not_available What the hell are you doin'? 
not_available They are trying to pull you off the line.
not_available You leave a hole in that perimeter, we are gonna lose the canister.
not_available Tell your men to stand fast.
not_available Medevac is on its way.
not_available Get them in the air now! 
not_available I got you.
not_available Set up a triage! 
not_available Up, up.
not_available Jack, I'm goin' in! Agent Park! Agent Park! How many men are unaccounted for? 
not_available Still assessing.
not_available There were at least 30 of us in the building when it went up.
not_available And Agent Walker? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Renee, this is Jack.
not_available Do you copy? Renee, this is Jack.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available Almeida.
not_available You have the canister? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available We need to get moving.
not_available Renee! Renee! Renee! Jack! Jack! Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available But he's not breathing.
not_available We need a medic! They've got him.
not_available I want to get you out of here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go now! How'd you know it was a trap? 
not_available Stoller's transponder was outside of the building.
not_available They were trying to thin our ranks, create a diversion.
not_available Has the cordon been breached? 
not_available No.
not_available I told the men to maintain their positions.
not_available The perimeter's secure.
not_available It's almost like they knew, Jack.
not_available They would've needed time to wire this building with explosives.
not_available This is the last sector we were due to search.
not_available You think they knew your sweep patterns? 
not_available They must have.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What is it, Jack? I'll meet you back at your vehicle.
not_available Hey, you want me to take him? 
not_available No, I got him.
not_available They need your help inside.
not_available Agent Mizelli.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available You said you wanted to talk to me about Tony's suspect, Vincent Cardiff? Yes, yes.
not_available Thanks for gettin' back to me.
not_available Listen, you told me that he expired during the course ofTony Almeida's interrogation? 
not_available Yeah, that's what Tony told me.
not_available Well, it can't be him.
not_available What are you talking about? Vincent Cardiff was picked up over an hour ago by Customs 
not_available trying to cross the border into Canada.
not_available Are you sure? Look, I'm positive.
not_available I've got his arrest report right here.
not_available Cardiff's alive.
not_available Were there any signs from his interrogation? Physical violence, abuse.
not_available Anything at all.
not_available Nothing's indicated on the report.
not_available That's why I was asking if maybe you had mistaken the name that Almeida gave you.
not_available Okay.
not_available I got him.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tony! Tony! 
not_available Yeah? 
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Sure.
not_available What's goin' on? I told you earlier today, if you were lying to me, I'd kill you myself.
not_available What the hell you talkin' about? Cardiff.
not_available Vincent Cardiff! You said he was killed during his interrogation.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So? 
not_available He's alive and well, in custody.
not_available And he's showing no signs of physical abuse.
not_available Explain that.
not_available All right, look, Jack.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Cardiff knew that by spilling that intel, he was gonna get himself killed.
not_available So I cut a deal with him.
not_available I told him I'd let the F.B.I.
not_available Think he was dead so he could walk away and disappear.
not_available I thought it was just a meaningless lie.
not_available You and I have been doing this long enough to know that there is no such thing as a meaningless lie.
not_available How are you involved in this? 
not_available You're not making any sense, Jack.
not_available That intel was good.
not_available Without it, you'd have never been in the White House to save the president.
not_available What is your involvement? 
not_available You're not thinkin' straight.
not_available How were you shot? Does Galvez even have a second man, or was itjust you? Just stop and listen to what you're sayin'.
not_available It's insane.
not_available It's paranoia.
not_available Now, why don't you put the gun down? Don't you move! The toxin's starting to affect your judgment.
not_available That's what's happening.
not_available You can see that, right? 
not_available Is this what you're lookin' for? I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.
not_available I told you to stay out of it, but you wouldn't listen, would you? Can we get some help here? This man's havin' a seizure.
not_available Stand back, please.
not_available Go get my bag, and call Dr.
not_available Macer, stat.
not_available You're gonna be all right, sir.
not_available Just try to breathe.
not_available Relax.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available I don't see anything.
not_available The wound must be posterior.
not_available Sir, I need to turn you on your side.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Keep driving.
not_available Now!
