
not_available Who is it you're looking for? Someone who can give me the names of everyone else involved.
not_available I need you to write the story in case I don't make it.
not_available If Dalia Hassan finds out that the Russians had a hand in the death of her husband, she'll never sign the agreement.
not_available I need to speak to your mother.
not_available It's about the people who really murdered your father.
not_available We know who is responsible.
not_available What you don't know is, those people were working under the orders of Russian agents.
not_available Bauer made contact with Meredith Reed.
not_available My God.
not_available You need to call her publisher and demand that they do not run the story.
not_available You're suggesting muzzling the press? If you don't use the power of your office to shut this story down, your peace agreement won't be the only casualty.
not_available I need you to contact the FBI.
not_available Have them locate Reed and seize whatever evidence she purports to have.
not_available Meredith Reed? FBI.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Let's go.
not_available But I You were right about Jack.
not_available He is working with somebody.
not_available It's James Ricker, ex
not_available CIA op.
not_available We found him living in a place on Mercer Street.
not_available He's not gonna be happy we tracked him down.
not_available I need you to talk to him.
not_available Get him to tell us where Jack is.
not_available Are you good with that, or have you still not taken sides? I want to expose this cover
not_available up as much as you.
not_available I'm in.
not_available That's Jack Bauer! Get up.
not_available I could just kill you right here.
not_available Do you know the name of the person inside the Russian government who's giving the orders? I want that name.
not_available Jack.
not_available Give me the name! I'll tell you.
not_available Four.
not_available Three.
not_available Mikhail Novakovich! Where's Novakovich? He's dead.
not_available Bauer just came in shooting.
not_available Mikhail Novakovich was just murdered by Jack Bauer.
not_available What? As far as, uh, Bauer is concerned, the trail ended with Novakovich.
not_available Then Bauer has no idea that Novakovich was operating under my orders? None.
not_available If you're so worried about Bauer, you never should have given the order to kill Renee Walker.
not_available Arlo.
not_available Cole, I just picked up a preliminary flash.
not_available Jack murdered Novakovich at his hotel, and six of his security guards.
not_available According to a witness, Jack killed all seven men on his own.
not_available Then fell right back off the radar.
not_available Eden can't find any trace of him.
not_available Does Chloe know about this? I just talked to her, and she should be at the U.N.
not_available any minute.
not_available Cole, I know that we need this evidence that Jack has, but this crime scene is a slaughterhouse.
not_available Does Chloe really still think she can pull this off? If anyone can talk Jack down, it's Chloe.
not_available And if she can't? Then we're both prepared to do whatever it takes to stop him.
not_available Even when Novakovich's whole security staff couldn't? What do you want me to do, Arlo? The truth about what went down today needs to get out, and that's not going to happen unless we get to Jack.
not_available Look, I'm coming up on Ricker's apartment.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available Cole.
not_available COLE: What? Ricker went to a lot of trouble to disappear.
not_available He's not going to like that you found him.
not_available I'm not expecting him to.
not_available You're looking at the U.N.
not_available Plaza gardens and the podium from which all three co
not_available sponsors of the peace treaty will address the public following a private signing ceremony inside the U.N.'s Council Chamber.
not_available Russian President Yuri Suvarov, the third co
not_available sponsor of the treaty, is en route to the U.N.
not_available where he will join President Taylor and acting IRK President Dalia Hassan Mr.
not_available Ricker, this is Agent Ortiz, CTU! Open that door.
not_available Before you pull that trigger, there's something you ought to know.
not_available I don't place a call in 15 minutes, every intelligence agency in the country gets alerted about you.
not_available Weapon charges alone will get you locked up for the duration, Or you can help us find Jack Bauer, and we'll keep our mouths shut.
not_available You think you're protecting him? The order on Jack Bauer is shoot to kill.
not_available He knew what he was getting himself into.
not_available Jack's not thinking straight.
not_available Look, I read your file.
not_available I know Jack saved your life in Damascus.
not_available This is your opportunity to pay back that debt.
not_available You know how this is gonna end, right? Do you? If Jack dies today, it's on you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Thanks, Adam.
not_available Director O'Brian, Agent Burke.
not_available I have the revised security assessment for you.
not_available Ma'am, I noticed that Agent Ortiz's name was back on the duty roster.
not_available That's right.
not_available He was arrested for helping Jack Bauer.
not_available I got him a temporary clearance so he could help us out here.
not_available He was the one who designed the U.N.
not_available protocols in the first place.
not_available I know.
not_available Do you really think we can trust him? I wouldn't have gotten him a release if I didn't.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What happened? Not good, Chloe.
not_available I think Jack's targeting Suvarov.
not_available Is that what Ricker said? Yeah.
not_available Jack planted a bug on Charles Logan, overheard a conversation between the two men.
not_available Turns out Suvarov's the one who gave the order for Renee to be killed.
not_available Does Ricker have a recording of that conversation? No.
not_available He wiped his system clean as soon as he saw me coming.
not_available But the surveillance rig he gave Jack records everything to a backup, so Jack has a copy.
not_available Good.
not_available We're gonna need it.
not_available Why? The White House just arrested Meredith Reed.
not_available They confiscated a data card from her.
not_available Dana's evidence.
not_available Exactly.
not_available The recording that Jack has is the only proof we have now.
not_available Chloe, I don't know that getting proof is our first priority anymore.
not_available We have to put an alert out on Jack.
not_available If we do that, then Pillar will get to him first.
not_available He'll kill Jack, and he'll destroy the recording.
not_available Chloe, we can't stand by and let Jack assassinate the president of Russia.
not_available No, but we can buy ourselves time.
not_available Can change Suvarov's motorcade route, sequester him in the U.N.
not_available Make it impossible for Jack to get to him.
not_available Yeah, except Suvarov's gonna be standing at that podium soon, and once he's exposed like that, we can't protect him.
not_available That's not happening for over an hour.
not_available If we haven't found Jack by then, then we can put out the alert.
not_available It's still taking a big risk, Chloe.
not_available I know.
not_available All right, get Suvarov's route changed.
not_available But you're putting me in charge of his security as soon as he gets to the U.N.
not_available How far out are you? I'll be there in ten.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sir, the flash about Novakovich is going out.
not_available You wanted to speak with the president before that happened.
not_available Ah.
not_available Thank you, Jason.
not_available Oh, um do we know anything about Bauer? No.
not_available Nothing.
not_available If you don't mind me asking, sir.
not_available What are you going to tell the president? I think it's time she she knows everything.
not_available All the delegates are present with the exception of Suvarov, who's still in transit.
not_available He'll be given the details once he arrives.
not_available Excuse me, Tim.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I'm about to go into the protocol meeting.
not_available What's going on? I wanted you to hear this news from me first.
not_available What news? I tried to insulate you as long as I could, preserve your plausible deniability, but Just tell me what you're talking about, Charles.
not_available Jack Bauer isn't just trying to gather evidence about the conspiracy.
not_available He's He's seeking retribution.
not_available Go on.
not_available Bauer just murdered Mikhail Novakovich, along with a good number of his staff.
not_available So Novakovich was responsible for the assassination of President Hassan? Yes.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Novakovich was the ranking member of the Russian Delegation.
not_available President Suvarov is going to demand an explanation.
not_available Actually, he's not.
not_available Are you telling me that Hassan's murder goes all the way up to Suvarov? Yes.
not_available But the good news is that Bauer doesn't know that.
not_available How can you be sure? Because according to a witness, Bauer killed Novakovich before he could talk.
not_available And aside from me, Novakavich is the only person who ever knew that Suvarov was calling the shots.
not_available Madam President, Bauer's finished what he started, an
not_available and Suvarov will be happy to sweep this under the rug.
not_available An
not_available and the peace agreement can go forward as planned.
not_available This is Really, we couldn't have asked for a better outcome.
not_available Except that I am asking Dalia Hassan to shake hands with her husband's murderer.
not_available Madam President Call Suvarov.
not_available Tell him that I am aware of his involvement in this, and that I will see him at the signing.
not_available My apologies.
not_available Thank you for waiting.
not_available How did the call go? I told the president about Suvarov's involvement, and, um she understood
not_available not that she has an alternative.
not_available Well, that's good news, sir.
not_available PILLAR: Your new Secret Service detail's here to escort you to the U.N.
not_available Thank you, Jason.
not_available It's been a long road, but, uh we're almost there.
not_available Anything new on Bauer? A security camera picked him up leaving Novakovich's hotel.
not_available Confirmed what Berkov told us.
not_available Bauer was definitely wounded during the attack.
not_available How badly? Badly enough that he's gonna need treatment.
not_available Getting alerts out to medical facilities now.
not_available All right, also let Port Authority and INS know Bauer might be trying to get out of the country.
not_available We'll find him
not_available it's only a question of time.
not_available Maybe a little quicker than you thought.
not_available Slowly, take your weapon out and pass it back to me.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Start the car and drive.
not_available You saw what I did to Pavel.
not_available I didn't have a lot of time with him.
not_available You, I've got all the time in the world.
not_available So you either do what I say, or I will take you apart piece by piece.
not_available Now, drive! Where are we going? The U.N.
not_available Why? You already got what you wanted.
not_available You killed everyone involved.
not_available Save your breath.
not_available I know about President Suvarov.
not_available Your delegations will be joining you at the reception after the post
not_available signing ceremony.
not_available And finally, on behalf of the U.N.
not_available staff, I would like to say that we are all honored to be part of this historic occasion.
not_available Thank you for your time.
not_available Your daughter's been waiting inside to speak to you.
not_available She says it's important.
not_available Let her know I'll be right there.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President.
not_available I have something for you.
not_available It's from Omar.
not_available He wanted to give it to you to sign the agreement, and I'm grateful that I can do so on his behalf.
not_available It reads: "All religions, "all this singing, "one song, peace be with you." It is a verse Omar would quote from Rumi when he was talking about what you and he were trying to achieve.
not_available Thank you for seeing this through and for helping us all do justice to his memory.
not_available Dalia, I am I am honored.
not_available I'm very honored.
not_available Th Kayla, what is it? Meredith Reed called the residence looking for you.
not_available I am not interested in that woman's condolences.
not_available That is not why she called.
not_available She says she has information about the people who are behind Father's murder.
not_available But we know who was behind your father's death
not_available extremists in our country.
not_available She claims that they had outside hKYp.
not_available That the Russians were involved.
not_available Why would she say such a thing? Does she have evidence, or is this just a rumor? I don't know, but it can't have been easy for her to call you.
not_available I don't think she would have done so because of a rumor.
not_available What else did she say? She wouldn't say anything more until she talked to you.
not_available She left her number.
not_available Let's call her from the residence.
not_available Ann, President Suvarov's motorcade is delayed five minutes because of the new routeput out an all
not_available agency.
not_available How do you want it coded? Eyes only.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Lanza, make sure Burke reports here with a set of tactical gear for Agent Ortiz.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Arlo's at CTU, running the surveillance video through facial recognition software.
not_available Still no sign of Jack.
not_available Look, I've been thinking.
not_available Let's say we do get this recording from Jack.
not_available What are we supposed to do with it? I mean, if the president's willing to lock down Meredith Reed She can't shut down every media outlet in the world, which is where we're gonna send this file.
not_available We're also gonna send it to every government employee in the country.
not_available Legislative, military, judiciary
not_available that's over a hundred thousand people.
not_available How are we doing this? By using CTU servers, we can distribute it simultaneously to everyone.
not_available President Taylor won't be able to stop the truth from getting out.
not_available Burke.
not_available Good to see yo Sir.
not_available Did you use the revised protocol for President Suvarov's arrival? Yes, ma'am.
not_available We're now bringing the motorcade into the FDR Drive ramp.
not_available Good.
not_available Make sure that Agent Ortiz has the revised protocols.
not_available He's back in charge.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available We're going to the Hart Building.
not_available I want you to park underground.
not_available This guard's life is in your hands.
not_available You make one move that I don't like, I'm gonna kill you both, you understand? Jason Pillar.
not_available There's no one inside.
not_available They left the building two hours ago.
not_available Yeah, I'm just running a last
not_available minute security check.
not_available Of course, sir.
not_available Is there anything else, sir? No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Drive.
not_available Pull in over here.
not_available Slowly, with your right hand, take the keys out of the ignition and pass them back.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available Now! Close the door.
not_available Put your hands on the roof.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Suvarov's not gonna be out on the podium for another hour.
not_available You're not gonna make it that long, not the way you're bleeding.
not_available Slowly, back up towards me.
not_available Stop.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Good.
not_available You're gonna suture me up.
not_available You try and make a move on me, the slightest twitch, I will put a bullet in your brain.
not_available You got it? Yes.
not_available I don't understand something.
not_available You've spent your entire career working outside the system; you've always had a good reason.
not_available But this it's just blood lost.
not_available You're destroying an agreement that took years to put together.
not_available An agreement made by murderers and liars.
not_available Murderers? You're the one killing people in cold blood.
not_available Everybody I took out had a hand in today's attack.
not_available But who makes you judge and jury? President Taylor, when she agreed to the cover
not_available up.
not_available I would have accepted justice by law but that was taken away from me by people like you.
not_available So you're right
not_available I am judge and jury.
not_available Now, step back.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Start to move back towards the car.
not_available Look, I came in after Hassan and Renee were killed.
not_available I didn't have anything to do with that, you have to believe me.
not_available Get on your knees! Please, Bauer, I'm telling you the truth.
not_available I've got a family; I've got a little girl.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Please I'm telling you the truth.
not_available Still no answer.
not_available Are you sure this is Meredith Reed's number? It's the number she gave me.
not_available Then why isn't she answering? I just talked to Gary Klausner, Ms.
not_available Reed's editor.
not_available He doesn't know where she is and has no way to reach her.
not_available He seemed very anxious to get off the phone.
not_available Where are you going? President Taylor and I are supposed to be sitting across the table from Yuri Suvarov in less than an hour.
not_available If his government was involved in murdering your father, President Taylor needs to know.
not_available Following the death of Omar Hassan, President Suvarov was reportedly pessimistic about the viability of the peace treaty.
not_available But rumors of a Russian withdrawal were soon dismissed by the White House, and President Suvarov is expected to arrive at the U.N.
not_available shortly.
not_available Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available It's Dalia Hassan.
not_available I'll have to call her back.
not_available She's outside, ma'am.
not_available She says it's urgent.
not_available Send her in.
not_available Madam President, forgive me.
not_available I have just heard something that is very disturbing.
not_available What did you hear? That the Russian government, or people within the Russian government, were involved in the murder of my husband.
not_available Where did you hear this? My daughter received a phone call from the journalist, Meredith Reed.
not_available Have you spoken with her yourself? No.
not_available I've tried everything, but I've been unable to reach her.
not_available I came here to ask for your help finding Miss Reed.
not_available I need to know if there is any truth in what she said.
not_available Dalia, we heard a rumor about the Russians being involved as well.
not_available And you didn't tell me? No.
not_available Because we looked into it and found that there was nothing backing it up.
not_available It was just a frivolous accusation.
not_available Whatever else she may be, Meredith Reed is not a frivolous woman.
not_available She came to me, someone she knew would have every reason to doubt her.
not_available Dalia I know that you want answers but we are signing the agreement in less than an hour.
not_available Madam President, I feel like you're not listening to me.
not_available Before I sign a treaty with people who may have murdered my husband, I need help finding this woman.
not_available Please.
not_available I will do the best I can in the time that we have left.
not_available I don't think I'm making myself clear.
not_available Until I determine if her allegations are true, I will not sign this treaty.
not_available Dalia please, be reasonable.
not_available This is my position, Madam President.
not_available I will not change my mind.
not_available Then you You leave me no choice.
not_available I had Meredith Reed arrested.
not_available Why? Because her allegations would be too damaging.
not_available That doesn't make any sense.
not_available You wouldn't arrest someone for making false allegations.
not_available Unless they aren't false.
not_available You knew! You knew the Russians were behind my husband's death, and you said nothing?! Dalia, I am so sorry.
not_available Itit was an im
not_available impossible situation.
not_available I was trying to protect you.
not_available Protect me? You betrayed me! Dalia, we are about to complete the most important diplomatic action in generations.
not_available Your husband sacrificed his life to preserve this agreement How dare you invoke my husband! He never would have stood for this! This treaty happened because he trusted you.
not_available And even though every fiber in my being wanted to go home and grieve, I carried on because I trusted you.
not_available But not anymore.
not_available I will not make peace with the people who murdered my husband.
not_available Or with you.
not_available There will be no agreement.
not_available I will be entering a formal complaint with the United Nations, demanding that you release Ms.
not_available Reed, and disclose whatever evidence you've kept from me and from the rest of the world! Stop! In one hour, you will stand beside me in the council chamber, and you will sign the treaty your husband and I agreed to.
not_available I will not! You will! Because if you don't, my administration will disclose hard, indisputable evidence that agents inside your intelligence service attempted to detonate a nuclear device on our soil, which will give me all the justification I need to retaliate against the IRK with the full force of the American military.
not_available It will be decades before your country recovers.
not_available But it doesn't need to come to that.
not_available All you have to do is sign the agreement.
not_available Dalia?! First they murder my husband, and now this woman who has lied to me is threatening my country! I don't see a way out of this, Madam President.
not_available We can tell the world what these Russian bastards did, and how President Taylor protected them.
not_available We can take our case directly to The Hague.
not_available There is no case.
not_available No proof to support any of these accusations.
not_available More important, there are President Taylor's threats to consider.
not_available We cannot dismiss them.
not_available Our military can protect us from incursion.
not_available And if necessary, we can reactivate our nuclear program! Giving your husband's enemies exactly what they wanted in the first place.
not_available In addition to providing her with even more of an excuse to launch a preemptive military strike against us.
not_available I don't care what President Taylor said; she wouldn't dare.
not_available Can you really take that chance? Yes? Thank you.
not_available Yuri Suvarov's delegation will be arriving any moment.
not_available President Taylor is expecting you there to greet him.
not_available Agent Ortiz? What's going on? I spoke with Arlo.
not_available He got a facial recognition hit on Jack.
not_available Where? Inside our perimeter.
not_available He's here, Cole.
not_available He's been careful to avoid all the security cameras, but Arlo found this.
not_available It's from the 22nd floor of the Hart Building across the street from the U.N.
not_available The software picked up his reflection.
not_available How did he get into the building? According to the logs, the only person that entered the building within the past 20 minutes was Pillar.
not_available Jack must have taken him hostage.
not_available The windows on the east side of the building give him a clean line of sight down onto the podium.
not_available I'm going to go find him.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available You can't.
not_available It would just cause a fight.
not_available I'm the only one that Jack will listen to.
not_available And what if he doesn't? Give me 20 minutes.
not_available If you don't hear from me, we'll follow through with our plan.
not_available Sound the alarm about Jack and secure Suvarov.
not_available Okay.
not_available And keep your comm open.
not_available I want to know what's going on.
not_available I can't.
not_available CTU is monitoring all frequencies.
not_available It's too risky.
not_available All right.
not_available At least take this.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Where's O'Brian headed? She's running a last
not_available minute perimeter sweep.
not_available By herself? Keep a real
not_available time uplink open with Suvarov's security people.
not_available Let me know when it's up and running.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available As long as I can remember, every time I've had to talk to you, it seems, for one reason or another, I've started out by telling you how sorry I am.
not_available I'm not going to do that to you now.
not_available You're going to hear a lot of stories about what I've done today.
not_available Some of them may even be true.
not_available But no one, and I mean no one can tell you why I did what I did except for me.
not_available And a lot of good people died today.
not_available Not just President Hassan.
not_available Operatives from CTU, members of other law enforcement agencies.
not_available ReneWalker.
not_available Who I was very close to.
not_available Yes? Thank you.
not_available President Suvarov's motorcade has just rounded the corner.
not_available Was Mrs.
not_available Hassan notified of his arrival? I believe so, ma'am.
not_available Yes or no, Tim? Which is it? Is she coming or not? Why wouldn't she be? President Taylor, that we are all here together is a tribute to your persistence.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hassan, I am sorry for your loss.
not_available I admired your husband very much.
not_available We're wanted upstairs for the press conference.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Dalia, I know that this is very difficult for you.
not_available There is nothing left for either of us to say, Madam President.
not_available Chloe O'Brian, Director of CTU.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Master key and building schematics you requested.
not_available Good afternoon, fellow delegates and ladies and gentlemen of the press.
not_available The last 24 hours have been the most difficult in this long and challenging road that we've all traveled together to reach this moment.
not_available Now, the eyes of the entire world are looking to the leaders standing here with me now, ready to usher in a new era of transparency, honesty and trust.
not_available President Taylor, President Hassan President Suvarov have each risen to this challenge for the sake of world peace.
not_available And the treaty that they have created together represents the culmination of their courageous efforts.
not_available Agent Burke? Sir.
not_available I need you to assemble a tenman squad and deploy them to Sector C
not_available 7.
not_available The Hart Building, sir? We already have men on post there.
not_available Not nearly enough if there's a threat anywhere along that corridor.
not_available Keep your men outside the building until you hear otherwise.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What the hell are you doing here? You don't have to kill Suvarov.
not_available There's another way.
not_available Who else knows where I am? Please listen.
not_available Who else knows?! Cole and Arlo.
not_available If I don't get you out of here in ten minutes, Cole's gonna send in every agent we have.
not_available Jack, they're going to kill you.
not_available There's a standing order to shoot you on sight.
not_available I couldn't let that happen.
not_available You shouldn't have come after me.
not_available You're my friend.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available Don't fight it.
not_available Don't fight it.
not_available Jason, you watching this? Jason? I have a fivefive
not_available six rifle pointed straight at your head.
not_available Bauer.
not_available The bullet travels If you try and move, you're a dead man.
not_available Which means you need to do exactly what I say.
not_available Do you understand? Do you understand? Uh, Jack, I told you everything I know.
not_available And you thought I believed you? And aside from me, Novakovich was the only one who knew that Suvarov was calling the shots.
not_available What do you want? I want you to call President Suvarov and have him meet you where you are as soon as the press conference is over.
not_available What am I supposed to tell him? Try the truth for a change.
not_available Tell him you've got credible intelligence about a threat to his life.
