
not_available I'm reprogramming a CTU key card right now.
not_available Good.
not_available Our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets.
not_available They'll be in place soon.
not_available When are you launching your attacks? After you're done at CTU.
not_available When these terrorists attack, you're going to need to maintain order.
not_available I believe we should be thinking of a preemptive declaration of martial law in the Greater Los Angeles area.
not_available If CTU can't find this man, Bierko, we're gonna get hit! Why didn't you just tell me you were alive? If you knew I was alive, you would have been at risk, and I had no choice.
not_available I'm happy that you're alive
not_available I am, but I can't give you what you want right now.
not_available Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan.
not_available to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas.
not_available Who's behind it? 
not_available Christopher Anderson.
not_available Whatever he's not telling us is important.
not_available And he's willing to tolerate an inhuman amount of pain.
not_available Thousands of lives Are at stake.
not_available There is enough time for you to tell me what I need to know to stop this insanity, please! I'm sorry, guy, but I can't tell you what you want to know.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available We've been compromised! Someone used a stolen key card to access CTU less than an hour ago.
not_available Freeze! Drop the gun! Bill, it's Jack.
not_available I think he tried to deploy nerve gas throughout the building.
not_available Code six, everybody out! Go, go! Seal all the rooms.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Oh my God! Chloe.
not_available Attention all CTU personnel.
not_available This facility has been contaminated with Sentox VX1 nerve gas.
not_available I repeat: this facility has been contaminated.
not_available There are two safe zones on the main floor
not_available the Situation Room and Medical.
not_available On the second floor, the safe zones are Mr.
not_available Buchanan's office and Holding Room Four.
not_available These areas will remain sealed, pending the arrival of the Chemical Response Team.
not_available If you are in any of these sealed areas, do not attempt to leave until the CRT clears the environment.
not_available I'm on my way, but it could take 20 to 30 minutes to gather all the CRT personnel you'll need.
not_available I understand, Curtis, but we need CRT here now! This is a high priority.
not_available Get here as fast as you can.
not_available All right, copy
not_available I'll call you in a few minutes with updates.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available I just talked to Curtis.
not_available He's with the Chemical Response Team.
not_available They won't be able to get here for at least 30 minutes.
not_available Why not? Most of their units were sent to Tyler Memorial.
not_available The rest are en route to high probability targets.
not_available Okay, we're going to keep working here.
not_available Our networks are still up, right? Yeah, the phones are working, the computers are up.
not_available I can coordinate with Division from here.
not_available What do you need where you are? I need to know if Henderson is still alive.
not_available Where is he? Agent Burke was transferring him over to the Isolation Clinic in Medical.
not_available I don't know if they made it before the barriers went down.
not_available You can tell if you pull up a building grid.
not_available What about CTU's chemical response plan? Gas masks are in the armory, atropine is in medical storage.
not_available Both areas are contaminated.
not_available We can't get to them without being exposed to the gaz.
not_available Bill, I'm gonna have to get right back to you.
not_available Chloe, I know how difficult this is for you right now.
not_available But there's nothing we can do for him.
not_available I need you to come back to work.
not_available As least tell me how to pull up a building grid, I'll do it myself.
not_available Jack, we can try to pull it up.
not_available Get started.
not_available Chloe, CTU isn't mobile right now.
not_available Everything is going to go through comm.
not_available That's you.
not_available I need you back at work.
not_available Can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available No, I can't! 
not_available Yes, you can! Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available What? I can help her.
not_available I'm a clinical psychologist.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Chloe, my name is Dr.
not_available Landes.
not_available Now, he was a friend of yoursÂ— what was his name? Edgar.
not_available Edgar.
not_available I'd like you to turn away from Edgar and focus on me, please.
not_available Chloe, you're in shock, and I'd like to help you through it.
not_available The only thing I'm going to ask you to do is sit in this chair and collect your breath.
not_available Let's do that now.
not_available Just collect your breath, just for a second.
not_available He was such a good guy.
not_available I just treated him like crap all day.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available Sir? Someone stole my key card and used it to get into the building.
not_available It was missing, and I didn't say anything.
not_available Why not? I thought they just stole my wallet for the money.
not_available How could you not report it? I was embarrassed.
not_available I didn't want anyone to know I got beat up.
not_available So we're all going to die, because you were embarrassed? Mr.
not_available Almeida, what are you doing? I want to know what's going on.
not_available No, I can't allow that.
not_available I'm not sitting in this damn bed while CTU is under attack
not_available got it? Fine.
not_available How long are we supposed to be sectioned off like this? I haven't received any news.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Jack, we've got the building grid.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Bill, it's Jack
not_available the grid's up.
not_available All right, check the isolation zones that have logged in.
not_available You'll have survivors.
not_available Two zones have logged on in Medical.
not_available Try them.
not_available I'm going to keep this line open.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Clinic.
not_available Dr.
not_available Besson, it's Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack, what's going on? One of the terrorists infiltrated CTU and deployed a canister of Sentox nerve gas through the ventilation system.
not_available That's why we needed to seal off as many rooms as possible.
not_available I need to know if Agent Burke got to Medical with Henderson.
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available Henderson's here right now? Tony, is that you? Jack, how much longer are we going to be locked down? Right now, we're in standby
not_available we're trying to figure out how to clean out the air supply.
not_available Dr.
not_available Besson? Dr.
not_available Besson? Tony! Get me a security feed over at Medical.
not_available Jack, I don't think this program is set up for that.
not_available Try a redirect.
not_available All right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Besson! What are you doing? 
not_available Move aside.
not_available My God, he's got a gun.
not_available Patch me through to their intercom.
not_available Do it.
not_available We'll be able to hear them, but they can't hear us yet.
not_available You can't kill him.
not_available He's got information we need.
not_available He killed my wife! Tony, please, don't kill him.
not_available Move aside, Rick! I don't want to shoot you, but I will.
not_available Move it! Henderson! You remember me? My name is Tony Almeida.
not_available You killed my wife, Michelle Dessler, this morning.
not_available He's going to kill him
not_available hurry! Hurry! She was my life, and you took her.
not_available And now, I'm going to take yours.
not_available I got it.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available I've got you on the security feed.
not_available Stay out of this, Jack! 
not_available Tony, please, just listen to me.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available I know how you feel right now.
not_available I lost Terry the exact same way, to one of our own.
not_available I know what it feels to be betrayed like this.
not_available But, Henderson has information that can save thousands and thousands of lives.
not_available And I know that doesn't make you feel better right now, but I know you, Tony.
not_available I know you don't want to make this situation any worse than it is.
not_available Please? Please, just let us finish our interrogation.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Agent Burke, please continue.
not_available When Henderson starts talking, focus on how to find the Sentox canisters and how we can find Bierko.
not_available Tell me where to find Bierko.
not_available Where? Nowhere.
not_available What is your computer password? No.
not_available I know no password.
not_available Agent Burke, can we increase the dose? Not without killing him.
not_available Okay, take a short break and then start again.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you've got anything.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How could CTU have been hit? We're not sure, Mr.
not_available Vice President.
not_available Are you telling me they didn't have any safeguards in place? They had partial containment, but our early reports indicate that 40% of their personnel have been taken out.
not_available You mean they've been killed? 
not_available We're afraid so, sir.
not_available CTU is protecting this city.
not_available Are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that? I'm saying they've been seriously compromised, yes.
not_available So what are we going to do, Ms.
not_available Hayes? We've got terrorists with nerve gas canisters out there.
not_available Who is going to stop them? Mr.
not_available President, I suggest an emergency restructuring.
not_available Meaning what? Meaning that the Chemical Response Team will go in neutralize the nerve gas at CTU and I will take a team in there and personally manage the operation.
not_available How soon can you do that? 
not_available Within the hour.
not_available Fine.
not_available Do it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right, they're still somewhat operational.
not_available It's not a complete disaster.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it is.
not_available I can see no other option right now but to impose martial law on the city of Los Angeles.
not_available Hal, my advisors believe if the military takes over the streets and starts detaining people, it could create mayhem.
not_available Sir, it's only a matter of time before more canisters are released in public places and then you will have mayhem.
not_available Except without the soldiers you'll need to contain it.
not_available So what do I tell the public? That we've got nerve gas canisters all over the city, but we don't know where they are?! No, no, you don't have to get into that.
not_available Tie it to that earlier incident at the airport.
not_available I'm going to get resistance from all sides.
not_available That's true, sir.
not_available We may have to swallow some saltwater, but wouldn't it be worth it, if we can keep the people off the streets, safe from another public attack? 
not_available I don't know, Hal.
not_available Sir, consider this
not_available if we clear the streets of everybody except the military, these terrorists won't be able to move as freely as they are right now.
not_available We have to do whatever we can to stop the people behind this.
not_available CTU is no longer an obstacle.
not_available At least for the time being.
not_available Good.
not_available Have our men move from their current positions and go to the new target.
not_available How much of the nerve gas will they release there? All of it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Chloe, are you ready to go back to work? What do you need? 
not_available I need you.
not_available We can't break Henderson.
not_available I need you to keep trying to decrypt the files that we took from his computer.
not_available I already tried that.
not_available It didn't work.
not_available Maybe somebody else could do it.
not_available Chloe, you're the only person in the room qualified.
not_available Chloe, please.
not_available Don't shut down on me now.
not_available I'm upset about everything that's happening too, but you know how things work around here.
not_available We do not quit until it's over.
not_available You're not helping her.
not_available You're just making things worse.
not_available I am sure that you are qualified to help someone through this kind of distress over an extended period of time, but you see, we do not have an extended period of time.
not_available So if you don't mind stepping aside so I can do my job, I would appreciate it.
not_available Believe it or not, Jack, you don't have to be qualified to help people.
not_available You just have to be there for them.
not_available Like you were there for my daughter.
not_available What does that mean? You're 20 years older than she is.
not_available I know exactly what you're doing.
not_available I've done nothing but try and help her deal with her loss.
not_available How dare you accuse me of taking advantage of her.
not_available You did 
not_available Dad, stop! You can be angry at me all you want, but before I met Barry, I didn't want to live.
not_available Do you understand that? Fine, I'll get back to work if everyone could just relax.
not_available Jack, we have a problem.
not_available What? Chloe, I just saw the alarm.
not_available What's going on? The seal pressure indicators in the contaminated zones are showing traces of sublimated polymer near the partition seal.
not_available What does that mean? It means that the nerve gas must be mixed with a corrosive agent
not_available an acid.
not_available The acid's breaking down the seal between the rooms.
not_available How long till the seal fails completely? It's hard to say for sure.
not_available Can you give me an estimate? It's deteriorating quickly.
not_available I'd say 15 minutes, 20 at the most.
not_available And then what? As soon as the gas permeates the seal, it enters the room.
not_available Then it's over.
not_available Get me schematics on all the isolated zones.
not_available Mr.
not_available Vice President, with all due respect, I'm not trying to usurp your position.
not_available I'm simply trying to serve the president the best way I can.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What was that about? I was trying to convince Gardner to let me help him draft the president's statement.
not_available Charles is letting Hal write his statement?! He's insisted.
not_available And the president gave him the go
not_available ahead.
not_available But that means Gardner is effectively making policy.
not_available We've got to stop him.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available But you know what kind of pressure the president's under today.
not_available He wants all the counsel he can get.
not_available And Hal's only too eager to help out.
not_available Of course he's too eager.
not_available He's got his eye on the Oval Office.
not_available Anything he can do to speed up Charles' downfall puts him one step closer to the presidency.
not_available Martha, you have to intervene.
not_available Hal feeds the president ideas.
not_available We saw it at the WTO, we saw it in Chicago.
not_available When they work, Hal takes the credit for them.
not_available When they don't, the president takes the hits.
not_available Have you reminded Charles of that? I can't.
not_available Hal's the vice president.
not_available I'm just the chief of staff.
not_available You have influence that super cedes any constitutional rank.
not_available And now's the time to use it.
not_available I want to see the statement as soon as it's issued.
not_available You will.
not_available I just checked the readings from all uncontaminated zones.
not_available The testing you've been doing in your respective areas is consistent.
not_available The Sentox nerve gas that was released into the air duct system contains a corrosive agent that is eating away at the barrier seals protecting the safe zones.
not_available I'm not going to pull any punches.
not_available CRT will not be here to help us.
not_available At this point, our only hope is to help ourselves.
not_available We need to find a way to either neutralize or flush the Sentox out of the contaminated areas before the barrier seals fail and the gas enters the safe zones.
not_available I want all personnel working on this problem.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available Do what you can.
not_available We'll hope for the best.
not_available Maybe we can do something from in here.
not_available Access the ventilation system? 
not_available Even if I could, it doesn't mean we could do anything to stop the seals from breaking down.
not_available Just try.
not_available Maybe it's not as bad as we think.
not_available Maybe the numbers are off.
not_available They're not.
not_available Even if the seals leak, CRT could get here in time.
not_available The only reason she's here is because I asked her to stay.
not_available If something happens to her, it's going to be because of me.
not_available Because of what I did.
not_available There was no way that you could know that CTU was vulnerable.
not_available Jack.
not_available You've got something? I think if I can slow the seals from breaking down I can flush the contaminated areas using the air conditioning.
not_available Do it.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available the control isn't responding.
not_available Why not? It's being blocked by some program that I can't get to remotely.
not_available It's probably on a computer near Holding Four.
not_available Can you get me in there? This is a false wall.
not_available the air in there is not contaminated.
not_available Can he get to the computer through there? Yes, but once he makes it through the safe zone, he'll be in a contaminated area.
not_available What are you talking about? He can't go through a contaminated area.
not_available I can hold my breath.
not_available The Sentox won't be absorbed by my skin over that short a period of time.
not_available As long as I don't inhale it, I'll be fine.
not_available Jack, you can't hold your breath that long.
not_available I only have to hold my breath long enough to get to the computer, disconnect the program and get back to the ventilated room.
not_available Once I'm back in the safe room, how long will it take you to clear out the Sentox? About 20 seconds based on the cubic footage.
not_available Jack, even if you get to the computer, what if we can't ventilate that room? Chloe thinks we can.
not_available Right now, this is our only option.
not_available CRT is not going to get here in time.
not_available The seals are now 80% gone.
not_available What's the bottom line? 
not_available We have less than 20 minutes.
not_available All right, Jack, Chloe and I are on channel one.
not_available If you need to communicate with anyone else we'll patch you through.
not_available As soon as I go through, you have to replace this behind me.
not_available Jack, it's time.
not_available Go now.
not_available Now.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available I just completed the airlock.
not_available I'm getting ready to move into the ventilation room.
not_available I'll tap my com unit three times when I'm back in the safe room.
not_available All right.
not_available Jack, I don't have to remind you if that airlock leaks, we'll all be dead within the next three minutes.
not_available It's not going to leak, Chloe.
not_available Okay I'm going in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Seal corrosion is now at 86 percent.
not_available Is there anything we can do from here? No, we just have to wait.
not_available There's nothing we can do to get your dad out any faster.
not_available Don't talk down to me, Chloe.
not_available Listen, we're in a crisis situation here, okay? Tempers are bound to flare.
not_available Let's just everybody breathe.
not_available What's with you and the breathing? Is that your solution to everything? It's Jack, he's back in the room.
not_available It's too soon, he couldn't have found the program and disabled it yet.
not_available He's got 15 more seconds before the room clears.
not_available What's it mean that he finished so quickly? I don't know.
not_available Well, it could be a good thing, right? It could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing.
not_available That's what "I don't know" means.
not_available All right, Jack, the room is clear, you can breathe.
not_available Are you okay? I couldn't get to it.
not_available Chloe, you're right.
not_available I saw it.
not_available There's a computer program running on the AC control unit, but there's a security grate in the wall behind the vent.
not_available I don't see it on my system.
not_available Trust me, it's there.
not_available I just found it.
not_available It was a security upgrade in the last two years.
not_available Somebody didn't file it properly, that's why I didn't see it.
not_available Are there any other vents that could help us get into that wall? No, they've all been upgraded.
not_available Well, it's a room, there's got to be a door.
not_available Where does it lead? To a corridor above Holding Four.
not_available None of us can get there from where we're at.
not_available Who's in holding room four? 
not_available Lynn McGill.
not_available Are there any other vented rooms we can get him to? No, Jack, there's nothing.
not_available Patch me through to him.
not_available McGill here.
not_available Lynn, it's Jack.
not_available We found a computer interrupt in the AC control unit.
not_available Now if we can shut that down in the next few minutes, we can stop the gas from permeating the safe zones.
not_available Well, that's good news.
not_available The problem is you're the only person close enough to get to it.
not_available Chloe? It's directly above the holding room where you are now.
not_available Take the stairs, go to the left around the corner.
not_available It's the room on your left.
not_available Okay How are we going to do this, Jack? Lynn, the truth is if I can get there, I would do this myself, but I'm not close enough.
not_available No one who's still alive in CTU is.
not_available You're the only person who can do this.
not_available And I'm going to have to ask you to do it without any protection.
not_available I see.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available As soon as you open the door to the hallway, your room will become contaminated.
not_available You can hold your breath long enough to fix the problem, but we have nowhere else to send you.
not_available We can't airlock you.
not_available There are two of us in here, Jack.
not_available Sir, this is Harry Swinton.
not_available So you're saying that if he does this, then we're both going to die? I'm so sorry.
not_available We don't have a choice, Harry.
not_available How do we know that you're not just making this story up so you don't have to make the sacrifice yourself? You don't.
not_available All I can ask you to do is believe me.
not_available I'm telling you the truth.
not_available Well, that's easy for you to say, sir.
not_available You're not the one who's about to die.
not_available It's not easy for me to say.
not_available Hold on.
not_available We have to do this, Harry.
not_available We're going to die anyway.
not_available If we don't, so will everyone in CTU.
not_available We have to do this.
not_available Okay, Jack, go ahead.
not_available Once you enter the ventilation room, the computer will be on your right.
not_available There's a program running on the computer.
not_available You need to quit out of it, I'll take it from there.
not_available Lynn, we don't have a lot of time.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Chloe I'm sorry about how I acted earlier and about your friend that died.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I've been wanting to ask you something.
not_available Did you have contact with my dad while he was gone? I sent him information about once a month.
not_available What kind of information? 
not_available A lot of different things.
not_available About me? Actually, almost all of it was about you.
not_available Your breakup with Chase, your depression What? How did you get? I'm really good at getting information.
not_available I don't judge it, I just pass it on.
not_available I'm sorry about you and Chase.
not_available It must've been really painful.
not_available Yeah, it was.
not_available So you talked to him, too? Chase? No.
not_available You know where he is? No, but I could find out, if you want.
not_available No, no, it's all right.
not_available Barry thinks I should let that go.
not_available He's probably right.
not_available Yeah, well, shrinks are always giving advice that they probably don't follow themselves.
not_available How are you doing? This morning I woke up with a guy in my bed that I'll probably never see again.
not_available And I just watched one of my best friends die right in front of me, so I guess not that great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Replace the panel.
not_available Pull up the security feed for the observation room.
not_available You be a good girl for Mommy, okay? She tells you have to go to bed, you have to go to bed.
not_available When you coming home? I don't know, honey.
not_available If I fall asleep, will you wake me up? Of course I will.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm going in now, Harry.
not_available I love you.
not_available Love you, too, Dad.
not_available Bye, baby girl.
not_available Chloe, we're ready.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available Okay, good luck.
not_available And thanks for doing this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He did it.
not_available Is the AC responding? Yes.
not_available I'm starting the fans now.
not_available How long before the Sentox is neutralized? At least 15 minutes, but the concentration should go down enough to stop eating away at the seals immediately.
not_available Polymer count is down It looks like the seals will hold until all zones are clear.
not_available Lynn, Harry, I don't know if you can still hear me, but I want you to know what you did was successful.
not_available The seals are holding.
not_available I will personally notify your families and tell them of the sacrifice you made.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I don't know what else to say.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm okay I'm okay.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Pull up the security feed to Medical.
not_available Can you hear me? What's your name? No No name.
not_available You're wasting your time.
not_available Agent Burke, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available What have you got from Henderson? Nothing.
not_available He's still not talking.
not_available Okay, keep working on him.
not_available As soon as the barriers go up, I'll get back to you.
not_available Chloe, I don't think we're going to break Henderson now.
not_available All the information that we're going to get is from his computer.
not_available I need you to keep working on those files.
not_available Most of my team is gone.
not_available How am I going to do that? Only work on his files.
not_available Kim, as soon as the barriers go up, I want you go over to Medical and let them check you out.
not_available No, Dad, when the barriers go up, I'm leaving.
not_available Kim, please, just do this for me.
not_available We still need to talk.
not_available There's nothing to talk about.
not_available Don't be in such a hurry to cut me off.
not_available You cut me off.
not_available Listen to me, I'm not angry.
not_available I love you.
not_available But there's nothing left to say except I don't want to be around you.
not_available Every time I am, something horrible happens.
not_available People die, and I know that's not your fault, but I can't be a part of it.
not_available I don't want you to be a part of that.
not_available All I want is for one day you and I just to be able to spend time together.
not_available Kim, I had to give you up once, I'm not going to let that happen again.
not_available Dad I can't.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available God, that was close.
not_available I know.
not_available Are you all right? No.
not_available An emergency peacekeeping force.
not_available It was Hal's suggestion.
not_available I think it works.
not_available Charles, aren't you afraid that an edict of this kind could do far more damage than any chemical weapon ever could? Martha, CTU has been attacked.
not_available Our first line of defense is shut down and people were killed because of this chemical weapon.
not_available And that's just a prelude to what's going to happen in this city.
not_available More nerve gas will be released, I can guarantee it.
not_available Look, if you or Mike
not_available you have any better ideas please, I would be glad to hear them.
not_available Could you leave us? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available What is it, Martha? If you, Charles Logan, really feel that martial law is your only option, I will support you.
not_available But what I will not do is stand by and watch Hal Gardner use you to promote his own agenda.
not_available Please, Martha, give me some credit.
not_available He has done it before.
not_available He is not the president.
not_available You are.
not_available I am doing this because it's the right thing to do! I don't know how much more of this I can take.
not_available I really don't.
not_available David's assassination, the nerve gas, the murder of those hostages, Walt Cummings' betrayal, and you I almost lost you.
not_available I didn't lose you, did I? No, Charles.
not_available You didn't lose me.
not_available I'm still here.
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available The men are there.
not_available they need the schematics.
not_available Who is it? Just a client.
not_available Yes.
not_available Have you got it yet? I told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything.
not_available I'm still waiting on a few items.
not_available I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette.
not_available And if you could have gotten the detailed specs of a facility this secure from someone else, you would have.
not_available But you didn't.
not_available You called me and I'll have it for you in a few minutes.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Difficult client.
not_available I wish I knew exactly what it is you did.
not_available I might be able to help.
not_available You do help me.
not_available Oh, I can't.
not_available I have to go and finish something.
not_available Finish this.
not_available How long till the air will be safe to breathe? 
not_available Momentarily, sir.
not_available All right, thank you very much.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, this is Karen Hayes from Homeland Security.
not_available Karen.
not_available I'm running a damage assessment and I need your body count.
not_available We don't have a body count yet.
not_available We'll know more when CRT gets here and the barriers lift.
not_available What's your best estimate? I'm guessing we'll need at least 20 in Comm.
not_available and other departments.
not_available All right, well, I'm on my way over there with a core team.
not_available We can make adjustments when I get there.
not_available You coming here now? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I see.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available How's your progress? 
not_available Good.
not_available I've already reformatted their main servers to our specs.
not_available All their tactical protocols will have to go through me.
not_available Good.
not_available I may have to replace some of their personnel with my people.
not_available Do you have a problem with that? Absolutely not.
not_available After what these people have been through, most of them won't be up to full capacity.
not_available We need to identify these people quickly and send them home.
not_available What about chain of command? Am I going to need approval from Bill Buchanan if I want to make a personnel change? No, Bill won't be in charge when we get there, I will.
not_available For all intents and purposes, CTU is no longer an operational entity.
not_available It's a building with workers who will report to us.
not_available We're clear.
not_available I'm going back to Medical.
not_available All right.
not_available Kim, I have to finish this now.
not_available I know.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Dad.
not_available Good
not_available bye.
not_available Excuse me, Jack.
not_available I just wanted to say thank you for saving our lives.
not_available We definitely couldn't have gotten through this without you.
not_available Take her outside of the city.
not_available Don't make any stops.
not_available You understand? Looks like he's dead.
not_available No.
not_available His nervous system is shut down.
not_available Well, can you wake him up? 
not_available No.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Yeah, Jack, Henderson's in a coma.
not_available He's not coming out of it.
not_available You've had your chance.
not_available He's mine now.
not_available Damn it, Tony, just wait until I get there! No, I'm done waiting.
not_available You don't want to do this.
not_available It's not going to bring back Michelle.
not_available No, but I'll feel better.
not_available Trust me, it won't.
not_available You're probably right.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Tony! Tony?! What'd Jack say? He's on his way here.
not_available We'll figure out what to do when he gets here.
not_available There's nothing to figure out.
not_available This guy's cooked.
not_available Tony! Tony! I couldn't do it.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Come on.
not_available You stay with me.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available I need help! Somebody help! No, no no, hang on.
not_available Hang on! She's gone, Jack.
