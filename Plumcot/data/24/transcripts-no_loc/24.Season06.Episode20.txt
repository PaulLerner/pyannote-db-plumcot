
not_available We're going to 
not_available Get Medical right away! Wayne Palmer won't be able to continue his duties as Commander in Chief.
not_available I have the fate of the West, the lives of millions hanging in the balance and I can't stop thinking about you.
not_available Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody and he let him go.
not_available Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland.
not_available Someone will have to go down.
not_available The farther from the president, the better.
not_available Are you asking me to resign? 
not_available No, Bill.
not_available I have to fire you.
not_available Work with Milo, get cosy.
not_available Don't be such ajealous jerk.
not_available The day I'm jealous is the day I kill myself.
not_available Anything else? How about, "Don't arm nuclear bombs for terrorists"? Sorry.
not_available That's not how I feel.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Itjust slipped out my mouth.
not_available Morris! 
not_available You shouldn't have trouble running CTU.
not_available I'm not the right choice to take over.
not_available You are the right choice.
not_available Nothing will change operationally.
not_available Your objective remains the same.
not_available Bring in Jack Bauer before he can hand over the component to the Chinese.
not_available Mr Bauer.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Audrey walks out of here alone.
not_available As soon as I see she gets down near the bridge, I'll give you the component.
not_available This is going down now, Nadia.
not_available Jack is about to hand it over.
not_available Mike, don't let that happen.
not_available Cheng and his men escaped.
not_available They're in three Hummers heading north.
not_available Agent Bauer, get down! Weapon is down! On the ground now! 
not_available Who is your commanding officer? I am, Jack.
not_available I gotta take you into custody.
not_available Where's the board? Cheng's got it.
not_available I was set to destroy the component till you engaged us in a firefight.
not_available I had this handled.
not_available Audrey, it's over.
not_available You're safe.
not_available Help me.
not_available Don't let them do this to me.
not_available Audrey! They've done something to her.
not_available You gotta help her.
not_available Please.
not_available My God.
not_available Was this the only C4 in the building? Yes, that's everything.
not_available The building's clean.
not_available Miss Raines, my name is Mike Doyle.
not_available I'm a CTU field agent.
not_available Did you see or hear something while Cheng held you, something to lead us to him? You're safe now, Miss Raines.
not_available Jack bought your freedom with a component that contains highly sensitive Russian technology.
not_available Can you understand me, Miss Raines? Help me, Jack.
not_available Please don't let them do this to me.
not_available I want CHP to work with Military on roadblocks.
not_available You need to set up threeto five
not_available mile perimeters from Cheng's last location.
not_available I need satellite scans forwarded to me.
not_available We're at full capacity.
not_available We 
not_available I understand, but those are your orders.
not_available You wanted to see me? 
not_available I read your request for transfer out of Comm.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Is this because you and Chloe had a fight? Your facts are essentially correct, but the why I don't see as being anybody's business.
not_available You've had a hard day we all have 
not_available but I really need you on the floor.
not_available I'm sorry, request for transfer is denied.
not_available I'm trying to protect you from being caught in the middle of an awkward professional situation.
not_available You're asking me to indulge your melodrama in the middle of an international crisis.
not_available Bill said he'd consider my request.
not_available Bill Buchanan is not running CTU, I am.
not_available I've made my decision.
not_available Nadia 
not_available Keep your personal life to yourself.
not_available You can deal with this tomorrow.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Anything else you wanna say? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Nadia Yassir.
not_available It's Mike.
not_available Do you have a lead on Cheng? 
not_available We're on it.
not_available How'd it go with Raines? 
not_available Not good.
not_available She doesn't know anything about Cheng, where he held her? She's completely non
not_available responsive.
not_available Whatever they did to her in China, it left her with a post
not_available traumatic reaction.
not_available District will want a specialist to look at her.
not_available Any idea what Jack was thinking? 
not_available He had the motel rigged with C4.
not_available He was gonna take this whole place down.
not_available He was willing to sacrifice his life.
not_available His plan would've worked had I not intervened.
not_available You saved his life.
not_available But I lost the component.
not_available Jack went against a direct order from the White House.
not_available This was no one's fault but his.
not_available We're on our way back.
not_available Stephenson, you take Miss Raines.
not_available I'll go with Bauer.
not_available Audrey! Audrey! Audrey! 
not_available Jack, stop.
not_available Where are you taking her? 
not_available CTU, same as you.
not_available Let me talk to her for a few minutes.
not_available You saw what condition she's in, Jack.
not_available I know her.
not_available I know what she's been through.
not_available I might be the only person that can get through to her.
not_available Please.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available We'll discuss this at CTU.
not_available Put him in the second chopper.
not_available Mike, let me talk to her now! CTU is pouring its resources into finding Cheng.
not_available This order gives them authority to close ports and border crossings.
not_available If we can't stop migrant workers crossing borders, how can we stop an enemy agent? I think the point is to slow him down, sir, so CTU has more time to find him.
not_available But I agree Cheng will find a way to smuggle out the Russian component eventually.
not_available So then Russia loses its defensive edge against the Chinese and Moscow blames us.
not_available We will do everything in our power to prevent that, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Karen.
not_available Yes? Tom told me about you and Bill, how you had to fire him from CTU.
not_available How'd he take it? Not well.
not_available Karen.
not_available Yes.
not_available You and I have had our difficulties in the past, but I want you to know that I value your role here, and that I appreciate your sacrifice.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available What is it? The Russian president's calling for you.
not_available He's insisting on a faceto
not_available face.
not_available Did he say what he wants? 
not_available No, but he's on with the heads of military.
not_available I want you both with me on this.
not_available Palmer's in a coma.
not_available It looks like Noah's gonna be acting president for some time.
not_available Good for Noah and good for us.
not_available The only thing he cares about is pushing his foreign agenda.
not_available Any pending legislation on spending he'll defer to me.
not_available Now he is acting president, we must be more careful.
not_available We will be.
not_available I got half an hour.
not_available Let's stop talking.
not_available President Suvarov, you're on a secure conference with Vice President Daniels.
not_available President Suvarov.
not_available Mr Vice President.
not_available You know Tom Lennox and Karen Hayes, my national security advisor.
not_available How can we help you? Some troubling news has been brought to my attention.
not_available What would that be? The nuclear weapons that fell into terrorist hands contained Russian technology that, up until now, has only been available to your government and mine.
not_available I'm well aware of that, sir.
not_available Then you are also well aware that an FBsub
not_available circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government.
not_available Do you deny that, sir? Mr President, all I'm prepared to tell you is that we're in control of the situation.
not_available Mr Vice President, my generals have confirmed that this component contains information that will compromise our defensive capabilities.
not_available You must stop the Chinese from leaving your country with it.
not_available I don't appreciate being dictated to, Mr President.
not_available It was a Russian general who allowed those bombs to enter the US in the first place, the same Russian general who conspired to detonate them.
not_available That does not change our grave concerns about this development.
not_available If you do not intercept this component, my generals have instructions to initiate an appropriate response.
not_available Mr President 
not_available Good night, sir.
not_available How did the Russians find out? 
not_available Russian intelligence must've tracked it.
not_available No.
not_available The information circle is too tight.
not_available Only select people at the White House and CTU even knew about this.
not_available You're saying there's a spy? 
not_available There is no other explanation.
not_available I will start an internal investigation into White House staff.
not_available I'll do the same at CTU, sir.
not_available What are your reads on Suvarov? How seriously do we take his threat? Very.
not_available With the Chinese in possession of the component, the Russians will need to extend their defensive line in central Asia.
not_available We have a military base in the region.
not_available Which the Russians must target.
not_available We will have to respond in kind 
not_available Which will escalate things.
not_available Give CTU whatever they need to find this man Cheng.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I've interfaced the component.
not_available You should have the schematics.
not_available Yes, they've downloaded.
not_available I'm running a diagnostic on the component now.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll be there in less than an hour.
not_available Wait.
not_available There's a problem.
not_available What? 
not_available The circuit board is damaged.
not_available Can you fix it? 
not_available No, not unless I have the security override.
not_available We don't have access to that information.
not_available Without it, this technology is useless to us.
not_available You have to find someone with the necessary expertise.
not_available I'm gonna take a quick shower.
not_available Noah's waiting for me to get back.
not_available Yes? 
not_available We're all set.
not_available The girl doesn't know you're working for us? 
not_available Not a clue.
not_available Good.
not_available Morris.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I saw you arguing with Nadia.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Was that about us? I asked for a transfer.
not_available It was denied.
not_available Why'd you do that? Because working with you is becoming very uncomfortable.
not_available I told you I was sorry.
not_available You said I should stop helping terrorists arm nuclear bombs.
not_available We've both said things that we haven't meant before.
not_available Yeah, I know, but there's a line, darling, and and you crossed it.
not_available So what are you saying? I'm saying that it's over.
not_available There's no going back.
not_available We're done.
not_available Morris, look at me.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Shh.
not_available We're done.
not_available Morris The situation has escalated with the Russians.
not_available They know the Chinese have the component and threaten action, unless we stop them taking it out of the country.
not_available How did the Russians find out? 
not_available A leak.
not_available Lennox is looking into it here, and he wants you to start an investigation.
not_available I'll let Internal Affairs know.
not_available What about Raines? Has she provided any information? Not yet, but the psychiatric specialist has just arrived, so we hope he can get her to talk.
not_available Do you have any other leads? 
not_available Not at the moment.
not_available That's unfortunate.
not_available I cannot emphasise enough how important it is we stop Cheng.
not_available If you need more resources, you need to let me know now.
not_available Do you understand? I will.
not_available One more thing To be honest, Karen, what we need is Bill Buchanan.
not_available There's a rumour flying around you fired him.
not_available That's complicated, Nadia.
not_available Not as far as we're concerned.
not_available You know more than anyone how good he is at this job.
not_available I don't see how this could happen in the middle of a crisis.
not_available Look, I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
not_available Just keep me updated with your progress in finding Cheng.
not_available Doctor Bradley, I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU.
not_available We're under a time crunch.
not_available I'd like to get started at once.
not_available She's being prepped.
not_available These men can take you.
not_available I'll join you shortly.
not_available I wanna hear your first impressions.
not_available Of course.
not_available Nadia, Doyle and Jackjust landed.
not_available OK.
not_available Have Doyle secure Bauer and then have him meet me in Medical.
not_available OK.
not_available Can you leave us alone, please? Thank you.
not_available Miss Raines? Miss Raines, I'm Doctor Bradley.
not_available I'm here to perform an evaluation to help you remember whatever you can about Cheng.
not_available Where you were held, what you heard It's all right.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Come here.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Please, you've gotta let me talk to her.
not_available You know CTU's protocol.
not_available You know how they'll interrogate her.
not_available They'll make her retreat inside herself.
not_available Please listen to me! Sit down.
not_available This will make you more comfortable.
not_available Mike.
not_available Please, I'm begging you.
not_available Take care of her.
not_available Are you all right? Come here.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Jack's in holding three.
not_available How you doing? White House is pressuring us to find Cheng.
not_available We have to hope we can get some information out of her.
not_available This is Agent Doyle.
not_available He was involved in rescuing Miss Raines.
not_available Do you have a diagnosis? She's a type
not_available three catatonic capable of following commands, repeating words, but otherwise unresponsive.
not_available Will you be able to get the information? 
not_available Not without intervention.
not_available What does that mean? She is suffering from psychological abuse amplified by pharmacological agents, as evidenced by over 100 injections in her arms, feet and groin.
not_available It'll be impossible to communicate in the near term unless we shock her out of this state.
not_available They used drugs, and you'll give her more? These are compounds used for different reasons.
not_available What are the risks? 
not_available 22% of patients have cardiovascular events, some of it neurological.
not_available In extreme cases, death occurs.
not_available We can't do this.
not_available Doyle.
not_available I am not comfortable with the high percentage either, but this is the only way you're gonna get anything out of her.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available One of our agents has a history with her.
not_available The Chinese put him through something similar.
not_available See what Jack can draw from her before we do anything riskier.
not_available Doctor? 
not_available Yeah, I know who Jack Bauer is.
not_available I've read Miss Raines' file on the way over.
not_available Contact with him will upset her.
not_available But there's no chance of her dying from it.
not_available Let's give Jack a chance with her.
not_available It's not your call, Miss Yassir.
not_available District has placed Miss Raines in my custody and granted me authority.
not_available I'll begin preparing for treatment shortly.
not_available I'll let you know the results.
not_available Good day.
not_available You can't let him do this 
not_available He has jurisdiction.
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available You can do what you know is right.
not_available That's what Buchanan would have done.
not_available And that was uncalled for.
not_available Well, I'm sorry.
not_available What I meant to say is, since you're acting director, you can't be afraid to step on toes.
not_available Does that go down better? Part of being acting director is respecting the chain of command.
not_available But thank you for your advice.
not_available It's him.
not_available Hi.
not_available Where are you? I'm on my way out the door.
not_available Well, get here as quickly as you can.
not_available There's a crisis.
not_available Has there been another threat? 
not_available Yes, but not from terrorists.
not_available I'll fill you in.
not_available I'll be there in less than 15.
not_available Lisa I need you.
not_available I need you too.
not_available I have to go.
not_available What's going on? I don't know.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's me.
not_available What's my next move? 
not_available I think I've identified the leak, sir.
not_available Is it here or at CTU? It's very much here, sir.
not_available I had NSA run a data sort on all White House phone calls and emails over the last two and a half hours.
not_available That's when we found out the sub
not_available circuit board was in play.
not_available And? 
not_available During the same time frame, one of our staffers called a lobbyist, Mark Bishop, three times.
not_available CIA had flagged this Bishop two years ago as having possibleto
not_available likely contact with Russian intelligence agents.
not_available No further investigation was done due to lack of resources.
not_available Which staffer are we talking about here, Tom? Lisa Miller, sir.
not_available I find it hard to believe she is working for the Russians.
not_available I don't think she did so knowingly, or she wouldn't have called Bishop from her phone.
not_available Then I I don't understand.
not_available How's this man getting information from her? Well, so far, we have found credit
not_available card records that show Miss Miller and Bishop staying at the same hotels on the same nights several times over the past year.
not_available Now, I think if we dig a little deeper I'm sure that we will find more evidence that shows these two are sleeping together.
not_available Then we have a bigger problem than you think.
not_available Why's that, sir? Because I'm sleeping with her too.
not_available She she started working for me two years after my wife after Nancy died.
not_available I didn't think I'd feel anything for another woman again but Lisa and I became close, and then last year we were working late one night and You understand how these things happen, Tom.
not_available Dammit, what a fool I've been.
not_available What the hell do I do, Tom? You know, actually, sir handled correctly, we may be able to turn this situation to our advantage.
not_available Mike, what's happening out there? Will they let me speak to Audrey? 
not_available I tried, but they're not going for it.
not_available Why not? 
not_available The shrink doesn't think it's a good idea.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available I wish this guy was interested in what other people had to say, but he isn't.
not_available Why? He's got her in Medical.
not_available He's about to try protocol of his own using big doses of drugs.
not_available It could kill her, Jack.
not_available Why did you uncuff me? Cos I think you need to do something about it.
not_available Make it look good.
not_available Easy.
not_available Vitals are strong.
not_available She's ready.
not_available Get her IV started.
not_available Excuse me, sir, you can't be in here.
not_available Have you started? 
not_available No.
not_available What have you done to her?! 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Consider yourself lucky.
not_available You're Bauer.
not_available I recognise you from her file.
not_available Seeing you will only make things worse.
not_available Shut up! Audrey, I need you to come with me.
not_available I need you to come with me now.
not_available Please, come on.
not_available Just get me anything you can.
not_available Milo, what's the location of that alarm? 
not_available Room six where Audrey's being treated.
not_available Bring up the video feed.
not_available She's gone.
not_available Lock everything down.
not_available Get me holding room three.
not_available If you'd just let Jack talk to Audrey, none of this would've happened.
not_available OK, thank you.
not_available Jack didn't pass through any of the exits before the lockdown.
not_available He's still here.
not_available No one left sectors A through K.
not_available They're clear.
not_available He's on the lower levels.
not_available You checked the video? 
not_available That's what I'm doing.
not_available It takes time.
not_available I know, make it take less time.
not_available Where's Chloe? Morris? 
not_available I don't I'm not sure.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Have you found Jack? No, not yet, but I'd like to know how he managed to overpower you.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I got too close.
not_available Yeah, see, I don't think it was a mistake.
not_available You wanted Jack to have a chance with Audrey, so you went there with the purpose of letting him overpower you and then escaping with your key card.
not_available I did what I think is best for this operation, and for Audrey Raines.
not_available I have him! He's headed down to the lower level, but with everything locked down, he'll only have access to corridors L and M.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Let me know if you find anything, and have Doctor Bradley and Doyle meet me there.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available I'm gonna protect you.
not_available I'm gonna take care of you, I promise.
not_available I know you can recognise me.
not_available I see it in your eyes.
not_available It's me 
not_available Jack.
not_available The men who hurt you, they can't touch you now.
not_available I won't allow it.
not_available Right now, I need you to try and remember.
not_available I need you to remember who you are.
not_available Your name is Audrey Raines.
not_available You were born Audrey Louise Heller in Albany, New York.
not_available Your father was the Secretary of Defence, James Heller.
not_available Your mother's name was Alicia.
not_available She died when you were nine.
not_available Please, Audrey, just try and remember.
not_available Nadia? I've got Jack.
not_available Room 237 was just sealed from the inside.
not_available They have to be in there.
not_available I see the room now.
not_available Dammit, it's disabled.
not_available Get an entry team down here now.
not_available We need an entry team at door 237.
not_available The men holding you, when they called me they were within an hour of that motel.
not_available When they moved you, did you take surface streets or the freeway, anything that can help us find them? I want them to pay for what they've done.
not_available I know what you've been through.
not_available I know what it's like to feel like it's never going to end, to hate them that much, and then need them to start blaming yourself for everything that's happening to you.
not_available But they can't hurt you any more.
not_available You don't need to hide now.
not_available It's over.
not_available Please, give me a signal.
not_available Anything that lets me know you understand what I'm saying.
not_available Please, please.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm I'm sorry.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I know you're trying.
not_available I love you with all my heart.
not_available I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
not_available They'll take you away from me.
not_available There's nothing I can do to stop them.
not_available We're out of time.
not_available Is there anything you can tell me to help us find Cheng, or where they were holding you? Please.
not_available Come here, come on! 
not_available Jack, put your gun down.
not_available You put your gun down! Get him out! I'm not letting him take her back to Medical.
not_available Jack, lower your weapon! Not until I get a guarantee from you that Audrey is safe.
not_available Bloomfield.
not_available What'd you say? 
not_available Bloomfield.
not_available Did you hear that? She said "Bloomfield".
not_available I asked her where she was being held.
not_available We don't know if it's communication.
not_available "Bloomfield" could be a programmed response meaning nothing.
not_available We'll soon find out.
not_available Morris, did you get that? Have Chloe track it down.
not_available Keep Doyle in the loop.
not_available All right.
not_available In the meantime, Doctor, I'd like you to wait for me in my office.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available She's my patient.
not_available And she's my witness.
not_available I suggest you go with these men, Doctor.
not_available Listen to me, Jack.
not_available You have my word, I will not let him touch her.
not_available Please, lower your weapon.
not_available Audrey, please, it's all right.
not_available He's gonna take care of you.
not_available Jack, I need you to go with these men to Holding.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes, of course, General.
not_available I'll review the report with the vice president.
not_available I'll get right back to you.
not_available Suvarov wasn't bluffing? No, sir.
not_available Air Force satellites confirm the Russian army is moving large numbers of troops into central Asia.
not_available How long till they're in range of our base? 
not_available They'll be in strike range within the hour.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr Vice President.
not_available I got back here as soon as I could.
not_available Forward the report to the Joint Chiefs.
not_available Let me know their recommendations.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's going on? Why is Tom talking to the Joint Chiefs? Because the Russians know the Chinese have the component.
not_available How? Someone inside the beltway has been selling them information 
not_available someone with access.
not_available A man named Mark Bishop.
not_available Do you know him? I believe he's a lobbyist.
not_available Are you sure it's Bishop? Yeah.
not_available We began monitoring his phone calls as soon as this came to our attention.
not_available Ten minutes ago he called a known Russian intelligence agent from his cellphone.
not_available It's me.
not_available What's my next move? 
not_available You must reach out to her.
not_available Find out if there are any developments with the component.
not_available I'll call her, access her PDA, see if she has new email.
not_available Very good.
not_available So how long have you known this man Bishop? He's an acquaintance.
not_available He consulted on a white paper last year on defence spending.
not_available Dammit, don't insult me any more than you already have.
not_available Bishop's been passing intelligence to the Russians that he got from you.
not_available I don't know if he read your emails, or if you talked about it in bed, but the Russians know about the component.
not_available They're threatening military action if we don't get it back from the Chinese.
not_available I always knew you were a good liar.
not_available I just I just didn't think you could lie to me.
not_available I guess I thought too highly of myself.
not_available I swear to you, I didn't know.
not_available It's still treason, which I don't need to remind you is a capital offence.
not_available You didn'tjust betray me, you betrayed your country.
not_available What do you want from me? You're gonna go back to your boyfriend, and you're gonna make him believe that we have the component back.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available You can and you will do exactly what Tom Lennox tells you to do.
not_available And don't you even think about trying to expose our relationship.
not_available If you go there, I'll have you declared an enemy combatant, put you in solitary.
not_available It'll be years before you speak to anyone about anything.
not_available Noah? You all right, sir? I'm better now.
not_available Secret Service is sending over a team to work with her.
not_available We'll get this going soon.
not_available I've made arrangements to take you away from here.
not_available I'm going to look after you, I promise.
not_available You will get well, and you won't be alone.
