not_available I don't have to tell you.
not_available You're trying to get outside the blast radius.
not_available Sir, we have a serious situation.
not_available Taking time out to coddle the media Once the rumour mill starts, we've got two problems.
not_available We don't need mass hysteria.
not_available My sister is getting married today, Ralph.
not_available We have to establish whether or not there's a connection between Reza and the terrorists.
not_available A passport would be ideal.
not_available You'll be dropped three blocks from the salvage yard.
not_available We haven't seen Wald come in yet.
not_available That's Eddie Grant, one of Wald's main go
not_available to guys.
not_available You haven't changed much, Jack.
not_available What's your point? I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule.
not_available What are we doing? Today we're turning a government building into a cemetery.
not_available What building? 
not_available The CTU.
not_available Kim.
not_available Take my keys and get her away from here.
not_available Kim, stop the car.
not_available I will kill you.
not_available Stop the car, Kim.
not_available Do not do this.
not_available I need you to come over here.
not_available Right here.
not_available Wait for me.
not_available I'm gonna go get some help.
not_available Tell me where my daughter is, Kim.
not_available Megan? Megan? Megan! Megan! Megan! 
not_available Megan! Megan! Megan! Have you seen a little girl? Nine, blonde hair? I'll be fine, OK? I'll be fine.
not_available You are Gary Matheson? Yeah.
not_available About time you got here.
not_available Where you been? We just got the call five minutes ago, sir.
not_available You're reporting a child abduction? It's my daughter.
not_available She took my daughter.
not_available Describe the suspect for me.
not_available I can do better than that.
not_available Her name is Could you stop, please? Her name is Kimberly Bauer.
not_available She works for my wife and me.
not_available I need a description, sir.
not_available Mason.
not_available It's Tony.
not_available Howfar out of the city are you? Why? I just got off the line with Steve Lawler from District.
not_available About what? LAPD made a vehicle match with somebody on our watch list.
not_available He wants you to check it out.
not_available This is coming out of LAPD? Come on.
not_available Lawler doesn't trust their judgment, so he wants you there.
not_available Plus he knows it's on your way to Bakersfield.
not_available I know you're headed out there to follow up on a lead, but Lawler wants this checked out.
not_available What's the address? Before you go to your press conference, Rayburn wanted me to give you this updated damage projection.
not_available These casualty figures are higher.
not_available They have all but ruled out dirty bombs and conventional weapons.
not_available They feel that we are actually dealing with a nuclear bomb.
not_available Megan! Megan! Megan! Get away from her! Get away! Where did you go? I told you to wait.
not_available Huh? I was looking for you.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available OK, OK.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available You're gonna take that building down with three charges? It's all in the placement, Jack.
not_available Did you guys spread those fuses? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What made you target CTU anyway? Why are you asking so many questions? 
not_available I just wanna know what I'm getting into.
not_available Nobody asked you to get into this.
not_available The time comes, all you gotta do is keep your eyes open and we'll do the rest.
not_available Whatever you say, Eddie.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dad.
not_available Did you get my message? Listen to me 
not_available I left it on your phone about an hour ago.
not_available I lost my phone.
not_available Gary flipped out on me.
not_available Can you find it? Find what? 
not_available Your phone.
not_available I'm in trouble.
not_available I need you to come get me.
not_available I can't go to the police with this.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at a payphone on Spring Street.
not_available What's the number? 
not_available Dad, I wantyou to come get me.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Why not? Why don'tyou go to Carol's? I'll call you there.
not_available Aunt Carol's? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She lives in San Jose, Dad.
not_available I know where she lives.
not_available Dad, you're acting really weird right now.
not_available Just go there.
not_available And for once do what I ask, OK? Who was that? 
not_available My girlfriend.
not_available I asked her to pick something up for me.
not_available She just doesn't listen.
not_available Tony, Jack Bauer's daughter on line five.
not_available She sounds pretty freaked.
not_available Kim, this is Tony.
not_available You all right? 
not_available I just spoke to my dad.
not_available He's acting strange.
not_available He pretty much hung up on me.
not_available He's on a job, Kim.
not_available Since when? I just saw him a couple of hours ago.
not_available Maybe I can help you out.
not_available It's messed up.
not_available I have the police after me.
not_available Why? 
not_available I didn't do anything wrong.
not_available I've just been Kim? Hello, Kim? Hello? Kim? The connection's messed up.
not_available Tell me where you are and somebody'll pick you up.
not_available I can't stay here.
not_available Can you find a way to CTU? Yeah, I guess so.
not_available I can take the bus.
not_available Do that.
not_available When you get here I'll help you straighten everything out.
not_available OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available There's noise on all the phone lines.
not_available I tried a filter and I can't get rid of it.
not_available It may not be our system.
not_available Today of all days.
not_available Call the phone company, and switch all priority calls to wireless protocol.
not_available You trying to knock out their phone lines? 
not_available Don't bug me.
not_available I'm working.
not_available We're causing some interference so the phone company sends out a crew.
not_available Maybe you could go out to the road, Jack.
not_available Keep an eye out.
not_available Sure.
not_available No problem.
not_available CTU operations.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Hello? Is this CTU? Can you hear me? Hello? Dammit.
not_available Northwest Regional.
not_available This is Jack Bauer from CTU.
not_available I need to speak with the president.
not_available Who is this? It's Jack Bauer.
not_available Priority access code 7117A.
not_available This is urgent.
not_available Hold, please.
not_available Please don't put me on hold.
not_available Lynne Kresge.
not_available I have a Jack Bauer for the president.
not_available He has a clearance code.
not_available Put him through to me, please.
not_available Mr Bauer, this is Lynne Kresge.
not_available I need to speak with the president.
not_available I'm terribly sorry.
not_available He's with the press corps right now.
not_available Mr Bauer, hello? CTU's phone lines are down.
not_available I need you to get them an urgent message.
not_available What is it? CTU, Los Angeles, is going to be blown up within the hour.
not_available Wald's group is doing it.
not_available Is this the nuclear bomb? 
not_available No, it is not the nuke.
not_available Butyou need to evacuate CTU and you need to alert a bomb squad.
not_available There are at least three charges on the 
not_available Jack.
not_available All set, Jack.
not_available I applaud Governor Schulman's efforts to protect Oregon's endangered species.
not_available His work with the Natural Resources Defense Council has created a new paradigm Wald's crew is planning to blow up CTU, Los Angeles.
not_available It is a non
not_available radiological attack, and it is happening within the hour.
not_available Where'd you get this? 
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available They wanna cripple CTU's investigation, divert attention away from the major strike.
not_available I agree.
not_available Has Bauer contacted CTU? He couldn't get through.
not_available Phone lines are down.
not_available Somehow we have to warn CTU.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available We can't.
not_available What are you talking about? If Wald's crewfails, they'll think somebody tipped off CTU.
not_available They'll figure out it was Bauer.
not_available Are you seriously suggesting we just let these people at CTU die? 
not_available Jack Bauer gave specific instructions.
not_available Why isn't he stopping them? Because he knows he's gotta keep his cover intact.
not_available He knows if he's exposed he can't get to Wald and we lose our only chance to find the nuke.
not_available This is the president's decision.
not_available He's telling the press it's business as usual.
not_available We've already detained Ron Wieland illegally.
not_available We can't muzzle the entire press corps.
not_available We still have to tell the president.
not_available We will.
not_available When he's in a position to hear it.
not_available It will be too late by then.
not_available Lynne, this is my call.
not_available I don't work for you.
not_available Jenny Dodge.
not_available It's Lynne.
not_available I need to speakto the president.
not_available He's in a press conference.
not_available I don't care.
not_available This is urgent.
not_available I want to speak with him now.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll try to get to him.
not_available Hey, look at this.
not_available Someone cut the chain.
not_available Get on the radio to Dispatch and have them send security.
not_available Who are you? Don't move.
not_available Don't move! What's your name? What's your name? Look at me.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Cam Strocker.
not_available Is thatyour name? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cam, look at me.
not_available You wanna live, Cam? Cam.
not_available Cam.
not_available Cam.
not_available You wanna live? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is whatyou're gonna do: call your boss, tell him you need an on
not_available site systems check at CTU headquarters.
not_available Got that? Can you do it? Can you do it? That's a good answer.
not_available It's Eric Rayburn from NSA.
not_available Mr Rayburn? This is Tony Almeida.
not_available I understand you're the ranking agent on site.
not_available Is that correct? 
not_available Yes, sir, it is.
not_available Then I need you to execute an order.
not_available Of course.
not_available I wantyou to copy and transfer your database onto our server, anything related to the nuclear threat.
not_available Did you hear me? 
not_available Yes, sir, I did.
not_available May I ask why? It's precautionary, given the extraordinary threat we're facing today.
not_available But I would like it done sooner than later.
not_available How soon? By 11.
not_available The earliest I could get that done is by noon.
not_available You have until 11.
not_available Sir, that may not be enough time.
not_available Then you probably should get started.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Paula.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need to pull you off your SIM analysis.
not_available I'm almost done.
not_available I wantyou to sort and send data to the NSA server, everything relevant to the nuke, OK? When do you need it done? 
not_available Right now.
not_available I'm gonna have to generate a fresh encryption code.
not_available I'm gonna need to use Mr Mason's office.
not_available Just do it, please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tony, what's going on? First the phone lines go down and then NSA puts in a rush order for us to transfer all our data on the nuke? He says it's precautionary.
not_available Then he would have issued the same order to every other agency.
not_available Look into that, would you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How you doing? George Mason, CTU.
not_available Arroyo, LAPD.
not_available Barber made a vehicle match from the alertyou guys put out this morning.
not_available Have you checked inside? 
not_available We were about to.
not_available Our captain made us stand down until you got here.
not_available Relax, Sergeant.
not_available I wanna be here even less than you want me here.
not_available Hello? What's this? Nice.
not_available You OK in there? We got a man down in here.
not_available Get out of the building! Get out of the building! Call Hazmat and have them set up a quarantine.
not_available I think we got a hot zone.
not_available You OK? Yeah? Does your mom cry a lot? I don't have a mom.
not_available Where is she? She passed away.
not_available Butyou have a dad, right? Do you make him mad? Sometimes.
not_available I always make my dad mad.
not_available No, when your dad gets mad, it's not because of you.
not_available But he always says it is.
not_available Well, he's wrong.
not_available I promise you he's wrong.
not_available Everything's gonna be OK, Megan.
not_available I'm never gonna let him hurtyou again.
not_available You knowthe drill.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available I'm doing a system check and line repair.
not_available Let me see your work order.
not_available My office just called a few minutes ago.
not_available They spoke with McKendrie.
not_available He says you got some serious noise on your lines.
not_available Let me see your ID.
not_available Sure.
not_available You're doing fine, Cam.
not_available Isn't he, Jack? Yeah, he's doing great.
not_available Is the back open? 
not_available It's just my crew backthere.
not_available I still need to look.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's open.
not_available There's a lot of you.
not_available It's a big job.
not_available It's all clear.
not_available All right.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Have your IDs ready for security up ahead.
not_available This isn't a bank.
not_available There's nothing to steal here.
not_available We're not stealing anything.
not_available Then why are we here? We're taking back our country.
not_available From who? Who are you people? Jack, tell him who we are.
not_available We're patriots.
not_available Kate, it's for you.
not_available Some guy named Ralph Burton.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So who is he? A new boyfriend? Maybe.
not_available Why can't I ever get a straight answer out of you? Can you just give me the phone? 
not_available Hello.
not_available Kate.
not_available Did you check the passport information I gave you? I'm afraid it confirms that Reza Naiyeer has had contact with Syed Ali.
not_available What does that mean? Are you saying Reza's a terrorist? The authorities need to determine that.
not_available Authorities? What authorities? 
not_available I had to alert homeland security, Kate.
not_available Are they gonna arrest him? I'm not sure yet, but until I hear from them, please keep this to yourself.
not_available I have to tell my sister.
not_available You can't tell her or anyone else about this until you hear from me again.
not_available I don't believe this is happening.
not_available I know it's hard, but just try to act normal.
not_available My sister is marrying someone who works with terrorists and you expect me to act normal? You could endanger yourself and your family if you let on that anything is wrong.
not_available Kate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I understand.
not_available Kate.
not_available Come with us.
not_available Not right now.
not_available My cousin Sanjar just arrived.
not_available We wanted you to meet him before he headed to the hotel.
not_available I can meet him later.
not_available You'll probably recognise him.
not_available He was at Stanford the same time you were.
not_available He's cute.
not_available No, really.
not_available No! I said no! Kate, what is your problem? I'm sorry, Marie.
not_available I just I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to do that.
not_available What did you mean? You've been acting really weird all morning.
not_available What is it, Kate? Tell me, what's going on? You're my little sister.
not_available And I love you so much.
not_available And I just wantyou to be happy.
not_available That's it.
not_available Well, then, be happy for me, OK? That'll make me happy.
not_available Because this is gonna be the best day of my life.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No crying.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm getting married.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
not_available Jenny.
not_available Yes? I told you I need to speakto the president.
not_available I have to draft a statement anticipating the nuclear event.
not_available Why haven't I heard from him? 
not_available He's on camera.
not_available I told you this was urgent.
not_available You should have slipped him a note.
not_available I did.
not_available I'm sure as soon as the president can extricate himself, he'll call you.
not_available Let's get those portable units in here now.
not_available Looks like this lead turned out to be real.
not_available Some kind of lab where they may have assembled the nuke.
not_available Based on what? 
not_available They found radioactive material.
not_available What kind of radioactive material? They're still doing field analysis on it.
not_available Was anyone exposed? All of them in the bag.
not_available They're putting us through decon now.
not_available Precautionary measure.
not_available We have three dead bodies.
not_available I'm gonna send you photos and fingerprints on 'em.
not_available See if they match anybody on our watch list.
not_available Your phone, sir.
not_available I'm gonna have to get backto you.
not_available George, look, NSA ordered us to send them our case database.
not_available Paula's already on it, but I sense they're keeping us out of the loop on something.
not_available They're consolidating data from all agencies.
not_available That's just it.
not_available We're the only agency they've asked.
not_available Sir, the phone.
not_available Tony, I gotta go.
not_available Call Chapelle.
not_available Tell him whatyou just told me.
not_available See what he can find out for you.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available George, you sure you're OK? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I need all your clothes off.
not_available You're not even gonna buy me dinner? Check him over at hoses.
not_available Easy, guys.
not_available I like my skin.
not_available Try and leave some on.
not_available Did you finish exporting those files to Division? No, it's in process now.
not_available As soon as they finish uploading, I'll send an encryption key.
not_available Paula, are you all right? Yeah.
not_available I was a little nervous before, but Tony said everything's probably gonna be OK.
not_available I grew up in LA, you know.
not_available My whole family is here, my friends are here.
not_available So if this bomb goes off, that just means all of a sudden everyone's gonna die? No.
not_available No, not necessarily.
not_available It depends on a lot of things.
not_available Yeah, that's probably right.
not_available Well, I should checkthe upgrade.
not_available Paula.
not_available Are you gonna be OK? I guess so.
not_available I'm really scared, but there's nothing I can do about it, right? It's fine, Michelle.
not_available You gonna kill me too? 
not_available Not today.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Just relax.
not_available I'm not gonna hurtyou.
not_available I'm trying to stop this thing.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Two cars over there's a large grey SUV.
not_available I want you to hide under it and wait until we go.
not_available After we've gone, I wantyou to take this back into the building.
not_available Go to security, ask for Tony Almeida.
not_available It'll show him where all the bombs are located.
not_available He'll know what to do.
not_available Now go.
not_available What are you talking about, man? Who are you? I'm a government agent.
not_available I'm undercover.
not_available You work for the government? And you let them kill Danny? 
not_available It happened before I could stop it.
not_available You son of a bitch! Listen to me.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm sorry aboutyour friend.
not_available I am.
not_available But we are in a very serious situation, so you better getyour ass under that car right now.
not_available These guys'll be back in a minute.
not_available If you're still here they will kill you.
not_available I won't be able to stop them.
not_available Do you understand? The lives of everyone in this building are at stake right now.
not_available So, please, get that message to Tony Almeida.
not_available Come on, go.
not_available Where's your boy, Eddie? Jack? Jack? Jack.
not_available What happened? Where's the guy? Look at me.
not_available Jack.
not_available What happened? Jack, look at me.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Where's the telephone guy? I don't know.
not_available I was looking out like you asked me to, and the next thing I know you're slapping me in the head, Eddie.
not_available What are you telling me, Jack? Are you saying you let the son of a bitch go? 
not_available I didn't tie him up.
not_available Are you saying it's my fault? Do you believe this guy? He walks in off the street, breaks Dave's ankle Back off! Back off.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Jack, get in the front of the van.
not_available Get in the front of the van.
not_available We got seven minutes until this building goes down.
not_available Get in.
not_available Hi.
not_available My name's Kimberly Bauer.
not_available Tony Almeida is expecting us.
not_available OK.
not_available He'll take care of you.
not_available Where are we? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We're safe here.
not_available How much time have we got? 
not_available Four minutes.
not_available Unless the phone guy already pulled the alarm.
not_available Leave it alone.
not_available The press conference ended five minutes ago.
not_available The president was supposed to call me the minute, very minute that he What are you doing? It was you.
not_available You told Jenny to keep the president away from me.
not_available I spared the president from a no
not_available win situation.
not_available The people did not electyou to make that choice, Eric.
not_available It's too late.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Don't do this, Lynne.
not_available You do not want me for an enemy, I promise.
not_available Are you threatening me? 
not_available Just giving you some strong advice.
not_available What's going on? Jack Bauer called.
not_available He said that Wald's crew is planning to blow up CTU.
not_available It's a non
not_available nuclear strike, which suggests that it's a secondary target.
not_available When? 
not_available We're not sure.
not_available Bauer got cut off.
not_available Have you called CTU? 
not_available That's what we were debating.
not_available Debating? Right now Wald is our only thread to finding the nuke.
not_available But Bauer hasn't got to Wald yet.
not_available If we stop Wald's crew, they may realise it was Bauer that turned them in.
not_available In the meantime, I'm having CTU transfer their intel so our only losses would be infrastructure and personnel.
not_available Those losses are unacceptable.
not_available Contact CTU immediately.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Think I'm making a mistake? 
not_available I do, sir.
not_available Tony.
not_available That guy over there, he's asking to see you.
not_available He claims he was taken hostage by these men that wanna blow up CTU.
not_available He said there are bombs planted here, here and here.
not_available I'll have a squad check it out.
not_available Order an evacuation.
not_available We don't know This is why NSA wanted us to transfer over our database.
not_available They knew we were being targeted and didn't say a thing.
not_available We have to evacuate now.
not_available Everyone, listen up.
not_available This is Lynne Kresge.
not_available I'm calling to tell you about a possible threat to CTU.
not_available We just found out about it.
not_available NSA knew about this a half an hour ago.
not_available That's why Rayburn wanted our files.
not_available Right now getyour people out.
not_available I wantyou to go down this hallway and calmly clear everyone out.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available We're evacuating.
not_available I'm looking for Tony Almeida.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We've gotta go right now.
not_available I need you to move a little faster.
not_available No, leave your things behind! What are you doing? 
not_available I'm almost done with the encryption.
not_available Leave it! There's a bomb! We can't lose this data! Would you leave it? Come on! Let's go! Come on, hurry! Hurry! 
not_available We did it, Jack.
not_available Good job, Eddie.
not_available Good job.
not_available We're too late.
not_available CTU was just hit.
not_available I want Mommy.
not_available I know.
not_available It's OK.
not_available You're clean.
not_available Then why so grim? The tests are back from the field analysis.
not_available The substance you inhaled is well, it's plutonium.
not_available Based on the particle size, atmospheric saturation, length of time you were exposed Cut to the chase, Doctor.
not_available Your radiation exposure level is high.
not_available Definitely lethal.
not_available How much time do I have? Could be as much as a week or as little as a day.
not_available I'm sorry.
