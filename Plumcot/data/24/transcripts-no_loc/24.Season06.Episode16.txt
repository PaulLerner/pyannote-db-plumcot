
not_available 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mark Hauser? Who's this? 
not_available You know who it is.
not_available I already gave you what you asked for.
not_available But your employer has tightened security.
not_available So the access I paid for is no good.
not_available It'll take some time 
not_available to download the new security protocols.
not_available I'll be there in 40 minutes.
not_available Federal agent, get on the floor! Hauser sold Gredenko security specs for Edgemont nuclear power facility.
not_available Does Gredenko have them? 
not_available He's picking them up in 20 minutes.
not_available Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother.
not_available We're gonna use him for the transaction.
not_available You look nervous, Brady.
not_available All teams, take out your targets.
not_available All teams, there's a third hostile inside the vehicle.
not_available You know who I am.
not_available Then you know what I'm gonna do to you, unless you tell me where the bombs are.
not_available First, my terms.
not_available Amnesty from your government and a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia.
not_available Nadia's being processed as an enemy combatant.
not_available I don't know if I can accept that she betrayed us.
not_available She spied for Fayed? I think we're wrong.
not_available I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why do you ask? I came across evidence at the switching station that proves she's innocent.
not_available You're cleared, Nadia.
not_available Admiral, is the Vickery ready to launch? 
not_available It's seconds from optimal launch position.
not_available Good.
not_available Proceed with the strike.
not_available Vice President Daniels is about to launch a nuclear strike against the Middle East.
not_available This strike is a complete reversal of everything that he was working for.
not_available You want Dr Welton to bring him out of the coma? Yes.
not_available It's for you, sir.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I've called off the strike, Noah.
not_available I'm resuming my duties as commander in chief.
not_available Inform Admiral Smith and the others there's to be no action without my authorisation.
not_available It's apparent to me the president is still suffering the effects from the attack on his life.
not_available I can't let him remain in power.
not_available Get me the Attorney General.
not_available Should have live feed, sir.
not_available Secretary Dawes, can you see and hear me clearly? 
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available Secretary Durant and Attorney General Graves? 
not_available Connections are being set up.
not_available And the president? He should be arriving any moment.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I need to get up from this wheelchair.
not_available No, you need to take care of yourself.
not_available Sandra, I can't afford to look weak.
not_available Roosevelt did just fine from a wheelchair.
not_available Listen, when I face Daniels, I want to be on my feet.
not_available Dr Welton? Yes, sir? Can you give me a shot of Adrenalin? 
not_available Wayne.
not_available I can.
not_available It'll raise your blood pressure, which is not what you need right now.
not_available The risk of 
not_available Mr President? It is time.
not_available Give us a few minutes, please.
not_available Excuse me, Mr President.
not_available Mr President 
not_available Just do it.
not_available Now.
not_available What do you have, Jack? 
not_available Gredenko offered us Fayed, in exchange for immunity and a guarantee that we won't extradite him back to Russia.
not_available Bill, I don't trust it.
not_available He rolled over too easy.
not_available What do you think his play is? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available It's your call, Jack.
not_available But you should know what's happening in Washington.
not_available The president's regained consciousness.
not_available How is he? Well enough.
not_available But Daniels is challenging him under the 25th Amendment, in large part so he can go ahead with the nuclear strike against Fayed's country.
not_available Does he have a chance of winning? 
not_available It's unclear.
not_available But if Fayed detonates another bomb, no one will be able to stand in Daniels' way.
not_available If there's a challenge for the presidency, the immunity agreement won't be binding.
not_available Bill, you need to understand that I have no intention of honouring this agreement.
not_available Tell the Attorney General, draw up the papers.
not_available I'm calling him right now.
not_available The president should be here momentarily.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Mr President.
not_available I know I speak for everyone here in saying how very happy I am to have you with us again.
not_available Let's proceed.
not_available As you know, an attempt was made to assassinate the president.
not_available He sustained injuries so serious that the doctors had to induce a temporary coma in order to relieve the pressure on his brain.
not_available In so doing, they saved his life.
not_available The question now is whether, in the words of the 25th Amendment, he is unable to discharge the duties and powers of his office.
not_available Isn't this really a medical question? 
not_available Well, to a degree it is.
not_available But the 25th Amendment puts the final decision 
not_available squarely in the hands of the cabinet.
not_available May we hear medical testimony? Yes.
not_available Let me bring in the surgeon in charge of the president's case.
not_available Dr Welton, if you would, please.
not_available The president has undergone an ordeal, but from a medical point of view, the greatest danger has passed.
not_available His cognitive functions are presenting normally.
not_available I have every expectation that he will make a full recovery.
not_available Might the pressures of the office increase the chance of a relapse? 
not_available It's difficult to say.
not_available It's certainly a possibility.
not_available Can you estimate those chances? 
not_available No, I'm afraid I can't.
not_available If you had a vote, Doctor, how would you cast it? 
not_available This is precisely the question which the Constitution demands that this cabinet answer.
not_available Thank you very much, Doctor.
not_available Mr President, I think now would be an appropriate time 
not_available to address the cabinet, if you would, please.
not_available The vice president initiated this process because I stopped him launching a nuclear strike against the Middle East.
not_available But this vote shouldn't be about policy.
not_available According to the Constitution, you're judging me to see if I am unable to discharge the duties of my office.
not_available Well, as you can see, and as you were just told by my physician, I'm in complete possession of my faculties, and so to remove me from this office would be to betray both your oath and the American people, who voted me as their president.
not_available Mr Vice President? Ladies and gentlemen of the cabinet, the 25th Amendment is purposely vague on how you're supposed to judge if the president is unable to discharge his duties, which is why this is very much about the president's policies, and his actions.
not_available Here are the facts: when a second nuclear attack today spread radiation over one of our major cities, I decided it was necessary to launch a retaliatory strike, to show our enemies that if attacked, we would make them share our pain.
not_available Wayne Palmer's first act upon regaining consciousness was to stop that strike.
not_available To respond to the attack by doing nothing.
not_available In a time of war, the president must be strong enough in body and mind to defend this country.
not_available And I'm afraid Wayne Palmer's actions are the proof in this matter that indeed he is unable to discharge his duties.
not_available All right.
not_available Time is of the essence, so unless there is an objection, I would like to recess and then reconvene for your vote in ten minutes.
not_available Any word on the cabinet vote? 
not_available No, they haven't come back yet.
not_available Look, Milo, about what happened today.
not_available Let's just put it behind us, OK? Which part? The suspicion of terrorism, or the the other thing? 
not_available The suspicion.
not_available And the other thing? Let's not worry about it right now.
not_available Let's try and get through the day.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm not gonna forget about the kiss, and I don't think you are either.
not_available Nadia.
not_available It's Doyle.
not_available Don't say my name.
not_available Just listen.
not_available I need you to come up to my office.
not_available Don't say anything to anybody.
not_available Just come.
not_available On my way.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Look, I know you and I got off to kind of a bad start.
not_available "A bad start"? You assaulted me.
not_available This country is under attack.
not_available We had reason to believe there was a mole in this building.
not_available Starting with you wasn't racist.
not_available It was common sense.
not_available So you're not a racist, you're just a sadist.
not_available You don't know me.
not_available I think I do.
not_available Why did you call me here? 
not_available Turns out there was no mole.
not_available The terrorists could hack into our system cos someone screwed up and logged the wrong security parameters.
not_available I'm pretty sure that someone was Milo, and the proof is on his computer.
not_available I need someone to get it without him noticing.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Why? Is it cos you're too busy deciding if you wanna sleep with him? Listen, if you don't get the evidence for me, I'm gonna call a forensics team and they'll tear his system apart as the entire floor watches.
not_available And if they find what I think they'll find, everyone gets to watch Milo hauled out of this building in handcuffs.
not_available I'm sure it wasn't pleasant when it happened to you, but you're gonna stand by and watch it happen to him? That's your idea of being a friend? So you want me to betray him for his own good? I promise you, Milo will be better off if you help me than if you don't.
not_available Your call.
not_available If the cabinet sides with you, what will you do about Daniels? The Constitution does not allow the president to fire his vice president.
not_available But you can marginalise him.
not_available She's right.
not_available Get him out of the bunker.
not_available I'd love to, but Daniels has way too many supporters, and I can't afford to alienate any one of them right now.
not_available Besides, I'd rather have him somewhere where I can keep an eye on him.
not_available Mr President? The cabinet's reconvening.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available Right.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen of the cabinet, let us now begin the vote.
not_available Will those of you who believe that President Palmer is able to discharge his duties please, at this time, raise your hand? Do we have any abstentions? The vote is seven to seven.
not_available Mr Attorney General, what would be the next step? Well, there's no need for a next step.
not_available The Amendment requires that the vice president and a majority of the cabinet agree.
not_available There is no majority in the cabinet, it's split evenly.
not_available President Palmer remains in office.
not_available It's not that simple.
not_available One of the cabinet votes is invalid.
not_available Sir, which vote is not valid? 
not_available National security advisor.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available She resigned.
not_available I resumed my duties.
not_available I don't agree.
not_available I've seen no evidence that you've been reinstated.
not_available That is ridiculous.
not_available I sat here with you in a cabinet meeting less than one hour ago! Ms Hayes, allowing you to sit in on the meeting isn't equivalent to formally recognising you as national security advisor! In fact, I did not and do not so recognise you.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available And if Ms Hayes' vote is invalid, then the tally's seven to six in favour of invoking the 25th Amendment and removing President Palmer from power.
not_available I'm sorry, Wayne.
not_available Noah, don't waste your apologies on me, because I won't let you steal the presidency.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Then what do you suggest? 
not_available The country has to be governed.
not_available I would suggest, sir, 
not_available that this is properly a matter for the courts.
not_available I concur.
not_available We don't have time to go to 
not_available Mr Vice President, if I may.
not_available I agree with Mr Lennox.
not_available This is a legal question.
not_available The Supreme Court was in session this afternoon.
not_available We can recall it, and have them render a decision regarding the validity of the vote.
not_available The matter could be resolved in under an hour.
not_available Thank you, Attorney General Graves.
not_available Get the process started and keep us advised.
not_available I think this meeting is concluded.
not_available Get my affidavit started.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tom.
not_available You know something? I'm beginning to think you're not on my side.
not_available Sir, I'm on the side of the United States of America, and if you ever thought otherwise, you're very much mistaken.
not_available Gredenko's attorney approved the immunity agreements.
not_available Yeah, we're just waiting for digital signatures.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll inform the Attorney General's office it's on its way.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Milo.
not_available What's up? I'm having a problem.
not_available My station keeps telling me to refresh the system credentials.
not_available It's the hardware codes.
not_available You have to reset them.
not_available I can take care of it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You were right.
not_available Milo forgot to refresh the security parameters.
not_available The breach was his fault.
not_available So when you tell District, they can fire and maybe arrest him.
not_available Which is why I'm going to alter the log so they'll never know.
not_available This should work, as long as they haven't changed the password.
not_available There.
not_available It's done.
not_available Why did you do that? 
not_available Cos all I care about is finding those nukes.
not_available We have a better chance of doing that with Milo on board, whether he likes me or not.
not_available "And mankind is naught but a single nation".
not_available You've read the Koran? 
not_available And the Bible.
not_available And the Upanishads.
not_available Anything I can get my hands on.
not_available You're lucky, you've found your answers.
not_available I'm looking for mine.
not_available I'd better get ready to deploy.
not_available What did Doyle want? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Just reviewing some data sets.
not_available There you go.
not_available Your system's back up.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available How did the cabinet vote go? 
not_available It was a tie, which in effect means that Palmer is still in office.
not_available That's good.
not_available That's what we wanted.
not_available Daniels is contesting the vote.
not_available He's saying that mine is invalid.
not_available Based on what? Based on the fact that I resigned, and I was never officially reinstated.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available You attended meetings.
not_available You had no replacement assigned.
not_available I know, but maybe he's right, Bill.
not_available I did hand in my resignation.
not_available Which was rescinded before it was officially accepted.
not_available Daniels knows that.
not_available He's grasping at straws, Karen.
not_available I'm so scared, Bill.
not_available If he wins, this will all be my fault.
not_available Stop, stop.
not_available It's desperate manoeuvring on his part, Karen, nothing more.
not_available He hasn't got a case.
not_available And the Supreme Court will agree.
not_available Well, we're giving our arguments in 15 minutes.
not_available Call me as soon as the decision is in.
not_available Thank you for being there.
not_available You don't have to thank me.
not_available It's my job.
not_available I miss you so much.
not_available I miss you too.
not_available I'll talk to you soon.
not_available Bye.
not_available Good.
not_available My attorney has verified the agreements.
not_available We're set.
not_available Gredenko's ready to make the call.
not_available We're standing by.
not_available Doyle's got a team ready to go as soon as Fayed tells Gredenko where to meet him.
not_available You try and warn Fayed with anything you say, or how you say it, 
not_available and I will kill you right here, right now.
not_available I believe you, Agent Bauer.
not_available Make the call.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Do you have the security protocols? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where do you want to meet? Are you sure you're not under surveillance? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Do you think I'd be calling you otherwise? 
not_available I can't allow another mistake to disrupt my plans for the remaining two devices.
not_available Do you want the protocols or not? 
not_available Where are you right now? Culver City.
not_available Meet me at the Santa Monica pier in ten minutes.
not_available Uh It may take me more time.
not_available I won't wait.
not_available Where do I find you? 
not_available Just be there.
not_available I'll find you.
not_available Give him the phone.
not_available Bill, how long will it take Doyle's team to make it to the pier? 
not_available He's about 30 minutes out.
not_available We'll make do with Ryan's team.
not_available Put him in the vehicle.
not_available Instructions from the Supreme Court.
not_available Our arguments have to be submitted in writing in the next ten minutes.
not_available Sandra's working on our brief.
not_available How's it coming? I'm just about finished.
not_available We have a strong case.
not_available You resigned, and Daniels was in charge when you returned.
not_available So the legal question is, did he consent to your reinstatement? Of course he did.
not_available And he made no objections when you returned to the bunker, and he never questioned your right to be there? No, he didn't.
not_available His own actions prove our case.
not_available Thank you.
not_available For everything, Sandra.
not_available My affidavit explains everything 
not_available that I never really intended to reinstate Karen, letting her perform her duties temporarily, therefore she had no authority to cast a vote under the 25th Amendment.
not_available Problem is, after she returned, you treated her as if she still were national security advisor.
not_available It's a question of my state of mind, though, isn't it? Yes.
not_available And your state of mind will be inferred from your actions.
not_available Doesn't sound like you think our chances are very good.
not_available I don't.
not_available Then I am deeply afraid for our country.
not_available When the world sees that Wayne Palmer isn't willing to fight back, our enemies will be encouraged, these recent attacks will be just the beginning.
not_available America will be vulnerable in a way it never has been.
not_available There may be a way to illuminate your state of mind more explicitly.
not_available I can swear an affidavit that earlier today you told me to inform Karen Hayes you had no intention of reinstating her, but you'd let her perform her duties on a temporary basis only.
not_available Then Wayne regained consciousness before I could have that conversation with her.
not_available You'd be perjuring yourself in front of the Supreme Court.
not_available I'm aware that it's perjury.
not_available But the end justifies the means.
not_available My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favour so that you can do what's right for this country.
not_available You're right.
not_available Do it.
not_available Prepare your affidavit.
not_available And, Lisa Thank you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hasim, Hasan, with me.
not_available I'm meeting Gredenko.
not_available I'll be back within the hour.
not_available And if you're not? Are you worried for me, Halil? Orjust anxious to take my place? I think we're wasting time.
not_available We have the bombs.
not_available We should use them right now.
not_available Gredenko's information will enable us to inflict damage across half of California.
not_available There's other targets out there will result in large amount of casualty 
not_available without the additional risk.
not_available I've made my decision.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Come in.
not_available Mr Vice President, I need to speak with you alone.
not_available There is something in this room you need to know about, sir.
not_available "Something in this room"? What are you talking about? This small object here is a microtransmitter.
not_available After you directed me to lie to the ambassador about the assassination attempt, I decided it was time to protect myself.
not_available Now it turns out I was protecting the country as well.
not_available Be careful, Tom.
not_available Be very careful what you try to do here.
not_available Actually, sir, you are the one who needs to be careful here.
not_available I'm aware that it's perjury.
not_available But the end justifies the means.
not_available My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favour so that you can do 
not_available what's right for this country.
not_available You're right.
not_available Do it.
not_available Prepare your affidavit.
not_available Turn it off.
not_available As I'm sure you're aware, sir, conspiracy to commit perjury is a felony offence.
not_available Now, I strongly urge you to pick up that phone and call the Supreme Court.
not_available You tell them that you have withdrawn your affidavit and that of Miss Miller as well.
not_available Tell them you support the vote of the Cabinet, that you have no further objections to President Palmer continuing his presidency.
not_available You do understand that I'm just trying to do what's right for this country.
not_available Well, so am I, sir.
not_available Are you going to make that call now, sir? Karen, I need the launch protocols the joint chiefs set up with Daniels, and chainof
not_available command signing.
not_available They just came from the Pentagon.
not_available Everything is in place.
not_available If the court sides with you, you can cancel the strike permanently.
not_available I also want an update on the situation with Fayed.
not_available Has CTU made any progress? Yes, they have Gredenko in custody.
not_available Bill said they were gonna use him to lure Fayed out in the open.
not_available Who's running it? 
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Good.
not_available Wayne.
not_available The Supreme Court was just notified Daniels withdrew his suit.
not_available What?! 
not_available It's over.
not_available He gave up before the court had a chance to make its decision.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just know that you're still the President of the United States.
not_available Let the Cabinet know I won't take any action against those who sided with Daniels.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Oh, and Karen? Tell Bill I want him to keep me up to date on CTU's progress.
not_available Yes, sir? Melinda 
not_available Tell Dr Welton I need to see him, please.
not_available Certainly.
not_available I don't have a visual yet, but Fayed won't show himself until he sees Gredenko.
not_available Ryan, what's your status with Gredenko? 
not_available I've got the audio transmitter set up.
not_available Preparing the tracker now.
not_available Roll up your left sleeve.
not_available What's his range? 
not_available We can track up to 15 miles.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Is it radioactive? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It penetrates into the bone.
not_available It's got a half
not_available life of about 11 hours, so forget about digging it out or making a run for it.
not_available He's good to go.
not_available Bill, how far out is Doyle's team? 
not_available About 20 minutes.
not_available We can't wait.
not_available Fayed was clear about his time line.
not_available Ryan, send in Gredenko.
not_available Gredenko's moving now.
not_available I'm getting a clean audio signal from the transmitter on Gredenko.
not_available And we are locked on the isotope signature that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm.
not_available Hello? Hello? I have the gain on Gredenko's transmitter up all the way.
not_available There's no one on the other end.
not_available He's reading something off his phone.
not_available It's a text message.
not_available Fayed's made contact.
not_available Everyone get ready.
not_available Gredenko is heading south.
not_available I'm moving in.
not_available Milo, have you got him on the tracker? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's still moving.
not_available I'm heading in.
not_available I'm gonna follow him.
not_available I've lost audio signal.
not_available I'm going to secondary channel.
not_available There's no audio on the secondary channel.
not_available But he hasn't moved.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available You led them to me.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available But if you listen to me, we'll both get away from here alive.
not_available Hasim.
not_available Which direction, Milo? I'm nearing the south end of the pier.
not_available That's where he stopped and entered the building on the left.
not_available Is he still inside the room? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's right on the other side of the door.
not_available I'm going in.
not_available Milo, no one's in here.
not_available Jack, the tracker's showing the signal right there in the room with you.
not_available My God! They cut off Gredenko's arm! Ryan, move your men in now! Hold on.
not_available I've picked up his blood trail.
not_available Fayed, their men will be coming from the west side parking lot.
not_available We should go this way.
not_available Ryan, circle back to the east side of the pier.
not_available Try and cut 'em off.
not_available I want Fayed alive.
not_available Ryan, you got anything? 
not_available Negative.
not_available How far out is Doyle's team? 
not_available 20 minutes.
not_available Have him set up a perimeter as soon as he gets here.
not_available Ryan, where are you? I'm pinned down.
not_available Moving towards you now.
not_available Show me your head.
not_available The same terrorist cell is most likely responsible for the explosion in Valencia 
not_available We're trapped.
not_available This way.
not_available and the assassination attempt on President Palmer.
not_available That's him! What? I recognise him from the news! It's the terrorist they're looking for! Terrorist? 
not_available That is him.
not_available You bastard.
not_available Federal agent! I am a federal agent.
not_available I'm taking this man into custody.
not_available Now back off! Back off! 
not_available He shot my friend.
not_available We'll get him medical attention.
not_available Just stay back.
not_available I hope your friend is dead.
not_available Shut up! Everybody out of the bar now! Move! Ryan, this is Jack.
not_available Gredenko is not here.
not_available Lock down the area, initiate a search.
not_available We have two men down.
not_available One is a civilian, the other is Fayed.
not_available He's in custody.
not_available I need medical up here now.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available Good work.
not_available Nadia, get me the president, please.
not_available I understand you're weak.
not_available More Adrenalin will raise your blood pressure even higher, to the point where we know there'll be vascular damage.
not_available That's a risk I'm willing to take.
not_available Your wellbeing is my responsibility.
not_available And my responsibility is the wellbeing of this country, so give me another dose or I will find someone else who will.
not_available Mr President? Bill Buchanan on line one.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Thank you, Arthur.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Bill? I'm calling to tell you 
not_available that Jack has Fayed in custody.
not_available What about the bombs? We haven't finished the scan yet.
not_available We can't confirm the bombs are in the vicinity.
not_available Jack is going to interrogate Fayed as soon as possible.
not_available There's no way of knowing how successful that will be, right? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available All right, Bill.
not_available That's what I wanted to know.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available The case was withdrawn.
not_available The court has no reason to retain the documents.
not_available They should be sealed and returned to me immediately.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I was thinking that maybe it's time to declare a truce.
not_available OK.
not_available Well, maybe it is.
