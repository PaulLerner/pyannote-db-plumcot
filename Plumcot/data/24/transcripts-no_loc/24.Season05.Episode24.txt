
not_available Coordinates for the targets upload them into the missiles.
not_available Begin the launch countdown.
not_available How much time do you need to cancel the launch sequence? I won't know for sure till I see how the targeting software works.
not_available We'll keep Bierko and his men out of here, so you can finish this.
not_available Ten seconds to launch.
not_available It's done.
not_available The launch sequence is canceled.
not_available You were never really going to let me go, were you? No.
not_available You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer and Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler.
not_available I'm going after Logan.
not_available What do you mean, "going after Logan"? I'll fill you in on the details later.
not_available Right now, I need you to walk me through modifying some field communications equipment.
not_available Who is this guy? Morris O'Brian, Chloe's ex
not_available husband.
not_available I need some com unit modifications.
not_available Can you do that without talking? I could, but it would be a terrible waste of my charm.
not_available Jack Bauer's on his way here now.
not_available He's going to confront your husband directly.
not_available But Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately.
not_available You have to find a way to stall him.
not_available There's a helicopter waiting for me.
not_available Let it wait.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available You're the president.
not_available Aaron said the recording you had implicating the president was destroyed.
not_available Yes.
not_available Without it, you can't mount a case.
not_available I'm working with someone inside CTU.
not_available They're setting up a digital uplink.
not_available If I can get Logan to acknowledge all that he's done today, it's gonna be all the evidence we need.
not_available I need to get on that chopper.
not_available I don't see how that's gonna be possible.
not_available If Logan doesn't confess, how far are you actually willing to go? As far as I have to.
not_available Here, let me get this for you.
not_available Watch your hair.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available I got a flight suit.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Did you make it to the Secret Service outbuilding? Yeah.
not_available I think Morris and I may have a way to pull the copilot from the flight.
not_available What about the reassignment protocol? I'm working on it.
not_available Mike Novick will have to verify the pilot codes.
not_available It should take him about one minute.
not_available Chloe, hold on a second.
not_available I'm switching over to com.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I'm on the chopper.
not_available Mike Novick's going to call.
not_available Morris.
not_available Yes, sweetheart? I need you to do one more thing.
not_available Some guy from Central just called.
not_available Says your packet's messed up.
not_available I got that straightened out Monday.
not_available I guess not.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available Now? Right now.
not_available He had me patch you through to the Secret Service outbuilding.
not_available Mike.
not_available I've delayed him as long as I can.
not_available He'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available Have you heard anything from Jack Bauer yet? He should be in the Secret Service outbuilding.
not_available I'm sending him the necessary documents now.
not_available There's not much time.
not_available Yeah, Mike.
not_available Reassignment protocol and authorization should be coming through to you.
not_available You'll need both.
not_available How are we doing for time? Hurry.
not_available Hello? Hello? John.
not_available Aaron.
not_available I thought you transferred out.
not_available Not quite yet.
not_available Some guy from Central called, said my packet's all messed You'll need this.
not_available Don't worry about him.
not_available Carruth has been relieved.
not_available I guess there was something wrong with his packet.
not_available Ron Franklin.
not_available There's my protocol.
not_available This is not bad, but it needs to be more positive, like, uh Jack Bauer is on the helicopter.
not_available You have to find an excuse not to get on board.
not_available Carolyn, do you have the itinerary? Charles? Excuse me.
not_available Could I talk to you for a second? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Will you excuse us for a second? I know it sounds silly, but I didn't bring my medication and I just, I just want to have it with me.
not_available Of course.
not_available We'll send somebody back for it.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I don't want to delay you.
not_available I'll be along later.
not_available Besides, Charles, I
not_available I'm thinking that when you land, it would be better if I wasn't with you.
not_available Why? This is your moment, Charles.
not_available I
not_available I think that when you step out of that helicopter alone, after saving the country, that is an image that History will never forget.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you, Marti.
not_available But don't be far behind me, now.
not_available I won't.
not_available Captain.
not_available I can fly this thing if I have to, which leaves you with one of two choices.
not_available You either do what I say and you live, or you don't and you die for nothing.
not_available You understand me? I want you to wait until I give you my command, then follow these instructions slowly.
not_available You're going to disconnect your helmet from the communications system.
not_available Then I want you to rip out the mic cable, take your helmet off and stow it.
not_available Do it now.
not_available I'll know if you deviate from your flight plan.
not_available Mr.
not_available President! I have a message for you from the White House! What the hell are you doing?! Put these on! You.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available Do you copy? I'm here, Jack.
not_available Where are you? We just left the ranch.
not_available I have Logan with me.
not_available Is Morris standing by with the equipment? He's on his way.
not_available I'll let him know you're airborne.
not_available Make sure the pilot takes heading 28
not_available 6 for two miles, then breaks south.
not_available Captain! I want you to follow heading 28
not_available 6 for two miles, then break south.
not_available Once you break south, there should be an industrial park.
not_available There's an abandoned printing press facility that you can use.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What are you trying to do, Jack? Whatever it is, you know you won't get away with it.
not_available Are you going to kill me? I suppose you want some sort of revenge.
not_available I understand that.
not_available Bad things happened.
not_available I didn't want them to happen.
not_available People who worked for me they
not_available they went too far.
not_available They did things that they thought I wanted them to do, but they were wrong.
not_available You have to understand.
not_available I have always acted in the country's best interest.
not_available But you're just trying to get even.
not_available Do you realize what effect this will have on the American people? This day has been trying enough, and now the President is being attacked.
not_available If you want to do what's right, you will turn this thing around and go back.
not_available Damn it, Bauer, say something! 
not_available Hello.
not_available Morris.
not_available Yes, love.
not_available The helicopter is landing in an industrial park one mile due east of where you are.
not_available Head over there.
not_available Okay, now, I give this guy what we worked on, and then I'm out, right? Yes, but make sure you have him call me when you do the hand
not_available off.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Shut it down! Undo your safety belt.
not_available Move towards the door slowly.
not_available Get out now.
not_available Move! Jack, maybe we can work something out.
not_available There's still time.
not_available What do you want? I can help you get away from here with enough money to start a new life, maybe find that daughter of yours and and try to work something out.
not_available Whatever you want, it's yours.
not_available You have my word.
not_available Your word Jack, I'm the President of the United States.
not_available I'm not, I'm not carrying any weapons.
not_available Don't you make a sound.
not_available Hey.
not_available Give me the case.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available I should have known that.
not_available Modified equipment.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's President Logan, Jack.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Chloe wants you to call her.
not_available Go.
not_available Yeah, Jack? 
not_available I have him.
not_available All right.
not_available I've just checked the response deployment.
not_available You have less than ten minutes until they're on you.
not_available Fine.
not_available Listen, Jack.
not_available I don't mean to put any added pressure on you, but if you don't have a confession by then, we'll all be arrested for treason.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Is this some kind of broadcast? What is this? I would like to know.
not_available Is this an assassination? A confession.
not_available Don't count on it.
not_available I know you're good at extracting information.
not_available I know that you're good at torture.
not_available I saw what you did with Walt Cummings.
not_available I think you'll be surprised to find out that I'm a little tougher than that.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Can you hear me? Yeah, Jack.
not_available I want to make sure that you have good reception.
not_available Who you talking to? Are those your friends at CTU? You know you're putting them in danger, as well.
not_available Coming through fine, Jack.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available My people can't be far behind, Jack.
not_available There's still time to get away.
not_available Take it.
not_available The plan involving the Sentox nerve gas, it was designed to fool the terrorists and the Russians.
not_available Whether or not you formulated the plan is irrelevant.
not_available You authorized it.
not_available You're delusional.
not_available David Palmer uncovered evidence of this plan.
not_available When he started asking questions, he was assassinated.
not_available Other people were killed to cover that murder up.
not_available Men and women who served this country with distinction.
not_available People that I worked with; friends of mine.
not_available No, you're wrong.
not_available This is all a pack of lies.
not_available The terrorists discovered your deception, and they deployed Sentox nerve gas on American soil.
not_available Every American who died today as a result of terrorist activity is another murder that you're accountable for.
not_available And before you leave here, you're going to admit it.
not_available I suppose if you hurt me enough, Jack, I'll say whatever you want, but that won't make it the truth.
not_available And everybody who watches this will know that perfectly well.
not_available What are the names of your coconspirators? There are no co
not_available conspirators, because there is no Walt Cummings, Christopher Henderson, James Nathanson have all admitted to being part of this conspiracy! Now they are dead! Right before Christopher Henderson died he acknowledged that there were others! What are their names?! A man will say anything under torture.
not_available This won't mean a thing.
not_available Mr.
not_available Logan, I'm not going to torture you, but you are going to tell me what I want to know.
not_available Or so help me God, I will kill you.
not_available A year and a half ago, I was warned that my life was in danger by someone within the government.
not_available I was told the only way I could stay alive was to create the illusion that I was dead.
not_available I was forced to deceive people that I loved.
not_available My only daughter will never forgive me.
not_available As I see the depth of your corruption unfold, I have no doubt that you are that source of danger.
not_available David Palmer was a great man.
not_available And he was a great president.
not_available He was also my friend.
not_available He tried to warn me about you and now he is dead.
not_available Other people tried to help me and they are dead, too.
not_available So, Mr.
not_available Logan, I hope you understand I have absolutely nothing to lose.
not_available You are going to be held accountable for your part of everything that happened today.
not_available You are not going to be able to hide behind the presidency.
not_available Right here, right now, you are going to face justice! And make no mistake about this, this is personal.
not_available And if you think for a second that I am scared to put a bullet in your brain, you don't know me.
not_available I'm going to ask you one last time, who are your co
not_available conspirators? You have until the count of three, or I will kill you.
not_available One 
not_available You make me a martyr, I'll go down in history with Lincoln and Kennedy, but you'll go down with John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald.
not_available Is that what you want? 
not_available Two! You're a man of honor.
not_available How can you assassinate a president of the United States in front of the entire world? If you love your country, you won't pull the trigger.
not_available Three! You can't do it, can you? No, Jack, it's all right.
not_available Jack, it's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right that you can't.
not_available I'm the president.
not_available Jack, they're here.
not_available Lay flat on your stomach! Put your hands out in front of you! Extend your arms! Mr.
not_available President, are you all right? I'm fine.
not_available I actually feel sorry for that man.
not_available He's delusional.
not_available It would be better if he were put in some sort of solitary confinement for the time being.
not_available Jack Bauer wasn't able to get the President to confess, Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Why not? What happened? I'm not sure of the details.
not_available Bauer's in custody.
not_available Gentlemen.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available That will be all.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Ho God, David 
not_available Martha, please..
not_available Marti, don't do this to me now.
not_available You killed him.
not_available You killed him.
not_available Marti 
not_available You're a murderer.
not_available Stop.
not_available You are! You're a criminal! 
not_available My wife is not well.
not_available Don't you Would you please escort her? Don't you touch me! You don't know what he did! 
not_available Escort her into the hangar.
not_available He's not fit to be president! It is a sacrilege for him to be even speaking David's name! Don't you No! I want to make sure that she's all right.
not_available Has this hangar been cleared? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All secure.
not_available It's empty.
not_available Good.
not_available Let them know that I'll be back in a moment.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available You're not wearing some kind of listening device, are you? 
not_available What are you talking about? I have to watch you now, Marti.
not_available You said that I was a good liar, but I am nothing compared to you.
not_available Charles! Stop it! Okay now Marti, tell me the truth.
not_available You're hurting me.
not_available You don't know what pain is.
not_available I'm on to you, Marti.
not_available I should've seen it from the 1st, but I wanted to believe that you still cared for me.
not_available Making love to me was just a ploy, wasn't it? Took a lot of planning to get Jack Bauer on that helicopter.
not_available You were part of that plan, weren't you? It was your job to delay me, wasn't it? Wasn't it?! Please 
not_available Wasn't it?! They used you so Jack Bauer could get to me.
not_available Come on, Marti.
not_available Admit it, you were part of it.
not_available Yes.
not_available Why? Why did? Why did you help them? Because you killed David Palmer.
not_available I told you I didn't realize that was going to happen.
not_available Your people killed him to protect you.
not_available You covered it up, that's just as bad.
not_available I covered it up because I had to.
not_available Oh, and then others died to cover that up.
not_available That's right, for the good of the country.
not_available You sold nerve gas to terrorists.
not_available You're insane.
not_available I did it for the good of the country as I saw it at the time.
not_available You're such a hypocrite.
not_available After your little performance this morning, you're in no position to call me a hypocrite.
not_available And I will tell you something else if you blow up like this, one more time I will fill you so full of drugs, you won't even remember your own name.
not_available And then I will ship you off to an asylum and you can stay there for the rest of your life.
not_available Are we clear? Are we clear? Now clean yourself up, you're a mess.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, the President of The United States.
not_available My fellow Americans, this has been a terrible day in the history of this country and yet at the same time, a triumphant day, because in the end, we won a significant victory over the forces of chaos and terror.
not_available We have preserved and protected our way of life, despite the loss of innocent American lives.
not_available Today I'll start the transmission in 1 minute.
not_available Is the Attorney General there? I'm here, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I certainly hope this recording is as important as you claim it is.
not_available Chloe, what's this about? I set up a conference call with the Attorney General.
not_available He's on speakerphone now.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available I'm very serious.
not_available Mr.
not_available Attorney General, this is Karen Hayes, 
not_available Homeland Security.
not_available Bill Buchanan, CTU.
not_available Sir, I apologize.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian placed this call without 
not_available authorization from me.
not_available I'm sorry I had to do that.
not_available We had to do things under the radar to protect you all 
not_available in case things went wrong.
not_available In case what things went wrong? I think it would help if I just played the recording.
not_available What recording? It's a conversation that took place 5 minutes ago between the President and his wife.
not_available How could you possibly have a recording of something like that? Sir, an agent named Jack Bauer placed a listening device on the President shortly before this conversation.
not_available Bauer? Isn't he the one that's under arrest? 
not_available I'm playing the recording now.
not_available I don't want to listen to it.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian, at the very least, this constitutes an egregious violation of privacy, and we're talking about the President.
not_available 'cause you killed David Palmer.
not_available I told you, I didn't realize that was going to happen.
not_available Your people killed him to protect you.
not_available You covered it up, that's just as bad.
not_available I covered it up because I had to.
not_available Oh, and then others died to cover that up! That's right, for the good of the country.
not_available You sold nerve gas to terrorists.
not_available You're insane! A poet once said, "No man is an island." On a day like this, we can feel the truth of those words.
not_available Any untimely death is a tragedy.
not_available Yet some men embody such greatness of character that their death serves as a unifying force for those who remain behind.
not_available David Palmer was such a man.
not_available A great President, a great American and on a more personal note a wonderful friend.
not_available He'll be missed Holtzman.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We take this moment to remember with appreciation With all due respect, Mr.
not_available Attorney General, are you sure this isn't some kind of mistake? Yes, sir.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available I'll do exactly as you say.
not_available combination of wisdom, strength and moral courage, this country might have not survived in its present form.
not_available It's very appropriate that David Palmer will be laid to rest in Arlington Cemetery, for he was a soldier in the truest sense.
not_available He was a man whose courage rose in direct proportion to the threats his country faced.
not_available In closing, I would ask that the country observe a national day of mourning for one of the greatest Americans this nation will ever see.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Federal Marshall.
not_available Would you please come with us, sir? You came very close to disrupting my speech.
not_available On behalf of President Logan, I wish to thank you all very much for joining us.
not_available I am sorry, but out of respect for today's Those are ridiculous accusations.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available If I may, sir? You've probably never seen one of these, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available It's a micro
not_available transmitter.
not_available Agent Clark, arrest these men and get them the hell out of here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We have our orders.
not_available You take! You take your orders from me.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available After you, sir.
not_available Give me a second.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thank God you're safe.
not_available Everything is gonna be all right.
not_available Jack, when I heard you kidnapped the President I was just trying to get him to give me a direct confession.
not_available How much longer do you need to stay here? Not much longer.
not_available They can debrief me tomorrow.
not_available You sure? I can't believe you're really, you're really here.
not_available Agent Bauer, excuse me, but there's a call for you from your daughter.
not_available From my daughter? Yes, sir.
not_available A Kim Bauer.
not_available It's been put through to a land line just inside that door.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I promise.
not_available Take as long as you need.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available I love you.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Hey, Kim? Any word on Logan? My guess is he'll try to cut a deal.
not_available He'll resign without a fight in exchange for clemency.
not_available He doesn't deserve clemency.
not_available No, but the country doesn't deserve a long impeachment process, either, with everything that's happened.
not_available In any event, we can expect Hal Gordon to be sworn in as president soon.
not_available Which means this will probably be the last time I see this place.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Not if I have anything to do with it, and I will.
not_available You'll be back here running CTU.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available When I came in here last night to save the day, I was a little bit condescending and tactless, to say the least.
not_available I had no idea what you were up against.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available No need to apologize.
not_available Mistakes were made.
not_available You were right to come in with a firm hand.
not_available Well, I better go.
not_available Karen.
not_available I was thinking of getting some breakfast before going home.
not_available I have to go over to Division for one last briefing.
not_available Bureaucracy.
not_available Rain check? Sure.
not_available Chloe, really good work today.
not_available You, too.
not_available I found this in Edgar's possessions.
not_available I thought you should have it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available what's all this then? A friend of mine who died today.
not_available You, um, do you want to talk about it? Yeah? Come on.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Agent Davis, Jack Bauer's missing! Attention, all units.
not_available We have a missing agent: Jack Bauer.
not_available I repeat, we have a missing agent: Jack Bauer.
not_available Put 2 men to the lower level.
not_available Give me three men on perimeter search.
not_available Report back.
not_available You surely must be aware, Mr.
not_available Bauer, that China has a long memory.
not_available Only 18 months ago, you invaded our territory and killed our consul.
not_available Did you really think that we would forget? I know how this works.
not_available I need to make one phone call.
not_available Please just one phone call.
not_available Kill me.
not_available Just kill me.
not_available Kill you? You're far too valuable to kill, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
