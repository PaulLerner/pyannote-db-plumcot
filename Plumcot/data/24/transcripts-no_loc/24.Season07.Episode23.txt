not_available Previously on 24.
not_available TheJustice Department is investigating theJonas Hodges car bombing.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available I didn't transfer the funds.
not_available Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid? Because it's what you wanted.
not_available Am I right? Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data.
not_available Okay, we've got him.
not_available Where's the canister? I am not gonna stop until you tell me where it is.
not_available Jack.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You need to give yourself a shot.
not_available I already did, 20 minutes ago.
not_available It's not working.
not_available You heading home? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Us too.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available I'm sending a link to your phone.
not_available It's something I think you should see.
not_available Your daughter's in the company of our operatives.
not_available Put this call on your earpiece and keep the line open.
not_available I'm gonna be listening to everything you say.
not_available You will help Tony Almeida escape, or my people will murder your daughter.
not_available The following takes place between 6:00 a.m.
not_available And 7:00 a.m.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The Deputy Attorney General is ready for you, ma'am.
not_available TelePresence call is initiated.
not_available Network is secure.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Good morning, Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available Thank you for giving up your time for this investigation.
not_available Of course.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Rollins, Mr.
not_available Hock are from theJustice Department.
not_available They'll be conducting your interview.
not_available Let the record show that this is to be the testimony of Olivia Taylor acting White House chief of staff regarding the homicide of federal witness Jonas Hodges.
not_available Let it also show that I am present to ensure that strict protocols be followed for Ms.
not_available Taylor's protection.
not_available Why would I need protecting? 
not_available Uh, poor choice of words.
not_available I merely meant that your questioning is just a formality.
not_available We have to go through everyone who had knowledge of Hodges's whereabouts until the bombing.
not_available I see.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Rollins, you have the floor.
not_available Let's begin.
not_available I wanted Olivia in this briefing.
not_available Where is she? I'm sorry, ma'am, but she's tied up with the Deputy A.G.
not_available And investigators Iooking into the Hodges murder.
not_available Have they made any progress on who leaked Hodges's location? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available But they agree that the list of people who knew Hodges was alive and at F.B.I.
not_available Is short.
not_available The leak had to come from inside.
not_available Good morning, everyone.
not_available Good morning, Madam President.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Please take your seats.
not_available I realize that we are all in dire need of sleep but I felt that it was vital to bring you all up to speed on the events of the past few hours and a greater crisis we face on the horizon.
not_available Less than 30 minutes ago, the F.B.I.
not_available Managed to recover the last canister of the bioweapon.
not_available But I'm afraid that the danger is far from over.
not_available Before his death, Jonas Hodges told us that there were other parties involved with him in the creation of this bioweapon
not_available a highly secret and extremely powerful group of private military firms collaborating to undermine the government of this country.
not_available Excuse me, Madam President but which military firms are we talking about? We don't know, Admiral.
not_available Hodges gave us no names or idea of which companies are involved but whoever they are, they represent a very real and ongoing threat.
not_available Now, we don't have much actionable intelligence at this point.
not_available However, the F.B.I.
not_available Has apprehended former C.T.U.
not_available Operative Tony Almeida.
not_available He is a key figure in this plot someone we hope will be able to help us uncover who these people are.
not_available Agent Walker, this is air support Bravo 3.
not_available We're in position.
not_available Your convoy's in sight.
not_available Roger that, Bravo 3.
not_available Metro will be controlling traffic and setting up a secure corridor through downtown.
not_available We'll be bringing Almeida in to headquarters through the west entrance.
not_available It's almost time, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available The convoy you're traveling with is about to get off on the l
not_available 70.
not_available You'll need to break off before you reach the downtown exit or you'll lose your chance to facilitate an escape for Tony.
not_available For your daughter's sake you don't want that to happen.
not_available Now listen carefully.
not_available You'll need to commandeer the van and peel onto the Taft Street exit in about four miles.
not_available I'll direct you further once you've managed this.
not_available Remember, my operatives are with your daughter.
not_available In fact, I'm looking at her right now, so don't try to be a hero.
not_available Something wrong? It's starting to look like the flight is gonna be full.
not_available And I'm on standby.
not_available Oh, no, you're gonna get on.
not_available There have to be some people that are too spooked to fly after those planes went down yesterday.
not_available Bob, did you have to bring that up? I'm just saying! Look, I think it makes us safer.
not_available They're gonna take extra precautions.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available A re those yours? 
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Would you mind, so my mother could sit down, please? Oh.
not_available Sure.
not_available Oh! You're bleeding.
not_available What? 
not_available You have a scratch on your neck.
not_available Honey! That must have happened when the door hit you getting out of the cab.
not_available Oh, well, yI'll just go to the newsstand and see if they have some Band
not_available Aids.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I'm getting worried.
not_available It's only a matter of time before that F.B.I.
not_available Agent's body's discovered and I think Bauer's daughter is getting suspicious.
not_available Look, I gave Bauer a short window to deliver Tony to me.
not_available It won't be long.
not_available Just stand by until you hear from me.
not_available And what if Kim Bauer makes us before then? You can't allow yourselves to be taken.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available Agent Walker, let me see your comm unit.
not_available I want to adjust its frequency.
not_available It's interrupting mine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Don't move! 
not_available Jack.
not_available Just keep driving and no one gets hurt.
not_available Both of you, I want you to slowly draw your weapons 
not_available put them on the floor and slide them to me.
not_available Jack
not_available Do it! Don't make this harder than it already is.
not_available Give me your weapon, or I will kill him.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available You're not gonna kill anyone.
not_available Give me your weapon! Now! Driver, I want you to handcuff yourself to the steering wheel.
not_available Over and under.
not_available Do it now.
not_available You're gonna exit the freeway when I tell you.
not_available Until then, I want you to maintain speed.
not_available Now! 
not_available Agent Walker, what's happening? Agent Walker! 
not_available Comm, the prisoner transport has split from the convoy.
not_available Renee, it's Janis.
not_available Do you read me? Renee! 
not_available Are you reading me? Agent Walker, what's your 20? Agent Walker, please respond.
not_available Jack, why? 
not_available They've got my daughter.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available I deployed Agent Franks to watch over her like you asked.
not_available Agent Franks is dead.
not_available The people that are working with Tony have operatives with Kim right now.
not_available Jack.
not_available They've threatened to kill her if I don't break him out.
not_available Jack, that's enough! 
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Okay.
not_available We're on Taft.
not_available What now? 
not_available You'll see the entrance to the Connecticut Avenue tunnel.
not_available Take the north lane.
not_available Continue down this street.
not_available Go towards the tunnel, north.
not_available Aerial Bravo 3, do you still have a visual? 
not_available Affirmative.
not_available The follow vehicles in the convoy are getting off at the next exit and will be doubling back.
not_available I've got prisoner transport on satellite.
not_available They're heading west on Hudson.
not_available Wait.
not_available They're pulling into the Connecticut Avenue tunnel.
not_available I'm losing visual.
not_available Repeat: I am losing visual.
not_available Pull up the transponder locators.
not_available Yep.
not_available Okay, we're in the tunnel.
not_available You'll see me parked in the emergency lane about a quarter mile in.
not_available I want you to pull behind that S.U.V.
not_available [Engine Shuts Off Jack, please.
not_available I understand your reasons, but you can't do this.
not_available No, what I can't do is risk Kim's life.
not_available UncuffTony.
not_available Give me the keys.
not_available You cuff her.
not_available I'll take him.
not_available They have a camera on Kim.
not_available I don't trust Tony to let her go.
not_available Please, I am begging you, do whatever you have to to save her.
not_available Please.
not_available Jack.
not_available The gun.
not_available Cuff yourself.
not_available Come on.
not_available What are you bringing Bauer for? Tony, I've done everything you've asked.
not_available Just let Kim go.
not_available Let her go! 
not_available Get in the car.
not_available So what are you doing, Tony? We don't need a hostage, okay, especially not him.
not_available Shoot him already, and let's get out of here.
not_available You're not seeing the big picture, Cara.
not_available Your people are gonna be able to launch their biological attacks just as they originally planned.
not_available How? We lost the canister.
not_available We don't have the pathogen anymore.
not_available We haveJack.
not_available The pathogen's in his blood.
not_available It's in his organs.
not_available We'll be able to harvest everything we need from his body.
not_available Why do you think I had you put those operatives on Kim Bauer? Your people are still gonna need proof thatJack's viable.
not_available Have one of your biochemists meet us at the complex.
not_available Let's begin with the confidential document on the left hand side of the packet.
not_available Take a moment to look that over.
not_available Thank you again for coming.
not_available You can thank me, Agent Pierce by telling me what this is all about.
not_available All right, sir, but we don't have much time.
not_available You implied it had something to do with Olivia Taylor.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available A few hours ago, Jonas Hodges was killed outside F.B.I.
not_available Headquarters.
not_available My God.
not_available Now, authorities believe he was murdered to keep him from implicating others who were involved in the bioweapon attacks but I suspect there may be another scenario and I have reason to believe that Ms.
not_available Taylor might be involved.
not_available That is an outrageous accusation, Agent Pierce.
not_available Olivia is capable of many things but I can't believe committing murder is one of them.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin, please just hear me out.
not_available After the president agreed to a witness protection deal for Hodges Ms.
not_available Taylor made a comment to me about wanting to see Hodges dead.
not_available He was responsible for her brother's death.
not_available She was venting.
not_available I thought so too until she met in her office with an old colleague of hers, a man named Martin Collier.
not_available I know Collier.
not_available Then you know the sort of man he is.
not_available I do, but none of this constitutes proof of complicity.
not_available No, sir.
not_available That's why I need you to access the digital recording system
not_available to see if their conversation was recorded.
not_available Agent, you're asking me to break into an office that's no longer mine and access classified recordings of the acting chief of staff.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin, if my suspicions prove correct you, of all people, understand how grave these consequences would be.
not_available Sir, Ms.
not_available Taylor's behavior over the past several hours has been erratic at best.
not_available Now, she's with theJustice Department investigators now, and we don't have much time.
not_available Sir, I need you to decide if you're gonna help me.
not_available If you could just again review the records on the screen below, Ms.
not_available Taylor I want to confirm that during the timeline in question you had no outside contact other than what's reflected in the phone and Internet logs you uploaded to us.
not_available For the third time, that's correct.
not_available We're just trying to be thorough, ma'am.
not_available I think we've taken up enough of your valuable time, Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available Thank you for, uh, indulging us.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Good luck with the rest of the investigation.
not_available She's coming.
not_available Sir.
not_available She's on her way.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor, I tried to get word to you but was told you were not to be disturbed.
not_available Word to me about what? 
not_available Let me explain.
not_available Good morning, Olivia.
not_available Ethan.
not_available What are you doing here? I'd forgotten some files when I cleared out my office, so Secret Service was kind enough to admit me so I could retrieve them.
not_available May I see them? Nothing terribly important.
not_available But I like to fully archive my memos for, uh, posterity.
not_available You understand.
not_available So you have what you came for.
not_available Um, I think so.
not_available Well, then if you'll excuse me
not_available Of course.
not_available Agent Pierce.
not_available Stay a moment, please.
not_available What was he doing here? 
not_available Ma'am? Kanin.
not_available Did you observe him while he was in my office? Is something wrong, ma'am? Yes.
not_available Yes, something is wrong.
not_available No one, and I mean no one is to be allowed in my office without
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor, could I get someone on staff to help you with that? 
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor
not_available Security? This is Olivia Taylor.
not_available Ethan Kanin is on his way out of the White House.
not_available I want him taken into custody.
not_available Detain him until I arrive.
not_available Ma'am, what's happened? He stole my property, Aaron.
not_available Sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kanin! Mr.
not_available Kanin! Yes? 
not_available We have orders to detain you, sir.
not_available Orders from whom? From the acting chief of staff, sir.
not_available Please come with us.
not_available Sir.
not_available Command, this is Walker.
not_available Janis, do you read me? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is happening? 
not_available Jack commandeered the transport.
not_available He was forced into helping Tony escape.
not_available Renee, it's Chloe.
not_available What do you mean, "forced'"? The group Almeida's working for threatened to kill Kim Bauer if he didn't cooperate.
not_available They have Kim? According toJack, they have operatives with her at the airport but I don't think she's aware of that.
not_available Do you want me to contact airport P.D.
not_available No.
not_available We can't move on these people until we know who they are.
not_available Chloe, I need you to patch me in directly to Kim's departure gate.
not_available She's at Gate 7.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available I'll brief the White House and let them know what's happened.
not_available I'll call when I'm on my way.
not_available I have a priority one emergency call from F.B.I.
not_available Please connect me with an agent at Gate 7.
not_available [Woman On P.A.
not_available Attention, passengers for Flight 147, nonstop to Los Angeles.
not_available Maintenance crews have finished preparing the aircraft and we should be ready to begin boarding in approximately 10 minutes.
not_available Thank you again for your patience.
not_available Would the following standby ticket holders please report to the ticket agent counter
not_available Marissa Boily, Kim Bauer, Robert Leighton.
not_available Well, looks like I got on the flight.
not_available Told you you would.
not_available [Man On P.A.
not_available Passengers on Flight 678 and pending for Indianapolis we do apologize for the delay at this time.
not_available [Man On P.A.
not_available Continues, Indistinct.]
not_available Kim Bauer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll take you over here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Phone call for you.
not_available Hello? Kim, this is Renee Walker.
not_available Listen carefully.
not_available Try not to react and do not look around.
not_available You're in danger.
not_available You're being watched by operatives sent by Tony Almeida.
not_available Tony? I don't understand.
not_available He's involved with the people responsible for the attacks.
not_available We had him in custody, but he used you as leverage to force your father to break him out.
not_available I don't believe that Tony would do something like that.
not_available He's on the run, Kim.
not_available He's taken your father hostage.
not_available You've got to trust me on this.
not_available I'm on my way with a team to you now, but we have to I.D.
not_available The people who are watching you.
not_available They're our only lead to finding your father and Tony.
not_available There was a man that was staring at me earlier but I haven't seen him in a while.
not_available Describe him.
not_available He was Hispanic.
not_available Medium build.
not_available He had short brown hair.
not_available He was wearing a suit.
not_available That was Agent Franks.
not_available Your father had me deploy him to the airport to make sure you got on the plane safely.
not_available He was killed by the people following you.
not_available Listen, Kim.
not_available Whoever these operatives are, they're in close proximity to you.
not_available Your father told me they sent him a live feed to prove they had you in their sights.
not_available Have you noticed anyone with a camera or cell phone? Or a laptop? 
not_available What? There's a couple that I've been talking to.
not_available They're sitting right next to me.
not_available The man has an open laptop right in front of me.
not_available Can you give me a description? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's got long hair, he's tallKim? Kim, what's wrong? 
not_available Oh, well, I appreciate that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Please let baggage claim know that I will be much more careful next time.
not_available Kim? Chloe, do you read me? 
not_available I'm here.
not_available The operatives may be moving on Kim.
not_available A lert airport police.
not_available Have them lock down the terminal.
not_available Tell airport security to maintain patrols.
not_available Do nothing to arouse suspicion.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available We saw you were on the phone.
not_available We thought there might be a problem.
not_available You need some help? No.
not_available There's no problem.
not_available I left my electric toothbrush on in my luggage.
not_available So the airline called and said they broke my lock.
not_available Nice.
not_available You get your boarding pass? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available It's right here.
not_available There was a little security problem with her luggage.
not_available Guess they can never be too careful.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available This is the first time that I've been apart from my little girl.
not_available I'm just a little anxious to get back to see her.
not_available Would you like to see a picture of her? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Got one in here.
not_available Here it is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where is Here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Her name's Teri.
not_available She's adorable.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Look at this.
not_available So cute.
not_available That's my husband, actually.
not_available This is
not_available Aww.
not_available Take her.
not_available Let me go! 
not_available Code two! Code two! Suspects are armed! Get down! 
not_available Walker.
not_available It's Kim Bauer.
not_available Security's down.
not_available Where are the airport police? They're mobilizing to you now.
not_available What about the operatives? The woman is dead.
not_available The man is getting away.
not_available Kim, we need him to find your father.
not_available What direction was he headed? 
not_available Agent Walker! 
not_available Damn it! 
not_available Kim? Kim! Let's go! Let's go! 
not_available Olivia.
not_available I always liked that about you, Ethan.
not_available Even when I was a little girl, you always stood up when I came into the room.
not_available Old habits die hard.
not_available You removed something from my office.
not_available I want it back.
not_available I told you before, you're welcome to them.
not_available You know damn well I'm not talking about those files.
not_available Do I? Ethan, I found the digital recorder.
not_available Now give me what you took or I'll order the security officers outside this door to strip
not_available search you.
not_available All right.
not_available I do have a recording.
not_available It's a personal account of my last days in service to this administration and I think I'm entitled to it.
not_available No one is entitled to take sensitive material out of the White House.
not_available Oh now it's national security you're worried about.
not_available As a matter of fact, yes.
not_available Well, I still have my clearances.
not_available Why don't we listen to the recording together? You're in no position to dictate terms, Ethan.
not_available You're in violation of at least 10 federal laws.
not_available What are you so afraid of, Olivia? What's on there that's so incriminating? I'm not the one facing incrimination.
not_available You are.
not_available But give me the recording right now and I'll see to it no charges are filed.
not_available Last chance, Ethan.
not_available Search him for a data card.
not_available I'm being held without cause.
not_available I demand to speak to President Taylor.
not_available It was the president who ordered his detention.
not_available If that's true, I want to hear it from her directly.
not_available Well, this is a criminal matter now.
not_available Considering her personal relationship with Mr.
not_available Kanin the president doesn't deem it appropriate to intrude on the investigation.
not_available Please stand up, Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available Arms up.
not_available You're making a terrible mistake.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor is grossly overstepping her authority.
not_available Thank you, Agent.
not_available Process him out.
not_available Come with me, Mr.
not_available Kanin.
not_available I don't think you understand the seriousness of what you're doing.
not_available I don't think you do.
not_available Agent Hobson.
not_available I can take him the rest of the way.
not_available Fine.
not_available She's definitely hiding something, Agent Pierce.
not_available Lucky for us, I'm a paranoid son of a bitch.
not_available May I ask what was on the other data card? Nothing.
not_available It's blank.
not_available I can try to get you into the communications office so you can listen to that.
not_available Too risky.
not_available And unnecessary.
not_available I have a companion device to the recorder in my car.
not_available Well, it sounds like you were, uh, expecting this.
not_available One has to be prepared when you're dealing with Olivia.
not_available I'll let you know what I find.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available What are you doing? We're gonna use you to reconstitute the bioweapon, Jack.
not_available Put him on the table, face down.
not_available How long till we know? 
not_available It depends.
not_available On what? On the levels of pathogen in his spinal fluid.
not_available Give me a time frame.
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available Good.
not_available Get started.
not_available Tony.
not_available Tony! To
not_available We've gotta give him something to control the seizure.
not_available I need him completely immobilized.
not_available There we go.
not_available I'll contact the group as soon as we know if Bauer's viable.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, I need to talk to you first.
not_available What is it? I want a larger role in the organization, and I think this is a good time to make my case.
not_available Tony, we've gone over this before.
not_available Okay? It's not how it works.
not_available You don't ask in.
not_available You're invited in.
not_available All right, then get me an invitation.
not_available Look, after what I've done today, I think I've earned it.
not_available You have been resourceful, it's true.
not_available Still
not_available Look.
not_available I know you talk to the top guy.
not_available All's I'm asking is that you get us in the same room together.
not_available I'll sell myself.
not_available I don't think that would be the right approach.
not_available Why not? Because he's careful to a fault, Tony and he's very protective of his anonymity.
not_available I can appreciate that.
not_available But the bottom line is, without me this operation never happens.
not_available Now, you have influence over him.
not_available He trusts you.
not_available You can convince him.
not_available I've seen you do it before.
not_available This is different.
not_available That's right.
not_available It is different.
not_available This time it's for me.
not_available I'm ready to extract the spinal fluid.
not_available Hold his head still.
not_available All right.
not_available He knows, Martin.
not_available I'm telling you.
not_available No, Olivia, he doesn't.
not_available Worst case, he has a suspicion.
not_available He never actually had the time to listen to the recording, did he? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available And he never will, because you destroyed the data card, right? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Then we're fine, all right, so long as you keep thinking clearly and don't panic.
not_available You're forgetting, I ended this man's career, Martin.
not_available He won't let me off the hook.
not_available Ever.
not_available You're the president's daughter, okay? Trust me.
not_available No one will come after you without hard evidence, least of all Ethan Kanin.
not_available Olivia.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available President's been looking for you.
not_available She needs you in the Oval Office.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available A situation unfolding at the airport involving Tony Almeida.
not_available We're about to be briefed, and she wants you in on it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Everything all right? Yes.
not_available Fine.
not_available We need help over here! Stand back.
not_available Did you see which way he went? 
not_available It was chaos.
not_available There were people running everywhere
not_available Janis, it's Renee.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available The male operative remains at large.
not_available Kim Bauer is missing.
not_available Either she went after him or she's a hostage.
not_available Issue a priority alert across all channels.
not_available Yep, that's it.
not_available We got it.
not_available We're on our way back up.
not_available Officer, my name is Kim Bauer.
not_available I followed the man that shot up the terminal.
not_available You need to contact Special Agent Renee Walker with the F.B.I.
not_available Kim Bauer.
not_available Kim, it's Renee.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I've got him.
not_available He's in the south parking garage.
not_available Are you in visual contact? 
not_available No.
not_available He's on one of the upper levels.
not_available I'm at the exit.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're coming towards you.
not_available Hurry! 
not_available Hang on.
not_available Help is on the way.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available No! 
not_available Move! Move! Move! 
not_available Go! Go! Go! 
not_available Kim! You're hurt.
not_available Let me see your arm.
not_available No, listen to me, Renee.
not_available That laptop has the camera they were using to track me.
not_available With a D
not_available 11 inverse router we may be able to backtrace the signal to the people that have my father.
not_available I worked at C.T.U.
not_available Systems analyst.
not_available Is there anyone back at your office that can help us with this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've got Chloe O'Brian standing by.
not_available Get her on the phone.
not_available [Audio Fast
not_available forwarding.]
not_available Once this happens, once it goes through, you can never go back.
not_available You will live with it for the rest of your life.
not_available I don't need a lecture on conscience from you, of all people.
not_available I have thought this through.
not_available What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this.
not_available He has to pay for what he did.
not_available The virus load is even higher than we hoped for.
not_available Ten
not_available plus in spinal fluid alone.
not_available Not enough to reconstitute the pathogen, of course.
not_available We'll still need his organs for that.
not_available He doesn't look too good.
not_available How much longer does he have? Couple of hours, give or take.
not_available And what happens if he dies before we extract the pathogen? Obviously, it's optimal to keep the host alive but the pathogen can survive up to two hours after death, sometimes even longer.
not_available In fact, the only sure way to destroy it is by exposure to extreme temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius.
not_available Make sure you put that in your report.
not_available I have.
not_available And I've already uploaded it to your computer.
not_available Good.
not_available Get him ready to move.
not_available Get the stretcher.
not_available Bauer is viable, but you'll need to secure a facility.
not_available That won't be a problem as long as you're absolutely certain that we can accomplish this.
not_available We've already done the hard part, Alan.
not_available And from what I understand, with the proper equipment the actual extraction and bioengineering is fairly straightforward.
not_available Okay, Cara.
not_available I'll contact the others.
not_available Good work.
not_available They should know they have Almeida to thank for this.
not_available He's the one who realized Bauer was a possible source.
not_available Relay my gratitude.
not_available I think you should consider going farther than that.
not_available "Farther"? What did you have in mind? Tony believes in what we're doing.
not_available He wants to play a larger role.
not_available That sounds premature to me.
not_available The thing is, Alan, if we don't make a significant gesture I'm afraid we may lose him.
not_available I don't even know this man, Cara.
not_available Then you should get to know him.
not_available Are you suggesting I meet with him? Look, all I'm saying is that he would be a very useful voice in the mix.
not_available His field experience fills a knowledge gap in regards to our logistics and planning.
not_available Coming from you, that's a hell of a recommendation.
not_available There's no one better, Alan.
not_available And it's not as if you haven't vetted every other member of the group.
not_available Maybe it is time that he and I met.
not_available I could be there, where you are, in the next half hour.
not_available You're coming here? I think it would be a good idea if I supervised Bauer's transfer myself Make the others feel at ease, don't you think? But, Cara, I'll look Almeida in the eye and if for any reason I don't like what I see
not_available You understand.
not_available I can't let him walk out of that meeting alive.
not_available I understand.
not_available He wants to meet you.
not_available He'll be here in a little while.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's up to you now.
not_available Wheel the gurney closer.
not_available Get that.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available He's gone! Come on! 
not_available He's too weak to have gotten very far.
not_available Cover the north exit.
not_available I'll go this way.
