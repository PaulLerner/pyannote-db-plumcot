not_available OK, what did Wieland want? 
not_available I think he's putting it together, sir.
not_available How can he? I just found out myself less than an hour ago.

not_available We won't have time to separate them once we get there.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available That's Jack.
not_available Are you outta your mind bringing him here today? He used to work with us, Dave.
not_available What the hell is that supposed to mean, Eddie? I used to work for Joe.
not_available I just did a nickel for him up in Gainesville.
not_available That's what it means.
not_available Oh
not_available oh.
not_available Is that a fact? And he happens to show up today of all days? I'm not buying this, Eddie.
not_available He did a solid for Joe.
not_available He took care of Goren, Dave.
not_available Well, if he can get to Goren, he must be 
not_available Hey, Eddie.
not_available Look, man, I just need to speakto Joe, OK? Then I'm outta here.
not_available I hear you, Jack.
not_available If he's stayin', I'm checkin' him out.
not_available Don'tyou have something to do, Dave? I'll bird
not_available dog his records in two minutes.
not_available Don'tyou think it's worth two minutes considering what's about to happen? Check it out.
not_available Have a seat, Jack.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack what? 
not_available Roush.
not_available Rous
not_available h.
not_available He's in.
not_available They just went online.
not_available They're checking Jack's background.
not_available Already? The network addresses aren't ready.
not_available Better send it to me now.
not_available Tony, did you backfill those Gainesville end dates? 
not_available Notyet.
not_available I need them now.
not_available They're looking for it.
not_available These guys don't waste time.
not_available I can't believe they got in so quickly.
not_available You want me to stuff some data in? 
not_available They want this now.
not_available I'm gonna forge their server portal and hope they don't looktoo closely.
not_available I'm not finding any release documents on this guy.
not_available What does that mean, Dave? That means he's lying.
not_available That's what it means.
not_available Keep lookin'.
not_available Listen, Jack, if this time you did in Gainesville doesn't check out, I won't letyou walk outta here.
not_available It's gonna check out, Eddie.
not_available Anything? No.
not_available Come on.
not_available Tony, I need it.
not_available OK, I got it.
not_available Hold on, hold on.
not_available It's still looking.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available I think I found it.
not_available Yeah, here it is.
not_available It just took a little longer to come up than I thought it would.
not_available Told you it would check out.
not_available You almost made me shoot a friend, Dave.
not_available I'm sorry about that, Jack.
not_available You still got that '64 Mustang? No, the lawyers got that.
not_available Eric.
not_available Are we narrowing things down at all? I mean, are we making any headway? 
not_available It's too soon to tell.
not_available Too soon? Aren't we assuming that this bomb could go off at any moment? What can I say? I've never been sanguine about our chances of stopping it.
not_available Not with just a few hours' warning.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? 
not_available I'm not giving up, sir.
not_available Every protocol is being followed, every resource tapped.
not_available But I would give serious thought to your plan of action if in fact we have a detonation.
not_available I still feel a discussion with the Pentagon this morning is in order.
not_available Fine.
not_available Thanks, Eric.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Come in.
not_available I just spoke with Jenny.
not_available I'm afraid we have a problem.
not_available What now? 
not_available Ron Wieland.
not_available He's convinced the networkto give him a 10
not_available minute live report today at noon.
not_available For what? He's heard the alert condition has changed and thatyou are managing a situation.
not_available Dammit.
not_available He's going live based on what? 
not_available Jenny doesn't know, sir.
not_available But I'm assuming that he will avoid the facts and present the rumour.
not_available I'm sorry, Lynne.
not_available I'm not mad atyou.
not_available There's no need to apologise, sir.
not_available How would you like to proceed? Set up a private interview in 10 minutes with Mr Wieland.
not_available The condition is no one's to know.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available And, Lynne GetArmus over here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Hey, man.

not_available The guy's a moron.
not_available What did Joe say? 
not_available Joe's busy.
not_available Maybe tomorrow, bro.
not_available I just need to see him for five minutes.
not_available We got this thing going down today, Jack, so swing by tomorrow around four.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available That's cool.
not_available It's good to see you, man.
not_available Good luck.
not_available It's time, Dave.
not_available Mason.
not_available George, it's me.
not_available Did you get to Wald yet? 
not_available Notyet.
not_available His crew are shutting me out.
not_available George, you gotta pickthese guys up.
not_available Why? They're packing charges.
not_available They're involved.
not_available If we pick 'em up, are they gonna lead us to Wald in time? I don't know.
not_available Well, stick with them until they do.
not_available NSA just upgraded his probable role in today's threat.
not_available Put him just a click away from the Second Wave terrorists.
not_available OK, I'll try and figure something out.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Mr Mason? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've opened up that socket to Division you askedfor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available George, where are you going? 
not_available Bakersfield.
not_available What for? Following up on a lead.
not_available We're short
not_available handed today so I gotta cover it myself.
not_available Peter's assigned to Bakersfield.
not_available I put him on something else.
not_available What? 
not_available I don't have to tell you that.
not_available Well, I guess I disagree.
not_available I mean, if you're just trying to get outside the blast radius Who the hell do you think you are? Do you have access to my information? 
not_available No, George, I don't.
not_available Then keep your mouth shut and do your job.
not_available Get down! 
not_available I feel funny.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available My head hurts.

not_available I'll be right back.
not_available This is Burton.
not_available Hi, it's Kate Warner.
not_available Did you get something for me? 
not_available No, I couldn't get his wallet.
not_available There are only a few things we can use to check out his connection to this guy Ali.
not_available Actually, a passport would be ideal.
not_available I don't think he carries that around.
not_available It's gotta be around somewhere.
not_available Check his briefcase.
not_available Look in his car.
not_available Ralph, I can't just steal his passport.
not_available You won't have to.
not_available Just write down the countries that have been stampedfor entry over the last six months.
not_available Let me know, OK? Kate! What are you doing? 
not_available l, uh Craig said more vans were coming and they needed the space.
not_available How you gonna drive it without the key?

not_available My car won't start.
not_available Well, take a cab.
not_available Beat it.
not_available You need to learn to mind your own business.
not_available Hey, Eddie.
not_available What? I hope this job isn't too important.
not_available Junior here packed your fuses too tight.
not_available There's no way it'll blow.
not_available He's a joke.
not_available See what I'm telling ya? Agh! Jack! It's broken.
not_available He just broke my ankle.
not_available You broke his damn ankle, Jack.
not_available He shouldn't have been playing with adults.
not_available This is the 911 emergency operator.
not_available Please stay on the line.
not_available Who are you calling, Kim? The police are looking for you for kidnapping my daughter.
not_available Let go of me.
not_available All right.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not gonna hurt Megan.
not_available I promise.
not_available I know it was wrong of me to push Carla, but I have been under a lot of pressure lately.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available I'm not a bad person.
not_available OK? You were right to take Megan away from that situation.
not_available I would have done the same thing.
not_available But, listen I'm her father, OK? I need to apologise to her and tell her that she doesn't have to be afraid of me.
not_available You understand that, right? Yeah.
not_available Where is she? Why don'tyou go home and talkto Carla? If it's OK with her, I'll bring back Megan.
not_available You don't tell me what to do, OK? 
not_available I'm not You don't tell me what to do.
not_available Tell me where my daughter is! Tell me where my daughter is, Kim! Tell me! And the last entry is Frankfurt, May 19th.
not_available Great.
not_available That's a big help.
not_available So what does that tell us? We'll compare Reza's travel dates with Syed Ali's.
not_available See if we can find a terrorist connection.
not_available Um OK.
not_available Yes, that would be great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There's the bride.
not_available Reza's parents are coming in early, so I called Brent's and I ordered lunch.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll pick it up.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I finally feel like everything is under control.
not_available Kate What?

not_available For being the maid of honour, for helping me with the wedding, for being my big sister.
not_available Marie 
not_available I love you.
not_available Oh, honey.
not_available Oh, I love you too.
not_available Now, get to work.
not_available Ron.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Come in.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available Can I offer you anything? Oh, no, thank you, sir.
not_available I understand you're about to go live with a story today.
not_available Just what is ityou think is going on? I thinkthe alert condition has been elevated and you don't want us to knowthat, sir.
not_available You think? Do you want me to tell you my sources? You know I can't do that.
not_available You're barking up the wrong tree, Ron.
not_available I don't recall the last time a journalist got a private interview with the president on a few minutes' notice.
not_available So my 22 years in the business tells me I'm barking up the right tree.
not_available I tell you what, Ron.
not_available There's gonna be a briefing tomorrow.
not_available If you want a 30
not_available minute jump, I can arrange it.
not_available Why are you horse
not_available trading with me? Because if you go live with a story about unsubstantiated threats, you will cause mass hysteria.
not_available That could be worse than the threat itself.
not_available So there is a threat.
not_available Ron we get them every day.
not_available So you want me to sit on this, even though it's my professional right to take what I've got on the air? Ron, you know me.
not_available I've been more forthcoming with the press and public than any politician you know.
not_available So when I ask you for a favour, I do it in the spirit of what's best for the American people.
not_available Let me think about it.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available Thank you, Ron.
not_available Armus.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I think we're gonna have to deal with this.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr Wieland, I'm Richard Armus.
not_available I'm with the president's Secret Service Blue Unit.
not_available There's something the president wants you to see before you go.
not_available It won't take more than a few minutes.
not_available Let go of my arm.
not_available You haven't changed much, have you, Jack? What's your point? 
not_available I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule.
not_available I'm looking for work.
not_available This isn't a job.
not_available You're gonna do this for nothing, Jack.
not_available My price is a thousand a day.
not_available Well, Jack, I'd say you owe me a bit more than that for whatyou did to Dave.
not_available You do this, I don't tell Joe.
not_available You don't do it, you'll be too busy lookin' over your shoulder to find work.
not_available What's the job? 
not_available You're gonna like it.
not_available Megan Megan.
not_available Megan! Megan! Megan! Megan! No! Megan! No! Megan! Megan! Yeah, we're right on schedule.
not_available We'll talkto you in about an hour.
not_available All right, that's great.
not_available Rock out.
not_available Where are we goin'? 
not_available West LA.
not_available What are we doin'? 
not_available A conversion.
not_available What do you mean? Well, today we're turning a government building into a cemetery.
