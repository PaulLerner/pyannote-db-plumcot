
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Welcome to the first of three debates between President David Palmer, and Senator John Keeler.
not_available My office has just learned, that the woman with whom the President is currently involved: Dr.
not_available Anne Packard is being accused of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial.
not_available Did the President know of these accusations and choose to ignore them? Kim, your dad's trying to break out Salazar.
not_available When's the last time you heard from him? About half an hour ago.
not_available He asked me to issue a transfer order for Ramon Salazar.
not_available And you did it? 
not_available Yeah, he said that Salazar needed to be moved.
not_available But now you're telling me this isn't true.
not_available No Kim, I'm sorry your dad lied to you.
not_available What's gonna happen to him? The best way out of this whole situation is to find Kyle Singer.
not_available Then your dad'll give up Salazar.
not_available What are you doing? There is no way out of here.
not_available If I die, the virus is dying with me.
not_available Wait! No! I got it, a patrol car just found the truck Kyle Singer was in.
not_available Hype this into the teams on stand
not_available by.
not_available Assume everyone on site is contagious and use level 1 CDC protocol.
not_available If I get out of this thing, you're gonna have to trust me.
not_available Chase! 
not_available What are you doing Jack? I've got to get Salazar in the air in that chopper in the next 60 seconds or a hundred thousand of people will die.
not_available You choose.
not_available This is Warden Mithell, I want all teams to stand down, I repeat, stand down! Congratulations! Now you are an even bigger enemy to your country than I am.
not_available The following takes place between 6:00 P.M.
not_available and 7:00 P.M.
not_available Do we have enough fuel to get to Mexico? 
not_available We're not going to Mexico.
not_available What do you mean? Why not? If we make a run for the border, they'll just try and force us down.
not_available You're gonna have to trust me.
not_available Field office, O'Brian? 
not_available Chloe, it's Chase.
not_available Jack disarmed his locator but the military should have him on radar by now.
not_available They're feeding us the stream now Chase, I'm sending it to you.
not_available He just banked.
not_available He's heading west towards downtown.
not_available Downtown.
not_available He knows they can't shoot him down over a populated area.
not_available We may be able to override what he did to his com unit through an emergency hailing frequency.
not_available We have to get through to him Chloe.
not_available We gotta let him know we found Kyle Singer.
not_available On it.
not_available Major Blanchard, this is Ryan Chappelle, what's the status of your pursuit craft? I have 2 helicopters that have just taken off from down here.
not_available How quickly will they intercept? 
not_available Well that's changed.
not_available Bauer just turned, he's no longer heading south toward us.
not_available Where is he heading? Looks like he's heading towards the city At he's current speed it will take us 10 minutes before we get within range.
not_available You go to force him down, even shoot him down if it comes to that.
not_available But we can't do that while he's over the city without incurring serious collateral damage.
not_available Then you have to do it before he gets to the city, if he lands, they'll be difficult to catch.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Keep this line open.
not_available Michelle, I'm taking over for Tony, Division wants a senior officer in charge of CTU.
not_available Give me an update.
not_available We're trying to make contact with the Chopper.
not_available Now that we have Kyle Singer and the virus has been contained, we need to contact Jack, let him know that the attempted escape of Salazar is pointless.
not_available Ok, assemble all the department heads in the conference area, I want everyone on the same page.
not_available What about C
not_available Band? It's a SWAT chopper.
not_available They wouldn't be using those frequencies.
not_available Adam, tie up whatever you're doing, we have a briefing in the conference area in two.
not_available Kim, over here.
not_available What do you need? I need you to anchor this list for Chloe, while she is trying to find an admitting channel for the Chopper.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Sorry, I lost it in your dad's office.
not_available It's ok.
not_available Did you tell Michelle about the drug you found in there? Yeah.
not_available What are they gonna do? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Everything came in right after that so no one has had time to process.
not_available Send me the first 2 groups.
not_available Sure.
not_available We'll make every attempt to communicate with Jack, trying to resolve this peacefully.
not_available But if we can't, I need everyone absolutely clear on this.
not_available Salazar's terrorist connections are a serious threat to this country.
not_available We cannot let him leave.
not_available Now that we've got Singer, should it come to it, both Salazar and Bauer are expandable.
not_available Why aren't we focusing on other options that would bring down the Chopper without force.
not_available Jack is not giving us any options.
not_available He's on a suicide mission either way.
not_available Once he hands Ramon off to Hector, they'll have no use for him, they're going to kill him.
not_available I just got off the phone with Major Blanchard.
not_available He has pursuit crafts tracking Jack.
not_available However if they're not able to catch him by the time he reaches his metro airspace then we have an all new set of problems.
not_available We need to coordinate with local authorities now.
not_available Hector, relax.
not_available Why can't I reach Gael? He can't get away.
not_available I need to know what's going on with Ramon now! The Government is probably releasing him, it's just taking some time.
not_available They're not releasing him.
not_available I didn't want to tell you.
not_available Tell me what? The plan has changed, Jack Bauer is the one who's going to deliver Ramon.
not_available What is that? A joke? 
not_available No.
not_available But how is that possible? I mean Ramon will never accept help from the man who put him in prison.
not_available Oh no, he is accepting his help.
not_available Bauer, is now a criminal in his own country for doing this.
not_available Hector, what's going on? How could you let Bauer come to us, that's too dangerous.
not_available Don't worry about it Claudia.
not_available No I am worried.
not_available Look what he's already done to us, is that some kind of trick? Don't worry about Jack Bauer, I have plans for him.
not_available Yes? I don't have a lot of time, we're in the middle of this.
not_available Is Ramon alive? 
not_available Yes, he and Bauer have escaped in a helicopter.
not_available Have they contacted their pilot yet? 
not_available No, no, no, they're being pursued.
not_available Everything will be decided in the next few minutes.
not_available Hey, what did Chappelle say in the briefing? He said a lot of stuff.
not_available Are they gonna try and shoot at my father? 
not_available If they have to, yeah.
not_available But if they can contact him first, it won't come to that.
not_available Chloe, where are you at? 
not_available No progress on the hailing frequency.
not_available Without that we can't get through to Jack.
not_available Ok, here some new ones to try, use a tree search, we gotta get through that chopper.
not_available Kim? Yeah? 
not_available I need to speak to you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Ryan and I feel you shouldn't be here, until the situation with your father is resolved.
not_available I'm qualified to handle the work, Michelle.
not_available Your qualifications are not an issue.
not_available Your emotions are.
not_available I can control my emotions.
not_available My father is doing this so the virus won't get out.
not_available If he knows that Kyle Singer is in custody, he'll give Salazar back.
not_available I know but we can't reach your father.
not_available Not yet, but Chloe and Adam are getting there, and I can help them.
not_available I'm a resource Michelle, don't do this.
not_available Ok, go back and help them.
not_available If we have to fire on that chopper, I want her out of here.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available It's military.
not_available How can you tell? Their formation, their range of speed, they're gonna be on us in the next 3 to 4 minutes.
not_available And then what? As soon they got on us, they shoot us out of the sky.
not_available Chappelle? I just spoke with someone at CTU, they said you authorize to use the force against the chopper.
not_available That's right Chase, I did.
not_available Does President Palmer know about this? Palmer? First of all he's in the middle of a national debate.
not_available And I don't need his authorization.
not_available Bauer just help Ramon Salazar break out of prison.
not_available He did that to make sure Salazar's people don't release the virus.
not_available I don't care, but this is my jurisdiction.
not_available All I'm saying is that getting Palmer's authorization, might be the smart play here.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Jack Bauer has a personal relationship with the President.
not_available He saved his life more than once.
not_available Palmer has interceded on his behalf before.
not_available Our mandate does not bend to accommodate personal relationships.
not_available You're right Ryan.
not_available And after you shoot Jack down you can personally explain that to the President.
not_available Chappelle? Our aircrafts are about to make visual contact with Bauer.
not_available We can be ready to fire and 
not_available Do not fire! Repeat, do not fire until you hear back from me.
not_available The President has spoken of his administration support for the American worker, but I'm sure these words sounds hollow to Armando Rodriguez of Galveston, Sean Brown of Baloxi, to Kendall Taylor of Tampa, and to a hundred thousand of their fellow workers who have lost their jobs, because of trade agreement signed by President David Palmer.
not_available Wayne Palmer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Palmer, Ryan Chappelle call.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chappelle what's the latest on the bio
not_available threat? Kyle Singer, who we believe to be the only carrier of the virus has been taken in a custody.
not_available Do you tell me there is no longer a risk of this virus being released? 
not_available That's what I'm saying.
not_available Oh thank God! Yes, we still have the Bauer situation to deal with.
not_available What's the status on that? Bauer is taking Salazar from the prison in an helicopter, We have our men on site, but we aren't able to communicate with.
not_available So, what do you plan on doing? Salazar can't be allowed to leave the country.
not_available I'm afraid our only alternative is to shoot him down.
not_available Mr.
not_available Chappelle, my brother is not gonna like that alternative.
not_available I understand, that's why I'm calling.
not_available I don't want to fire on Bauer without the President permission.
not_available Yeah, well the President is in the middle of televised debate right now, 
not_available so I'm sorry but this is gonna have to wait.
not_available It can't wait.
not_available In a few minutes, their helicopter's going to be over downtown LA, and we will be unable to shoot it down without risking significant civilian casualties.
not_available I'm gonna get back to you alright? 
not_available Soon Mr.
not_available Palmer.
not_available Otherwise Bauer will be able to land that chopper and disappear with Salazar into the population.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Senator Keeler.
not_available Who's the economic experts? The administrations? I, for one, cannot accept the blurred numbers being projected, by the so called economic experts of this administration.
not_available David it's me, the biological threat has been eliminated We have Kyle Singer in custody.
not_available However Jack Bauer doesn't know this and now he is facilitating Salazar escape.
not_available and they're in a chopper in the outskirts of the city.
not_available Now listen to me carefully David.
not_available It may be necessary to shoot him down.
not_available I would like to hear the President answer to that question.
not_available Are you prepared to authorize this? Mr.
not_available President, your response.
not_available Come on David, what do you want to do? I think the entire American work force would like to hear his answer.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? My fellow Americans, I have just been informed of an impending national emergency that requires my immediate attention.
not_available Therefore I must withdraw from this debate.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Now what is this? This is to say the least an unusual situation.
not_available I need this room cleared.
not_available Get this people out of here!!! Help! Where they're taking me? Where do you taking me? Why don't you talk to me? Hey! What are you doing? Where are you going? What's going on? Talk to me! Please! 
not_available Kyle, I'm doctor Duncan.
not_available I need you to calm down.
not_available Where is my girl friend? Where is Linda? We have here in another part of the facility.
not_available Is she ok? 
not_available Yes, she is fine.
not_available There's an incubation period of 14 hours.
not_available With this particular virus if you haven't become symptomatic, You haven't transmitted it.
not_available And my parents? They will be ok too? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're on their way.
not_available What happens when I do become symptomatic? It's like that Ebola thing, isn't it? It's gonna eat me alive? We'll keep you has comfortable has possible.
not_available Alpha 1, Zebra 1, we have visual.
not_available They've got us.
not_available They've locked onto our heat signature.
not_available Then, why aren't they firing? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Chloe! Come one, give me the hailing frequency! I can't make the servers go any faster, OK! Mr.
not_available Chappelle we've just locked on to the chopper.
not_available It is not yet over a populated zone.
not_available I need an answer.
not_available How much time do we have precisely? Before collateral damage becomes an issue, Mr.
not_available we've 4 minutes.
not_available Stay on course Major, I'm waiting to hear back from the President.
not_available We still haven't got any indication as to the nature of this national emergency.
not_available And Senator Keeler's staff is questioning whether or not this emergency actually exists.
not_available If this indeed is a national emergency of any sort, it would challenge the nation at this critical time.
not_available Could you give us a moment please? David, I'm sorry but we don't have a lot of time here.
not_available So what do you wanna do about shooting down this chopper? 
not_available I can't give the order to kill Jack Bauer.
not_available But you can't let Salazar go either.
not_available Is this Salazar you're worried about? Or you worry that if Jack Bauer lives, he'll talk about our arrangement.
not_available It's a fair question to be blunt, yeah I'm worried about that, even if you're not.
not_available But you still have to think about national security David.
not_available I mean Salazar not only runs a drug cartel, but he's connected to terrorist organizations.
not_available And he has proven to us today that he has the infrastructure to launch a biological attack on our soil.
not_available How we can allow him to do that again? Jack Bauer sacrificed everything to prevent that attack.
not_available Jack Bauer volunteered.
not_available Jack Bauer knew the risks, now David you have got to make this decision as if that wasn't Jack Bauer on that helicopter.
not_available You have to do what's right for this country David.
not_available Listen.
not_available This is your call.
not_available But you gonna make it now.
not_available Get me Chappelle.
not_available We now have just over one minute until they reach the no fire zone.
not_available I repeat, we have over just 
not_available Hold on Major.
not_available Ryan Chappelle? 
not_available This is President Palmer.
not_available Why can't you force down that chopper without firing it? Bauer won't communicate with us Mr.
not_available President, he's forcing our hand.
not_available How much time do we have? In 60 seconds he'll be out of reach.
not_available Sir? You have my authorization to fire.
not_available Yes, Sir.
not_available Major, shoot him down.
not_available Yes, Sir.
not_available This is Alpha 1 to Zebra 1 and Zebra 2.
not_available Proceed, you have a go, I repeat, you have a go.
not_available Roger that Alpha 1, preparing to launch.
not_available Damn it! What's happening? They gave the order.
not_available No please.
not_available ?? 6 do you copy? I don't have a shot.
not_available He's changing course, get under, get under! Do you have a shot? Negative, negative.
not_available He knows where I am.
not_available He knows you're in the way.
not_available I've got him again.
not_available Rocket's engaged.
not_available You're clear for shot.
not_available Target locked.
not_available I'm taking the shot.
not_available Hold fire, hold fire, standby.
not_available Alpha 1, he's reaching downtown.
not_available Please advise, do we still fire? No, stand down, I repeat, do not fire, do not fire.
not_available Roger that Alpha 1, standing down Hold on we're going in.
not_available All right! Everyone! Fall back to B protocols.
not_available Have all units on the ground and prepared.
not_available Wherever Bauer lands, I wanna be on top.
not_available Dessler? 
not_available Michelle, what's going on? They're not firing.
not_available He takes over the city.
not_available Can you get him on the hailing frequency yet? Chloe is getting close.
not_available Ok, he's putting it down, I gotta go.
not_available Get me to Chloe! Get me to Chloe! Yeah? Chloe? Chloe? Any seconds left Chase? There is no time damn it! I need to get through before he lands.
not_available I got it Chase, I got it.
not_available Patching you through, you're in, go.
not_available Jack, we found Kyle Singer.
not_available I repeat, we found Kyle Singer.
not_available The virus is contained.
not_available No need for you to doing this.
not_available Mr.
not_available and Ms.
not_available Singer, I'm Doctor Duncan.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available One more second.
not_available That's good.
not_available Get this.
not_available But our options of retrievement are limited.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available If he's not sick yet, why isn't there any way to treat him? Once someone is exposed and starts incubating the virus, there is nothing we can do.
not_available So, how long does he have? The lab tests haven't come back yet, once we do we'll have a more 
not_available Please! Just give me some idea.
not_available Hours, not days.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Can we see him? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Come on honey.
not_available I can't! I can't! Hey, Helen he needs to know that we're not angry with him.
not_available Kyle? Your parents would like to speak with you.
not_available They can hear you through the intercom.
not_available Take your time, I'll be just outside.
not_available The doctor told us everything.
not_available But maybe they're wrong! Maybe it isn't as bad as they think.
not_available They're not wrong.
not_available I deserve what I'm getting.
not_available Don't say that, all you deserve is a father who could do better for you, so you wouldn't have to go and get money and bring it home because i couldn't.
not_available I'm sorry, Kyle, I'm so sorry.
not_available I love you.
not_available You've always taking care of me.
not_available Now I've never now I've never told you this.
not_available But you made me feel safe.
not_available Even now you make me feel safe.
not_available You did the best you could dad.
not_available I will die.
not_available I will die.
not_available No, no.
not_available Edmunds, CTU, anybody seen him.
not_available Witnesses saw your suspects run down at to the station over 5 minutes ago.
not_available How many trains have left? 
not_available Two.
not_available One made a stop 10 blocks east of here.
not_available We got officers searching that area.
not_available We stopped another train in the tunnel, they're searching it now.
not_available Jack's not gonna let himself be trapped in a train.
not_available You think he's still down the tunnel.
not_available CTU, Bauer? Kim I need the entire schematic of the Pershing Square station.
not_available What's going on Chase? Your dad got out of the Chopper before I can tell about Kyle Singer, he and Salazar are on the run.
not_available Hang on, ok I've got the schematics.
not_available How many tunnels emergency access are their between here and Grant.
not_available Heuuu? Kim? 
not_available I'm looking.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available There is one, in the alley.
not_available Just off 6th street south
not_available west corner.
not_available How far is that from here? One block, but they are one ways so you'll be better off on foot.
not_available Ok, I'll get back to you.
not_available Hey! Are we coordinating with you guys or not? Michelle, I just get off the phone with Chase, he's at the metro station.
not_available What did he want? 
not_available Information about the subways.
not_available Whatever you gave him, copy to all other agents.
not_available I did.
not_available Good.
not_available They know not to use lethal force, right? Mandate is the same.
not_available Stop Salazar by any means necessary.
not_available But now that they're on the ground, they can probably do that without harming your father.
not_available Right.
not_available Dessler? Michelle, it's Chase, Jack got out of a tunnel to a maintenance access of mission the 900 block, you need to redeploy all your people this area.
not_available seal off a 10
not_available block radius.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Come on, get in.
not_available The exit of the President did come at a critical time of the debate and even pondered?? on both side of the isle are speculating that it is quite odd, to say the least, Yeah, I will.
not_available I will tell him, thanks.
not_available It was CTU.
not_available They still haven't found Bauer or Salazar.
not_available LAPD is placing an?? area where the Chopper landed.
not_available Hopefully they'll be picked up without an incident.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it's probably more likely that Bauer sneaked through.
not_available David, listen.
not_available You gonna have to stop thinking about his welfare for the moment.
not_available That Bauer breaking Salazar out of prison has already leaked to the press.
not_available Now you gonna have to go out there, and explain to them that's why you ended this debate.
not_available And then explicitly denounce what Bauer did.
not_available So Jack puts his life on the line to stop the fire so we hang him out dry.
not_available David we cannot allow anyone to know that we sanctionned what he did.
not_available That would do irreparable damage to you, to the office.
not_available Now you know what I'm saying is true.
not_available No sorry but you gonna have to let him go.
not_available Who are you calling? The pilot.
not_available Your brother gave the FBI contact instructions in his last call, he's got a plane circling waiting to pick you up.
not_available So CTU knows about the plane.
not_available Would that be a problem? Not for a long.
not_available Yes? Yes, this is Jack Bauer, I've got Salazar.
not_available I'm on a secure cell: Reconfigure your frequency and call me back.
not_available I get confirmation.
not_available That's right.
not_available Is this the real thing? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes it is, he's got Salazar, call him back and make arrangements.
not_available And you'll buffer from CTU.
not_available It's handled.
not_available Yeah? Where are you? All right, the closest safe airstrip is Santa Margarita.
not_available Do you know where that is? Yeah, I can get there in about 10 minutes.
not_available You really are the best Jack.
not_available When you were down there with us I had no idea your were an agent.
not_available We accepted you.
not_available You didn't have to put the needle in your arm.
not_available You did that for other reasons.
not_available Same reason as all junkies, to kill the pain.
not_available What's your pain Jack? What does the needle make go away? Make sure to call Division, tell them that they need to move their men out of Downey.
not_available Same place? 
not_available Yeah, we need everyone downtown.
not_available Michelle Dr.
not_available Linzer on line 3.
not_available It will take a few minutes, is that all right? 
not_available Yeah call me back with confirmation.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah Doctor? 
not_available Well, your husband is out of surgery.
not_available How is he? Their was no nerve damaged, the injury was entirely vascular.
not_available It's what we're hoping for, right? Yes.
not_available He should recover fully.
not_available Thank God! Now, he is going in a post
not_available op now so he should be awake in the next hour or so.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you Doctor.
not_available It was the hospital.
not_available Tony is gonna be ok.
not_available That's good news.
not_available Thank you Ryan.
not_available Have you heard back from INS? Yeah we send out an alert.
not_available And we cover from Baha to New
not_available Mexico.
not_available How about local airfields? We're trying to shutdown everything we can but, we're getting a little bogged down with the FAA.
not_available Have Gael run a pattern analysis on local air traffic, we may come up with an anomaly.
not_available It's a good idea.
not_available Kaufman? 
not_available Adam, where's Gael? Hmmmm, Tech.
not_available 1.
not_available Kim and I are just about to head down there, do you need me to tell him something? No, just send him over to my office 
not_available Ok.
not_available I'll let him know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Once you get back in the air I'll be offline.
not_available You comute your frequency every 15 minutes, I'll pick you up in 22.
not_available 7.
not_available Roger that.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available So everything on the system hasn't been updated since 11am.
not_available So that's where you should start.
not_available Ok.
not_available Gael? Michelle needs to see you in her office.
not_available Ok.
not_available You can use the station right here.
not_available Great.
not_available What are you doing? Ah, bringing the logs back up to date, we got really behind when everything hit the fan today.
not_available I can do that a lot faster than she can.
not_available No, Michelle needs to see you now.
not_available Ok.
not_available You're all set.
not_available Great.
not_available See you in a bit.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sir? Can you give me a moment? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have these 2 paragraphs inverted.
not_available And have the secretary meeti me in the morning.
not_available All right? 
not_available Yes sir.
not_available Is everything ok? No we had to make some fast choices and I couldn't do that while I was on stage.
not_available Yes.
not_available Everything is ok now.
not_available Are you sure? This is just damage control.
not_available David I'm sorry, I just I still can't believe Keeler would repeat those lies in a national debate.
not_available You don't have to apologize for anything.
not_available You didn't sink to their level.
not_available And in the long run, it's gonna pay off.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available But I'm more concerned about you.
not_available You've only been brought into this because of me.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available David, Jerry has scheduled a press conference.
not_available They're expecting a statement this evening.
not_available Fine.
not_available We've got to get right on a response to Keeler's accusation about Anne.
not_available What did the quick post tell us? Well I'm not gonna lie to you.
not_available We got hit hard.
not_available Voters who are on a fence may have just fall into Keeler's camp.
not_available But that is ridiculous once they'll find out that Ted was lying.
not_available But how are they supposed to do that Anne? I mean it's he said, she said, see this is politics, it's not medicine, so do me a favor and stay out of it.
not_available Stay out of it? I am it! That's enough.
not_available Wayne, you gonna have to be patient.
not_available Anne's not going anywhere, and we are not changing our strategy.
not_available David we really 
not_available Right now, it's Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Yes, Sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I may not agree with his bedside manner, but I think he's right.
not_available You don't need this right now.
not_available Now, what are you saying? I think we should put our relationship on hold until after the election.
not_available Wow, wow, first of all, that won't resolve anything, and second of all, I need you.
not_available Then I'm right here.
not_available That's my lady.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available How can that be? Have we rechecked these results? 
not_available 3 times Doctor.
not_available You're sure? 
not_available Very sure.
not_available Ok, thanks.
not_available Yeah, get me Chappelle at CTU, put him through to my cell.
not_available What's going on? There is no trace of the virus in your blood.
not_available What? We've rerun the tests several times, and have them double checked in another lab.
not_available You're clean.
not_available Ohh! My God! Duncan? 
not_available Nicole? Chappelle.
not_available Kyle Singer's tests came back negative.
not_available How is that possible? It's only possible if he was never infected.
not_available So you're telling me this whole virus scare was a bluff? Hard enough I'd say that.
not_available That dead body they dropped off this morning, was definitely infected.
not_available Then why wouldn't have infected the boy? What the hell is going on here? I don't know, you tell me.
not_available What the hell is going on? You didn't think I was gonna let you just deliver me and leave, did you? Get him off.
not_available Ramon! What the hell is going on Ramon? 
not_available Thanks for the ride Jack.
not_available Ramon! Hector said to bring him back, alive.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Adam! Adam, there is something seriously wrong.
not_available I've just remembered.
not_available I forgot to close that file.
