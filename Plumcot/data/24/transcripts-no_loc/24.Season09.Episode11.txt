
not_available Previously on 24 Mr.
not_available President, I'm calling to alert you that the override device used in today's attacks was stolen from our facility.
not_available We believe that Adrian Cross and his people are in possession of it and it's important that you understand that this device can get past the basic firewall security most countries use to protect their military command and control systems.
not_available Why did you do this? We paid you to develop the override, not for you to give it away for the rest of the world.
not_available You're working with Cheng? Are you insane? How do you know him? He kidnapped Jack, had him put in a secret prison outside of Beijing and tortured him for over a year.
not_available When Audrey went to go look for him, he did the same thing to her.
not_available Well, I really don't have any use for you anymore.
not_available No, no No, no! No! We've got a lock on the override device.
not_available We need to move immediately, we don't know how long Adrian Cross is gonna stay put.
not_available Erik, I want your tac teams to hold their position.
not_available We can't run the risk of them being seen on satellite.
not_available They'll be two miles behind you.
not_available The moment Jack Bauer showed up in London, things changed for you.
not_available What happened between Jack and I that was a long time ago.
not_available Clearly, you have not resolved your feelings for him.
not_available I can't talk to you when you're like this.
not_available I hope you're calling to tell me you have Jack Bauer ready to turn over to us.
not_available He's using an encrypted CIA comm link.
not_available Your men will be able to pinpoint his location.
not_available Hold on! Come on.
not_available I'm inside the Naval Command server.
not_available Draft the order.
not_available That's a nuclear sub.
not_available Send it.
not_available What is it, sir? 
not_available Fire order.
not_available We're to sink the Chinese carrier Shenyang.
not_available Fire torpedoes one and two.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available With Cross in possession of the device, the intelligent asset's primary targets are likely those places he's publicly denounced in the past.
not_available Now, we've stepped up our, uh, security.
not_available And we're deploying Patriot missile batteries at Cambridge Naval Tracking Station and the NSA depot at Emery.
not_available Do we have a problem, Admiral? Sir, our KH
not_available 12 satellites are tracking a massive series of explosions aboard the Chinese carrier Shenyang.
not_available Was that our doing? All we know is it started below the waterline.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sir, DIA is patching through live sat feed now.
not_available Just got to get out of here behind that building.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go.
not_available _ Adrian Cross has Russians working for him? I don't think this is Cross.
not_available It's too sophisticated.
not_available They're gonna try and flank us.
not_available I'm gonna move to the front of the car.
not_available You ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go.
not_available The American sub commander's sending confirmation of the Shenyang's sinking.
not_available Should I reply? 
not_available No.
not_available Disconnect from the Naval Command server.
not_available If there's a vulnerability with the software, we don't want the transmission of the order traced.
not_available If you wanted to use the override to start a war between the U.S.
not_available and China, why attack your own country? 
not_available China turned its back on me.
not_available It's not my country anymore.
not_available Sir.
not_available You need to see this.
not_available That closed
not_available circuit camera's less than a quarter mile from here.
not_available Just up the road.
not_available Freeze it.
not_available Bauer.
not_available How did he find us? Did you search her and Cross for any tracking devices? They're both clean.
not_available It's time to go.
not_available Scramble the closed
not_available circuits.
not_available What do you want to do about her? 
not_available Bring her with us.
not_available What's in her head is extremely valuable.
not_available Get up.
not_available Stop.
not_available You're trying my patience, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Do not cause any more trouble than you're worth.
not_available Get going.
not_available _ _ Aim for the propane tanks.
not_available I'm out.
not_available I'm out, too.
not_available Jack, backup is here.
not_available Federal agents.
not_available Drop your weapons.
not_available Identify yourself.
not_available Agent Morgan.
not_available I'm glad to see you.
not_available We were ambushed.
not_available I need a few magazines for an HK 30.
not_available You got 'em? I still got a clean signal.
not_available Override device hasn't moved.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I need your people to get back on comm.
not_available I'm going after the device.
not_available Looks like we were expected.
not_available They were Russian.
not_available I want to know exactly who they are, I want fingerprints on everyone.
not_available Lock down the entire area, okay? Let's lock it down.
not_available Oh, son of a bitch.
not_available My God.
not_available Adrian Cross is dead.
not_available What about Chloe? Don't know.
not_available The override device is missing.
not_available Whoever has it was smart enough to take off the tracker.
not_available Jack, this phone is still recording.
not_available You're trying my patience, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Do not cause any more trouble than you're worth.
not_available Get going.
not_available Play it again.
not_available Play it again.
not_available You're trying my patience, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Do not cause any more trouble than you're worth.
not_available Get going.
not_available My God.
not_available Do you recognize the voice? I'll never forget it.
not_available Bring your people in, I need to talk to the president.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available President, Jack Bauer is calling for you.
not_available Admiral, I want the Massachusetts to initiate all rescue efforts.
not_available And bring General Coburn up to speed when he gets to Euro Comm.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You're on, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm sorry about the noise.
not_available Can you hear me? Loud and clear.
not_available Have you found Adrian Cross? Does he still have the override device? Sir, Adrian Cross is dead and the override device is gone, but I know who has it.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you're not gonna believe this, but it's Cheng Zhi.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available I just heard a recording of his voice on a phone left behind by Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Jack, Cheng was killed three years ago trying to escape from a Chinese prison.
not_available Our sources in China confirmed that.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I thought so, too.
not_available But we were wrong.
not_available Sir, if this man held me captive and tortured me for over a year and a half, I would never forget his voice.
not_available I promise you, it's him.
not_available Well, a short while ago, one of our subs executed a false order to destroy a Chinese carrier.
not_available I guess we can assume the override device gave that order.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Whoever Cheng's working for is trying to start a military conflict between China and the West.
not_available What makes you think he's working with someone else? Because when we were en route to apprehend Adrian Cross, we were attacked and held back by Russian operatives.
not_available Russian? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It's imperative that you find Cheng and the override device, so that we can show the Chinese that we were not responsible.
not_available Understood, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I'll keep you apprised.
not_available You all right? He was dead.
not_available Everyone said he was dead.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available President? Do you want to go? No, I'mI'm, uh You all right? 
not_available I'm all right.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available We need to know where Cheng went after using the override.
not_available Satellite coverage has been off
not_available axis.
not_available And I'm having trouble trying to get into the local CCTV feed.
not_available Why? That's what I'm trying to find out.
not_available I somehow doubt this isn't a coincidence.
not_available Look, I know you're still trying to get up on Jordan's system.
not_available But we need you to do this and do it now.
not_available Fast.
not_available Before Cheng manages to start a war.
not_available I'm running some purpose
not_available built subroutines, but it's gonna take a moment.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Make sure you tell Bauer.
not_available Ritter.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, all closedcircuit cameras for a two
not_available mile radius have been scrambled for several minutes.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What about satellite? I'm scrolling through now, but it was out of position.
not_available So you're telling us we've got nothing? Not unless you can tell me what vehicle or vehicles that Cheng is traveling in.
not_available We were pinned down.
not_available We didn't get a visual.
not_available Jack, it's Erik.
not_available Listen, our tac agents found a tablet inside the Russians' van.
not_available They were tracking you, using the transmitter code from your comm link.
not_available How did they get that code? It's encrypted.
not_available Only this station and the White House have access.
not_available The White House? Why the White House? The president's chief of staff, Mark Boudreau, he requested it.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's done.
not_available Yes, I'm watching it on television.
not_available But Bauer is still in the picture.
not_available You were supposed to have taken him out.
not_available I sent a team to recover him.
not_available You should have sent a bigger one.
not_available He traced the override device to my location.
not_available Where is Bauer now? I don't know.
not_available But he's not gonna stop until he finds me.
not_available We have history.
not_available Get to the docks.
not_available You'll be out of the country in less than an hour.
not_available You will be leaving on a cargo ship under a Dutch flag.
not_available My people will meet you at the dock.
not_available All right.
not_available Dockside security was reinforced after the drone attacks.
not_available You will need to be careful.
not_available Yeah, I understand.
not_available Just keep trying.
not_available Still no sign of Cheng.
not_available Looks like he made it outside the CCTV network before it was restored.
not_available What does Cheng have to gain by starting a war between China and the United States? Cheng was part of the old guard.
not_available Ten years ago, when the political landscape in China really started to shift, Cheng and a group of extremists pushed for complete power.
not_available He lost.
not_available And he was imprisoned.
not_available Up until today, the entire intelligence community thought he died there.
not_available Somehow the Russians must have got him out.
not_available Right, so the Russians are behind the attack on the carrier.
not_available That's a dangerous game, even for them.
not_available This might not be official policy.
not_available This could be an off
not_available book intelligence op.
not_available Either way, U.S.
not_available goes to war with China, Russia has a freer hand to expand into Eastern Europe.
not_available Yeah, I get that.
not_available What I don't get is why the hell is Mark Boudreau helping them? We'll find out soon enough.
not_available Audrey, you don't have to stay here 
not_available if you don't want to.
not_available I want to.
not_available We've got plenty of people to cover things.
not_available My father needs me, and I'd like to think that my country needs me, too.
not_available Mark, please, just let me do 
not_available my job.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available President Wei is on the line now.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available President Heller.
not_available I'm calling you about the attack on your aircraft carrier.
not_available The attack initiated by an American sub.
not_available It was a mistake, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available An accident.
not_available It was not ordered by me or by anyone else in the American chain of command.
not_available You're telling me the captain acted on his own initiative? No, sir, I'm not telling you that.
not_available He received an order he believed to be authentic.
not_available But the order was issued by someone who penetrated our defense communications network.
not_available And do you know who is making these so
not_available called intrusions? We know who issued the false order that sank your carrier.
not_available Someone we both know and have every reason to distrust, Cheng Zhi.
not_available That's nonsense.
not_available Cheng is dead.
not_available We thought so, too.
not_available But we have reliable evidence that he's alive and he's here in England.
not_available We have evidence of our own proving that Cheng was killed three years ago trying to escape from prison.
not_available Suppose we produce Cheng and the device I've told you about.
not_available Would that satisfy you? It's well
not_available known that you disapproved of our carrier sailing into the Mediterranean.
not_available Its sinking and the deaths of thousands of crewmen is a brazen act of war 
not_available that cannot go unanswered.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, believe me I'm a reasonable man, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I do not want war.
not_available But we will do what you have forced us to do.
not_available Whatever happens today is on your head.
not_available So if we could just deliver Cheng to him, show him the device, maybe we could get him to back down.
not_available Then we have to catch Cheng and quickly.
not_available I want you to use all of our resources on it.
not_available Stay in touch with Jack Bauer.
not_available Whatever he needs, get him.
not_available Understood.
not_available Mark, I want a crisis management plan.
not_available Their moves, our counter moves.
not_available I'm on it, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Dad.
not_available I know this is a long shot, but I have a contact at the Chinese Embassy here in London.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Her name is Jiao Sim.
not_available We worked together on a trade agreement in Beijing about a year ago, but the point is, her father is on the politburo.
not_available Let me arrange a meeting, and I will bring evidence about the drone attacks, whatever I can get my hands on that indicates the penetration of our systems was out of our control.
not_available It's not as good as having Cheng.
not_available But it will buy us some time until we find him.
not_available I know that she trusts me and she'll take what I say seriously.
not_available All right, give it a try.
not_available Good.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Our satellites have detected movement 
not_available from the Chinese military.
not_available What movement? Six J
not_available 16s are being scrambled from Datong Air Base and three destroyers off the China coast that weighed anchor.
not_available Where do you think they're headed? Well, it's too soon to tell, Mr.
not_available President, but whatever their plan of action might be, they're not wasting any time.
not_available White House switch port.
not_available This is a secure line.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available I need you to patch me through to Audrey Boudreau.
not_available Please hold sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello.
not_available Audrey, it's Jack.
not_available Look, I need to tell you 
not_available Kill him.
not_available What? Cheng.
not_available Do what you have to first and then you kill him.
not_available How do you know about Cheng? I was next to my father when you called.
not_available Look, I I need you to know that the only reason I surfaced today was to try and protect your father.
not_available For you.
not_available Also because I think he's a really good man.
not_available But things have gotten complicated.
not_available Some things are gonna happen.
not_available And I just don't want you to hate me forever.
not_available Jack, stop.
not_available I could never hate you.
not_available I never have.
not_available Do what has to be done, do you hear me, Jack? I hear you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I got to go.
not_available The Chinese destroyers are steaming at full speed.
not_available The J
not_available 16s have been joined by another squadron, but they're holding at 30,000 feet.
not_available I'm still waiting for you to tell me what their target is.
not_available Sir, their vector is consistent with an attack on our naval bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, if the Chinese plan to attack Okinawa, we have to stand ready to respond in force.
not_available Otherwise our defense of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan 
not_available I understand all of that, Colonel.
not_available It seems to me that we are responding in force.
not_available Sir, I believe our response to be insufficient.
not_available What does that mean? May I suggest raising the alert level of our nuclear forces? I think that's premature, Colonel.
not_available This conflict could escalate very quickly.
not_available We can't afford to be unprepared.
not_available I do not want to be the first one to threaten the use of nuclear weapons.
not_available Sir, we have warhead superiority of ten to one.
not_available If push comes to shove, the Chinese will blink.
not_available What makes you think they're gonna blink? As I said, Mr.
not_available President, we have nuclear superiority of ten to one.
not_available We fired the first shot, albeit unintentional.
not_available Yes, we did, but, sir 
not_available I think we should keep the alert level where it is.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer said it was urgent.
not_available Thought you were on the hunt for Cheng.
not_available I was.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I need to speak with you and Mr.
not_available Boudreau privately, please.
not_available You set me up for the Russians, you son of a bitch.
not_available Why?! Jack, take it easy.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the Russians that attacked me were tracking me using my comm link.
not_available Mr.
not_available Boudreau here gave it to them.
not_available Mark, tell me that's not true.
not_available You tell him the truth.
not_available Now! I'm sorry.
not_available Sorry? You're working for the Russians, and you're telling me you're sorry?! 
not_available I am not working for the Russians! I thought Bauer was a traitor! I thought he was here to assassinate you.
not_available The Russians have been pushing us for four years to turn him over to them.
not_available So, yes, I I I forged your signature on the rendition order.
not_available I thought I was killing two birds with one stone.
not_available I can't believe what you're telling me.
not_available Sir, as long as Jack Bauer is free, he is our political liability.
not_available I was trying to turn him into an asset.
not_available I was doing my job.
not_available Your job?! Mr.
not_available President, don't don't be so naive.
not_available My job is to keep your hands clean.
not_available That means mine get dirty.
not_available I had no idea Anatol Stolnavich was working with Cheng.
not_available Stolnavich's cover is that of deputy foreign minister.
not_available He's a covert intelligence operator, you idiot! If the U.S.
not_available goes to war with China, who do you think benefits? Russia.
not_available I am placing you under arrest for treason.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I can still use him.
not_available Have you had personal contact with Stolnavich? He doesn't return my phone calls, but I, I do know where his personal residence is.
not_available Sir, I'm gonna need him to set up a meet.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I want you to know, I, I thought 
not_available Enough! I don't want to hear any more, nothing.
not_available Where does he live? Knightsbridge.
not_available In a heavily guarded compound there.
not_available Gonna have to figure out something on the way.
not_available Move.
not_available We're having some difficulty acquiring the updated schematics for the Stolnavich residence.
not_available An old one's better than nothing at all.
not_available Just send it through.
not_available All right, Gavin's sending it now.
not_available What kind of intel do you have on their security detail? So, what we know is that there's one guard at the main gate.
not_available But we have no idea how many in total.
not_available To get you inside, we need to know the name of the alarm system Stolnavich is using before Gavin can disable it or take control of it.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We'll get it for you.
not_available Get back to you when we're on site.
not_available This is a wireless comm unit.
not_available I want you to put it in your right ear.
not_available You'll be able to hear everything that Agent Morgan and myself say.
not_available We'll also be able to hear you.
not_available Agent Morgan, can I have the camera? Turn to me.
not_available Okay, when you approach the house, I need you to stand directly in front of the security panel.
not_available It's the only way that we're going to be able to identify what kind of security system they have.
not_available Okay? You're set.
not_available What if he doesn't go for this? You make him go for it.
not_available You persuade him.
not_available You're good at that.
not_available What happens when the bullets start to fly? You're gonna want to try and stay low.
not_available Look, as soon as we enter the house, it's gonna happen very fast.
not_available Stolnavich is gonna want to get to a more secure area of the house.
not_available Anything you can do to slow him down will help us.
not_available Look, I understand that you hate me because of what I tried to do to you, and that's fair enough.
not_available But what I did I thought was the best for the president and for this country.
not_available I'll do whatever it takes to Make it right.
not_available Good.
not_available Camera's online.
not_available Haven't you finished? We'll be there in half an hour.
not_available I'm still trying to add this truck to the manifest at port security.
not_available You're taking too long.
not_available Perhaps she'd have better luck.
not_available I can do this.
not_available I just need a few minutes.
not_available Tell me, how do you intend to keep port authority from inspecting the cargo? Customs have the manpower to only inspect two percent of all shipping containers.
not_available Do you need any help? You'd better move this truck.
not_available There's no stopping here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available _ Mr.
not_available President, the Chinese fighter squadron has cleared their airspace.
not_available They're moving to support their fleet steaming toward Okinawa.
not_available Our own squadron is shadowing them.
not_available Any shots fired? Not yet, sir.
not_available You hear anything from Jack or my daughter? No, sir.
not_available That was Prime Minister Davies' office.
not_available What did he want? Well, the prime minster finally got through to President Wei in China.
not_available He was hoping to help convince him regarding the override device.
not_available And? Unfortunately, he had no more luck than you did, sir.
not_available Damn it! Hey.
not_available I'll get them.
not_available We're good.
not_available We're good.
not_available Let me get these things, okay? Hey, you want some water? No, I'm good, I'm sure.
not_available Throw 'em in there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No, don't worry.
not_available Sir? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? I'm getting confirmation of two SC
not_available 19 missiles launched by the Chinese.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where are they headed? 
not_available It's unclear, sir.
not_available We're trying to ascertain their trajectories right now.
not_available What's happening? Where are all the visuals? Sir, it appears the missiles have taken out two of our surveillance satellites.
not_available We'll get AWACs into position as soon as we can.
not_available Sort it out.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we need to think about moving you to a more secure location.
not_available And under the circumstances, I recommend we raise the alert level to DEFCON three.
not_available Sir? Raise the level.
not_available Gavin, Erik, we're on site.
not_available Do you copy? Yeah, we copy.
not_available We're ready to go.
not_available Okay, this is it.
not_available Good luck.
not_available I need to speak to Stolnavich right away.
not_available The deputy minister isn't receiving visitors.
not_available Just tell him it's Mark Boudreau.
not_available Please.
not_available He can't see you right now.
not_available No, he's got to.
not_available Please, just, just give me the phone, give me the phone, actually, I'll
not_available I'll talk to him, just for a second.
not_available Please? _ Anatol? What are you doing here? You've got to give me asylum.
not_available What? Heller found out that I forged his signature.
not_available There's a warrant out for my arrest.
not_available You got to help me out.
not_available I I I I
not_available I cannot go to prison.
not_available This is no concern of mine.
not_available Come on Listen to me, I am the White House Chief of Staff; think of what I know.
not_available Think of the intelligence briefings I've attended.
not_available I could be a huge asset to you.
not_available To your country.
not_available If you truly wish asylum, then go to our embassy in the morning.
not_available I will not last till morning! I told you, they're following me! Your embassy is being watched.
not_available If, if I turn myself over to you think of what a hero you'll be in Moscow.
not_available Stolnavich? Come on.
not_available Stolnavich! Stolnavich.
not_available _ Da.
not_available Okay, he's in.
not_available Erik, are you receiving the images? We are.
not_available The security panel should be just outside the front door.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Mark, I need you to move closer to the security panel.
not_available Got it.
not_available We're dealing with a Panbeck 3200 series.
not_available Motion sensors, remote viewing.
not_available This is pretty high
not_available end stuff for a home security setup.
not_available Can you disable it remotely? No Best I can do is jam the signal.
not_available Working on it now.
not_available Okay, Mark.
not_available I need to see their security personnel.
not_available Got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Boudreau.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Sit.
not_available If I am to sponsor this, it would be best for you to share a bit of the classified intelligence you say you possess.
not_available First, we nail down the details of my defection.
not_available Details? Sell it to him.
not_available I'll need money First of all.
not_available It always comes down to money.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Gavin, we're moving into position.
not_available I'm still trying to make sure I have the right signal address before I try and jam the security system.
not_available And if you don't? Then I set off the alarm and inform the police.
not_available I'm working as fast as I can.
not_available Got it.
not_available Ready to jam the security system on your signal.
not_available Gavin, I want you to open the gate.
not_available Stand by for the front door on my command.
not_available Got it.
not_available Signal is jammed.
not_available Go.
not_available Ready to breach the door.
not_available On my move.
not_available Anatol.
not_available Anatol.
not_available He's down! You okay? Yeah.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available He's bleeding out.
not_available Get me a towel now! Where is Cheng?! Bauer.
not_available Where is Cheng?! My country has not forgotten.
not_available They will not give up until you pay for what you have done.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available Where is Cheng?! I'm losing him! Here.
not_available Come on, you son of a bitch.
not_available He's done.
not_available He's gone.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sorry, ma'am.
not_available Jiao.
not_available Thank you for coming on short notice.
not_available I'm sorry it's under such unfortunate circumstances.
not_available All the more reason we need to trust one another.
not_available Please.
not_available The order that sank your carrier did not come from us.
not_available It was executed by Cheng Zhi.
not_available Everyone knows Cheng Zhi is dead.
not_available Unless you can prove otherwise.
not_available We can't prove it, not now at least.
not_available But what I can tell you is this Earlier today, we discovered a device that has the capability of hijacking and controlling our drone fleet.
not_available That's what caused the attacks in London.
not_available We were able to get a partial view of the device.
not_available Our analyst assessed it.
not_available This contains a redacted copy of their findings.
not_available I'm not qualified to judge such technical matters.
not_available I understand this.
not_available But can you take this to your father have him analyze it and decide whether or not to pass it on to the politburo? We are hoping that this evidence plus Cheng, if we can capture him, will be enough evidence to prove to the president that the attacks were not our doing.
not_available I can't speak officially but if there's enough evidence including proof that Cheng is still alive I believe President Wei will be able to resist the hard
not_available liners in the party and back away from retaliation.
not_available Good.
not_available Take this to your father as quickly as possible.
not_available Yes, I will.
not_available Go.
not_available Jiao.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No.
not_available My associate has his weapon trained on you.
not_available Sit back down on the bench and don't move.
not_available And maybe I'll allow you to live.
