
not_available You helped terrorists acquire weaponised nerve gas! We were going to trigger the canisters once they reached central Asia.
not_available Walt, you got into bed with them and they're threatening to use the gas on US citizens.
not_available What do we do about Walt? Keep him out of sight long enough to construct a narrative.
not_available Are you talking about a cover
not_available up? Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.
not_available If we go public, the credibility of this office will be destroyed.
not_available Mr President.
not_available What is it, Mike? 
not_available Come here.
not_available What's going on? Just come here, sir.
not_available Lynn.
not_available What is it? I know you're busy, but I need to see you.
not_available I need you to do some work for us and we need it done fast.
not_available Get the canisters.
not_available You have to cut precisely ten centimetres from the bottom of the casing.
not_available We need a place we can meet.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Logan asked for Jack to be reinstated provisionally with full autonomy.
not_available We got a possible intercept on Erwich 
not_available Jacob Rossler.
not_available He's a software programmer indicted for security code infiltration.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Federal agent! Rossler is in custody.
not_available Repeat, Rossler is in custody.
not_available Answer it.
not_available Yes.
not_available We have the identification keys.
not_available No! No! Is he gonna make it? No.
not_available He's dead.
not_available He was our only link to those canisters.
not_available Erwich's gonna call here any minute and he's gonna expect to talk to him.
not_available What's the situation? 
not_available Rossler's dead, shot by his companion.
not_available What does that do to our plan? 
not_available We intended him to lead us to the Sentox.
not_available How? 
not_available He was gonna sell Erwich a chip that would enable him to release the Sentox.
not_available And we put a tracker on the chip? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Obviously that plan has to change.
not_available Has Erwich set a place for the meeting? 
not_available No.
not_available We've also picked up chatter related to the canisters.
not_available Related how? 
not_available Erwich's put out feelers to terrorists here.
not_available He's asking for help launching nerve gas attacks on larger targets.
not_available There's a call coming in on Rossler's phone.
not_available What do you want to do? Put it on the speaker.
not_available Jack, this has to be Erwich.
not_available The roof of the parking garage, the corner of White Oak and Madison.
not_available One of my men will meet you.
not_available Look for a blue van.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available I think we caught a break.
not_available Give me the chip.
not_available CTU.
not_available Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.
not_available Jack Bauer on the line.
not_available 
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Did you get that? Erwich is sending someone else.
not_available That's a problem.
not_available No.
not_available It means I can pass myself off as Rossler.
not_available We can keep the meeting.
not_available We can control this.
not_available Rossler and Erwich's man may know each other.
not_available He wouldn't have said, "Look for a blue van" if they did.
not_available It's a big risk, Jack.
not_available Jack, they will probably kill you.
not_available Even if they do think you're Rossler.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available If we're lucky, he'll take the chip to Erwich and lead us to the gas.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available Do it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Chloe, Edgar, Jack will need you to support him through the installation of the chip.
not_available We'll pull up the schematics.
not_available Already on it.
not_available The chip is genuine, but it's useless without the unlock code.
not_available The tracker is built into the chip itself.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How do you wanna play this? 
not_available I want them to think I'm scared of them.
not_available Get tac teams ready.
not_available We're on the move.
not_available You'll need a comm unit with a fresh battery.
not_available You'll be patched into CTU at all times.
not_available We'll be able to hear everything within a 20ft radius of you.
not_available I'll be watching your back.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Testing, one, two, three.
not_available He'll be waiting for you there.
not_available Let me know if there's a problem.
not_available Do we have the new chip yet? 
not_available No.
not_available I sent Polakov and Komar to meet Rossler.
not_available We should have it in a few minutes.
not_available Anything? A remote is the most effective way of triggering the canisters.
not_available I understand, but what if the new chip doesn't work? I need options in case Rossler fails us.
not_available There may be a work
not_available around, but someone will have to be on site with the canister.
not_available Get it done.
not_available Excuse me, I thought you should know.
not_available Walt's body has been moved to the Secret Service outbuilding for the time being.
not_available You realise, sir, we still need to issue a public statement about his death.
not_available No statement till his wife's been notified.
not_available Of course.
not_available Sir, if you don't mind me saying, I think perhaps we have an opportunity here.
not_available This statement you plan to release disclosing the fact that Walt was part of the conspiracy to supply terrorists with nerve gas and that he was involved in Palmer's assassination What's your point, Mike? 
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available I wonder if his death might render all that moot.
not_available Go on.
not_available Little will come from dragging his name through the mud when he's not here to answer for what he did.
not_available And it would be devastating for this country, particularly if, God forbid, that nerve gas is used against us.
not_available What are you suggesting? We could attribute Walt's suicide to a despondency over the day's events.
not_available Overwork, personal issues.
not_available Let him go out with some dignity, you mean, not as a traitor.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available My wife will have a considerable problem with that.
not_available Well I respect the first lady's moral conviction, but this is your decision, not hers.
not_available Is there anything else I can get you? 
not_available No, thank you, Evelyn.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Can I ask your advice on something? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Some of the staff are asking questions.
not_available About? 
not_available Walt Cummings' death.
not_available I'm preparing a statement that the president's gonna give later.
not_available It'll explain everything.
not_available Is there something else, Evelyn? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What? What is it? Why did he do it? Why did Walt kill himself? I deserve to know.
not_available A violent thing happened to someone that I work with every day, who had no visible signs of depression.
not_available What if it wasn't suicide? What if we're in danger? I don't know what to think.
not_available It was suicide.
not_available How can you be so sure? Evelyn, listen to me.
not_available What I'm going to say to you has to stay in this room until it's made public.
not_available You do understand? His family doesn't know the truth yet.
not_available OK.
not_available Walt Cummings was a traitor.
not_available What? I'm not gonna go into any details.
not_available Walt was responsible for some of the awful things that happened.
not_available I can't believe that.
not_available The presidentjust found out.
not_available I suppose that Walt didn't want to face the humiliation of a long public trial and he decided to kill himself.
not_available Was he working with the terrorists? Our enforcement agencies are trying to figure that out.
not_available Jack's arrived at the rendezvous point.
not_available Maintain your distance.
not_available Heads up.
not_available We have the blue van entering the parking garage.
not_available Licence plate 6Q49951.
not_available Repeat, 6Q49951.
not_available Running the plates.
not_available He's heading up the ramp towards you.
not_available Couldn't get a visual.
not_available I have a hit.
not_available The plates don't match the vehicle.
not_available They probably stole the van and put clean plates on it.
not_available Two men are getting out.
not_available Showtime.
not_available Rossler.
not_available I was told there'd only be one of you.
not_available Is that a problem? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't like surprises.
not_available Relax.
not_available I've got your money.
not_available Let me see it.
not_available When I see the chip.
not_available Erwich says you have to install it.
not_available Where's the remote trigger? Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available OK, Jack.
not_available You need to remove the backing.
not_available Inside there are five jumpers.
not_available Toggle the one in the middle to the left, then pry out the old chip, but do it gently.
not_available When it's out, clear your throat or something.
not_available OK.
not_available Insert the new chip into the slot.
not_available Press the reset button directly under it.
not_available Screw the back on and you're done.
not_available It's reconfigured.
not_available You can activate the canisters.
not_available You'd better hope it works.
not_available You're coming with us, just to make sure.
not_available What are they doing? We're on the move.
not_available This isn't the deal I made with Erwich.
not_available I reconfigured the trigger.
not_available You're supposed to just give me the money.
not_available Standing by to move in.
not_available Hold on, Curtis.
not_available Erwich knows who Jack is.
not_available He saw him.
not_available They'll kill him.
not_available When Jack gets close, the tac teams will move in.
not_available We need to move in now.
not_available Make the terrorists tell us where Erwich is.
not_available Erwich will know something's wrong and we'll lose him.
not_available This is our only shot.
not_available Bill! Are we letting them take Jack? Stand down.
not_available Take no action.
not_available Reassemble the tac teams and mount a follow operation.
not_available All teams, stand by.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Lynn's right.
not_available Whatever happens, Jack can handle it.
not_available He has to.
not_available Come in.
not_available Excuse me, Mrs Logan.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Here's the press release.
not_available I'm confused.
not_available About what? It's not what you said.
not_available They're calling Walt Cummings a hero, not a traitor.
not_available I don't believe this! Well, is CTU any closer? They hope their operation will lead them to the canisters.
not_available Hope is not good enough.
not_available We want results.
not_available You need to make that clear to them.
not_available I believe they're doing everything that can be done, sir.
not_available I just read the statement you issued about Walt's death.
not_available "Stress due to overwork robbed this country of one of its most dedicated public servants.
not_available " "His work with this administration has " You're covering everything up.
not_available I'll wait outside.
not_available Don't go anywhere, Mike.
not_available Your fingerprints are all over this.
not_available Charles, we worked on this together.
not_available I thought we agreed you needed to go public about Walt's involvement with everything.
not_available I know you're disappointed, but it's obvious Walt taking his own life changes things.
not_available What's obvious is that this is a pack of lies! Mrs Logan, full disclosure would have been necessary to ensure Walt faced justice for what he'd done.
not_available With his death making that a non
not_available issue, it was decided this course was best for his family.
not_available Oh, don't.
not_available You don't care about his family.
not_available You decided that this was best for you.
not_available But you are dead wrong 
not_available Martha, that's enough! I made my decision, and I am the president.
not_available Which means it's yourjob to tell the truth, even when it's ugly.
not_available And if you don't, I will.
not_available If you feel so strongly about telling the truth, start with Walt's wife when she arrives.
not_available Suzanne's coming? 
not_available To collect her husband's body.
not_available So you can tell her that the real reason Walt took the coward's way out was because he disgraced himself and he betrayed his country.
not_available All right.
not_available It will be very painful, but it's the right thing to do.
not_available We're one mile behind Jack, heading west on Nordhoff, passing Sepulveda.
not_available Maintain your distance.
not_available We've got them on satellite.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available What does it matter? I have another appointment.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available How long it takes once we get there is up to you.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I told you.
not_available We need to make sure the remote trigger works on the canisters.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available You've got one of the canisters with you.
not_available Erwich wants a field test.
not_available I won't be within 50 miles of that when it goes off.
not_available We have masks.
not_available What's the target? Curtis, are you reading this? 
not_available Do you want me to reposition for intercept? No.
not_available Not till we have a visual on the canister.
not_available If they stay on Nordhoff, up ahead there's an industrial park and two retail complexes.
not_available They just turned north.
not_available That's not good.
not_available What is it? What's the potential target? Sunrise Hills Mall.
not_available Curtis, the intended target is the Sunrise Hills Mall.
not_available Repeat, the intended target is the Sunrise Hills Mall.
not_available Uploading schematics of the mall and surrounding streets now.
not_available Teams, stand by for positioning.
not_available We'll set up on the second level of the parking structure.
not_available This is it.
not_available Curtis, do you have Jack on visual? He and the hostiles are in the south parking lot.
not_available Alpha team, take up position at the perimeter.
not_available Bravo team, I want plain
not_available clothes agents at the mall doors.
not_available How will you get the canister in? 
not_available Through the door.
not_available Anyone asks, we're working on the air conditioning.
not_available I didn't agree to this.
not_available I'm not going in.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available What are we waiting for? There are hundreds of video cameras in there.
not_available This entire country'll know what we look like.
not_available We want your leaders to know who did this.
not_available That's your fight.
not_available The deal I made was to sell the chip, not to get my face all over the news.
not_available Erwich prefers to keep you alive, but only if you cooperate.
not_available Now hand me the jackets.
not_available We're moving the tac teams in to recover the canisters before you go inside the mall.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's get this over with.
not_available I'll let you know as soon as we're in position.
not_available Sending redeployment orders now.
not_available Hold off on that.
not_available We have got to stop them before they get inside.
not_available If we move in, Erwich will know we're onto him.
not_available We won't be led to the other canisters.
not_available Are you talking about letting them do this? Sacrificing the lives of all those people? I'm accepting the damage that one canister can do versus what the other 19 can do.
not_available This is insane.
not_available Bill.
not_available Bill's not in charge here.
not_available I am.
not_available We need to call the president.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I just got into the mall's video surveillance server.
not_available We should be able to see Jack.
not_available Jack, we're still waiting for the president to call.
not_available I'll let you know as soon as we have him.
not_available Get the security guard.
not_available Knock on the glass.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Servicing the HVAC.
not_available We didn't get a call about that.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available We did.
not_available You got paperwork? 
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Will this work? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do it.
not_available Throw me the bag.
not_available And yourjacket.
not_available The president is on line one.
not_available 
not_available Put him through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Jack, the president is on the line.
not_available I'll patch you in.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available 
not_available This is Lynn McGill.
not_available You also have Bill Buchanan, Audrey Raines, Chloe O'Brian and Edgar Stiles in the room.
not_available We need your decision on a critical operational matter.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Jack Bauer's undercover with the terrorists.
not_available They're expecting Jack to help them release a canister of Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills shopping mall where they are now.
not_available Well, then, arrest them.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available If we don't maintain Jack's cover, there's no guarantee that they'll lead us back to the other 19 canisters.
not_available Do you mean actually let them release the Sentox? Are you out of your mind? Mr President, Bill Buchanan.
not_available I had the same initial reaction.
not_available Then I looked at updated scenarios.
not_available With the help of other terrorists, the remaining canisters could be deployed at other, more crowded public areas such as subway stations, hospitals and sports arenas, sir.
not_available The loss of life could exceed hundreds of thousands of people.
not_available My God.
not_available Bring it over here.
not_available I got it.
not_available What kind of casualties do you predict at the mall? We don't have exact numbers, but based on our surveillance our guess is 800 or 900.
not_available Sir, many of them are children.
not_available Can't you evacuate the mall? 
not_available Not without the terrorists knowing.
not_available The public will not tolerate the government's complicity in this.
not_available They wouldn't know, sir.
not_available This would be a covert decision.
not_available We're monitoring them.
not_available We know with 100% certainty that when they leave the mall, they're going back to the remaining canisters.
not_available What's your recommendation? 
not_available Bill and I agree.
not_available The greatest good would be served by allowing them to release this single canister.
not_available I believe that we have no right to sanction the deaths of innocent people.
not_available We should take our chances, interrogate them and find the location of the other canisters.
not_available Are we ready? Almost.
not_available Mr President, we're running out of time.
not_available We need your decision, sir.
not_available This is a field operation.
not_available It's up to you.
not_available With all due respect, Mr President, it's not.
not_available We don't have the legal authority to make this decision.
not_available Only you do.
not_available You're putting me in a terrible position.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Mike.
not_available CTU has laid out the facts well, but you have to make the call.
not_available All right.
not_available The terrorists are forcing us to make a tragic choice.
not_available I'll go along with your assessment.
not_available Let them release it.
not_available But you'd better find those other canisters, or those people will have died in vain.
not_available Pull our tac teams out of the mall.
not_available Jack, you heard the president's decision.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Put your masks on.
not_available I'm going to arm the valve.
not_available What's the unlock code? Jack, the unlock code is Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.
not_available I repeat, Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.
not_available Come on! What's the unlock code? Alpha, Kilo, Charlie, Jack.
not_available Echo, Bravo, Charlie.
not_available Enter the correct code, Jack.
not_available That's an order.
not_available Jack, this is a direct order from the president.
not_available Now, enter the correct code and let them release the gas.
not_available Now! 
not_available It's not arming.
not_available Why isn't it working? 
not_available Maybe the remote's been damaged.
not_available Make it work or I'll kill you.
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available Make it work! I told you, there's nothing I can do! Jack, can you hear me? Yes? 
not_available We can't arm the canisters.
not_available What is the problem? 
not_available Rossler says he doesn't know.
not_available Do you believe him? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Should I kill him? Not until we are sure we have another way to release the gas.
not_available Andrei thinks he's discovered an alternative.
not_available I'll put him on.
not_available Get him in the other room.
not_available Polakov.
not_available The canister is in front of you? Yeah.
not_available You have the mechanism? Yeah, I have it right here.
not_available Follow my instructions exactly.
not_available OK, I understand.
not_available In the trigger mechanism you'll see multicoloured wires.
not_available OK.
not_available Splice each wire individually.
not_available 
not_available What's going on? Andrei may have a way to release the gas.
not_available See the circuit configuration? 
not_available I see it.
not_available Now, move the jumper over.
not_available Expose the red and yellow wire.
not_available Hang on.
not_available I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.
not_available Can the valve open without warning? If you make a mistake, it could, so pay attention.
not_available 
not_available Five more splices to go.
not_available Which one now? The orange wire is next in the sequence.
not_available Exactly as before.
not_available The white and blue wires need to be connected through the circuit board, then into the release valve.
not_available Get the masks.
not_available We're almost ready.
not_available OK.
not_available Now you're ready to proceed.
not_available You'll see three inputs on the bottom left of the circuit board.
not_available Three outputs on the top right.
not_available They are marked input one There is still time to stop them before they murder those people.
not_available We have a directive from the president.
not_available He signed these children's death warrant.
not_available More people could die if these men don't lead us to the canisters.
not_available They could.
not_available That's theoretical.
not_available Those children will die in minutes.
not_available Look at them! 
not_available Audrey, that's enough.
not_available If you were in Jack's shoes would you follow that order? Stand and watch as they murder all those people? This is war.
not_available There will be casualties.
not_available If those were the orders of the president, I'd have to.
not_available I hope that's not true.
not_available For your sake.
not_available You have two more wires to go.
not_available All right.
not_available The wires are together.
not_available Put your mask on.
not_available The next pair you splice will open the valve.
not_available Go kill Rossler.
not_available Polakov.
not_available Polakov! Polakov! Jack, can you hear me? What's happening? What's your status? I stopped the gas, but some got into the ventilation.
not_available Evacuate the mall.
not_available What about the terrorists? One's dead, one escaped.
not_available Have Curtis's men start looking for him.
not_available Curtis, this is Buchanan.
not_available Move in now.
not_available About time.
not_available Move in.
not_available All teams, move in.
not_available Up against the wall.
not_available Terrorists have released a toxic substance into the ventilation system.
not_available You need to evacuate people now.
not_available This is not ajoke.
not_available This is not a robbery or a drill.
not_available Do it now! We have a red alert.
not_available Begin evacuation procedures immediately.
not_available Where's the power source for ventilation? 
not_available It's next to the food court.
not_available Get everybody out now.
not_available to the nearest mall exit in an orderly fashion.
not_available 
not_available Curtis, it's Jack.
not_available We're closing in on the mall.
not_available I'll try and shut down the ventilation system.
not_available I do not have a visual on the hostile.
not_available Make sure your men take him alive.
not_available Understood.
not_available Curtis, it's Jack.
not_available The Sentox nerve gas that escaped has stayed in the food court.
not_available I got at least 11 people down.
not_available I need assistance.
not_available I need assistance now.
not_available Got it.
not_available 
not_available Sweetheart, can you hear me? I want you to hold the mask to your face when I take it off, OK? All right, masks on.
not_available Inject anyone who's down and get them outside as soon as possible.
not_available I need a shot of atropine for a child under 12.
not_available Curtis, give me thatjacket for her head.
not_available I'm losing her.
not_available Come on.
not_available She's responding.
not_available Her pulse is stabilising.
not_available We've secured the exits.
not_available We don't have a visual on the terrorist.
not_available If he got out of the mall before we locked down, he may be lost.
not_available He's our only chance of finding Erwich.
not_available Monitor the tracking device in the remote trigger.
not_available The hostile still had it on him.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Jack's right.
not_available The signal's moving away from the mall.
not_available Looks like he's on foot.
not_available Michaels.
not_available Jack and I are going after the remote trigger.
not_available You're in charge here.
not_available Walsh, gather your team.
not_available You're with us.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available This man's gonna take care of you.
not_available Yes.
not_available Rossler or whoever he was 
not_available killed Komar and tried to stop us.
not_available What? Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I managed to activate the valve before I got away.
not_available At least some of the gas was released.
not_available You sure you're not being followed? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Come back here.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available 
not_available He's turning left on Reese.
not_available We're six blocks out.
not_available One moment, please, Mr McGill.
not_available I'll connect you with the president.
not_available Yes? Mr President, I thought it was important to let you know what's happening.
not_available What's happening is I sent you over there to make sure CTU was running smoothly and you seem to be incapable of that.
not_available Bauer refused.
not_available There was nothing I could do.
not_available No, I don't want excuses.
not_available Just do yourjob, and if you can't do it I'll find somebody else who can.
not_available The estimates from the mall are much lower than we anticipated.
not_available It appears the fatalities will be limited to between ten and 20 people.
not_available Thank God.
not_available So, what are we telling the media? 
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available CTU is maintaining a blackout until we give them direction on a cover story.
not_available What about the other 19 canisters? CTU has a terrorist under surveillance as we speak.
not_available They believe there's a good chance he'll lead them to Erwich and the other canisters.
not_available All right.
not_available Good.
not_available There's something else, sir.
not_available Suzanne Cummings has arrived to claim Walt's body.
not_available Martha is on her way to speak with her now.
not_available Thank you, Mike.
not_available Suzanne.
not_available I can't believe he's gone.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so, so sorry.
not_available I should've been with him today.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available I wanted to be.
not_available Honey, don't do that.
not_available Don't blame yourself.
not_available He told me to stay at the hotel.
not_available You know how much we love you, honey.
