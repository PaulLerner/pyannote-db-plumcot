
not_available David, what have you done? 
not_available Excuse me? I just got a call from the Secretary of State about a covert action against the Chinese.
not_available That's correct.
not_available I sanctioned it.
not_available An attack on their consulate.
not_available A military engagement.
not_available A covert operation.
not_available We marched on Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals, and in the process the Chinese consul was killed.
not_available If we don't find that warhead before it's deployed, ten million Americans could face annihilation.
not_available We could be at war with a billion Chinese.
not_available Is he gonna make it? 
not_available We'll do our best.
not_available I just need him long enough to get the information about Marwan.
not_available I know, Jack.
not_available You made me aware of that when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available You made a choice that killed Paul and I'm trying to deal with it.
not_available We both have a job.
not_available Let's just do it.
not_available I know he worked on the warhead.
not_available Now he needs to tell us where it is.
not_available He knows where Marwan might be.
not_available A factory on Sixth.
not_available They're looking for the warhead in their cities.
not_available They have no idea that it's going to be delivered by missile.
not_available Start the sequence.
not_available We're done here.
not_available They can't stop us now.
not_available I've been waiting for this.
not_available You're too late.
not_available Kill me.
not_available That won't stop the missile.
not_available Tony, can you see this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you get the source of the transmission? No, it's on an encrypted uplink.
not_available No way to trace it.
not_available Have you got a lock on the missile? Still trying to find it.
not_available What about Marwan? I'm gonna scan the building, then bring him into CTU.
not_available Prep a holding room.
not_available I'm going off com.
not_available If you need me, get me on my cell.
not_available All right.
not_available Try and decode his files.
not_available I'll prep a team to scan the building.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available How did they manage to assemble a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead? S
not_available series cruise missile.
not_available Stealth technology.
not_available They smuggled it in piece by piece and then assembled it on site.
not_available If it's Stealth, we can't track it by radar.
not_available What about targets? Pull it up.
not_available An S
not_available series has a range of 1800 miles.
not_available A warhead could be delivered from the Midwest to anywhere in the continental US.
not_available Those missiles travel at a speed of 600mph.
not_available It could hit a target on either coast in three hours.
not_available That's assuming it's headed for the coast.
not_available If not, it could hit its target any time.
not_available No files.
not_available He just used this to unscramble the downlink.
not_available What else did you find? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Just the laptop and the cell phone.
not_available OK.
not_available Upload the SIM card to CTU.
not_available See if any of it's traceable.
not_available You got it.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available This is Logan.
not_available I've been told a cruise missile was launched containing a nuclear warhead.
not_available Our military tracking device is doing all they can to find the trajectory of the missile, 
not_available but we don't have a lot to go on.
not_available What about Marwan? You think he'll break? That won't be easy, sir.
not_available He's planned and organized everything that's happened today.
not_available He's committed.
not_available He's prepared to die.
not_available I know you'll do your best.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I will.
not_available Let the Joint Chiefs know.
not_available This should be limited to the intelligence community only.
not_available A nuclear missile was launched.
not_available We have to assume Washington is its target.
not_available What are our options? 
not_available Not many.
not_available Our priority is to establish a continuity of government and start a quiet evacuation of government personnel in the city.
not_available Bring the cabinet members and the Speaker to the bunker.
not_available Congress and Pentagon should be taken to the mountain safety facility.
not_available Mike, let them know that this is a category one emergency.
not_available Tell them nothing more.
not_available We can't afford an information leak.
not_available David, the public needs to be warned.
not_available Cities need to be evacuated.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Let's see what Bauer comes up with first.
not_available He'll die before he talks to us.
not_available I know.
not_available Stand down.
not_available You and I both know all I wanna do right now is kill you, but I have my orders.
not_available We've run out of time.
not_available You win.
not_available I'm instructed to ask you what you want.
not_available What I want is already happening.
not_available The destruction of innocent life is a means to an end.
not_available Why don't we just skip to the end? To the end? Everything you did today, you did for a reason.
not_available For your people.
not_available What do you want to change? I have no interest in having a political discussion with you.
not_available I am in the position to make things happen.
not_available I have the ear of the President of the United States right now.
not_available You have the power to make any kind of deal that you want, and I promise you, you'll do more for you and your people if you cooperate with me than if you let that missile hit its target.
not_available You tell me where the missile's headed, you help me stop it, and I guarantee you that you will talk to the president and he will listen.
not_available He has no choice.
not_available Right here, right now, you have the chance to get what you want.
not_available I already have, Agent Bauer.
not_available After this day, every elected official and citizen of America will know that America cannot intervene in our lives, in our countries, with impunity.
not_available Besides, your president sees me in only one dimension.
not_available Evil.
not_available As you see us.
not_available Yes, and vulnerable.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What? You'll never believe it.
not_available I got names off the calls received on Marwan's cell phone.
not_available Take a look.
not_available Richard Heller? 
not_available Right.
not_available Secretary of Defense Heller's son.
not_available Called Marwan a week ago.
not_available Did you tell anyone yet? No.
not_available Just you.
not_available I'II let Buchanan know.
not_available With every minute the missile's target zone widens.
not_available We need to get updates from regional teams.
not_available Sorry to interrupt.
not_available Edgar pulled a name off Marwan's phone from a call he received last week.
not_available Who called him? 
not_available Richard Heller.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available The number originated from his cell phone.
not_available That's how Marwan knew where Heller was yesterday morning.
not_available Richard helped plan the kidnap? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Where is he now? 
not_available Well, it's 4am.
not_available He's at home asleep, I guess.
not_available Where does he live? 
not_available Van Nuys.
not_available Do we have field teams in the area? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'll pull it up on the IP phone.
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available Dispatch them.
not_available I'll call Secretary Heller, tell him his son's being brought back in.
not_available Chloe, does Audrey know about this? No.
not_available It's more of a management conversation, don't you think? Your team has been issued new orders.
not_available You are to dispatch immediately to Van Nuys.
not_available Audrey, you got a minute? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's about your brother Richard.
not_available Is he all right? 
not_available I assume he is, yeah.
not_available What do you mean? We found out that Marwan got a call from Richard's cell phone a week ago.
not_available I'm sorry, but that's absurd.
not_available We don't know what it means.
not_available Buchanan sent a team to pick Richard up.
not_available He was brought in once today and he was cleared.
not_available I know, but this call definitely connects him to Marwan and the missile.
not_available Look, I don't know how he got mixed up in this, but my brother is not a terrorist.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Richard's phone number was found on the received registry of Marwan's SIM card.
not_available Does my father know about this? 
not_available Buchanan's calling him right now.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, we got something.
not_available What? 
not_available Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.
not_available We're sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're bringing him to CTU.
not_available I wanna question this kid myself.
not_available We need to get back there now.
not_available Put the suspect in the vehicle.
not_available We're headed back to CTU now.
not_available It doesn't matter where you take me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We'll see about that.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack.
not_available Did you get anything out of Marwan? No.
not_available We've got a better chance of breaking him at CTU.
not_available We're about ten minutes out.
not_available Curtis, are you OK? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Can you see the shooters? 
not_available On the roof behind us.
not_available Go! Notify the perimeter we no longer have Marwan in custody.
not_available Perimeter teams, Marwan's escaped.
not_available He's headed toward the southwest sector.
not_available What have you got on Marwan? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available He ditched the vehicle.
not_available We can't find him on satellite.
not_available How did his people get into that area? 
not_available They didn't.
not_available They must've been there before.
not_available All right.
not_available Have perimeter teams comb the nearby buildings for remaining hostiles.
not_available We lost them, Jack.
not_available Dammit, Tony, how? They dumped their vehicle on the freeway.
not_available Marwan got into another car.
not_available We're trying to analyze the satellite.
not_available The images are noisy.
not_available How does Buchanan wanna handle this? 
not_available Finding Marwan is becoming less likely.
not_available We have to follow primary leads only.
not_available Right now that's Richard Heller.
not_available Has he arrived yet? 
not_available No.
not_available He'll be back here momentarily.
not_available Bill, I wanna interrogate this kid myself.
not_available I understand.
not_available I'll have him ready for you.
not_available We're on our way in.
not_available Curtis, we need to get back to CTU.
not_available They lost Marwan.
not_available We'll have to track him from there.
not_available What did Buchanan say? 
not_available Heller's in first position.
not_available We're gonna interrogate him.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Please, everybody, be seated.
not_available I apologize for the abruptness of your removal from your homes.
not_available Please know that every precaution had to be taken to ensure the secrecy of your arrival.
not_available The US has been thrown into a category one emergency.
not_available A cruise missile containing a nuclear warhead has been launched and is now headed for, we believe, a major US city, very possibly Washington, DC.
not_available Now, all branches of the military have been alerted.
not_available They're doing everything in their power to locate and intercept the missile.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available You're saying that not only do we not know what the missile's target is, but you don't know where the missile is? 
not_available That's correct.
not_available When do you plan to inform the public? At this time, we feel that informing the public wouldn't be in the country's best interest.
not_available "We" meaning who, Mr.
not_available President? I feel that way, Mr.
not_available Speaker.
not_available Doesn't the public have a right to know the truth? That's all I have for now.
not_available When I know more, an update will be given.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Gentlemen.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Yes, Don.
not_available Sir, I do not wish to question your decision in front of the cabinet, but I think that you're making a grave mistake in not alerting the public.
not_available Look, I've thought a lot about this, and I'm certain it's the right course.
not_available Well, if I may say so, sir, you do not seem certain.
not_available It's a difficult day for all of us, Don.
not_available Now, if you'll excuse me Mike.
not_available What's going on here? 
not_available Meaning what? Logan was just sworn in.
not_available We're under a terrorist attack.
not_available He needs all the help he can get.
not_available He understands that and he's seeking advice.
not_available Not from his cabinet, or the Congressional leadership.
not_available Give it time, Don.
not_available Give it time.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tacticals are going through Richard's things now.
not_available What about Jack? 
not_available Jack and Curtis are on their way back.
not_available Someone has to tell Audrey that Jack's going to be interrogating her brother.
not_available Audrey's not gonna wanna let Jack near her brother.
not_available It can't be helped.
not_available I mean, if Richard knows something about that missile This morning, Jack and Audrey were planning their future.
not_available Now he's responsible for her husband's death and he may have to torture her brother.
not_available And yet every move he's made has been the right one.
not_available Not if he wanted to be with her.
not_available Look, Michelle.
not_available Everything that's happened here today it's been hard going through it with you again.
not_available It's been hard for me too.
not_available And I look at what this job does to the people in our positions, and I realize I want us to be together again, but it's gotta be away from all this.
not_available You want us to leave our jobs? We've spent the last 12 years of our lives doing this.
not_available Where would we go? What would we do? I don't care.
not_available People start over every day, if it's important to them.
not_available You're asking me to leave the only thing I've ever done.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available This is beyond belief! I cannot be back here! Audrey, get me outta here! These guys broke into my house.
not_available This is illegal.
not_available Richard, listen.
not_available Just calm down, OK? Listen to me.
not_available Your number came up on the cell phone of a terrorist.
not_available That's what they said and that's insane! 
not_available All right.
not_available Listen, OK? 
not_available Audrey.
not_available Yes.
not_available They have to get him into holding now.
not_available Audrey! Audrey, don't let them do this! Don't let them do this to me! Who's interrogating him? 
not_available Jack.
not_available What? 
not_available You are not gonna torture my brother.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available We're outta time.
not_available He knows something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
not_available And what if he doesn't? 
not_available You're aware that he called Marwan.
not_available There has gotta be an explanation for that.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available You believe you can interrogate your own brother? Maybe I can get something out of him that you can't.
not_available Please, just give me five minutes.
not_available Please.
not_available Take five minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mike.
not_available Don.
not_available How's President Logan managing? 
not_available Given the circumstances, very well.
not_available I noticed that ex
not_available president Palmer's here.
not_available Yes.
not_available He brought the former president in to advise.
not_available Yeah, well, that's probably a good idea.
not_available Palmer's been at the helm in this kind of crisis.
not_available He knows how to lead.
not_available President Logan doesn't have any problem leading.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available It's just that if he's not going to ask his cabinet for help, or the leadership, it comforts me somewhat that he's in good hands.
not_available Is there something else you wanted to say? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, there is.
not_available The people elected John Keeler to run this country.
not_available In his absence, Logan is expected to take over, but if he's not up to the task, Mike, it is I, Speaker of the House, and not David Palmer who steps up.
not_available Understood.
not_available And let me assure you that's not the case.
not_available Logan is in complete control.
not_available Excuse me, Don.
not_available I gotta get back.
not_available Sure.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We may have a problem.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Don Ashton.
not_available He's been asking questions and raising concerns as to President Palmer's role here.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available We have more important things to worry about at the moment.
not_available Sir, as Speaker of the House he can create problems which you don't need right now.
not_available Mike's right, sir.
not_available Don's very ambitious.
not_available Now that he's next in line to the presidency, he'll look to exploit any angle he can.
not_available He won't put ambition before national security.
not_available He won't see it in those terms, sir.
not_available In his eyes, national security and his personal ambition are one and the same.
not_available What do we do? Show him who's in charge.
not_available Everything set up? 
not_available Yeah, he's ready.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Hey.
not_available Audrey! Get me out! Tell them I didn't do anything! Richard, I want you to listen to me very carefully, OK? A missile carrying a nuclear warhead was launched by this man, Habib Marwan.
not_available Tell me what you know about him.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available CTU has proof that you called him last week.
not_available Last Tuesday at four in the morning.
not_available I don't know any Habib Marwan or anything about a missile.
not_available You have got to believe me.
not_available That missile is in the air now heading toward a city.
not_available Please, Richard, just tell me what you know.
not_available Look, I told you.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available Why'd you make that phone call last week? 
not_available I didn't make a phone call, Audrey.
not_available What's happened with my son so far? We decided to let Audrey talk to him first.
not_available They just started.
not_available Has he confessed anything yet? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Richard, it's not making sense.
not_available That call was made.
not_available Look, I don't know where you get your information, Audrey, but it's all bull.
not_available His readings are spiking.
not_available He's holding something back.
not_available Richard.
not_available Richard, I am begging you to talk to me, all right? If you don't, there is a man who will come in here and he will get the information from you.
not_available I saw him torture someone today.
not_available It's what he's trained to do.
not_available He won't stop hurting you until you tell him the truth.
not_available Please.
not_available Don't let them do this to me.
not_available Tell me what you know and they won't.
not_available I don't know what you want from me.
not_available I don't.
not_available Richard, look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available We have a chance to fix this.
not_available Audrey 
not_available This is not working.
not_available We don't have time to coddle him.
not_available Open up.
not_available I don't care if he is my son.
not_available He's playing games now.
not_available All right, Richard.
not_available This has gone far enough.
not_available Either you tell us what we wanna know, or I will let them use every piece of equipment they have to drag it out of you.
not_available You understand that? 
not_available Dad, don't.
not_available Audrey, leave the room.
not_available Dad, please 
not_available Now! I mean it.
not_available I want you to tell them everything you know.
not_available Don't let them do this to me.
not_available Now, what's it gonna be, Richard? 
not_available Go to hell.
not_available I did nothing wrong.
not_available I don't have to tell you.
not_available There's a nuclear warhead gonna detonate somewhere over this country.
not_available Those lost lives will be on your head.
not_available You will be a murderer! I didn't mean to do anything wrong, I swear.
not_available What did you do, Richard? Tell me what you did.
not_available Look, don't A week ago I was I was at a bar and and there was this girl and her boyfriend, OK? All right.
not_available What were their names? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available They wanted to party and I we we went back to my place.
not_available We got high and then I guess there was time for one of them to make a call on my phone.
not_available How? When we were in bed.
not_available So, while you were in bed with her, he used your phone in the other room? He wasn't the one in the other room, Dad.
not_available I was with him.
not_available She must have been the one that made the call.
not_available So you were set up.
not_available Yeah, I guess so, Dad.
not_available Did they leave you with a number or an address? No.
not_available What kind of a car were they driving? They didn't have one.
not_available I drove.
not_available Where did you drop them off afterwards? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available They took a cab.
not_available You remember the name of the company? No, Dad, I don't.
not_available Get logbooks from every cab company that works in the area.
not_available Get me a sketch artist now.
not_available I'll run it.
not_available Take over.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available So now you know.
not_available I suppose you're even more disgusted with me, huh, Dad? This is not about how you choose to live your life, son.
not_available This is about how you put this country in jeopardy.
not_available If you had told us this yesterday, maybe these attacks would not have occurred.
not_available No.
not_available Don't you put that on me, Dad, cos yesterday I didn't know that night had anything to do with these attacks.
not_available You should've told us everything.
not_available I'll wait outside.
not_available You made a profound mistake today, Richard.
not_available Based on this information, we can start to develop a contingency plan.
not_available You got the cab company? 
not_available Better than that.
not_available We got the cab driver.
not_available He dropped them off at an apartment complex called the Mercerwood.
not_available Did you talk to the manager? 
not_available We gave him a description.
not_available He knows what unit they're in.
not_available Jack, take this.
not_available I'm gonna need Curtis and Castle.
not_available I need Curtis here with me.
not_available Then you gotta give me Tony.
not_available All right.
not_available What about the phone call to Marwan? I analyzed Richard's phone.
not_available The phone call to Marwan activated a listen
not_available in.
not_available He was able to hear all of Richard's calls after that night.
not_available That's why Marwan knew that Heller was visiting Richard.
not_available Anything on the missile? 
not_available We've run military protocol.
not_available So far, nothing.
not_available Is Logan gonna make an announcement? As of now, the president still thinks that would do more harm than good.
not_available Please, as you were, everybody.
not_available Be seated.
not_available Gentlemen and ladies, considering the crisis that we face today, I felt it prudent to enlist the assistance of ex
not_available president Palmer.
not_available In what capacity? 
not_available Excuse me? Everybody in this room has a title and specific function.
not_available Exactly what position will President Palmer be occupying? I'm here solely as an advisor, not only to the president but to anyone who requests my counsel.
not_available He is outside the chain of command, if that's what you're asking.
not_available Asking for a clarification, sir.
not_available The missile carrying the warhead was launched from a location in Iowa.
not_available It's becoming more and more likely that the target is on or near one of the coasts.
not_available It's clearly going to be New York or DC.
not_available Why aren't we evacuating those two cities? I disagree, Jenny.
not_available It's not clear.
not_available And if you start to evacuate these two cities, then you may have an unauthorized mass exodus of Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta The president shouldn't deal with that situation.
not_available Maybe the president should tell us that himself.
not_available Please, Mr.
not_available Speaker.
not_available I've discussed this option with a number of domestic experts, including President Palmer, and that's my assessment as well.
not_available What about air defense? Are we gonna stand by and let these cities' airspace remain undefended? We have a limited number of F
not_available 18 interceptor jets at our disposal.
not_available They need to be augmenting the search for this missile and not deployed in a "wait and see" mode.
not_available Mr.
not_available Palmer, I am sure that we all appreciate your desire to help, but the Constitution has determined who the decision makers should be.
not_available I think you're overstepping your bounds.
not_available In the first place, it's "Mr.
not_available President", Don.
not_available You should address the content of my statements.
not_available David.
not_available You are to be addressed as "President", it's an expression of respect, but not a functional title.
not_available I understand that, but you have to understand I've been through this crisis before.
not_available Yes, but we are here now, the appointed representatives of the people of the US.
not_available Mr.
not_available President 
not_available There will be no more discussion on this.
not_available Your point has been taken.
not_available However, Ashton has made a good point and I wanna address his concerns.
not_available Perhaps it's best if I excuse myself.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available Ladies, gentlemen.
not_available Mr.
not_available Speaker, I think you're right.
not_available We're gonna put those jets over DC and New York.
not_available Did you see it on the inside feed? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It went exactly as you'd hoped.
not_available We won't have any more problems with Don Ashton today.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available We'll monitor everything on three.
not_available Make sure LAPD's there when we land.
not_available We'll need transport to the site.
not_available They've already been called.
not_available OK.
not_available Tony, wait.
not_available I
not_available I can't I can't spend another day without you.
not_available I'm ready to leave here.
not_available I'm ready to go with you.
not_available Tony.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Right.
not_available They're setting up a feed.
not_available Richard will help Jack identify the suspects when they get on site.
not_available Then what? 
not_available Then theyll let him go.
not_available His motives certainly weren't seditious.
not_available Dad, I feel so lost.
not_available I know, sweetheart.
not_available Ms Raines.
not_available Yes.
not_available Jack Bauer's on line two for you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You take it, sweetheart.
not_available I'll be on the floor.
not_available Hello.
not_available Audrey, it's Jack.
not_available I know you don't wanna talk, but I need to say a few things.
not_available All right.
not_available I know with everything that's happened, you've seen me do things that before now you thought were unimaginable.
not_available I would have been happy to skip today.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available But I never believed you could ever love me if you'd known about everything I've done.
not_available Jack, I can't 
not_available Audrey, please, let me finish.
not_available These were the things I was running away from.
not_available That's why I moved to DC.
not_available That's why I stopped doing field work, why I don't work at CTU.
not_available AII I know is that you're back in it and it's too much for me, Jack.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available The last thing I ever wanted to do was push you away from me.
not_available God, Audrey, I love you.
not_available But this is how the job has to be done.
not_available I want you to know how sorry I am that it had to involve you and the people you care about.
not_available Look, you don't have to say anything now.
not_available Please, just promise me as soon as this is over, we can talk about everything that's happened.
not_available Audrey, please.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'm gotta call you back later, OK? All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tactical's got the schematic ready.
not_available What are the approach perimeters? 
not_available They want us to go in from the west.

not_available This is the composite the artist made based on Richard's description.
not_available Get it to Jack.
not_available Will do.
not_available Now can we go? 
not_available We have plenty of time to get to Marwan.
not_available I don't like cutting it this close.
not_available This is a sketch of the guy Richard Heller described.
not_available He and the girl are our only leads to finding Marwan, so once we identify the suspects it is vital we take them alive.
not_available Manning.
not_available Curtis, it's Jack.
not_available We're getting ready to land.
not_available Is everything set? Yeah.
not_available Richard's ready to make a positive ID.

not_available Am I clear? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available OK, let's go.
not_available Ready? 
not_available They found us.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available A helicopter just landed a block away.
not_available So what? 
not_available So, they found us.
not_available Dammit! 
not_available Hey! We can't go together.
not_available Why not? 
not_available One of us has to stay here in the apartment.
not_available Why? 
not_available If they think we're still here, it gives the other a chance to escape.
not_available You gotta be joking.
not_available One of us is gonna get caught to save the other? Exactly.
not_available It's gonna be you.
not_available Do you wanna move in on the apartment now? No.
not_available I want you and Castle to take up positions here on the roof of the main building.
not_available Teams B and C, are you in position? 
not_available Team A set.
not_available Team C in position.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Let's go.
not_available LAPD, I need the entry code for the south gate.
not_available It's: star 4763458.
not_available I'm in.
not_available OK, I've got a visual on the apartment.
not_available There's activity inside.
not_available McAllen, meet me at the door of the apartment.
not_available Have your people cover us.
not_available On my way.
not_available Go.
not_available Go.
not_available Pick it.
not_available OK.

not_available Got it.

not_available Has anybody reported outside movement? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? The man is dead.
not_available The girl is no longer in the apartment.

not_available Roger that.
not_available All teams, hold position.
not_available Charlie, copy that.
not_available Holding steady.
not_available Drop your gun.
not_available Argh! All right.
