
not_available Roger, it's good to see you.
not_available I'd like to talk to you about this meeting.
not_available I don't trust the ambassador.
not_available It's possible that his country's supporting Second Wave.
not_available We want to prevent this incident.
not_available We need access to your files.
not_available I want you to monitor how they use our intel.
not_available It's the ambassador's chopper.
not_available It crashed just after takeoff.
not_available There's a man who needs to talk to you.
not_available Who is he? He's from the Counter Terrorism Agency? I told you, I do not know a Syed Ali.
not_available Then how do you explain that his name is in your personal computer files? There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
not_available Do what I tell you.
not_available Go now.
not_available Miguel, get over here.
not_available There's a nuclear bomb in the city.
not_available Let's get outta here.
not_available Not without Megan.
not_available George, I got to Wald.
not_available I found out who commissioned him to take out CTU.
not_available Who was it? 
not_available It was Nina Myers.
not_available Nina? Nina killed your wife.
not_available I don't want you near her.
not_available I have to grant her a shadow asylum.
not_available That sounds like a pardon, sir.
not_available She has information that could help us find this bomb.
not_available What is it? 
not_available They're gonna let her go.
not_available I know you were exposed to high levels of radioactive materials this morning.
not_available I wanna know what your plans are for Nina.
not_available I want the case.
not_available I know how she thinks.
not_available If you don't do this, I'll tell District about your condition.
not_available They'll replace you.
not_available Palmer just signed the pardon.
not_available So, as soon as it gets here, we'll start the interrogation.
not_available Nina's file.
not_available I don't need it.
not_available The president's here.
not_available Mr.
not_available President Mr.
not_available President, can you give us any details about the helicopter crash? Who was on the aircraft? Any survivors? 
not_available Is it related to the bombing in LA? We can't disclose information about the crash until the families of the victims have been notified.
not_available But I promise you, there will be a careful and thorough investigation.
not_available Mr.
not_available President 
not_available Let's go.
not_available We will be putting out a formal statement as soon as we get those issues resolved, and I ask everyone to refrain from speculation until that time.
not_available No one besides Jenny releases a statement on the crash.
not_available No names, no speculation.
not_available And keep the lid on tight.
not_available Absolutely, sir.
not_available Hello, David.
not_available How did you get in here without my authorisation? We were married for many years.
not_available Many people respect that, even if you don't.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available We have nothing more to talk about.
not_available You're not my wife any more.
not_available It's not about us.
not_available Then what? Not here.
not_available I need to be alone with you.
not_available You know what? Even if I were interested in what you had to say, today is impossible.
not_available You shouldn't have come here.
not_available It's about your administration.
not_available What about it? 
not_available Just give me five minutes.
not_available I don't have time now.
not_available Did you order an evacuation of military personnel out of Los Angeles? Who told you that? Five minutes, David.
not_available Wait here.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available Do we know about the military moving personnel out of LA? No.
not_available Sir, you specifically requested there be no evacuation.
not_available Check into it.
not_available I certainly will.
not_available You're doing business with a known terrorist, and you sit there with a straight face and tell me you don't know what's going on? I grew up in London.
not_available I'm marrying an American girl, a Protestant.
not_available So, if you're going to racially profile me, you should at least get it right.
not_available You ever hear of the Finsbury Park Mosque? It's considered to be one of the main recruitment centers for Islamic terrorists in the West.
not_available Our main targets are European Muslims with western educations, passports, and the potential to blend into western society.
not_available And do you know where that mosque is located? Your hometown London.
not_available So tell me, Reza, how's my racial profiling going now? I want a lawyer.
not_available No.
not_available Did they find the black box yet? 
not_available Not yet, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available How could something like this happen? I don't know.
not_available I've opened a multi
not_available agency investigation.
not_available NTSB is on the way.
not_available Lynne, schedule a call with the prime minister.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I wanna talk to him before rumours start.
not_available But I'm afraid they may not be far from the truth.
not_available This was not an accident.
not_available I'm thinking along the same lines, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The prime minister may not have been happy about the ambassador's cooperation with us.
not_available There's another possibility, Roger.
not_available I'm not following you, sir.
not_available That we did it.
not_available Correct.
not_available That hardly seems likely.
not_available The ambassador took classified information back to his government.
not_available You both thought it was questionable.
not_available And if we were talking about it here, you can bet there are others back in DC who feel even more strongly.
not_available Set up an independent investigator.
not_available Let's find out exactly who was in the loop.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available OK, this is it.
not_available Here we go.
not_available I'll show her this, I'll let her start talking.
not_available Then I'll get you the stuff she doesn't want us to know.
not_available The last time I let you interrogate somebody, you shot him through the heart.
not_available I'm letting you do this, but I hope I'm not making a mistake.
not_available No mistake, George.
not_available All right.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Let's keep this simple.
not_available If you wanna stop the bomb, I need to be on a plane to Visalia now.
not_available Did you pick Visalia for a reason, or would anywhere outside the blast zone work? 
not_available My contact is in Visalia.
not_available Who is it? The only person who can tell us where the bomb is.
not_available I'm not gonna tell you who it is till we get there.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then you can sit here and wait for the blast to hit.
not_available Stop wasting time.
not_available I have the president's signature.
not_available I'm here.
not_available He's not.
not_available And I'm not gonna make a move until I believe you're credible.
not_available I'll only get the pardon if I stop the bomb.
not_available Why wouldn't I do everything I can? Because you're worse than a traitor, Nina.
not_available You don't have a cause.
not_available You don't believe in anything.
not_available But you would sell anyone out to the highest bidder.
not_available So stop wasting my time! Gimme a name! Don't even bother, Jack.
not_available If you lay a hand on me, you'll be taken off the case.
not_available You're just gonna have to follow my lead.
not_available Tell me everything I wanna know, or I swear to God, I will hurt you before I kill you and no one will stop me.
not_available Do you understand? Jack, let her go! Now! 
not_available All right, you're done.
not_available Get outta here.
not_available Why? Why? Because you've lost it! That's why.
not_available Right now she thinks she's won the lottery.
not_available She's in control.
not_available You want her to tell the truth, take that away.
not_available By killing her? That'll work.
not_available By giving her someone to answer to, someone to be afraid of.
not_available She has to believe I'd be willing to put my revenge over finding this bomb.
not_available And you're telling me you're not.
not_available George, it had to look like that.
not_available Look at me.
not_available There's no emotion here.
not_available Now look at her.
not_available What would your next move be? 
not_available You need to let me go back in there, show her that I have the power to do anything I want to her.
not_available If I let you go back in there, you've got 
not_available All I need is five minutes.
not_available Just don't let anyone in that room and raise the thermostat ten degrees.
not_available Are you gonna let me have five minutes? Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available In the latest update, we have Mr.
not_available President requesting We need to talk.
not_available I told you to leave.
not_available Well I'm not leaving.
not_available I'm your sister, and you can stay angry with me, but we need to figure out what we're going to do.
not_available Do about what? The wedding.
not_available We may have to cancel.
not_available That would make you happy, wouldn't it? Isn't that what you wanted all along? No.
not_available Not the marriage, Marie.
not_available Just the wedding.
not_available We can't do it today.
not_available Let me help you take care of it.
not_available You are always pretending you wanna help me.
not_available Pretending? I dropped out of school when Mom died to take care of you, to keep this family together.
not_available So you'd have an excuse for not having a relationship.
not_available "Dad needs me.
not_available Marie needs me.<br>" Now I don't need you any more, you can't handle it! I made sacrifices because 
not_available Then stop! Mom died a long time ago! So get your own life and stay outta mine! We are not cancelling this wedding! She's not in intensive care or the east wing.
not_available She's gotta be up here.
not_available How much time do we have to this nuke? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What if Megan doesn't wanna come with us? I don't know.
not_available That's him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Matheson? The MRI confirmed that the pressure on the brain was the result of the concussion.
not_available Meaning? That we won't release her until questions about the sources of her injuries are resolved.
not_available Of course.
not_available Listen, I just wanna do what's best for my little girl.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll check in on her at the end of my rounds.
not_available And, Mr.
not_available Matheson, no cellphones in the hospital.
not_available They interfere with the equipment.
not_available Of course.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Daddy, are you still mad at me? No, sweetie, no.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available Daddy's just tired.
not_available You need to get dressed, OK? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Matheson's office.
not_available Chelsea, it's me.
not_available Do something for me.
not_available Book me two seats on the next flight to Mexico City.
not_available But you have a meeting 
not_available I know.
not_available I'm asking you to cancel it.
not_available What about your five o'clock? 
not_available Cancel everything.
not_available Who is the man in Visalia? Who is the man in Visalia? Mamud Faheen.
not_available The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen.
not_available That's not news! We've got his name! But you don't know where he is.
not_available I do.
not_available What's the history of the relationship? 
not_available He introduced me to Wald.
not_available So Wald could buy the schematics for CTU and blow it up as a diversion? I didn't know it was part of a plan to detonate a nuclear device.
not_available Then why are you so sure Faheen's involved? I heard hints that he was involved in something in Los Angeles.
not_available Something substantial.
not_available Where is he in Visalia now? I'm not gonna give you his location until we get there.
not_available If you could get to him, you wouldn't need me.
not_available My deal would do me no good if I'm dead.
not_available Get me Visalia.
not_available Sir Sherry was right.
not_available An evacuation of military personnel began about an hour ago, which means it is well under way.
not_available Do we know where this order came from? 
not_available Yes, we do, sir.
not_available Roger Stanton.
not_available Countermand the evacuation.
not_available All forces already moving are to return to their bases immediately.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Roger.
not_available My office, please.
not_available Janet? Hi, this is Lynne.
not_available I'm gonna need contacts for the following bases: Point Mugu, Camp Pendleton.
not_available I got word that military resources were being moved out of LA.
not_available Yes.
not_available On your order.
not_available Yes.
not_available I was implementing the plan.
not_available I assumed you authorised it.
not_available No, I told Rayburn not to trigger any evacuation.
not_available I should have double
not_available checked everything Rayburn told me before I took any action.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it's inexcusable.
not_available I take full responsibility.
not_available We'll worry about that later.
not_available I just told Lynne to countermand the evacuation order.
not_available Make sure it happens immediately.
not_available Right away, sir.
not_available Can I help you, Mr.
not_available President? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Tell Sherry I'll meet her in 20 minutes.
not_available You know how much Daddy loves you, don't you? And you know how sorry I am that my little angel ever got hurt, right? Listen, pal, we're leaving now, OK? So if anybody tries to talk to you, you just you don't say a word.
not_available OK? Just pretend you're asleep.
not_available You can do that, right? 
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available Mr.
not_available Matheson? There's a call for you.
not_available A call? 
not_available You can take it at the nurse's station.
not_available Why can't I take it in here? Because we don't have phones in the rooms unless you order one.
not_available You stay there, OK? Megan, don't move.
not_available Looks like she'll be fine.
not_available OK.
not_available OK? Just running a few other tests.
not_available Is it gonna be much longer? The phone's right in there.
not_available So let's go take a look, OK? 
not_available This is Gary Matheson.
not_available Mr.
not_available Matheson? Yeah, who is this? 
not_available This is Trey in Accounts Receivable.
not_available Our computers crashed, and we lost a lot of your billing information.
not_available So if we could just go over it again Can we do this another time, please? 
not_available No, we need it now, sir.
not_available I can send someone up to your daughter's room.
not_available No.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available Hi, Kim.
not_available Hi, sweetie.
not_available Listen, do you trust me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I need to get you outta here.
not_available All I can tell you is I'm doing this because I love you and I want you to be safe.
not_available OK? OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available The expiration date? 
not_available It expires March 2007, OK? Great.
not_available Now if we could just go over your billing address.
not_available You know what? I'll come down later.
not_available Mr.
not_available Matheson? Megan? 
not_available My daughter's gone.
not_available Did you try the bathroom? 
not_available Yes.
not_available She's not there.
not_available She might have been taken to radiology.
not_available Well, find out where she is.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Dr Shapiro, 2262.
not_available Dr Shapiro, 2262.
not_available Where are we going, Kim? 
not_available I told you, you have to trust me.
not_available I just got off the phone.
not_available Come on.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available I don't wanna go.
not_available My daddy's gonna get really mad, and then he's gonna hurt me.
not_available I don't wanna go.
not_available We need to go because your dad is hurting you.
not_available And your mom is trying to stop him, but she can't.
not_available He's gonna keep hurting you unless you leave with us.
not_available That's the only way anyone is gonna stop him.
not_available Do you understand me? Your daughter's not with any of the departments.
not_available Then where is she? 
not_available I'm trying to figure that out.
not_available Did you see anyone near her room? 
not_available No! Call security! Find me my daughter! Megan, I need you to breathe and calm down and stop crying, so we can leave now.
not_available OK? Come on.
not_available I miss my mom.
not_available I want my mom! I know.
not_available Come on with me.
not_available I know.
not_available Look out for a nineyear
not_available old girl with blonde hair, striped top and blue jeans.
not_available I've got Third Street, west door covered.
not_available In there.
not_available Just got a team on the ground in Visalia, and more coming in from Fresno.
not_available Division's loaned us some men, so I'm sending Miller along with you.
not_available I can handle her myself.
not_available That's not what I'm worried about.
not_available Do you think I'd sentence millions to death just for the satisfaction of killing her? I'll do my job.
not_available I'm just sending Miller along to make sure of that.
not_available You should go be with your family.
not_available You should get on a plane.
not_available I'll call you when we're in the air.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available David How did you find out about the military evacuation? I made some phone calls.
not_available Just following up on a rumour.
not_available I can't tell you any more than that.
not_available You will tell me more, and I will not ask you again.
not_available I am not a member of your staff, David.
not_available I am your wife.
not_available Ex
not_available wife, and you will tell me because the safety and security of this country is more important than your power plays.
not_available You know, despite everything that's happened, I love you.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available No, I always will.
not_available Whether you believe it or not, everything that I have done has been in your best interest.
not_available If you won't give me a second chance at your heart, let me help in the ways you know I can.
not_available And I can't help you, David, unless you give me some idea of what you're facing.
not_available I was able to find something your own staff couldn't find.
not_available I didn't have to warn you.
not_available I came here on my own accord.
not_available Terrorists have planned a strike against Los Angeles.
not_available NSA thinks it'll be today.
not_available What kind of strike? Nuclear.
not_available Oh, my G Oh, my God.
not_available Talk to me, Sherry.
not_available Come on.
not_available I got the information about the military evacuation from someone inside the defence department.
not_available Who? A high
not_available level staffer.
not_available He's in the loop.
not_available He owed me a favour.
not_available But there's something more important.
not_available He also told me that there are members of your own administration allying against you.
not_available They want control of your presidency.
not_available That's why I came here today.
not_available Who, Sherry? People who disagree with your policies, who want to impose their will on the country.
not_available There have been deals made under the table, David.
not_available Back
not_available room promises.
not_available Now, I can keep digging, find out.
not_available If you want my help.
not_available If I accept your help, it won't be about us.
not_available It'll be about doing what's best for the country.
not_available Sweetheart, you can call it anything you want.
not_available I'll get you a secure line and a private place to make your calls.
not_available Then I'll come to you as soon as I find out more.
not_available This had better not be one of your manipulations.
not_available The stakes are too high.
not_available Dad? Hm? 
not_available Reza's parents are here.
not_available I'm on the phone to your grandmother.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Oh! You're here! Welcome.
not_available So nice to see you, Kate.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The house looks beautiful.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available Well you must be tired.
not_available Let's go into the living room.
not_available OK.
not_available So, how is everyone holding up? Not too bad.
not_available Where is Reza? Um, well, there's a small problem we're dealing with.
not_available What kind of problem? Um, some men from the government are here talking to him.
not_available About? 
not_available It's a criminal investigation.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available It's very complicated.
not_available Kate, what is going on? 
not_available It would be best if Reza told you himself.
not_available Told us what? They're talking to Reza about his possible involvement in terrorist activities.
not_available That is absurd! 
not_available This must be a mistake.
not_available That's what they're trying to find out.
not_available You see? Your country, you talk about tolerance, you talk about freedom, but you treat every Middle Easterner like terrorist! No! No, of course not.
not_available I'm sure it'll all get sorted out.
not_available Rima, Hassan 
not_available Bob, do you know about this? They just showed up about an hour ago.
not_available I know nothing else.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm sure it's nothing.
not_available Wait for me in the parking lot.
not_available If it's more than ten minutes, it means they caught me, so take off without me.
not_available You can't let them.
not_available We are gonna leave all together.
not_available OK? Miguel.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Are you OK to walk by yourself? Yeah? Good girl.
not_available Hey! Hey! I got a male Hispanic, early 20s, running out with a computer monitor.
not_available Hey, come on! Shh.
not_available Go that way! So, Ed, how are ya? Don't bother, Nina.
not_available I'm here because I have to be, not because I'm your friend.
not_available You're here because they think, after I help stop the bomb, Jack will try to kill me.
not_available Which, of course, he will.
not_available And what if you can't stop him? I mean, no offense, but, Ed, let's face it, you're no match for Jack.
not_available You're just not that ruthless.
not_available So he manages to get around you and pull the trigger.
not_available What happens then? Because of the pardon, he knows if he kills me, he'll spend the rest of his life in jail.
not_available Jack, if you have some way to shut her up I'm not thinking of Of course, Jack's mind is thinking "That's not such a bad deal.<br>" Small price to pay to avenge his wife's death.
not_available But what about his daughter? Is he thinking about her? She's already lost one parent.
not_available If he kills me, she'll have no one.
not_available Jack knows I'm right.
not_available He should just use me to stop the bomb, and then go home to Kim.
not_available She needs you, Jack.
not_available I didn't transfer that money.
not_available You transferred it into that account.
not_available I didn't! Then you better tell me who did, or I'm taking you in! Why are you doing this? Friends of mine who were doing their best to protect the citizens of this country were murdered today probably by the same people you're funding! That a good enough reason for you? I told you before I don't know anything else.
not_available Your parents.
not_available All right, stand up, Reza.
not_available Place your hands behind your head.
not_available It's a shame.
not_available It's gonna break their heart.
not_available I have to walk you right past them.
not_available And they're gonna see who their son really is.
not_available Wait! I confirmed the transfers, but I didn't make them.
not_available I was just covering the records.
not_available I didn't want him to get into trouble.
not_available Who? Who are you covering for? Come on, who transferred that money into Syed Ali's accounts? Bob Warner.
not_available Marie's father.
not_available What? What's the matter? 
not_available I don't feel very well.
not_available Come on, Miguel.
not_available Get away from us! Give her to me, or I will make sure you go to prison for 20 years.
not_available I know how she got hurt.
not_available That was an accident! Like Carla's bruises? 
not_available It's OK.
not_available Miguel Let's just get outta here.
not_available Get his car keys.
not_available Reza.
not_available Sweetheart, angel.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yes.
not_available They know I didn't do anything.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available We can get married today.
not_available I don't know, sweetheart.
not_available Mr.
not_available Warner.
not_available Could you follow me, please, sir? What does this have to do with me? 
not_available Just come with me, please.
not_available What did you tell them? The truth.
not_available The truth? What do you mean, the truth? 
not_available Please, my parents are very upset.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available The team's in Visalia.
not_available We'll have tactical and field units.
not_available We have confirmation that they're in place? Probably in the air.
not_available We'll have air traffic, um Air traffic priority? Yeah Tra Jack It's all right, Ed.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Just take it easy.
