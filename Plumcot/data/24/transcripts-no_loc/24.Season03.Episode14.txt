
not_available Previously on 24 Tony Almeida from CTU has just informed us that they were unable to confiscate this Cordilla virus in Mexico.
not_available This man Amador, where is he now? Latest working theory is that Amador has this virus, and is headed back here to Los Angeles.
not_available I let you live.
not_available Tell me what you know.
not_available Any time Amador does business on the west coast, he washes his deal through a man named Alvers.
not_available How does Amador contact this Alvers? I don't know.
not_available I've never met him.
not_available Hello? Marcus, it's me.
not_available I'll be there in an hour.
not_available Got the virus? Yes.
not_available Just be ready.
not_available I will be.
not_available I got to go see Julia Milliken.
not_available No.
not_available I don't want you to go anywhere near her or Alan tonight.
not_available Do you think I'm scared of you? Julia My pills.
not_available No, don't.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Don't.
not_available Sherry? 
not_available This is your way out.
not_available We killed him.
not_available No.
not_available There's one thing you're going to have to be really clear about, when the authorities come around questioning you.
not_available I was never here.
not_available The following takes place between 2:00 a.m.
not_available and 3:00 a.m.
not_available Point Mugu Naval Air Station I got her.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available Yeah? I'm Jason Carusone from Division.
not_available These men will be escorting the prisoner back to CTU.
not_available She doesn't leave my sight.
not_available I know.
not_available You can accompany her in the lead van.
not_available Let's go! This is Carusone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, he's right here.
not_available Agent Edmunds.
not_available It's Chloe O'brian from your office.
not_available Hey, Jack, I'll take another car.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, Chloe? Chase, they found out.
not_available Who found out what? Everybody here found out about Angela.
not_available They all know she's your daughter.
not_available What? How? The baby
not_available sitter flaked.
not_available She had a family emergency and brought her here.
not_available You brought Angela into CTU? What was I supposed to do? Your sister's out of town.
not_available There is no one else.
not_available You have no idea what I've been through in the past couple of hours.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available Chloe, thank you for covering.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available But where is Angela right now? She's downstairs with Marcy until you get back.
not_available Did Kim find out? Chloe, did Kim find out? Yes, yes, Kim found out.
not_available How did she react? Uh, gosh, Chase, I think she's kind of pissed.
not_available All right, listen.
not_available I'm coming back to CTU right now.
not_available I'll take care of everything.
not_available Bye.
not_available Here's the situation: We believe Michael Amador is in possession of the Cordilla virus.
not_available We believe he is either headed to LosAngeles or he's here already.
not_available We estimate he has enough of the pathogen to take out a major metropolitan area.
not_available Our only lead is Nina Myers, who's being brought back to CTU right now.
not_available She thinks Amador is meeting with a man here in Los Angeles by the name of Marcus Alvers.
not_available Adam's done a workup on him.
not_available We have some background, but there's nothing that places him definitively in Los Angeles today.
not_available That's it? What about interpol? What do they have on Alvers? Our data tracking's a little behind, so we weren't able to access that report.
not_available Why are we behind? We didn't update the European contact logs while I was down.
not_available Michelle, you were the ranking agent.
not_available I didn't think Europe was a priority.
not_available Obviously it was.
not_available There was a lot going on at the time.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available And let's try to ease up on the mistakes for the rest of the night as there are millions of lives depending on us.
not_available Michelle Come.
not_available I just got off with CTU.
not_available What's the status on the virus? Well, it's not good.
not_available The limited intelligence they have supports their original suspicion.
not_available It's on its way to Los Angeles.
not_available David, it may already be here.
not_available Then we should be prepared in case they target other cities.
not_available Our people in the security envelope have been alerted.
not_available Trust me, it's being handled.
not_available Now, why don't you try and go get some rest? I'm on this.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Mrs.
not_available Palmer's here to see you.
not_available Send her in, please.
not_available Start waking people up.
not_available Set up a conference call with the appropriate cabinet members: Homeland security, FBI, National Health Services.
not_available We're going to need everyone on this one.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Wayne? Sherry, I asked you here to help me, not make things worse.
not_available I did not want you going to Alan Milliken's house.
not_available Well, relax, David.
not_available I didn't go there.
not_available You didn't go? 
not_available No.
not_available When we spoke on the phone, you told me it was crucial that you speak to Julia in person.
not_available Yes, and I changed my mind.
not_available I
not_available I spoke to her over the phone.
not_available About what? About Kelly's disappearance.
not_available I asked her if she would check Alan's cell phone and see if there were any recently made calls.
not_available And? She wouldn't do it.
not_available You don't take no for an answer, Sherry.
not_available What aren't you telling me? Nothing, David, I swear.
not_available What have you been up to since we last talked if you weren't at Milliken's? Making calls.
not_available You could have made them from here.
not_available Yes, but I didn't.
not_available I parked on the side of the road, I started making calls because I didn't want to wait.
not_available I told you we have a small window of opportunity here.
not_available I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly.
not_available All right.
not_available I have other things to attend to.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is there anything else? That's it.
not_available Hello, Nina.
not_available Take her to interrogation 819.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's the security configuration? Don't worry about it, Jack.
not_available We're handling Nina.
not_available Ryan, you know what she's capable of.
not_available That's none of your concern right now.
not_available I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I don't think you are.
not_available What's this about? We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
not_available Tell me I'm off here, Jack.
not_available Tell me I'm wrong.
not_available I didn't think so.
not_available Ryan, I haven't missed a step.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I have to cover my ass.
not_available I need to get you checked out.
not_available You're wasting time.
not_available Kim.
not_available Yeah? I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
not_available What about Chase? Uh, he's a few minutes behind.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Kim.
not_available Dad.
not_available Oh, god.
not_available Hi.
not_available She's here.
not_available I know, sweetheart.
not_available I know.
not_available Come here.
not_available Look, I have to debrief Chappelle.
not_available I'll see you in a minute, okay? Dad, I know about your drug problem.
not_available Why didn't you come to me with this? Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available I'm sorry, baby.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was embarrassed.
not_available And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't.
not_available I didn't want you to worry.
not_available Well, is it over? No, not exactly.
not_available I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
not_available We'll talk about this later, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I love you.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'm glad you're back.
not_available It's been difficult without you.
not_available Thanks, Chloe.
not_available Chase.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Need to talk to you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why don't you take a few minutes and come to my office.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Mr.
not_available Milliken? Mr.
not_available Milliken? Oh, my god.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Milliken! Come quickly! Quickly! Hey.
not_available How's the hand? It's fine.
not_available How'd Chappelle find out? I don't know, it doesn't really matter.
not_available What's going on out there? Almeida's going to be interrogating Nina, and I'll follow it from a feed.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available Make sure Tony puts double security on the doors.
not_available Get back to me as soon as she gives you anything.
not_available Agent Bauer, keep pressure here.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack, you're about to find something out about me that's not going to make you happy.
not_available What are you talking about? Excuse me.
not_available Do you mind? I've got a daughter.
not_available A daughter? 
not_available It was sprung on me a month ago.
not_available Her mother dropped her off, and she split.
not_available It's a long story.
not_available Does Kim know about this? Yeah.
not_available From you? I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
not_available You square this with her, Chase, you understand me? Just make that right.
not_available And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
not_available I will.
not_available Are we up yet? Yep.
not_available Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription.
not_available We're all set.
not_available Nick, do you copy? 
not_available Yeah, I read you.
not_available We're ready to go.
not_available All right, recording to hard drive now.
not_available So, Tony's doing this? Yeah.
not_available Is that going to be weird for you? What do you mean? Didn't
not_available didn't he and Nina go out? Yeah.
not_available We set? Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available I want you to do a hi
not_available res on her eyes.
not_available She's tired.
not_available We might be able to pick up a tell.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, we all right? Yeah.
not_available We're fine.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available I got the hi
not_available res on monitor two.
not_available Tony.
not_available Didn't know I was gonna see you today.
not_available You know what we want.
not_available We need to find Michael Amador before he unloads the virus.
not_available I've already told Jack everything I know.
not_available Well, I want you to tell me.
not_available First Jack, now you.
not_available Hmm what does that remind me of? You told Jack that Amador might try to contact a Marcus Alvers.
not_available So, where do we look for Alvers? That's a nice ring.
not_available Who's the lucky girl? Hope you did a background check, though, 'cause you don't want to make the same mistake twice.
not_available You're going back to prison.
not_available There's a good chance you'll be executed as a traitor.
not_available Now you know if you cooperate, you may be able to save your own life, but you're stalling.
not_available Which means you know something and you still think there's a play you can make, only now's not the right time.
not_available Very incisive.
not_available I hope your wife appreciates that about you.
not_available Why don't you tell me about Alvers? All I know is that he works only with Amador.
not_available I don't know him personally.
not_available All we've been able to dig up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known aliases.
not_available He had an MRI on one of his knees, there's a prescription for antibiotics, treated for HIV Her pulse is spiking.
not_available Someone hasn't been using protection with Marcus Alvers.
not_available She's probably had sex with him.
not_available See, Nina, my colleagues in the next room tell me that something in those medical records concerns you.
not_available I'm guessing it's not the knee.
not_available I'm here to see Alvers.
not_available Marcus.
not_available Michael.
not_available How was your trip? Interesting.
not_available I still don't understand why you risked so much down in Mexico, why you didn't come here directly.
not_available made it worth the risk.
not_available What about Nina? If she wasn't killed by the bomb, I'm sure our buyers took care of her once they found out she didn't deliver the virus.
not_available Either way, she's out of the picture.
not_available I hope so.
not_available She can point to both of us.
not_available We'll be long gone before anyone starts looking.
not_available Kim.
not_available Look, I know we haven't talked since I got back.
not_available No, we haven't.
not_available I know what you must be thinking, but you need to give me a chance to explain.
not_available I don't know what to think.
not_available Look, I'm happy that you're okay, but this thing you have a baby, Chase.
not_available We've been together for more than three months, and you kept this secret from me.
not_available Who's the mother? Where does she fit into this? That's what I want to talk to you about.
not_available I didn't know I had a daughter until a month ago.
not_available How could you not know? Angela's mother and I went out last year.
not_available Okay, it's over.
not_available And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant.
not_available Now she calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby, and that I'm the father.
not_available And she's in trouble, and she can't handle it.
not_available I was afraid to let people find out.
not_available I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
not_available But you told Chloe.
not_available Chloe and my sister have been helping me take care of the baby.
not_available She's a good friend.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Chase? You wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Kim, I'm just as confused as you are.
not_available But all I know is that I love you.
not_available And I'm falling in love with Angela, too.
not_available And I need to make this work.
not_available Go on.
not_available What's happening with Nina in interrogation? They're getting something.
not_available What? The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deeper than we thought.
not_available You'd better hope she's not just spinning your wheels, because she knows how to manipulate our interrogation protocol.
not_available Tony knows what he's doing.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Look, I need to get together with Chloe.
not_available I need everything that she's got on the Amador investigation.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Ryan, look, you're wasting my time.
not_available Now, I humored you with the physical.
not_available And we both know that my blood work's gonna come back with trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough.
not_available Rae Plachecki from the inspector general's office is here.
not_available She wants to talk to you.
not_available Well, this is not the time.
not_available Actually, it is.
not_available You'll talk to her, then we'll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not.
not_available Come on.
not_available Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available You know the drill, Jack.
not_available I'm gonna ask you some questions, but I want you to know, I'm on your side.
not_available We just want to establish that this heroin addiction was a necessary part of your cover.
not_available It was necessary to maintain my cover.
not_available Are we done now? Sit down, Jack.
not_available This is Rae Plachecki.
not_available The time is 2:31 A.M.
not_available This is the interrogation of Jack Bauer, director of field ops, CTU.
not_available Ryan Chappelle is present.
not_available Jack, tell us how you established your cover with Ramon Salazar.
not_available I first came in contact with the Salazars approximately two years ago.
not_available They were an upand
not_available coming narcotic cartel, coming out of Mexico.
not_available So, when did you meet Amador? Did you know him when you were working at CTU? Tell me something, Nina, what kind of a deal you think you're gonna cut? You've betrayed everybody you know, including me.
not_available You murdered Jack's wife.
not_available You helped terrorists smuggle a nuclear bomb into this country.
not_available You're helping to unleash a deadly virus into the general population.
not_available Help me understand this.
not_available What do you want? What is it you get out of being a mass murderer? Your neck is bleeding.
not_available Dalton, what do you got? So far, the only reactions we're getting from her are subliminal.
not_available If she's not gonna say anything, we need to be more plugged in to her vitals.
not_available We can take her down to seven, give her a passive response test.
not_available Seven's not secure enough.
not_available She stays here.
not_available Where's Richards? He's waiting.
not_available All right, let's bring him in.
not_available Send Darren in.
not_available Nina, I don't think you've met Darren Richards.
not_available He joined us after you left.
not_available Hello, Darren.
not_available Don't take it personally.
not_available He doesn't talk much.
not_available Uh, something's not connecting up for me, Jack.
not_available You say that you weren't in with the Salazars until early February, but the first time you started using was late December.
not_available That's six weeks of shooting up for the benefit of no one.
not_available Am I missing something? I was trying to pass myself off as a junkie.
not_available I wanted to be prepared.
not_available What do you mean, "prepared"? The Salazars lived their entire lives in the drug world.
not_available If I couldn't handle the narcotics that went with that territory, they'd have known I was a cop, and they'd have killed me.
not_available I needed to be able to handle it.
not_available Yeah, that makes sense, but in January, when you were putting needles in your arm, you didn't have a meeting on the books with these guys
not_available it could have been a year, for all you knew.
not_available What are you saying? I am trying to establish incontrovertible evidence that you did drugs as part of your cover
not_available if I submit what you just told me, it's not gonna hold up, Jack.
not_available What do you want me to say?! I did drugs to get in with these people, and I got in with them! And no matter how difficult it's been, I don't use anymore.
not_available Look, I'll write it up that way, and maybe it'll fly, but I just think you're gonna have a problem because you never told anyone, not even your partner.
not_available That's suspicious.
not_available Rae, you know my history.
not_available I've had a very difficult time since my wife passed away.
not_available If I'd told anyone that I was using drugs to develop a case, they would have misinterpreted, and I couldn't afford that risk.
not_available Yeah, well, that's what they're gonna do now.
not_available Rae, let's put down that Jack started using heroin in late January, after the first meeting with Salazar was established.
not_available I appreciate what you're trying to do, Ryan, but that's not what happened.
not_available Just trying to save us all some paperwork.
not_available I'm okay with that.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I started using in December.
not_available I've got nothing to hide.
not_available This office demands results, and that's what I provide: Results.
not_available Fine.
not_available Can I get back to work? Not quite yet, Jack.
not_available No, it's secure and we have it.
not_available It will be as arranged.
not_available He'll be here in an hour.
not_available Just as long as we have enough time to leave the country before they let this virus out.
not_available Please be seated.
not_available Five hours ago, I went public with a statement that there was a domestic terror threat, but it had passed.
not_available And now it appears that that was premature.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, do we or do we not have a threat of this virus being released? Sir, I'm afraid we can't answer that question with any kind of certainty.
not_available What can you tell me, Mr.
not_available Hammond? What few leads we have indicate that Michael Amador has the virus and is in Los Angeles.
not_available For what purpose, we can't say.
not_available Then we have to prepare for defensive action here in Los Angeles.
not_available And for that matter, in all of our major cities.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, you know our position here at homeland security.
not_available We think being forthright with the public and making such preparations in the open is the correct course.
not_available Again, we have to assess the downside of that course.
not_available I have no problem with that, Mr.
not_available President, as long as we realize we are working against a clock.
not_available I want all departments present to work up an open versus covert containment strategy and report back to me in 30 minutes.
not_available In the meantime, I want Health Services to issue guidelines, but only to be distributed internally.
not_available That is all.
not_available I'll be in my office.
not_available David.
not_available Give us a second, please, Aaron.
not_available Of course, sir.
not_available Secret Service just received a phone call from the west Los Angeles police department.
not_available Alan Milliken is dead.
not_available What? He was found 15 minutes ago in his home.
not_available All signs point to a heart attack.
not_available It isn't possible.
not_available Well, apparently, it is.
not_available You told me Sherry was on her way over there about an hour ago.
not_available She changed her mind.
not_available Made some phone calls from her car.
not_available Came straight back here.
not_available David, is that what she told you? Yeah.
not_available And where is she now? Resting.
not_available Aaron, take me to Sherry.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available She's right this way.
not_available Hasn't your shift ended? I stayed on.
not_available I sense it's a difficult day, and I wanted to be here for you.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Right in there, sir.
not_available Sherry.
not_available David.
not_available What's wrong? Alan Milliken is dead.
not_available What? How? Why don't you tell me? What do you mean? I told you, I didn't go there.
not_available I know what you told me.
not_available You sat in your car, you made some phone calls, and you came straight here.
not_available Yes, and that's the truth.
not_available Then you won't mind the police checking your cell phone and the car you used tonight.
not_available You know you asked me to take care of a problem, and I did.
not_available If you want the police to check phone logs, then have them check yours first.
not_available Because remember? You called me tonight.
not_available I am here because of you, David.
not_available What happened, Sherry? I went over to the house just to speak to Julia.
not_available Alan interrupted us.
not_available There was an argument and he had a heart attack.
not_available There's going to be an investigation.
not_available You're going to have to tell the truth about this.
not_available The truth isn't going to save either one of us.
not_available All they're going to hear is that I was there on your behalf to prevent Alan from meddling with your presidency, and that he died from natural causes.
not_available Now, how do you think that's going to play out in the New York Times for the next six months? What did you do to Alan? Honestly, David, nothing.
not_available Absolutely nothing.
not_available Kim, I transferred that feed to your system.
not_available Do you want me to pull it up for you now? Yeah I don't think she's going to give them anything.
not_available We're going to have to find Marcus Alvers by ourselves.
not_available What can I do? Um, I followed up on some of those Asian connections, but in the meantime, there's something I want you to look at.
not_available It's a long shot.
not_available What is it? A list of cities where Marcus Alvers has been in the last three years.
not_available Each time only for a couple of days.
not_available Maybe he was meeting somebody.
not_available Cross it with the other suspects in our database.
not_available Let me know what you come up with, okay? Okay.
not_available Look, I don't know why we have to go through this again.
not_available I already answered that.
not_available What is it, Edmunds? Just wanted to give you an update on Nina.
not_available Rae, could you pause that? She give us anything new on Alvers? No, other than the probability she knew him personally.
not_available She's not cooperating.
not_available What are we doing? Richards is working on her now.
not_available I think that's a mistake.
not_available Why? /I don't think anybody should be in there that hasn't worked with her before, doesn't know what she's capable of.
not_available She'll manipulate him.
not_available All Richards does is inflict pain.
not_available There's no way for her to manipulate him.
not_available All right.
not_available How much more of this you want to endure, Nina? I think this is about it.
not_available She hit an artery! 
not_available Michelle, call medical! No, she's bleeding too much.
not_available We got to take her there now! Tell security! 
not_available We need someone from medical.
not_available Interrogation room 819.
not_available Uncuff her.
not_available Now! So what did Sherry have to say? That Alan had a heart attack.
not_available And you believe her? I'd be a fool to believe anything Sherry says to save herself.
not_available But murder? I can't imagine she'd do that.
not_available David, we can't allow ourselves to be caught off guard this time.
not_available Now we have to assume the worst.
not_available Then we'd also have to assume that Julia was somehow involved.
not_available What? Whoa, whoa, listen.
not_available David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not the same kind of person that Sherry is.
not_available When we find out all the facts, we'll proceed from there.
not_available I have to go over the morning brief with Jerry.
not_available All right.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Julia, it's me.
not_available Wayne? I just heard about Alan, and I are you alone? The police are here.
not_available I'm was just going to speak with one of the officers.
not_available All right, tell me what happened.
not_available Wayne, Sherry was here when it happened, but she told me not to tell the police.
not_available Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly what happened over there, all right? We were talking with Alan.
not_available He got excited, then he started to gasp for air.
not_available He gets angina.
not_available So you called 911, right? No, no.
not_available I
not_available I tried to give him his medication.
not_available What do you mean you tried? Sherry stopped me.
not_available I went to help Alan, but she grabbed my arm.
not_available I just stood there.
not_available I
not_available I couldn't, I couldn't move.
not_available I I 
not_available I killed him, Wayne.
not_available Shh, shh, shh.
not_available All right, listen to me carefully, all right? I killed him.
not_available Call Alan's lawyer, and do not say anything, anything to anyone until he gets there.
not_available You understand me? Wayne, could you come down here and help me? No, and please don't call me.
not_available I will help you, Julia, I will, but for right now I have to keep my distance, I'm sorry.
not_available Excuse me, coming through.
not_available Let's move, right here.
not_available Okay, swing it.
not_available Come on, come on, let's go! One, two, three.
not_available Carotid's been lacerated.
not_available Start a twilight drip.
not_available Yes, doctor.
