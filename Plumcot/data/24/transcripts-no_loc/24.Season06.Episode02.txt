
not_available Mr President, my analysts believe Assad's organisation cannot survive without him, and once he's dead, the attacks will stop.
not_available CTU needs to eliminate Assad.
not_available That's all there is to it.
not_available God knows we're paying a steep enough price to get him.
not_available We were contacted four days ago by a man named Fayed.
not_available He offered to give us Assad's location for a list of demands.
not_available One of them was Jack Bauer.
not_available We're asking you to sacrifice yourself so we can eliminate Assad.
not_available The reason why I fought to stay alive in China was because I didn't want to die for nothing.
not_available Today I can die for something.
not_available You kept your end of the deal, I'll keep mine.
not_available I have a transponder at Assad's location.
not_available Have Bowen mobilise the helicopters.
not_available I'll tell the president we're a go.
not_available CTU is about to kill the wrong man.
not_available Assad isn't behind these attacks.
not_available He's come here to stop them.
not_available He's come here to stop me.
not_available Get out of my house.
not_available This kid's father's a terrorist.
not_available He's no more of a terrorist than you or me.
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available The FBI.
not_available They took my father.
not_available Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's well hidden.
not_available You need to deliver it soon.
not_available Get in there! Find him! Wait.
not_available We have to go.
not_available Not until we find Bauer.
not_available We're not here to kill one American, we're here to kill thousands.
not_available But he knows the truth.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available By the time Bauer tells anyone, it will be too late.
not_available Assad will be dead and we'll be free to finish what we started.
not_available Fayed, listen to me.
not_available If we don't leave now, we'll jeopardise the mission.
not_available All right.
not_available This our target? 
not_available This is where Fayed says Assad is now.
not_available Heat signature? 
not_available They're shielded.
not_available We can't tell how many are in there.
not_available If there's anyone in there at all.
not_available Fayed lied to us.
not_available And Jack bought the farm for nothing.
not_available Shut up, Milo.
not_available What's her problem? Jack's a friend of hers.
not_available It hurt her that he died that way.
not_available You might want to attenuate your thoughtless remarks once in a while.
not_available Two Cobra attack helicopters are being launched.
not_available They'll hit Assad's location in 15 minutes.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available What is it? Jack Bauer's calling in.
not_available Line two.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available Thank God you're alive.
not_available What happened? Listen.
not_available We do not have a lot of time.
not_available I need you to call off the air strike.
not_available Why? You're going after the wrong man.
not_available Assad is not responsible for the bombings.
not_available Where did you get this information? 
not_available I'll explain when you call it off.
not_available I don't have the power to rescind a presidential order, Jack.
not_available Put me through to the president.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available Jack Bill, trust me.
not_available Just put me through to the White House.
not_available All right.
not_available Stay on the line.
not_available Bill Buchanan for the president.
not_available Priority three.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Bill? 
not_available There's new information regarding the air strike on Assad.
not_available I'm on the line with Jack Bauer.
not_available He escaped from Fayed.
not_available What? How? I'm not sure, but he's requesting that we abort the air strike against Assad.
not_available For what possible reason, Bill? 
not_available He says Assad is not behind the attacks.
not_available Bill, that's insane.
not_available What is Jack basing this on? He wants to talk directly to the president.
not_available Put him on.
not_available You're on the line, Jack.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Jack We don't have a lot of time.
not_available Did Bill explain about Assad? Yes, he has, but we're all sceptical here.
not_available What's Assad doing in this country? 
not_available Trying to stop them, trying to stop Fayed.
not_available So you're saying that Fayed is carrying out these bombings? Yes, sir.
not_available Fayed admitted to me that Assad is planning to renounce terrorism.
not_available He's trying to mainstream his organisation, bring them into politics.
not_available Fayed wants to stop that.
not_available Fayed is behind these attacks.
not_available Jack, this is inconsistent with His organisation has waged nonstop war against the West.
not_available He's responsible for hundreds of deaths.
not_available I am aware of Assad's history, and I am still telling you that there is sufficient cause to call off this strike.
not_available What if we change to a ground assault? Sir, we cannot afford a ground assault.
not_available We have to take him out while we've got the chance.
not_available Mr President, if Jack is right, it's a risk we have to take.
not_available Jack has been in a Chinese prison for 20 months.
not_available His ability to assess this situation is highly questionable.
not_available I believe he's being played.
not_available I know what I heard.
not_available I am not being played.
not_available With all deference to Mr Bauer, I think Karen is right.
not_available Mr President, if you wanna stop these attacks, you need to stop Fayed.
not_available To do that, you need to capture Assad and find out what he knows.
not_available Sir, he might be the only hope you have.
not_available Mr President, I know your history with Mr Bauer runs deep, but don't let that impact yourjudgment here.
not_available We have the opportunity to eliminate Assad.
not_available We have to take it.
not_available I want real
not_available time progress on that air strike.
not_available I'm sending a video uplink.
not_available Mr President, don't do this.
not_available Jack, I am sorry.
not_available I am.
not_available Give me your location.
not_available I'll send a unit.
not_available Killing Assad is a mistake.
not_available Right now, he's your only chance of finding Fayed.
not_available It's the president's call.
not_available We'll do all we can when you get back.
not_available That'll be too late.
not_available Jack, tell me where you are.
not_available Don't put me on hold again.
not_available Just give me the agent in charge.
not_available I will wait on the line.
not_available Dammit.
not_available She says they'll call me back on this number.
not_available Where are they holding my father? 
not_available They cannot release that information.
not_available Hello.
not_available You have the package? I'm at my friend's.
not_available They're helping me find out where the FBI took my father.
not_available You're not free to talk? 
not_available No.
not_available Just tell me if you have the package.
not_available Not yet, but I'll have it soon.
not_available There are other people I could have chosen for this task, but I chose you.
not_available Now get out of there.
not_available Retrieve the package.
not_available Call me when you have it.
not_available Yes.
not_available I will.
not_available I have to go back to my house.
not_available I'm meeting my uncle.
not_available Do you think that's wise? Are you sure? 
not_available Ahmed, stay here.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Thank you for everything.
not_available Thank you.
not_available OK.
not_available Take care.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available His family's taking care of him now.
not_available Ahmed.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry.
not_available I I can't believe this is happening.
not_available It's like the whole world has gone crazy.
not_available It's been crazy for a long time.
not_available We just haven't been paying attention.
not_available Yeah, well, we are now.
not_available You know what, you should take this.
not_available I got this at a fair in Oregon.
not_available It's supposed to mean good luck.
not_available Thanks, but I can't take it.
not_available Why? You might need it yourself someday.
not_available Zebra One lead is cleared hot.
not_available Zebra One is cleared hot.
not_available Flight is cleared for immediate engagement.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Please hold for Karen Hayes.
not_available Bill? 
not_available Yes, Karen? You're also online with the president.
not_available We're monitoring the Cobras.
not_available How soon before they hit? 
not_available Five minutes.
not_available How soon after the strike can we expect confirmation that Assad is dead? Curtis will lead a team into the target zone.
not_available He'll do a pointby
not_available point grid search.
not_available Thank you.
not_available request heading change.
not_available Onefive
not_available zero.
not_available Zebra One.
not_available Receiving southwest.
not_available 3 minutes and 50 seconds to lock on target.
not_available Changing course to oneeight
not_available three for southerly approach to target.
not_available Roger, Zebra One.
not_available Oneeight
not_available three.
not_available Lock in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
not_available Drop the coffee.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Don't even think about it.
not_available Where is Assad? Where is Assad?! 
not_available Put down your weapon.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I know.
not_available This house has been targeted for a strike.
not_available I need to get you and your men out.
not_available Check the street.
not_available I came here alone.
not_available I know about Fayed.
not_available I know you're here to stop him.
not_available There's no one outside.
not_available Fayed has set you up.
not_available He provided CTU with the coordinates to this house.
not_available Kill him, Assad.
not_available In a few minutes, we'll all be dead.
not_available Don't listen to him.
not_available It's a trap.
not_available There's a transponder in this house.
not_available US military is using it to pinpoint the strike.
not_available There is no transponder here.
not_available We've searched the entire house.
not_available One of your men must have it on them.
not_available That's the only possible explanation.
not_available One of your men is working for Fayed.
not_available Have them empty their pockets.
not_available Assad, don't listen to him.
not_available He's lying.
not_available Dammit, I am telling you the truth.
not_available Why else would I be here? If I wanted to kill you, I'd have come in shooting.
not_available Have your men empty their pockets! I'm trying to save your life.
not_available Wait.
not_available Empty your pockets.
not_available But I said empty your pockets.
not_available Behind you! Search him.
not_available You betrayed us.
not_available No.
not_available You're the one who betrayed his people.
not_available Assad, we need to leave now.
not_available If you are telling the truth, you will not need that gun.
not_available Go, Assad.
not_available You need to leave.
not_available We'll secure the files.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Move! Move! Are you all right? Get him up.
not_available Move.
not_available Mr President, the target has been destroyed.
not_available We are an advocacy group.
not_available These people are all volunteers.
not_available They're very good people.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available We're assembling a database of names to crosscheck against our watch list.
not_available Excuse me, Sandra.
not_available The FBI's here.
not_available FBI? They're asking for access to our personnel records.
not_available We take pride in being good citizens, and will cooperate to stop the attacks.
not_available May I see your warrant, gentlemen? I'm Mr Al
not_available Rezani's attorney.
not_available I also represent this organisation.
not_available We know who you are, ma'am.
not_available And I'm afraid we don't have a warrant.
not_available I'm afraid we can't turn over our personnel records.
not_available That information is private, and privacy is protected by law.
not_available I understand, but in light of what's happening in the country, we don't think it's unreasonable to ask for cooperation.
not_available You're in the wrong place.
not_available There are no terrorists here.
not_available So unless you have a warrant, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
not_available Please don't make me ask twice.
not_available All right, ma'am.
not_available This is getting out of hand.
not_available Maybe we should give them what they want.
not_available You're serious? 
not_available We've nothing to hide.
not_available No, but we have something to protect 
not_available the privacy of everyone who's ever worked here.
not_available Maybe we have to sacrifice privacy.
not_available The country's under attack.
not_available We cannot pretend it isn't.
not_available Who are you calling? 
not_available Yes, it's Sandra Palmer.
not_available I'd like to speak with my brother.
not_available We're sweeping the zone.
not_available We've recovered four bodies.
not_available Forensics is running field ID.
not_available They're sending data to CTU.
not_available Well, let's hope one of them is Assad.
not_available Yes? 
not_available The president's sister on the line.
not_available He'll wanna call her back.
not_available She says it's urgent.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Mr President, we're Tom, it's OK.
not_available Let me have the room, please.
not_available What's going on, Sandra? 
not_available I'm sorry, but I think you need to know.
not_available The FBI was just here, and they wanted access to the IAA's personnel records.
not_available Did they say why? 
not_available Some excuse about expanding a database.
not_available Listen, Sandra.
not_available I You know I have to do whatever I can to stop these attacks, right? Yes.
not_available That includes giving law enforcement the authority to follow up every single lead.
not_available That's my point.
not_available They weren't following any lead.
not_available They were invading a group of people's privacy based on their religion.
not_available Look, Wayne, you know I'm not some idealistic flag burner, and I understand you're going through a complicated situation, but once you start ethnic profiling, it's a slippery slope.
not_available I'll look into it.
not_available Start with Tom Lennox.
not_available This has his name written all over it.
not_available Don't start in on Tom.
not_available He treats the Constitution like a list of suggestions.
not_available He's laying the framework for a crackdown, and civil protections be damned.
not_available Let's be honest, you don't like Tom and you never have.
not_available Neither did David.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Bill Buchanan's on the line.
not_available One moment.
not_available Sandra, I gotta go.
not_available Wayne, look, I'm sorry to put this on you, OK? I I just wouldn't have called if I didn't think it was important.
not_available I understand.
not_available You take care of yourself, OK? 
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available I love you too.
not_available I hope I got through to him.
not_available You made a good case.
not_available He'll listen.
not_available Thanks.
not_available For what? 
not_available For making that call.
not_available And for not letting me lose sight of what we're fighting for.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We completed our sweep of the zone.
not_available Four bodies.
not_available None of them is Assad.
not_available What? Are you sure? 
not_available We're checking, but I think Assad is alive.
not_available How did we miss him?! 
not_available Someone must have warned him.
not_available Or the intel from Fayed was bad, and Assad was never there to begin with.
not_available Irrelevant.
not_available What matters is that Assad is out there.
not_available We're sealing a ten
not_available block perimeter around the area.
not_available Assad may be in the vicinity.
not_available All right, Bill.
not_available We put everything we had into that strike.
not_available We thought if we could cut off the head we could stop these attacks, and now Tom, what do you think Assad's next move is gonna be? Likely, there will be more attacks, but respond he will, guaranteed.
not_available Ahmed will have the package soon.
not_available Good.
not_available Is he ready? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He is waiting for you.
not_available That's not necessary.
not_available I will not fail you.
not_available I don't question your devotion, Nasir.
not_available When the moment approaches, even the most devout can experience fear.
not_available Look at me.
not_available By overcoming your fear, you prove your worth.
not_available I am proud to have known you in this life, Nasir.
not_available Your family will learn about your sacrifice.
not_available All right.
not_available One more load.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Put him here.
not_available He's unconscious.
not_available CTU's gonna realise you weren't killed.
not_available They'll widen their search grid.
not_available We can't stay here much longer.
not_available He knows where Fayed is.
not_available I only need a few minutes.
not_available Fayed told me that you wanted to disarm.
not_available You were gonna start negotiations.
not_available Is that true? Most of my people and the governments that support us agreed to a cease
not_available fire.
not_available Fayed wants to sabotage it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Once Fayed is eliminated, everyone will fall into line and I can go public with my proposal.
not_available But finding Fayed is the key to everything.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available I know why Assad wasn't in the building when the missile hit.
not_available I need to show you.
not_available This is an aerial frame enhancement of the building seconds before it was destroyed.
not_available Jack rescued Assad.
not_available OK, OK.
not_available This makes sense from Jack's perspective, if Assad is trying to stop the bombing.
not_available But President Palmer and your wife I mean, Karen Hayes 
not_available think he's wrong.
not_available So what am I supposed to do with this? Who else has seen it? 
not_available Nobody but me.
not_available OK.
not_available Let's keep it that way for now.
not_available Jack didn't save Assad out of compassion.
not_available He's gonna use him to find Fayed.
not_available We should be looking for Fayed too.
not_available Right.
not_available Filter the chatter stream, see if anything sources out on Fayed.
not_available OK.
not_available Good work.
not_available We have a car.
not_available If we're gonna find Fayed in time, we have to involve CTU.
not_available The people who tried to kill me and killed my men? 
not_available They have resources you don't.
not_available They will question me for days.
not_available Fayed worked under me.
not_available I know how he thinks, and I will find him, but I will do it on my terms.
not_available Where is Fayed? 
not_available I do not know.
not_available Where is he?! 
not_available I was just ordered to plant the transponder.
not_available Where is Fayed? 
not_available I do not know.
not_available Please stop.
not_available Please.
not_available Why did you stop? I can see it in his eyes.
not_available He's not gonna tell us anything.
not_available Where is Fayed? I know where some of his men will be.
not_available I heard Fayed giving instructions to go there.
not_available Where? 
not_available Figueroa and Sixth.
not_available When? After you were killed.
not_available You've told me everything? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I swear it.
not_available I swear it.
not_available I believe you.
not_available I understand how you felt you were doing the right thing.
not_available I admire your conviction, but you have taken the wrong path.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Let's go.
not_available My men are dead.
not_available I can find Fayed.
not_available But I cannot stop him by myself.
not_available I don't know how to do this any more.
not_available You'll remember.
not_available Hello? You'd better come out here.
not_available The FBI is back.
not_available They have a warrant.
not_available Who is the applicant for this? I wanna see the affidavit.
not_available The papers are on file with a district court.
not_available We have a legally executed warrant.
not_available Either you hand over the files, or we take them.
not_available It's your choice.
not_available This is an administrative warrant.
not_available It's not valid in this situation.
not_available That's your opinion.
not_available They're in the media room.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available I need to use your computer.
not_available Malek, I need copies of all of our personnel files.
not_available OK.
not_available No problem.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I can't find the files.
not_available Are you certain? Try again.
not_available They're not here.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available They're not where they're supposed to be.
not_available They've been erased.
not_available Don't try to recall them.
not_available I used the shredding program.
not_available Sandra, what are you doing? 
not_available Check it.
not_available She's telling the truth.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Obstructing official business, destroying evidence.
not_available Take Mr Al
not_available Rezani into custody.
not_available Wait.
not_available He has nothing to do with this.
not_available That's the judge's call.
not_available But I'm telling you, he's not involved.
not_available Are you sure about this? 
not_available I told you, she gets no special treatment.
not_available I know, but she's the president's sister.
not_available We have orders handed down, and we're gonna follow them.
not_available Impound every work station and hard drive in this office.
not_available Think I forgot about you, huh? This is for everyone you bastards killed today.
not_available How do you like it, huh? Get up.
not_available Get up! You're dead, do you hear me? You're dead.
not_available Please.
not_available Don't.
not_available Please.
not_available Don't.
not_available Ahmed.
not_available What happened? What happened? 
not_available I'm gonna call an ambulance.
not_available We're not calling anybody.
not_available Ahmed 
not_available I can't go to the hospital.
not_available You're hurt.
not_available I'm gonna call 911.
not_available You shouldn't have come here, Scott.
not_available Look, I don't wanna hurt you, but I will unless you do exactly what I say.
not_available Ahmed we're friends.
not_available What friends? You can't even pronounce my name.
not_available It's not Ahmed, it's Ach
not_available med.
not_available This is the location Omar gave us.
not_available Over there.
not_available Two men in suits, one carrying a briefcase.
not_available These are Fayed's men.
not_available The man in front is wearing an explosive vest.
not_available He's setting up another strike.
not_available Go.
not_available They're going in the subway.
not_available The detonator is in his right hand.
not_available They can't get on that train.
not_available Only the bomber is getting on.
not_available The other man is the handler.
not_available He'll see the bomber off, then he'll leave.
not_available The handler will lead us to Fayed.
not_available You follow the handler.
not_available I'm going after the bomber.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available He's on a train.
not_available It will reach Union Station in five minutes.
not_available When it pulls in, he'll martyr himself.
not_available The car is at the arranged place.
not_available Take it.
not_available Go to Union Station.
not_available Call me when it's done.
not_available Understood.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ticket.
not_available Ticket, please.
not_available Ticket.
not_available Sir, do you have a ticket? 
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I am a federal agent.
not_available You have a terrorist on this train with a bomb.
not_available I need you to walk away.
not_available If he notices anything unusual, he will detonate his bomb.
not_available Now move away.
not_available It's a bomb! Allahu Akbar! As the wave of violence continues 
not_available Talk.
not_available Fayed, something went wrong.
not_available I'm here at Union Station, but there's no explosion.
not_available And there's a cloud of smoke four blocks west from here.
not_available Whatever the case, it doesn't matter.
not_available Our other attacks were successful.
not_available Once again, the streets are flowing with blood.
not_available Three simultaneous bombings.
not_available One in a shopping mall, another in a hotel.
not_available Casualties are high.
not_available What about the third one? I'll call you back.
not_available It was here.
not_available On the Metro Red Line.
not_available It appears to be a suicide bomber.
not_available May be some good news.
not_available Aside from the bomber, no one else was killed.
not_available How the hell could that happen? 
not_available A passenger ejected the bomber.
not_available The passenger identified himself as Jack Bauer.
not_available If Jack was on that train, he'll have been caught on camera.
not_available I want visual confirmation.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sir, you need to hear this.
not_available It's a cellphone call red
not_available tagged from the NSA software.
not_available Fayed, something went wrong.
not_available I'm here at Union Station We need to contact the White House.
not_available The car bomb was detonated by remote control, sending bodies hurling out of windows from the 20th floor Mr President, if it's any consolation, these attacks were planned in advance of the raid on Assad.
not_available Tom, all that means is there will be more attacks.
not_available We're in a full
not_available blown war, and we have no way to fight back.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mr President.
not_available CTU just called.
not_available They intercepted a cellphone call between Fayed and one of the men behind today's bombings.
not_available Fayed? Are they sure? Yes, sir.
not_available Fayed is the one behind these attacks, not Assad.
not_available Sir, I promoted the strike against Assad.
not_available But I approved it, Karen.
not_available We were all in agreement.
not_available So Jack was right.
not_available He was right all along and I This is gonna get much worse.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What happened? Later.
not_available Are you following the handler? Yes.
not_available I'm in the car.
not_available We're on Alameda, two blocks from Union Station.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'll find you.
not_available Stay with the handler.
not_available He's our only connection to Fayed.
