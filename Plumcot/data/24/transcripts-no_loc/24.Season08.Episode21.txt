
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Renee! You said you had video file implicating people inside the Russian government who were responsible for Renee's murder.
not_available I want that file.
not_available Tell me where that file is, now! 
not_available It's in a safety deposit box! Where? DANA: First Unity Savings.
not_available I had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack.
not_available No.
not_available You never give up, do you? LOGAN: Bauer may have Walsh, but he can't have the evidence yet.
not_available We've still got a chance to stop him.
not_available I'm not the only one who can prove that elements in your government conspired to undermine the peace process.
not_available So you expect me to kill Bauer for you? You have the covert assets here to do the job.
not_available Maybe I do.
not_available But I don't have the resources to find him.
not_available CTU does.
not_available And the man in charge of the search now reports to me.
not_available We got him.
not_available Once they have Bauer, I'll find out where they're holding him.
not_available You'll have to take him out while he's in custody.
not_available Freeze! Police! Do not move.
not_available Jack tell me what I can do.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Mund, this is Captain Walleki.
not_available I'm on scene.
not_available You got that guy from the bank yet? Just bringing him up, Captain.
not_available Right.
not_available It's Cole Ortiz.
not_available He says he's with CTU.
not_available WALLEKI: You were with this woman at the bank.
not_available Do you care to tell me who she is? Her name is Dana Walsh.
not_available Shot twice at close range, lot of powder residue around one of the entries, like an execution.
not_available WALLEKI: Thank you, Mund.
not_available Get him to CTU, now.
not_available DANA: The hit on Hassan is all arranged.
not_available Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.
not_available Well, I'm pleased to hear it, but you could have just as easily called to tell me that.
not_available DANA: I wanted to know if you've spoken to your superiors told them that I'm out after this goes down.
not_available I told them what you wanted.
not_available He feels the same as me: we have too much invested in you to let you walk away.
not_available You should be focused on getting the E.M.P.
not_available device into CTU, not on your boyfriend, Ortiz.
not_available DANA: He's my fiance, and I told you to leave him out of this.
not_available I warned you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen.
not_available And now you think you have feelings for him? You think you love him, going to marry him? Yes.
not_available I am.
not_available And if you have a problem wrapping your brain around that fact, maybe I should talk to your boss in Moscow.
not_available You talk to no one but me.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.
not_available Yeah? Hey, it's me.
not_available I sent you a DAT video file.
not_available Okay.
not_available I got it.
not_available It's uploading right now.
not_available Okay, I need you to get me an I.D.
not_available of the man in the video.
not_available Also, I'm coming in hot, so whatever you have to do to protect your systems from getting flagged, do it now.
not_available What about the woman? You need an I.D.
not_available on her? She's dead.
not_available I'll see you in a few minutes.
not_available All right.
not_available Jack Bauer's last known location was First Unity Savings Bank on Lexington, where police responded to a 911 call, apparently from Dana Walsh.
not_available She's dead now.
not_available Bauer killed her.
not_available Cole Ortiz, who is known to be aiding and abetting Bauer is being brought here for questioning.
not_available Now, I need everybody not committed to the U.N.
not_available security task to devote their full attention to finding him.
not_available I want all cameras routed through facial recognition and all phone calls monitored.
not_available You don't have the bandwidth, you steal it from other tasks.
not_available If you think you have a lead, you bring it to me immediately.
not_available Any questions? 
not_available Why did they go to the bank? Dana said she had evidence of Russian involvement in Hassan's murder.
not_available Maybe that's where she was stashing it.
not_available There's no evidence; the president dismissed this.
not_available Well, she went to the bank with Jack to get something.
not_available Yeah, what she got was an explosive device that made possible her escape.
not_available It was her plan all along.
not_available Look, Jack Bauer can't accept the fact that Dana Walsh was an enemy agent working solely with the I.R.K.
not_available opposition to Hassan's government.
not_available His grief over Renee Walker's murder is causing him to create this fantasy about a Russian conspiracy.
not_available The simple truth is, he's lost it, and he's a danger to himself and the community.
not_available So let's stop second
not_available guessing the operation, and find him.
not_available Something is seriously wrong here.
not_available Pillar's ignoring the key questions, and the questions that he is answering, no one's asking.
not_available What are you getting at? I think Jack's right: this is a cover
not_available up, and Pillar's involved.
not_available That evidence was at the bank, and Jack 
not_available has it.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available It's all speculation.
not_available It may be just like Pillar says.
not_available Until I know otherwise, I got my orders.
not_available I'm clear.
not_available Well, you weren't kidding.
not_available You said you were coming in hot.
not_available All the police scanners are talking about you.
not_available They said you shot and killed some woman.
not_available Construction site on the East Side.
not_available Was that the same woman in the video you sent me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you I.D.
not_available the man? No.
not_available I'm not going to, either till you tell me what the hell 
not_available is going on, Jack.
not_available You saw the video.
not_available Dana Walsh is a Russian operative.
not_available She facilitated the assassination of President Hassan and the dirty bomb attack that would have wiped out the entire Upper West Side if we hadn't stopped it.
not_available I don't want to know about what happened today, and I don't care; I want to know why you're out there on your own and why everybody's after you.
not_available Because the president tried to lock me down.
not_available Why? Because I know she's trying to cover up the Russian's involvement in today's attack.
not_available Then why didn't you disappear? Because I can't! Listen, I want to help you, Jack.
not_available I really do.
not_available I need you to be straight with me.
not_available Tell me exactly what's going on.
not_available The Russians took something from me.
not_available Her name was Renee Walker.
not_available They killed her inside my apartment.
not_available And I need to make them pay.
not_available All right.
not_available Actually, I did I.D.
not_available the guy.
not_available There he is: Pavel Tokarev.
not_available Primary operative, Russian intelligence.
not_available Where is he? I don't know exactly.
not_available He's in the USA.
not_available Came in a month ago on a diplomatic visa.
not_available Diplomat.
not_available I tried to access the Russian database in the embassy.
not_available He didn't show up in the consulate.
not_available He could be anywhere, Jack.
not_available To keep everything quiet, they'd have to be a small unit, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think I've got an idea.
not_available Get me a secure line.
not_available Meredith.
not_available I didn't expect you'd still be here.
not_available Oh, fact check called: there are a few items left on the Hassan piece.
not_available Abby can follow up on it for you.
not_available I know.
not_available I just I need to make sure it's right.
not_available I know what he meant to you.
not_available It shows in this piece you wrote.
not_available What a great man he was.
not_available You've done him justice.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Miss Reed, there's a call for you 
not_available on 3.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let me know if there's anything you need.
not_available Thanks, Gary.
not_available This is Meredith Reed.
not_available Miss Reed.
not_available Who is this? 
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Please don't say anything; just listen.
not_available The people that you think are responsible for killing President Hassan were not working alone.
not_available They were being funded and managed by people working inside the Russian government.
not_available How do you know this? I have proof of this: a video file that was made by a Russian agent working out of CTU.
not_available She made it for her own protection.
not_available It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.
not_available Have you contacted the authorities about any of this? I can't.
not_available I'm being set up, just like you were yesterday.
not_available I need to get this evidence to you.
not_available There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.
not_available Do you think you get there in the next 20 minutes? (Panting): Miss Reed yesterday I helped clear your name.
not_available Right now I need you to help clear mine.
not_available Please.
not_available Of course I'll help you.
not_available I I want to know the truth as much as you do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available Where's Bauer? I don't know.
not_available You're in some trouble here, Cole.
not_available I assume you're aware of that.
not_available Luckily for you, I'm in a position to make all that go away.
not_available I reviewed your record.
not_available You've had a exemplary career up to now.
not_available You're Pillar.
not_available That's right.
not_available Jason Pillar.
not_available I've been asked by the president to oversee the effort to retrieve Jack Bauer.
not_available Madam President? Yes.
not_available So you're a part of the cover
not_available up? Oh, I see here you served in Fallujah.
not_available I I spent two tours in command of a marine unit in Baquba myself.
not_available We're both soldiers.
not_available So you understand, when the commanderin
not_available chief deems a course of action necessary to the national good, it's not our place to question it.
not_available The truth is: we're on the same side.
not_available We both want what's best for our country.
not_available Bauer doesn't care about that.
not_available He didn't give a damn about what happened to you, just as long as it served his needs.
not_available He used you.
not_available So let's start over.
not_available Do you know where Jack Bauer is? Probably somewhere with the evidence you guys keep saying doesn't exist.
not_available You really don't want to be playing with me.
not_available What? Good news: we may have a line on Bauer.
not_available We intercepted a call.
not_available Last chance.
not_available You don't take it, there's nothing anyone can do for you.
not_available Take him to holding.
not_available Arlo got a cell phone intercept report off of NSA's Echelon.
not_available Keywords: Hassan, Russian government, Jack Bauer.
not_available Did Arlo hear any of the conversation? 
not_available No, not yet; all he's got so far are the data handles, but he's processing the voice matrix now.
not_available Are we sure it's Bauer? No, not yet, but the other side of the call was a phone registered to Meredith Reed.
not_available She's the reporter CTU arrested last night before the first attempt on Hassan's life.
not_available Rumor has it she was also his mistress.
not_available If Bauer was going to reach out to someone with the evidence, she would be an excellent choice.
not_available Arlo, stop what you're doing.
not_available Tag and lock the intercept download and send it directly to Eden's system.
not_available She'll take it from there.
not_available That's not necessary, sir.
not_available I said I want Eden to handle it.
not_available Thanks, Arlo.
not_available JACK: There's a video file that was made by a Russian agent working out of CTU.
not_available She made it for her own protection.
not_available It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.
not_available REED: Have you contacted the authorities about any of this? JACK: I can't.
not_available I'm being set up just like you were yesterday.
not_available I need to get this evidence to you.
not_available There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.
not_available Do you think you can get there in the next 20 minutes? Jack Bauer.
not_available PILLAR (Over phone): Yes, sir.
not_available We confirmed the voiceprint.
not_available So take it to the press, that's his next move.
not_available It appears to be.
not_available Reed's connection to Hassan means she'd be highly motivated to help him.
not_available And he hasn't shown her anything yet? No, sir.
not_available Which still means that we, we don't know what the evidence actually is.
not_available Well, it will be in our hands soon enough.
not_available This is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir: Bauer and the evidence.
not_available I've already dispatched the Russian ops team to the location.
not_available They'll be in position well before the meet.
not_available NOVAKOVICH: You need to deal with local law enforcement, make sure Pavel has room to move.
not_available PILLAR: Yes, we're deploying NYPD away from the site, but we'll still need your guys in and out as quickly as possible.
not_available Understood.
not_available Jason, this is, this is a major break you've got, a major break.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available We'll shut this down.
not_available I want to stay on top of this personally, Mikhail.
not_available So will you let me have Pavel's number? Can you make this room less public? You wanted me for something? Yeah, the call you intercepted, the one that Pillar hijacked, do you think it was from Jack? I can't be sure.
not_available The program hit on keywords Hassan, nuclear, Bauer, but all three have been in the news in the last few hours.
not_available But the call was to Meredith Reed's cell phone.
not_available She's a journalist with an interest in the Hassan story.
not_available Plenty of people could be calling her.
not_available Doesn't have to be Jack.
not_available Okay, then explain this.
not_available Cell intercept report comes in here.
not_available Two minutes later Pillar downloads the entire conversation into a segregated server surrounded by firewalls like I've never seen.
not_available Then what does he do? Call one, call two, call three.
not_available Who'd he call? I don't know.
not_available They're outside of CTU and they're all completely masked.
not_available So the question is this: if the call was nothing, then why are they still hiding it? If the call was Jack, then why haven't they dispatched CTU SWAT team? Why haven't they alerted NYPD? Arlo, they're in on the cover
not_available up.
not_available Look at them.
not_available And what's worst is they're planning to take Jack out.
not_available Why? Why would they want to do that? Because he knows too much.
not_available He's gotten a hold of Dana's evidence, which proves the Russian involvement in Hassan's assassination.
not_available They can't let him go public with that.
not_available That's why I have to find him, and I need your help.
not_available Okay.
not_available How do you want to do it? I'm gonna talk to Cole.
not_available He just spent the past two hours with Jack and Dana.
not_available He must have some idea of what Jack's up to.
not_available Pillar's got Cole continuously monitored.
not_available You can't get in there without being seen.
not_available We'll create a loop and graft it into the security feed.
not_available That's the other problem: they added an extra layer of oversight to our system.
not_available Second I try to move beyond my security clearance, I get an on
not_available screen warning.
not_available They're watching everything we're doing.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available We'll use this, create a mobile hot spot.
not_available That way we can work off our own net without Pillar breathing down our necks.
not_available Got it.
not_available Setting up alternate network now.
not_available We're up.
not_available Okay, I'm restricting access to you and me.
not_available How long will it take you to make the loop? I can only give you 90 seconds.
not_available Anything more than that, somebody will notice.
not_available Okay, text me when you're set up.
not_available Fredericks, McDermott was injured in the E.M.P.
not_available blast, so I need you to collect the night shift time cards and take them to my office.
not_available Okay.
not_available Like now? Yes, ma'am.
not_available We put a loop in the security feed.
not_available I've only got so I'm gonna get straight to the point.
not_available I need to find Jack 
not_available or else they're gonna kill him.
not_available Who's gonna kill him? Pillar and whoever is working with him.
not_available You need to tell me where he is.
not_available I got no idea.
not_available You were at the bank with him; he must have said something.
not_available Hey, what Jack says and what he does are two very different things.
not_available He's trying to expose the cover
not_available up.
not_available He doesn't give a damn about any cover
not_available up.
not_available He's taking out anyone who was anywhere near Renee's death, starting with Dana.
not_available She gave him the evidence and he killed her anyway.
not_available She took the gun out of the safety deposit box.
not_available She was probably shooting at him.
not_available He shot her point
not_available blank.
not_available He executed her, just like she said he would.
not_available There are no good guys here.
not_available Jack, Pillar they end up killing each other, maybe it's the best thing.
not_available No, Jack's my friend.
not_available If I can find him, I can talk him down.
not_available These people are just going to kill him.
not_available I need you to be on my side.
not_available Everybody wants me on their side.
not_available Who am I fighting for? If we can get to him, we can expose the cover
not_available up.
not_available You just stay here and feel sorry for yourself.
not_available I'm gonna go find him.
not_available Wait.
not_available Look, it's not much, but Jack's got to be working with someone.
not_available Who? I don't know; I never saw him, but Jack showed up with stateofthe
not_available art weapons and comms, so he's got to have a contact in the city.
not_available You want to find Jack, you find his supplier.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Arlo.
not_available You got out in time.
not_available You okay? Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available Listen, I know what Jack's doing.
not_available Pull up his files, get me the list of his known associates in the tri
not_available state area, anyone he's worked with in the past.
not_available Okay.
not_available In the next half hour, the man who has widely been acknowledged as the vital "third partner" in the peace process, Russian President Yuri Suvarov, will touch down at JFK.
not_available He'll be ferried into Manhattan by helicopter and then to the U.N.
not_available Yes.
not_available Pavel, update, please.
not_available My team is in position.
not_available Any sign of Bauer? Not yet.
not_available I need to know.
not_available What about the woman? The woman? The journalist, her disposition.
not_available Ms.
not_available Reed is aiding and abetting a terrorist.
not_available She's a serious threat to both our countries.
not_available Do what you have to.
not_available I see from Ethan's notes that we still have not completely resolved the issue of site access for the inspection teams.
not_available I believe it was resolved.
not_available President Hassan agreed the inspectors would have right of passage over our entire country.
not_available But he exempted schools.
not_available Only primary schools.
not_available Omar didn't think tenyear
not_available old children would be building nuclear missiles.
not_available Of course.
not_available I remember now.
not_available I I do apologize.
not_available Are you all right, Madam President? It's been a long day.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Madam President.
not_available If you'll excuse me for a few minutes, there's someone I need to see.
not_available Of course.
not_available Where is he? He's in the conference room, ma'am.
not_available Thank you for seeing me, Madam President.
not_available I have good news.
not_available We've located Bauer.
not_available He he has the evidence, but Charles, you assured me that that wouldn't happen.
not_available Please, let me finish.
not_available We know exactly where Bauer will be and when, and and we have an operation underway to reacquire him even as we speak.
not_available Believe me, this is good news.
not_available Let me know as soon as it's resolved.
not_available I need to get back to the negotiations.
not_available Just There's just one thing, Madam President.
not_available Uh, we are three hours away from the signing of the treaty.
not_available Isn't it time for my role in the process to be officially recognized? I was thinking some kind of, uh, announcement to the media, perhaps by your press secretary, or maybe even by you yourself, Madam President.
not_available It was, you'll recall, our agreement that I would have a public face on this historic day.
not_available I believe I've earned it.
not_available I will talk to my press secretary.
not_available She will make the announcement in time for the Thank you very much, Madam President.
not_available We have contact.
not_available Target heading to the third floor escalator.
not_available Acknowledged.
not_available I see her now.
not_available We have eyes on Reed.
not_available Reed is confirmed.
not_available Units 2 and 3, Reed is approaching you.
not_available Confirm contact.
not_available Reed confirmed.
not_available Approaching the meeting place.
not_available Any sign of Bauer? 
not_available Where is he? He should be here.
not_available No sign.
not_available Pavel, do you see Bauer? Not yet.
not_available Unit 1, report.
not_available We have no visual of Bauer.
not_available WOMAN: Jason, where are you going? There he is.
not_available He's heading up towards Damn it, I lost him.
not_available All units, Bauer is on the third floor.
not_available Do you see him? 
not_available I do not have him.
not_available What? He's there.
not_available We see him.
not_available Get your eyes open, damn it! I have not seen him.
not_available EDEN: Got him.
not_available PILLAR: Bauer is approaching the target from the southwest.
not_available He's got a brown leather jacket and jeans.
not_available EDEN: There he is.
not_available PILLAR: Pavel, he's in view.
not_available He's closing in on the cafe.
not_available You should have a clean line on him.
not_available Pavel, if you have a shot, take it.
not_available I've got him.
not_available Put it down.
not_available Everything's all clear up at the top, Jack.
not_available Got her.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Do exactly what I say.
not_available All units, target is in the open.
not_available Take him out.
not_available I repeat: take him out.
not_available You stay down here.
not_available You don't move.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Don't move! 
not_available All right.
not_available JACK: Move! Okay.
not_available What the hell just happened? He knew it was a trap.
not_available Don't let them out of your sight.
not_available We lost him.
not_available Just keep looking! REED: Those people you shot who were they? Russian operatives.
not_available You have any problems? No.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Jason.
not_available Tell me.
not_available I'm afraid I have bad news, sir.
not_available All of Pavel's team is dead, and Bauer has Pavel.
not_available He was ahead of us from the get
not_available go, sir.
not_available He must have anticipated that we'd use Echelon, and he put out a series of keywords, knowing the listening stations would pick them up.
not_available He played us, sir.
not_available He knew we'd use off
not_available book resources to deal with him.
not_available He used that journalist to draw them out.
not_available Now, sir, I hardly need to tell you that the situation is grave.
not_available Pavel knows everything.
not_available He ran Walsh; he set up the Russian ops.
not_available If Bauer gets Pavel to talk But at the moment, sir, you still have complete deniability.
not_available President Taylor made all the decisions.
not_available I think the time has come for you to distance yourself from this mess.
not_available It's regrettable, sir, deeply so, but I believe it's what's best for you.
not_available You the president's press secretary is going to make an announcement.
not_available She will say I have become part of the president's team, and and I have been indispensable in bringing this peace process to a successful close.
not_available Sir, may I say that that is a bad idea? You need to distance yourself.
not_available What? You keep using that phrase.
not_available What what does distance myself mean? Do I just slink away? This isn't your fault, sir.
not_available There were circumstances we couldn't have anticipated.
not_available Namely Bauer.
not_available Well, then, we find Bauer, and we neutralize him.
not_available We're public now, Jason.
not_available We're committed.
not_available And I have worked We We have worked too hard just to throw this all away.
not_available Do you understand? Yes, of course, sir, but Pavel No.
not_available Pavel is a good soldier.
not_available He won't talk, whatever Bauer does to him.
not_available I, uh I put you at CTU, Jason, for a reason.
not_available They have huge resources.
not_available You have intelligence and tenacity.
not_available You use those capabilities.
not_available Find Bauer.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll head down to the scene myself.
not_available Good.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available He wants to move forward.
not_available Does he understand what actually happened? Yes, but he says we still have options.
not_available I need to know you're with me on this.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I'm with you.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm heading out.
not_available I'll clean up the scene, remove all trace of the Russians, and get on Bauer's trail.
not_available I'll take CTU SWAT with me.
not_available Tell NYPD to put a two
not_available block perimeter around the store.
not_available No one goes in or out without my say
not_available so.
not_available What reason do I give them? 
not_available National security.
not_available Anyone gives you a hard time, invoke the White House.
not_available Any luck with Jack's associates? No.
not_available Even discounting dead people, and people from foreign countries, it's still going to take hours.
not_available I think I can narrow it down.
not_available I just picked up a 911 call from Turner's in Midtown.
not_available There was a shootout, people killed.
not_available I managed to get into the store's security system.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available That's Jack.
not_available They're trying to kill him.
not_available Yeah, that part of the plan didn't go so well.
not_available I tagged the footage to 15 minutes after the shooting.
not_available If we run facial recognition on the camera feeds We can match it to the database of Jack's associates, maybe find out who he's working with.
not_available Thanks, Arlo.
not_available No problem.
not_available Copy the camera footage to my screen.
not_available I'll send you half the personnel files.
not_available We're clear.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Empty your pockets right now here.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available We'll be safe here for a while.
not_available RICKER: Jack? We don't have much time.
not_available Take off your coat.
not_available Now! Those people you killed you were ready for them, weren't you? You knew they were coming.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So you you knew they'd be listening to our phone call.
not_available Isn't that right? You used me to draw them out, right? That's right.
not_available I could have been killed back there! You weren't.
not_available Now, pick it up.
not_available I said pick it up! REED: What about the evidence you said you'd tell me? Was that a lie, too? No.
not_available The evidence is on this memory card.
not_available When you see it, you'll know it's real.
not_available Take it.
not_available My partner's gonna take you somewhere to show it to you.
not_available I'm sorry things had to play out like this.
not_available I didn't see another choice.
not_available REED: What are you gonna do? Put your hands behind your back.
not_available Now! 
not_available Don't do this, please.
not_available You don't want to do this.
not_available Take her to the storeroom.
not_available No, I'm not going anywhere.
not_available Please, you cannot do this.
not_available The evidence I gave you doesn't tell me how Walsh was involved.
not_available He will.
not_available Come on.
not_available No.
not_available You cannot do this this way! Springfield, M1A rifle.
not_available .308 round.
not_available You know, about four hours ago, I had a friend of mine, very good friend, named Renee Walker was killed by a rifle just like that.
not_available Go to hell.
not_available You first.
not_available DANA (On video): The hit on Hassan is all arranged.
not_available Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.
not_available You talk to no one but me.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.
not_available To be honest with you, Renee Walker was more than just my friend.
not_available But you already know that, don't you? Because you saw us in the bedroom of my apartment.
not_available Now, you're either not very good at what you do or you wanted her to suffer.
not_available Because with that rifle from that range, it was an easy kill shot.
not_available But instead, you shot her right there two inches below her heart, so she would bleed out slowly.
not_available I watched her gasping for air as the blood slowly filled her lungs.
not_available She died in agony, which is exactly what I'm gonna make you do unless you tell me what I want to know.
not_available Start talking to me! You want to know I killed your girlfriend? I killed her.
not_available I kill your bitch! I did it! Please please, you've got to stop him.
not_available Please.
not_available He needs answers, and he's gonna get 'em.
not_available I can use this.
not_available There's enough here.
not_available I don't need any more.
not_available Tell him I don't need any more.
not_available Please.
not_available You're not going anywhere.
not_available MAN: Let's go.
not_available Move aside.
not_available Move.
not_available Move.
not_available Please step back from the bodies.
not_available This is now a CTU crime scene.
not_available I need all weapons and documents you found on these people.
not_available This is all we got, sir.
not_available None of them had I.D.s on them.
not_available This is the man we're looking for.
not_available His name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Now, you need to spread out and check every floor and every exit.
not_available He has a hostage with him, so he won't have gotten far.
not_available Bauer's armed and extremely dangerous, so if you don't want to end up like these people, shoot on sight.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hey.
not_available So, why don't we start this again.
not_available I already know that you killed Renee Walker.
not_available What I want to know is the name that gave the order.
not_available Give me a name, and I'll end this quickly.
not_available I give you my word.
not_available You think you know about pain? You don't know anything yet.
not_available You people are so stupid.
not_available Renee Walker wasn't a threat to you.
not_available Her work was finished.
not_available She was done.
not_available We were out.
not_available All you had to do was leave us alone.
not_available Now, why couldn't you just leave us alone? I want the name of the person who gave the order to pull the trigger! Who gave the order?! Now! Did it on my own! You're lying.
not_available You're nothing.
not_available You didn't have the authority.
not_available I want the name! Give me the name! My name is Pavel Tokarev.
not_available This isn't working.
not_available Damn it! Where's the SIM card for your phone? Where's the SIM card?! Where'd you drop it? You dumb bastard, you swallowed it.
not_available You swallowed it.
not_available This is for my friend.
not_available What do you got? Fine.
not_available There's another service hallway.
not_available Check all the service hallways over there.
not_available Make sure they're locked down.
not_available You guys, I want you to go up there, get on the third floor.
not_available Do it now.
not_available PILLAR: You've reached the mobile number of President Charles Logan.
not_available We can't take your call right now, but if you leave your name and number, we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
