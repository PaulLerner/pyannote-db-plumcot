
not_available Did you checkthe passport information? 
not_available I did.
not_available It confirms Reza Naiyeer has had contact with Syed Ali.
not_available My sister is marrying someone who works for terrorists and you expect me to act normal? You could endanger yourself and your family if you let on anything is wrong.
not_available I understand.
not_available George, we need you to check out a warehouse in the valley.
not_available The substance you inhaled is plutonium.
not_available How much time do I have? 
not_available As much as a week or as little as a day.
not_available What's going on? Jack Bauer says that Wald's crew is planning to blow up CTU.
not_available Have you contacted CTU? 
not_available Bauer hasn't gotten to Wald yet.
not_available If we stop Wald's crew, they may realise Bauer turned them in.
not_available Contact CTU immediately.
not_available I won't let him hurtyou again.
not_available You're reporting a child abduction? 
not_available My daughter.
not_available Describe the suspect.
not_available Her name's Kimberly Bauer.
not_available It's kinda messed up.
not_available I have the police after me.
not_available Can you get to CTU? 
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available My name's Kimberly Bauer.
not_available Tony Almeida is expecting us.
not_available You think you'll take that building down with three charges? What made you target CTU anyway? Why so many questions? 
not_available We did it, Jack.
not_available Good job, Eddie.
not_available Good job.
not_available The walls are coming down.
not_available We have seven DOAs in the alpha zone.
not_available What's your count? Ten so far.
not_available Fire and rescue teams are en route.
not_available Tony Tony? Can we get some help over here? A little help.
not_available Tony! Michelle! I need you to set up a triage.
not_available Take Luke with you.
not_available Luke, I've gotyou.
not_available It's Michelle.
not_available Let me see that.
not_available Paula? Paula, can you hear me? What happened? You don't have to speak.
not_available Just blink your eyes if you can hear me.
not_available We're gonna getyou outta there.
not_available Just hang tight.
not_available All right? She's bad, man.
not_available We gotta get a crane or a hydraulic lift in here.
not_available We have to be careful.
not_available If we pull out the wrong piece, it could come down on her.
not_available We have to do this brick by brick.
not_available That could take for ever.
not_available All right, let's do it.
not_available It's OK.
not_available We're gonna be all right.
not_available You're being real brave.
not_available Real 
not_available Ssh, ssh, come on.
not_available I don't feel very well.
not_available We're gonna be OK.
not_available We're gonna be out of here soon, OK? All right? Megan! Megan! Somebody help me! Please, I need some help! 
not_available Hold her down.
not_available What's wrong with her? What's the matter? Megan! Megan! 
not_available She's seizing.
not_available We've gotta get her to the ER right away.
not_available What's wrong with her? Sir, we did everything we could do.
not_available If only Bauer had called earlier, even a few minutes, we could've saved those people.
not_available Until we know more, I'd like to go over my evacuation plan for LA.
not_available It's on your desk.
not_available I'll call you when I'm ready to meet on it.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Those people are dead because of you.
not_available I wanted to tell the president.
not_available Butyou didn't.
not_available Because of you, Eric.
not_available You made sure I couldn't get through to him.
not_available As far as I know, Bauer never called.
not_available You're the one who spoke to him.
not_available Are you blackmailing me? 
not_available I'm protecting the president.
not_available Lynne, whatever you know or thinkyou know, I suggestyou keep it to yourself.
not_available Everything in your car, I had it cleared out and put into the ambulance.
not_available So whenever you're ready to go to the hospital.
not_available So how's it gonna happen? 
not_available Excuse me? You said I might be dead by tomorrow.
not_available I'm curious to know what to expect for the rest of the day.
not_available Uh There's a latent period where you'll be mostly asymptomatic.
not_available Even in the most extreme cases of radiation poisoning, it can last a while.
not_available What's a while? Uh up to 12 hours, maybe longer.
not_available How do you feel now? I wanna puke.
not_available I can give you something to control the nausea.
not_available Thanks, yeah.
not_available At least until the symptoms are more acute.
not_available Yeah, like what? Your hair will start to fall out.
not_available I'm used to that.
not_available You'll start to manifest gastrointestinal haemorrhaging, skin lesions, bleeding from the mouth and the nose.
not_available OK.
not_available So how am I gonna die? Um Your mental functioning will begin to deteriorate and then you'll lapse into a coma Mr Mason.
not_available Not now.
not_available It's Tony Almeida.
not_available Not now! 
not_available He said it's urgent.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Tony, what is it? 
not_available They hit us, George.
not_available They bombed CTU.
not_available What kind of damage? Damage reports are still coming in but so far we got 19 dead, We're bleeding bad here, George.
not_available All of our intel on the nuke was destroyed.
not_available It's on the NSA server but Paula wrote the decryption code and she's in bad shape.
not_available Do whatever you have to to retrieve it.
not_available That's why I called you.
not_available Chain of command, remember? 
not_available Call NSA systems people.
not_available Get them on it.
not_available I already did, George.
not_available Good.
not_available When are you coming back here? I'm not sure.
not_available Well, the sooner the better.
not_available Look, the truth is I may not be coming back.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I'm not in a position to help out right now.
not_available What are you talking about? Look, a nuclear device is set to go off some time today in LA.
not_available We lost half the people who could've stopped it, so stop trying to cover your own ass! Just deal with it, Tony, OK? Just deal with it, all right? Yeah, right.
not_available Jack, you come with me.
not_available All right, light her up.
not_available Let's get outta here.
not_available Hey, Joe.
not_available It's done.
not_available No.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I can do it.
not_available Give me the address.
not_available Yeah, I know where it is.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Out.
not_available Was that Joe? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Give me the matchbook, Eddie.
not_available What the hell are you doing, Jack? I'm a federal officer.
not_available You're under arrest.
not_available Now give me the matchbook.
not_available You helped plant those bombs and cut Goren's head off.
not_available I know what I did, Eddie.
not_available Putyour right hand on the steering wheel.
not_available And very slowly, with your left hand, pass me your gun.
not_available You know, Jack, when Joe finds out about this, you're a dead man.
not_available Shut up, Eddie.
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available That son of a bitch.
not_available Tony Almeida's line.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available Michelle Dressler.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available What's going on? There was an explosion 20 minutes ago.
not_available Why wasn't CTU evacuated? 
not_available There wasn't any time.
not_available What do you mean there wasn't enough time? Is Mason all right? He wasn't here.
not_available How about Tony Almeida? 
not_available He's helping the rescue workers.
not_available Fine.
not_available Can you handle a situation report? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, go ahead.
not_available I've located Joseph Wald.
not_available I'm on my way there now.
not_available What about Wald's crew? 
not_available They're all dead.
not_available Dead? Just let Mason know I'm on my way to Wald's house.
not_available The address is 221 Canyon View Road in Simi Valley.
not_available OK, III send backup.
not_available OK.
not_available Oh, Michelle, let Mason know I talked to Kim.
not_available She is leaving the city.
not_available She called here too and she spoke to Tony.
not_available She did? What did she say? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available But I'll look into it.
not_available OK, get backto me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Paula! Paula! Is she OK? Tony! What's up? 
not_available Just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
not_available Where is he? On his way to see Wald.
not_available He wanted Mason to know.
not_available Well, Mason's checked out.
not_available Just get the information directly to NSA.
not_available And he asked about his daughter, Kim.
not_available Oh Oh, no.
not_available What? She was on her way here.
not_available Can you checkthe security logs, see if she was in the building? Thanks.
not_available Is Megan all right? 
not_available She will be.
not_available Her seizure was caused by pressure on the brain compounded by a skull fracture.
not_available But she wasn't injured in the explosion.
not_available I know.
not_available From what I've seen, her head injury most likely occurred before the blast.
not_available She's had prior injuries 
not_available a fractured wrist, several fingers that were never treated.
not_available What are you saying? These injuries suggest a possible pattern of physical abuse.
not_available You don't think I did this? You don't think I hurt her? I'm gonna let the police sort that out.
not_available Bill, they're limiting access.
not_available All we know is that a short time ago, a major explosion ripped through this government building in Los Angeles.
not_available No statement has been issued about the cause of the explosion, although early speculation has included rumours of terrorist involvement.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, this tips in favour of evacuation.
not_available I assume you've all read Eric's report recommending the evacuation of LA.
not_available The CTU bombing is just the beginning.
not_available It's only a matter of time before the questions become rumours, and the rumours set off a mass panic.
not_available Wouldn't the evacuation itself cause panic? We can do this discreetly.
not_available We've prepared cover stories.
not_available That's a tough sell for nine million people.
not_available General Preston assures me that the military can contain any civilian unrest.
not_available "Contain" sounds like a euphemism.
not_available Not to mention the Constitutional issues.
not_available I don't claim this'll be a cakewalk.
not_available There's also a practical issue not being addressed here.
not_available What's that, Lynne? Our intelligence is specific about this nuclear device being detonated today.
not_available Your report says it would take at least one week for this evacuation.
not_available It's my job to protect as many citizens of the United States as I can.
not_available If I get even 20%of the population outside the blast radius, that's a win.
not_available We don't know where the bomb is.
not_available Where do we begin the evacuation? My staff has ranked ten high probability target areas.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available Look, I realise you've only had a short time to prepare this, but I have some real reservations.
not_available Bottom line, Mr President, it protects you politically.
not_available If the bomb goes off If the bomb goes off, we'll have more important concerns than my re
not_available election.
not_available Do you have anything else to add? No, sir.
not_available Then we're done.
not_available Until we have reliable intelligence about where the bomb is located, there will be no evacuation.
not_available Let General Davenlos know I'm ready for him, and conference in Ted and Elyse.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available I need to speakto the president urgently.
not_available One moment please, Mr Bauer.
not_available I need you to confirm these reports and get them on Novick's desk.
not_available Lynne Kresge.
not_available I have Jack Bauer on line eight.
not_available He insists on speaking to the president.
not_available Put him through, please.
not_available Mr Bauer, this is Lynne Kresge.
not_available I asked to speakto the president.
not_available I'm sorry, he's unavailable.
not_available Perhaps I can help.
not_available What the hell are you doing? I gave you a 30
not_available minute warning before that building was hit.
not_available You had time to evacuate.
not_available There were extenuating circumstances.
not_available I did try to tell the president.
not_available It's more complicated than I'm able to explain at this time.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available It's all I can offer you.
not_available Ms Kresge, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're responsible for killing innocent people.
not_available Friends of mine.
not_available Right now you are the best chance we have of intercepting that nuclear weapon.
not_available So I suggestyou do your job.
not_available I'll do my job.
not_available You people better start doing yours.
not_available Dad? 
not_available I need to talkto you.
not_available It's important.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sure, honey.
not_available Just a second.
not_available This wedding's gonna break me.
not_available So, what's the big emergency? Last month I was going over the P and Ls and I found some inconsistencies.
not_available If this is business, we'll deal with this on Monday.
not_available Dad, it's about Reza.
not_available What about Reza? I thought he might have been responsible for the missing money so I hired an investigator to do an audit.
not_available You hired someone to spy on Reza? 
not_available I thought he was stealing from you.
not_available And is he? No.
not_available But something else came up.
not_available Something a lot worse.
not_available Come on.
not_available Reza may be involved with a terrorist.
not_available What? Apparently he's been in contact with someone who finances terrorist operations.
not_available A man named Syed Ali.
not_available What kind of proof does he have? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available You're not sure? He only called me an hour ago.
not_available He told me not to tell anyone, but I had to tell you.
not_available Whatever this investigator found, there's an explanation for it.
not_available You hire a man to dig up dirt, he's gonna dig up dirt.
not_available That's howthese guys stay in business.
not_available What if you're wrong? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available How do you know? Because I had Reza checked out myself.
not_available And a lot more thoroughly than the guy you hired.
not_available Kate, Reza is not a terrorist.
not_available Look, I am a businessman, Kate.
not_available A damn good one.
not_available My daughters are my most precious assets.
not_available I wouldn't let either one of you get married without performing a due diligence.
not_available Now, I wantyou to drop this nonsense and start treating him like a member of the family.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Hey! I think my cousin's got a little crush on you, Kate.
not_available He wouldn't stop talking aboutyou.
not_available He seems nice.
not_available Yeah, he is.
not_available Well, I promised Marie I'd pick up lunch.
not_available I'd better get going.
not_available Let me take you.
not_available It's OK, I can handle it.
not_available When you see how much she's ordered, you'll need another pair of hands.
not_available Really, I can do it.
not_available Kate Go.
not_available Mobile 3, this is Dispatch.
not_available This is mobile 3.
not_available I have Tony Almeida at CTU for George Mason.
not_available Sir 
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available Tony? 
not_available George.
not_available I told you to handle this yourself.
not_available If I didn't have to talkto you again I'd be happy.
not_available But IT need to access the data stream Paula was working on.
not_available It's on your system.
not_available We need your password.
not_available My password? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hendrix.
not_available That's with an "X"? 
not_available How else would you spell it? Right.
not_available Thanks, George.
not_available Tony? 
not_available What? How's Paula doing? Not good.
not_available They're trying to dig her out, but she's unresponsive.
not_available Look, I gotta go.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Am I contagious? No.
not_available Joe, it's Jack.
not_available Let me in.
not_available Where's Eddie? 
not_available He's dead.
not_available What about Chris and Scott? 
not_available They're dead, too.
not_available Let me in.
not_available I talked to Eddie half an hour ago.
not_available Joe, we gotta do this inside.
not_available Let me in.
not_available Eddie said the job went off without a hitch.
not_available What happened between then and now? I killed them, for resisting arrest.
not_available I'll kill you, too, Joe.
not_available I mean it.
not_available Put it down on the table.
not_available Put it down! On the table, now.
not_available Have a seat on the couch.
not_available You killed Goren.
not_available I did what I had to to find you.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available What do you want? Who told you to hit CTU today? What makes you think anyone told me? Because there's a nuclear device somewhere in Los Angeles set to go off today.
not_available That's right, Joe.
not_available CTU was a secondary target.
not_available A way of stopping us from getting to the bomb.
not_available Whoever gotyou to do this job, they used you, setyou up.
not_available You're lying, Jack.
not_available No, this time I'm telling you the truth.
not_available How else do you think I got to Goren? Come on, you're not stupid.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Why did you hit CTU today? Of all the days you could have, why did you hit CTU today? You weren't just told where to hit, you were told when.
not_available That's the truth, Joe.
not_available So, I'm gonna give you one last chance.
not_available Who told you to hit CTU today? Open the door, Joe.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Open the door! There's no other way outta here, Joe.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Carla.
not_available Kim, where are you? 
not_available The emergency room.
not_available Where's Megan? 
not_available She's with the doctors.
not_available Oh, my God, what happened? 
not_available She collapsed, started shaking.
not_available The doctors said she had a seizure because of pressure on her brain.
not_available Where are you? What hospital? First listen to me.
not_available No, you listen.
not_available You kidnapped my daughter and attacked my husband.
not_available You knowthat's not true.
not_available It's Gary's fault that Megan is here.
not_available The doctor said she had a seizure because of a head injury.
not_available Gary threw her down and she hit her head.
not_available It was an accident, Kim.
not_available Stop making excuses for him, denying what's happening.
not_available This isn'tyour problem, Kim.
not_available They found other things on Megan's x
not_available rays.
not_available They think she's been abused.
not_available I think so, too.
not_available Carla, are you there? Yeah, I'm here.
not_available The hospital called the police.
not_available They're on their way.
not_available You should be here when they come.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available St Virgil's Emergency Room.
not_available I'm 20 minutes away.
not_available A tactical team's on its way, Joe.
not_available There's nowhere for you to go.
not_available The people who gave you the information for CTU, the schematic, all the access codes, I wantyou to know what they're trying to do.
not_available They wanna destroy this entire country, starting with LA.
not_available Is that really whatyou want, Joe? I thoughtyou wanted to give the power backto the people.
not_available Isn't that whatyou used to say? Who do you think's gonna be at ground zero, Joe? You're not fighting the federal government.
not_available We're talking about innocent people.
not_available How many of them are gonna have to die for you today? A hundred thousand? Two hundred thousand? No, I don't think so.
not_available I think it's gonna be a lot closer to a million, once you factor in the radiation.
not_available Is that whatyou wantyour legacy to be, Joe? Come on, Joe.
not_available Just open the door.
not_available Son of a bitch! That's the funny thing about people like you, Joe.
not_available You wanna blame the rest of the world for everything wrong with your life.
not_available The government's too big.
not_available They're too powerful.
not_available Well, here's a bit of irony for you.
not_available You got all the power now, Joe.
not_available You got all the power.
not_available Question is, what are you gonna do with it? You gonna let all those people die, Joe? Dammit, Joe! You are running out of time.
not_available We are all running out of time.
not_available You, uh don't really like me very much, do you? That's crazy.
not_available I've been working for your father for three years.
not_available I've been dating Marie for two.
not_available Butyou and l, we never really got to know each other.
not_available No, no, we haven't.
not_available So, you don't know who I am.
not_available I know my sister loves you.
not_available Yes, she does.
not_available Where are you going? It's not the way to Brent's.
not_available I want to show you something first.
not_available What? It'll only take a few minutes.
not_available Where are we going? I'm gonna letyou in on a secret.
not_available In the spirit of getting to know each other better.
not_available Where are you taking me? 
not_available You'll find out.
not_available Tell me now or stop the car.
not_available It's a surprise.
not_available Stop the car.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available I said stop the car! What are you doing? Why won'tyou tell me where we're going? I wanted to show you the house.
not_available What house? 
not_available The house I just bought for Marie as a wedding present.
not_available I wanted you to be the first one to see it.
not_available Stand back.
not_available All right, step aside.
not_available Let's get ready to get blood pressure.
not_available OK.
not_available BP's 80 over 50.
not_available Get some saline into her stat.
not_available Is she all right? 
not_available She's haemorrhaging.
not_available The girder staunched the bleeding, but once we lifted it off, the dam broke.
not_available Can you stop it? If we don't get her to the ER, she'll bleed to death.
not_available Easy.
not_available Watch her neckthere.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Let's get her out, guys.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available All right, easy.
not_available All right, set her down.
not_available Let's go, let's go.
not_available Get a structural engineer and get him over here now.
not_available I have to keep people working.
not_available What's going on? I thoughtyou weren't coming back here.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available You did? Why? I don't have to answer to you.
not_available How bad is she? She's bleeding internally.
not_available Anything you can do, you can do here? 
not_available No.
not_available She needs surgery.
not_available Are you gonna put her under anaesthesia? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How long will she be under? 
not_available A few hours.
not_available Then she stays here.
not_available Everything we have on this nuke has been destroyed.
not_available All we have is the database Paula sent to the NSA and they didn't get the code.
not_available We'll assign other IT people to retrieve it.
not_available She's the only one who can decrypt the files.
not_available We'll send a programmer with her.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available I need her here and I need her lucid.
not_available I don't care whatyou have to do.
not_available Can you get her conscious? I can maybe get her BP up temporarily.
not_available You're out of your mind.
not_available Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better.
not_available This girl deserves a chance to live.
not_available Wake her up.
not_available Now! Tell me we're clear.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll speakto you soon.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Sir, this is Jenny's statement to the press about the CTU bombing.
not_available I took a quick pass but we can go over it whenever you get a chance, all right? Were you ever gonna tell me? About the 30 minutes after Jack Bauer called, and the time you finally warned CTU.
not_available Lynne, I am the president of the United States.
not_available Did you really think I wouldn't find out? What reason could you have had for keeping this information from me? 
not_available Sir, I tried to tell you.
not_available Not hard enough.
not_available Sir, when Jack Bauer called, you were with the press.
not_available I tried to get a message to you.
not_available Good.
not_available Now, after we found out that CTU had been hit, you still kept from me the fact thatyou knew 30 minutes earlier.
not_available Sir, you're right.
not_available There's no excuse.
not_available None.
not_available After Jack Bauer called, did you tell anyone else? You told Rayburn, didn'tyou? And he was the one that wanted you to keep it from me.
not_available That's why you two were arguing earlier.
not_available Sir, I think, under the circumstances, it would be best if I tendered my resignation.
not_available I'll decide what's best.
not_available Yes, of course, sir.
not_available As much as I appreciate the gesture, I don't have time to appease your guilty conscience.
not_available But I still trustyou, Lynne.
not_available And I trustyou'll tell me everything that happened.
not_available What's going on? Why is she here? Why is Paula still here? 
not_available It's Mason's call.
not_available She has almost no chance if we don't get her to a hospital now.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I thought Mason wasn't even coming back.
not_available He's back.
not_available He's trying to revive Paula long enough to access the information she was sending NSA.
not_available So he's just gonna let her die? I'm not so sure Mason made the wrong call.
not_available I mean, Paula is the only person that can retrieve that information.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry, Tony.
not_available It's just, I'm the one that brought her to CTU.
not_available I hired her.
not_available This job is all she ever wanted to do.
not_available She never even got a chance to do it.
not_available She did.
not_available We'd better get backto work.
not_available Please come with us, sir.
not_available Come with you where? 
not_available The president wants to see you.
not_available Mr President.
not_available You're out, Eric.
not_available Effective immediately.
not_available Sir, if this is about 
not_available You know exactly what this is about.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available Is that what Lynne told you? Lynne didn't have to tell me anything.
not_available You can't dismiss me now, sir.
not_available Not in the middle of a crisis.
not_available You need me here.
not_available I need someone I can trust.
not_available I made a decision thatyou couldn't make.
not_available I'm the only one who could make it.
not_available And now 27 people are dead.
not_available Collateral damage, sir.
not_available Regrettable but necessary, so that Bauer could get to Wald.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available Mr Armus is waiting to talkto him.
not_available OK, Joe, this is how it lays out.
