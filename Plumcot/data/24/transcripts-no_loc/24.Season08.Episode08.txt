not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Our security police have completed their initial sweep of the capital city.
not_available Sixty
not_available five known members of the opposition have been arrested and are being questioned.
not_available Have you learned anything? Were any of them working with my brother? 
not_available It's too early to tell.
not_available Kayla, your father is a great man, but Farhad's betrayal has changed him.
not_available What can we do? 
not_available The president says you may be involved with his brother.
not_available ÃÂe's ordered me to detain you.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available President Hassan's crackdown isn't just a response to the attempt on his life.
not_available There are unsecured nuclear materials in play.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available is running an undercover operation to retrieve them as we speak.
not_available l've got something.
not_available lt's an N.Y.P.D.
not_available evidence lockup.
not_available A local vice group just impounded 120,000.
not_available l help you do this, and you never call me again.
not_available That's beautiful, man.
not_available Absolutely beautiful.
not_available lt's a cop.
not_available You're gonna have to slip past him.
not_available I'm at the warehouse at
not_available Nick! Kevin, stop him! l hear there are materials for sale.
not_available Talk straight.
not_available What materials? 
not_available Nuclear rods.
not_available Nobody deals in nuclear rods.
not_available Nobody.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.
not_available Come on, Vladimir.
not_available Push them harder.
not_available Somebody knows something.
not_available No one knows.
not_available There's no one left to call.
not_available Look, it's over! What is wrong with you? 
not_available Renee, stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available They're Russian.
not_available What are you doing? l need to Iet them take me.
not_available When C.ÃÂ¤.U.
not_available gets here, you tell them to start tracking me from the air.
not_available These people are gonna lead us to everything we're looking for.
not_available l'm unarmed.
not_available Don't shoot.
not_available We can do business.
not_available Where's Jack? The Russians took him.
not_available ÃÂe said that you'd be monitoring him from the air.
not_available We haven't seen anything.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available The following takes place between 1 1:00 p.m.
not_available and 12:00 a.m.
not_available Yeah? Where the hell are you? 
not_available Hey, Jenny girl! You said you would call me as soon as the two of you got clear.
not_available l'm sorry, sweetheart.
not_available I forgot.
not_available WeWe got caught
not_available We got caught up celebrating our score.
not_available Celebrating? You put a police officer in the hospital.
not_available Hey, that wasn't me.
not_available That was Nick.
not_available Look, why do
not_available Why do you gotta focus on the negative? We're flush a hundred and twenty grand.
not_available Why don't you just come down here, have a drink, celebrate with us? We're at a club in Jersey City called Starlight.
not_available All right? We'll work out your cut.
not_available What cut? l don't want anything from you, Kevin.
not_available We're done.
not_available l want you to put my key in my mailbox and get the hell out of my life like you promised.
not_available Yeah, that
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available This is a sweet operation we got going here.
not_available You getting the access codes and
not_available and us pulling the jobs.
not_available WW
not_available Wait.
not_available We had a deal, Kevin.
not_available You promised me l do this one thing for you, and then you leave me alone.
not_available ll know, and land I
not_available And I meant that, all right.
not_available But things change, okay? AndAnd
not_available But we can get rich off of this, Jenny.
not_available You can't do this to me, Kevin.
not_available Jenny, please
not_available Look, bitch, you're in this up to your neck.
not_available You want your boss, you want your boyfriend finding out you're not who you say you are? You're gonna be our golden goose, okay? 
not_available Hello? 
not_available Dana.
not_available What are you doing? We've got a situation.
not_available You need to be on the floor.
not_available Dana.
not_available I heard you, I will be right there.
not_available Who was that on the phone just now? ÃÂ¤hat's none of your business.
not_available Actually, it is.
not_available When you start sneaking away to make phone calls or leave the officemaking me cover for you
not_available it becomes my business.
not_available Now, who was that? Kevin? How the hell would you
not_available Are you spying on me? Look, you want to step out on your fiancÃ©, it's fine with me.
not_available God knows l've got no love for the guy.
not_available You have no idea what you are talking about.
not_available I am not cheating on Cole.
not_available Whatever you want to call it, you'd better start telling your boyfriend what's going on, or I will.
not_available Now, come on.
not_available Our undercover operation just went south.
not_available What's happened? Jack Bauer was grabbed by an unknown group of armed Russians.
not_available We think they're the ones in control of the nuclear rods.
not_available Are we tracking them? We can't.
not_available They took Bauer through an underground access behind the building.
not_available Without aerial support, the best my people could do was track 'em to a drainage junction near Avenue Y and Ocean.
not_available They must have had a vehicle standing by.
not_available Jack's cell phone was trashed at the scene.
not_available There has to be something at the site to help us I.D.
not_available the vehicle.
not_available ÃÂ¤ire treads, transmission fluid, oil residue? No, there's nothing, sir.
not_available Trail's gone cold.
not_available What about Walker? Didn't she get a good look at these people? l don't know, sir.
not_available Frankly, she's pretty messed up right now.
not_available Blaming herself for Jack's circumstances.
not_available Well, she should.
not_available She crippled this operation when she murdered her contact.
not_available Without Vladimir Laitanan, we have no lead to finding Bauer or the nuclear materials.
not_available You get her back to C.ÃÂ¤.U.
not_available for debriefing.
not_available l want to know what the hell happened.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You might want to consider running a psych eval on her when we arrive.
not_available Count on it.
not_available You were supposed to be coordinating with N.S.A., monitoring chatter.
not_available I know.
not_available Something came up.
not_available I had to take care of it.
not_available What was so important? 
not_available It's my fault, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available l asked Dana to recover a data Iog I accidentaIly deleted from Archives.
not_available l didn't have clearance.
not_available l'm uplinking to N.S.A.
not_available servers now.
not_available All right.
not_available Just get on it.
not_available Roll back any chatter within the last 20 minutes.
not_available Right now, that's all we've got.
not_available Let me know if something turns up.
not_available l need to brief President ÃÂ¤aylor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You can thank me by putting aside whatever it is that's bothering you and helping me find Jack.
not_available He's my friend, and he's in trouble.
not_available Take him down the hall.
not_available Where is Vladimir? Dead.
not_available So are his men.
not_available The German said they tried to rip him off.
not_available Did he also say how he knows about the fuel rods? 
not_available Who are you? Ernst Meier.
not_available l've been looking for you to make you an offer.
not_available You know who I am? No.
not_available All l know is that there's a very powerful man in the Russian syndicate who's been trafficking weaponsgrade uranium, specifically U
not_available 235 fuel rods.
not_available After the nasty business with Laitanan, these men brought me here, so I'm just assuming you're that man.
not_available Where did you get this information? l represent a consortium of private interests.
not_available ÃÂ¤hey intercepted communiquÃ©s within the lslamic Republic.
not_available From whom? Farhad Hassan or someone in his camp.
not_available ln either case, you're doing business with the wrong people.
not_available And who are these people
not_available the ones you work for? l'm sure you can understand I'm not at liberty to say.
not_available You should be less concerned about who I work for and more concerned about the deal they're willing to offer you.
not_available l'm not interested in your offer.
not_available $250 million, half of which is ready to be wired to you immediately.
not_available ÃÂ¤he other half you will receive upon final acquisition of the fuel rods.
not_available You pose a very difficult problem for me.
not_available You show up out of nowhere, knowing far too much of my business, yet l have never heard of you.
not_available You've never heard of me because I'm good at what I do.
not_available What l'm concerned about is that you're a cop.
not_available l just killed three people back at that garage.
not_available Vladimir Laitanan, l stabbed in the eye.
not_available You really think l'm a cop? As a child, I saw K.G.B.
not_available throw an entire family off the roof of a building, two of them small children.
not_available l know what cops are capable of.
not_available So l ask you again, who do you work for? l'm sorry.
not_available I can't tell you that.
not_available Dimitri, work on him until he's ready to tell us everything.
not_available No, we can make a deaI.
not_available We can still make a deaI! No! No! 
not_available No! You have buried your brother's body? lt's Oleg's necklace.
not_available You gave it to him at his confirmation.
not_available You keep it to remind you of him.
not_available I'm glad you're back.
not_available We may have a problem.
not_available What is it? There is a man down the hall who claims to be an arms broker.
not_available ÃÂe knows about the nuclear rods.
not_available How could he? He says there was a leak from Farhad's people, but I wonder.
not_available Until I know for certain who and what this man is, l've stopped the transport of the rods.
not_available They've been redirected to a weigh station off the Wantagh Parkway.
not_available l'm sure Farhad can't be happy about that.
not_available l haven't told him yet.
not_available Perhaps we should tell him together.
not_available ÃÂow long do you plan to hold him off? ÃÂ¤hat depends.
not_available On what? On how long it takes Dimitri to break this guy.
not_available No.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Policeman.
not_available l'm not a cop.
not_available I swear to you.
not_available Please don't do this.
not_available Tell me what you know.
not_available 
not_available We are exhausting all efforts to ascertain who took Bauer and where.
not_available But until any progress is made, wejust have to hope that Jack can find some way ofsalvaging the operation on his end.
not_available What even makes you think he's still alive? Only the fact that he wasn't killed at the point of abduction.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, l need a realistic assessment.
not_available What are the odds of finding and securing these nucIear weapons within the next few hours? l can't answer that, ma'am, but the longer we're out of touch with Bauer, the less likely our chances.
not_available All right, Mr.
not_available ÃÂastings.
not_available Continue to coordinate with my office.
not_available l want updates every 30 minutes.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available l just spoke to General Wasim.
not_available He's very worried.
not_available Your brother's crackdowns back home are intensifying.
not_available Everyone's being arrested.
not_available Our window of opportunity is closing.
not_available And why didn't the general call me himselff? Perhaps he's losing confidence in your ability to complete our mission.
not_available This is my mission.
not_available My plan! Of course.
not_available But we're running out of time.
not_available lf your brother dismantles our opposition forces, we will no longer be able to reconstitute our nuclear program.
not_available He won't succeed.
not_available At this rate, he will.
not_available ÃÂow much longer must we wait for the delivery of the uranium? Not long.
not_available The rods should be arriving to you within the hour.
not_available Have your men ready.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available Yes? What is it? ÃÂ¤here is a man downstairs who's shown up to outbid you for the fuel rods.
not_available ls this some feeble attempt to renegotiate terms? Not at all.
not_available This man, Meier, claims someone in your organization tipped him off to our deal.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available He's lying.
not_available At any rate, in light of his sudden appearance, l'm halting delivery of the rods for the time being.
not_available What? You can't do that.
not_available It's already done.
not_available l cannot take the risk that we may be exposed.
not_available The longer you delay, the more time my brother has to crush his enemies.
not_available lf he manages to purge everyone in the military who opposes him, the uranium is worthless to me.
not_available That's your concern.
not_available Mine is to make certain this Meier is not a policeman.
not_available One of my men is interrogating him now.
not_available That could take hours, even days.
not_available Not days.
not_available l can promise you that.
not_available You promised to assassinate my brother too.
not_available Your failure to eliminate him has put me under enormous pressure.
not_available And now, because of your people's inability to maintain secrecy, you break our agreed timetable to suit your needs.
not_available Don't speak to my father that way.
not_available We've honored every agreement we made with you and shed a lot of blood for it.
not_available My father's allowed you to stay here and hide from the feds at great personal risk to our family.
not_available ÃÂ¤ell him to put the gun down.
not_available No.
not_available We're not taking any more of your demands.
not_available Throw him out of here.
not_available Let his own people shelter him if he thinks we're such fools.
not_available l'll drive him there myself if that's what it takes.
not_available lt would seem you have used up our hospitality here.
not_available Perhaps it's best you join your men at the rendezvous point to wait for delivery.
not_available And when will that be? When l think it's safe.
not_available Not a moment before.
not_available Make sure he gets where he's going.
not_available Still got men back at the scene in case we missed something.
not_available ln the meantime, l'll work out the aerial sweep protocols with Arlo.
not_available What are you doing to find Jack? Everything we can, Ms.
not_available Walker.
not_available Come with me.
not_available ÃÂave you checked all thethe traffic cams, subway routes? You have all this technology working for you
not_available comm surveillance, satellite tracking.
not_available We're using everything at our disposal.
not_available Then how come you haven't found him yet? Why don't you have any leads? The best lead we had is dead.
not_available l know about your suicide attempt.
not_available You should have been honest with me.
not_available O'Brian will take your statement.
not_available l want to know every detail about every event leading up to the death of Vladimir Laitanan.
not_available When she's done, take her to Medical.
not_available l've ordered a full psych evaluation.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Uh, you can write your statement in here.
not_available Hastings blames me for what happened to Jack.
not_available And he's right.
not_available No, he's not.
not_available ÃÂe shouldn't have said that.
not_available The only reason that Jack was even part of this operation was because of me.
not_available So whatever they're doing to him right now, it's because of me.
not_available l have to find him, Chloe.
not_available Renee, l know how you must feel.
not_available Just
not_available Just take one thing at a time.
not_available You have to deal with what you did.
not_available So write your statement.
not_available I'll check back with you.
not_available Cole.
not_available Hey.
not_available Do you have some time? I need to talk to you.
not_available Can it wait? l need to review these protocols before Arlo distributes them.
not_available I've got it covered.
not_available Go talk to your girlfriend.
not_available What's up? You all right? No, I'm not.
not_available I have a big problem.
not_available And, uh, it's the reason why l've been acting kind of weird the past few days.
not_available Okay.
not_available Listen, if you're calling off the engagement, you couldn't have picked a worse day.
not_available No.
not_available No, l would never do that.
not_available Good.
not_available So, what's bothering you? There are things about my past that I haven't told you.
not_available l'm listening.
not_available Hey.
not_available l'm sure l haven't told you everything about my past either.
not_available Listen, l don't care what happened before I met you.
not_available All that matters is now and what we have to look forward to.
not_available l think that's all that matters too.
not_available So, what are you so worried about? l don't want to lose you.
not_available l'm not going anywhere.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Agent Ortiz, Mr.
not_available Hastings needs to see you in his office.
not_available ÃÂ¤ell him l'll be there as soon as l can.
not_available No.
not_available Go.
not_available Hastings can wait.
not_available So can this.
not_available Talking to you has helped.
not_available l think l know what l need to do now.
not_available You sure? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Okay.
not_available Maybe later, you tell me what this is all about? 
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Who do you work for? 
not_available Who else knows about the fuel rods? 
not_available Everybody has a limit.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available l'll find yours.
not_available You're working with the police.
not_available Admit it.
not_available Tell me.
not_available The pain will stop.
not_available Who else knows? 
not_available l swear to you.
not_available I'm not a cop.
not_available Please.
not_available l'm just
not_available I'm just a businessman.
not_available Please stop.
not_available Who do you work for? l'm an independent contractor.
not_available l couldn't even tell you if l wanted.
not_available Please.
not_available We'Il see.
not_available Wake up.
not_available l said wake up.
not_available l told you l didn't want to be disturbed.
not_available Your daughter is still demanding to see you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available She refuses to leave.
not_available Very well.
not_available Send her in.
not_available Kayla, my love.
not_available l'm in the middle of a crisis, so unless it's an emergency
not_available lt is an emergency.
not_available We need to talk about you having Tarin arrested.
not_available Tarin has been taken to the embassy to help clarify a few questions, strictly routine.
not_available I know you believe he's been working against you.
not_available What l don't understand is why.
not_available ÃÂe refused to follow my orders.
not_available You asked him to arrest the family of one of your delegates, a man you considered a friend.
not_available Kayla, this is a matter of state.
not_available It doesn't concern you.
not_available lt doesn't make sense.
not_available ÃÂ¤arin was in the car with you.
not_available lf the assassination attempt was successful, he would have been killed too.
not_available ÃÂ¤he world is full of men willing to die for their cause.
not_available l know you consider Tarin a friend.
not_available And your loyalty is commendable, but, trust me, I have my reasons.
not_available We are more than friends.
not_available We're in love, and have been for almost a year.
not_available You've been carrying on with this man behind my back? You say that to me, after driving mother away with your infidelity? Please, Father, don't let Uncle Farhad's betrayal turn you against everyone who cares about you.
not_available l can't think of a better way to completely infiltrate my life and influence my judgment than getting close to my daughter.
not_available lt's not like that.
not_available You're not to see that man again, ever.
not_available Father
not_available I am done with this conversation.
not_available l need to get back to my work.
not_available What's happening to you? 
not_available Come on.
not_available I am holding the rods until Meier comes clean about how he knew of the transfer.
not_available If what Meier said is true about the leak in Farhad's team, it will be dangerous for us.
not_available So we must unload the rods, finish this.
not_available Let them be someone else's bloody headache now.
not_available And we erase any evidence.
not_available Once Dimitri is finished and I'm satisfied the German is telling the truth, I'm going to want to hand off the rods to Farhad tonight.
not_available Keep your men out of sight, along the perimeter.
not_available Mikhail and his man will stay with the cargo.
not_available Check to see if the rest of the street lost power.
not_available Just us.
not_available It's Meier.
not_available Cover the exits.
not_available Check the fuse box.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Jack, everyone's been looking for you.
not_available Where are you? l need you to trace this call and send a tac team immediately.
not_available Jack? Jack? 
not_available Chloe, just trace the call.
not_available We're sure N.Y.P.D.'s got the perimeter locked down? The restaurant and everything in a block radius is secure.
not_available Our response team will be there soon.
not_available Where's Dana? She logged out of the building about 1 5 minutes ago.
not_available Something about fixing a faulty relay at our 1 7th Street station.
not_available Why didn't she just have I.P.
not_available Maintenance take care of it? 
not_available Good question.
not_available She had to manually reboot the firmware herself.
not_available That's what she said anyway.
not_available Where are we with this man Bazhaev? It's coming through right now.
not_available I've cross
not_available accessed interagency servers, also Interpol and F.S.B.
not_available I'm relaying intel as it comes in to our response team and to Jack.
not_available Good.
not_available Put it up on
not_available screen.
not_available Okay, people.
not_available We've l.D.'d the suspect we have in custody.
not_available His name is Sergei Petrovich Bazhaev, Ukrainian national, Now, we believe he knows the location of the unsecured nuclear rods.
not_available Tactical is on its way to transport him back here for interrogation.
not_available Agent Ortiz will coordinate operations from here.
not_available ls it true? They found Jack? Yeah.
not_available He's okay.
not_available lf you're finished with your statement, I need to take you to Medical.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available l want to be here when Jack gets back.
not_available l'll let him know where to find you.
not_available Come on.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, this should hold you for now.
not_available But you'll to have to go to the hospital.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available They uploaded the suspect's file right now.
not_available ÃÂow far out is C.ÃÂ¤.U.? They're about five minutes out.
not_available lt's all right.
not_available I got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sergeant.
not_available l need to speak with this man alone.
not_available l knew you were a cop.
not_available l should have trusted my instincts and killed you on the spot.
not_available Well, you can add it to your list of regrets.
not_available C.T.U.'s already acquired a great deal of intel on you, Mr.
not_available Bazhaev.
not_available lt's over.
not_available You know that, right? You're finished.
not_available At the very least, we've got you on kidnapping and murder, and that's before C.ÃÂ¤.U.
not_available rips this place apart and uncovers the rest of your criminal activity.
not_available Lucky for you, though, l'm only interested in one thing, and that's the acquisition of those fuel rods.
not_available So, if you were to cooperate, help me out there, that would go a long way to reducing what is clearly gonna be a very long prison sentence.
not_available That offer extends to both of your sons too
not_available Josef and Oleg.
not_available Oleg is dead.
not_available He was exposed to the rods.
not_available Became ill with radiation poisoning.
not_available He was suffering, and l shot him, as if he was just a sick dog.
not_available l murdered my own son for nothing.
not_available You want to know where the rods are? l will tell you, but I want full immunity
not_available not just for me, but for my other son, Josef.
not_available l don't think l can make that happen.
not_available Then we have nothing to talk about.
not_available l'll see what I can do.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available l need to speak with Hastings.
not_available l think he's in the middIe of a briefing with President Taylor.
not_available Even better.
not_available See if you can patch me in, okay? Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, it's Farhad Hassan I'm worried about.
not_available ÃÂow do we know he hasn't acquired the rods already? Based on the intel we have, the transfer hasn't taken place yet.
not_available Madam President, excuse the interruption.
not_available Jack Bauer's on the line.
not_available He wishes to be conferenced in.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Jack, it's President ÃÂ¤aylor.
not_available You're on with Mr.
not_available Hastings and my chief of staff.
not_available C.T.U.'s been keeping me apprised of your involvement in this.
not_available l'm sorry that it's taken this long for us to speak.
not_available l understand.
not_available Please forgive me for getting straight to the point.
not_available But the man that we have in custody, Sergei Bazhaev, is willing to cooperate.
not_available ÃÂe said he would hand over the fuel rods in exchange for full immunity for him and his son.
not_available ls that all? Why don't we give him a parade down Broadway too? Jack, you've been dealing with this man.
not_available ls there no other way to get the location of the nuclear materials out of him? lt says in his files that he did ln the time frame that we have, we're not gonna break him, Madam President.
not_available l can see it in his eyes.
not_available Mr.
not_available ÃÂastings, what is your assessment? Well, at first blush, l'd say an immunity deal is premature.
not_available But under the circumstances, l'll defer to Jack's judgment on this.
not_available Gentlemen, l have a peace deal that's going to fall apart at any moment unless I can show President Hassan that we have stopped his brother from smuggling those fuel rods out of the country.
not_available Make the deal, Jack.
not_available Madam President, he's going to want this in writing.
not_available He'll get it.
not_available But in the interests of expediency, put him on the phone with me.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available The president of the United States wants to talk to you.
not_available You want to tell me what's going on? What are you talking about? You were implying something about Dana.
not_available I want to know what it is.
not_available When she came over before and said she had to talk to you, what did she tell you? Nothing.
not_available She said she had a problem, but she'd handle it.
not_available That's it? Arlo, if you know something
not_available Okay, look, it's none of my business, and I didn't want to be the one to tell you this, but I think she went to meet some guy.
not_available You're out of your mind.
