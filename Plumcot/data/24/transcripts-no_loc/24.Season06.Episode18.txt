not_available We have a successful launch.
not_available Good.
not_available My government has alerted me of the nuclear weapon heading toward my country.
not_available That's correct, Mr Ambassador.
not_available We've made good on our threat.
not_available We have identified a general in central command, Mohmar Habib, who has been in contact with Fayed.
not_available He's been helping orchestrate attacks.
not_available I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of World War III.
not_available I've never found pharmaceutical torture that effective.
not_available I have.
not_available If this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time.
not_available I won't tell you a thing.
not_available Watch out! We staged a fake rescue by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib.
not_available He wants us to help you rendezvous.
not_available Where do you want us to take you? If you take your orders from Habib, as I do, how is it I've never heard of you? 
not_available Fayed's gone.
not_available Jamal's alive.
not_available Stay with him.
not_available Call a medic.
not_available On it.
not_available CTU, the bombs are secure.
not_available Hello? Jack Are you there? Can you hear me? 
not_available Audrey.
not_available Help me, Jack.
not_available Hello, Mr Bauer.
not_available Yes, Miss Raines is alive.
not_available If you wish her to remain that way, call me back in ten minutes.
not_available If you make any attempt to find our location, she dies.
not_available Cheng? Agent Bauer, you really do need to get to a hospital, but I understand the circumstances.
not_available At least this will help you with the pain.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available The marines will secure the nukes for transport.
not_available They're calling the shots.
not_available Military's taking over? Yeah, according to a presidential order.
not_available I guess DOD doesn't want CTU in charge.
not_available Buchanan wants you to call as soon as the nukes are ready.
not_available Can you handle that for me? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Jack? What? I know you've been through hell the last couple of years, and I wanted to thank you for what you did today, cos it could've ended a hell of a lot worse, and it would have if you weren't here.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yes? 
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Let me speak to Audrey.
not_available You've already spoken to her.
not_available I wanna make sure she's all right.
not_available Her wellbeing is entirely up to you, Mr Bauer.
not_available Everyone has given up on you, everyone 
not_available except for Miss Raines.
not_available Over the objections of your government, her family, her friends, she came to Beijing just to find you.
not_available Since you proved to be an uncooperative prisoner, we felt she would be an asset we might be able to exploit one day, and that day is here.
not_available I'll hand myself over to you.
not_available Tell me where.
not_available A man who won't break is of no use to us.
not_available But the Russian suitcase nukes you captured Why? Your country has the technology to build those weapons.
not_available It's not the weapons we're interested in.
not_available What we want is the component from the triggering mechanism.
not_available It contains prototype algorithm old enough to be free of any modern decryption safeguards.
not_available With it, we'll have access to virtually all Russian defence technology.
not_available It's a simple exchange.
not_available You give me the component, I give you Audrey.
not_available If you refuse, I'll kill her.
not_available The Russians will know that we supplied you.
not_available You would be starting World War III.
not_available I suggest we leave that to the diplomats.
not_available Even if I wanted to, the bombs are under military control.
not_available I couldn't get anywhere near them.
not_available You'll find a way.
not_available If I'm gonna agree to this, I wanna speak to Audrey now.
not_available Very well.
not_available Speak to him.
not_available Jack.
not_available Audrey, are you all right? Did they hurt you? No.
not_available Jack, I I'm sorry.
not_available You have nothing to be sorry for.
not_available The only thing that's important is that you're alive.
not_available I know what they're asking for.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available I promise you I'm gonna get you outta there.
not_available Just don't be frightened.
not_available You have an hour to call this number to make the exchange.
not_available An hour's not gonna give me enough time.
not_available Cheng? Cheng? Go ahead and move it all the way back.
not_available You know, you really should work from Medical, sir.
not_available Come on.
not_available At least they can monitor you.
not_available I'm fine, Tom.
not_available I I don't think that you are, sir.
not_available And neither does Doctor Weldon.
not_available Putting myself under supervision might give the vice president a pretext to try and take a run at my job.
not_available You don't need to worry about that, sir.
not_available What exactly do you have on Vice President Daniels? I have the truth, sir.
not_available Now is the time that I need to know what that is.
not_available It is a tape recording of Vice President Daniels conspiring with Lisa Miller to commit perjury at your competency hearing.
not_available I'd love to hear that as soon as possible.
not_available Mr President, Tom, I have good news.
not_available CTU has recovered the two remaining suitcase nukes.
not_available When? 
not_available Just a few minutes ago.
not_available I just got off the phone with Bill.
not_available He'll brief you when you're ready.
not_available What about Fayed? 
not_available He and his men were killed in the assault.
not_available Then it's over? 
not_available Well, it certainly seems so, sir.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available The American people should know, and I wanna tell them that we're no longer at risk.
not_available I'll get the press corps down.
not_available No, no, Karen.
not_available We're gonna do this from upstairs.
not_available In the press room.
not_available Shouldn't we wait for clearance? No, Tom.
not_available There's no need for any of us to be hiding underground for a minute longer.
not_available Inform Secret Service that we'll be leaving the bunker and returning to the Oval Office.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Morris is coordinating with the Marines Technical Escort Unit to transfer the bombs to a NEST facility.
not_available Now that they've taken custody, I'd like you all to submit your briefings to the respective department heads.
not_available I'd like to share my pride in the work that you've all done.
not_available We were hit hard but not one of you gave up.
not_available You've done excellent work today.
not_available Work that 
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's me.
not_available Jack, you did it.
not_available Chloe, listen to me.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Can it wait? We're transferring bombs and doing cleanup.
not_available No, it can't.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Chloe, Audrey's still alive.
not_available No, she's not.
not_available She is.
not_available I talked to her.
not_available The Chinese faked her car accident.
not_available They've been holding her a prisoner since she was in Beijing trying to find me.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available We have to tell Mr Buchanan.
not_available He'll never go along with it.
not_available "Go along" with what? The Chinese wanna exchange Audrey for an FBsub
not_available circuit board.
not_available It'll give them complete access to Russian defence technology.
not_available I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards.
not_available Jack, we both know that if we do this, it will create an international situation bigtime.
not_available Chloe, I know.
not_available I promise I will do whatever I have to to stop the Chinese from getting that board, but I need you to get schematics for the bombs.
not_available Those files aren't on my system.
not_available They were reclassified when DOD took possession of the nuke.
not_available Figure it out.
not_available Without those schematics, I won't know what I'm looking for.
not_available I understand, but I don't know how I can do this.
not_available Chloe, Audrey's life is at stake.
not_available Think.
not_available Wait.
not_available Morris.
not_available He had to file a report with DOD about the work he did on the nukes.
not_available It contained a revised schematic.
not_available It might still be on his hard drive.
not_available Can you access it? 
not_available Only from his terminal.
not_available Chloe, please, do it.
not_available Where should I send it? 
not_available The phone I'm calling you from.
not_available Use a secure line.
not_available Alpha 539.
not_available Hold on It's here.
not_available The file's coming up.
not_available I'm sending it to your screen.
not_available Stand by.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Chloe, I don't see anything.
not_available It needs to load before it sends.
not_available There's still 30% to go.
not_available Dammit.
not_available What? 
not_available Morris is coming back.
not_available Hurry.
not_available There's nothing I can do.
not_available I need to log out.
not_available He's here.
not_available No, Chloe, wait.
not_available Jack 
not_available Come on I got it.
not_available Yes? Mr President, Vice President Daniels is here.
not_available Send him in.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Noah.
not_available Please sit.
not_available Listen, I, uh I wanna begin by expressing my gratitude to you for a lesson well learned.
not_available I'm not sure what you mean, Mr President.
not_available I believe attacking Fayed's country with a nuclear weapon would have been a serious mistake.
not_available I'm not going to lie to you about that.
not_available But if you hadn't have put that option on the table in the first place, I never would have gone as far as I did, and the bombs might still be out there.
not_available That being said, I think we would both agree that our relationship has always been a marriage of convenience, a way to strengthen the ticket rather than a case of seeing eye to eye on pretty much anything.
not_available And now that it's over, this crisis, it's become clear to me, Noah, that I just don't think it's possible for us to work together any more.
not_available Excuse me? I'm asking for your resignation.
not_available How dare you? You don't have the right to ask for my resignation.
not_available This isn't about what the constitution says, Noah.
not_available It's about what's best for the country in crisis.
not_available And how do you figure that? I can't lead effectively with you undermining me at every single opportunity that you may get.
not_available And let's be honest with each other, that's exactly what you would do if you stayed in place.
not_available Mr President I refuse.
not_available Good night.
not_available You don't wanna walk out that door, not like this.
not_available Otherwise, I may have to make this extremely unpleasant for you.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available The recording that Tom Lennox has in his possession, that's what I'm talking about.
not_available Conspiracy to commit perjury? That's a serious offence.
not_available I have to assume you'd rather resign than spend the rest of your life living with that kind of humiliation.
not_available So is resorting to blackmail your idea of effective leadership? If I've learned anything from you, it would be that sometimes it's necessary to apply a little brute force.
not_available I don't need your resignation immediately.
not_available Let's give the country a chance to take a breath after what happened today.
not_available Sometime in the next week will be just fine, Mr Vice President.
not_available NEST wants a path cleared to Edwards, Could you get back to me with confirmation? Thank you.
not_available ETA on the helicopter is 15 minutes.
not_available Distribute protocols to the NEST team.
not_available I'm on that.
not_available That's odd.
not_available What? I think someone's hacked into my system.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Yes, I'm sure.
not_available I installed a logging program to track any unauthorised access to my hard drive.
not_available You did? It's telling me that someone accessed my files ten minutes ago and downloaded the updated schematics to those suitcase nukes.
not_available I'm calling security.
not_available Wait, don't call security.
not_available I'm the one who hacked into your system.
not_available Why would you do that? I'll explain it to you in a little while.
not_available Explain it to me now.
not_available I did it for Jack.
not_available Audrey Raines is still alive.
not_available The Chinese are holding her hostage.
not_available What? They'll kill her unless Jack delivers a sub
not_available circuit board from one of the bombs to them.
not_available You've been to all the same briefings.
not_available The Russians have kept that out of Chinese hands for years.
not_available I know.
not_available What are the Russians gonna say when they find out we gave it to them? It's not gonna get that far.
not_available How in the world do you know it's not gonna get that far?! Because Jack gave me his word.
not_available I'm sorry, darling, but I can't leave it at that.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available The bombs I reprogrammed could have killed tens of thousands.
not_available But that didn't happen.
not_available I could have been responsible for each and every one of their deaths.
not_available I can't be involved with something that could easily end up starting a war.
not_available It's not gonna start a war, because it's not gonna get that far.
not_available This has nothing to do with you.
not_available I did it.
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available Now that you've told me, it does.
not_available You have to tell Buchanan.
not_available I can't.
not_available Then you're forcing me to.
not_available No.
not_available I'm gonna do it.
not_available I'm doing it.
not_available No! Morris! I'll tell him.
not_available Reinforcements aren't necessary at this point.
not_available The military is guarding the bombs with a CTU SWAT team standing by.
not_available They'll be en route soon.
not_available Very good, sir.
not_available I'll notify everyone.
not_available All right, thank you.
not_available What is it, Chloe? Mr Buchanan I'm sorry.
not_available There there's something that you need to know.
not_available You two come with me.
not_available This area is off limits.
not_available I'm Agent Bauer.
not_available I was responsible for securing these nukes.
not_available I'm under a presidential order to remove the FB circuit board and transfer it back to CTU for analysis.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available Open the gate.
not_available Sir, no one is allowed in here.
not_available Are you countermanding a presidential order? How dare you? Now you're wasting my time.
not_available What's your name? What's your name?! I want your name too! Now! That's not necessary.
not_available O open the gate.
not_available Open the gate! I want both of you to stand guard while I remove the circuit board.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stand down, Jack! 
not_available I can't do that.
not_available I won't say it again.
not_available Drop it! Agent Doyle, I am following orders Take him out! Take him out! 
not_available Put your weapon down or I'll shoot! Now! Secure him.
not_available He's under arrest.
not_available Doyle, please, just listen to me.
not_available Bill, we got Jack.
not_available What'd he say? 
not_available Not much.
not_available I had to subdue him.
not_available Let me talk to him.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Buchanan wants to talk to you.
not_available Bill.
not_available Chloe told me about Audrey and the Chinese.
not_available I can't let you give them the component.
not_available I'm not going to.
not_available I only need to have it long enough for them to let her go.
not_available I was never gonna let the Chinese keep it.
not_available Whatever you have planned, I can't let you do it.
not_available Bill, please.
not_available Right now we're the only chance she's got.
not_available I understand what Audrey means to you.
not_available I promise I will do everything to get her back.
not_available You didn't even know she was alive.
not_available Cheng is gonna make it impossible for us to ever find her again.
not_available We are her only hope, and you know it.
not_available I don't know what to tell you.
not_available Let Doyle bring you back here and we'll work out a game plan.
not_available Will you let me make one more call? I'm asking you as a friend.
not_available Who do you wanna talk to? President Wayne Palmer.
not_available I'll see if I can reach him.
not_available Let me talk to Doyle.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He wants to talk to you.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Keep Jack in custody.
not_available I'll call the president.
not_available I'll route the call through your cell.
not_available Yes, sir, I understand.
not_available Get him up.
not_available Sources confirm that terrorist leader Abu Fayed is dead.
not_available The president has recovered from injuries sustained from the attempt on his life, and he is expected to Yes? 
not_available Jack Bauer on the line.
not_available Put him through, please.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Please hold for the president.
not_available It's the president.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Yes.
not_available Jack.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Is everything all right? Yes, sir, the bombs are secure.
not_available I'm calling because I want you to authorise a field operation.
not_available For what purpose? 
not_available To save Audrey Raines.
not_available What? 
not_available Mr President, she's still alive.
not_available The Chinese have been holding her, and are using her as a bargaining chip.
not_available In exchange for what? For an FBsub
not_available circuit board from a nuke.
not_available They say they'll release Audrey unharmed if I bring it to them.
not_available Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defence codes.
not_available Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.
not_available I'm sympathetic, I am.
not_available I will make available to you the full resources of this country to get Audrey back, but I hope you don't expect me to authorise this exchange.
not_available Not exactly.
not_available Then what exactly? I need the Chinese to believe that I am willing to go through with this exchange.
not_available I need to have the component on me.
not_available They'll need to see it.
not_available As soon as I know Audrey is free, I will destroy it.
not_available And how can you guarantee that? I'm asking you to trust me, Mr President.
not_available I give you my word that that component will not end up in Chinese hands.
not_available But if it does, the Russians may take action against us for allowing it to happen.
not_available Under most circumstances, your word would be sufficient.
not_available But in this case, Jack, I need to know details.
not_available If I have to, I will destroy that circuit board with a concealed charge of C4.
not_available An explosion of C4 would take out anything within 30 feet of it You're gonna sacrifice yourself? 
not_available Yes, sir, if I have to.
not_available Jack.
not_available Mr President, please.
not_available Please, I am begging you.
not_available Audrey Raines was willing to give up her life to save mine.
not_available I cannot and will not do anything less for her.
not_available You're asking me to sign off on a suicide mission.
not_available With all due respect, hand me over for dead, and I did not hesitate.
not_available Mr President you owe me.
not_available And you're sure this is the only way? Yes.
not_available All right, then.
not_available I will not fail you, Mr President.
not_available I'll tell Bill to give you whatever you need.
not_available Now, I'm gonna need confirmation that circuit board's been destroyed.
not_available I'll have CTU embed a tracking device in the board.
not_available You'll have your confirmation.
not_available Good luck, Jack.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available Yes, sir? 
not_available Let me speak with Bill.
not_available Right away.
not_available That's the way it is.
not_available You've got your orders.
not_available Let me know how Jack wants to proceed.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I understand.
not_available Get over here.
not_available What did he say? He said the president signed off on this, and to give you whatever help you needed.
not_available I'm gonna need someone to help me with Audrey's extraction.
not_available I want that to be you.
not_available Fine.
not_available Where are you gonna be? The name of the Chinese agent that's holding Audrey is Cheng Zhi.
not_available He's responsible for my interrogation and torture for two years in that prison.
not_available As soon as I get the signal that Audrey is safe, two things will happen.
not_available I'll destroy that circuit board, and Cheng Zhi isn't gonna make it outta here alive.
not_available So in answer to your question, where am I gonna be Wherever I have to.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Are you gonna tell me what happened? The president agreed to Jack's plan.
not_available The president's gonna allow Jack to hand a defence algorithm to the Chinese? Of course not.
not_available Jack'll destroy the component as soon as he knows Audrey's safe.
not_available The Chinese will never get it.
not_available And how is he gonna manage that? I don't know.
not_available I guess President Palmer trusts him.
not_available Telling Buchanan was the right thing to do.
not_available You know it was.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available You should have trusted me.
not_available Trusted you? You're the one that broke into my system.
not_available Because I didn't think you'd back me up.
not_available I was right.
not_available So you're gonna hold this over my head now, are you? Yeah, for a long time.
not_available For how long? Could you give me an estimate? I'll get back to you.
not_available Nadia, Doyle's on line three.
not_available Ready to lock in on the tracking frequency.
not_available This is Nadia.
not_available It's me.
not_available The tracker's online.
not_available The frequency mark is alpha
not_available 1793.
not_available The signal's good.
not_available You're on the grid.
not_available Copy.
not_available Jack and I are getting ready to move.
not_available Yes? I have the board.
not_available Where am I going? Get on the 180 and head north.
not_available Get off the first exit after mile
not_available marker 49.
not_available I'll give further instructions when you've exited.
not_available I got it.
not_available You have half an hour.
not_available You know what would happen if you're late.
not_available I understand.
not_available CTU has the signal.
not_available They're monitoring the device.
not_available We're set.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You're taking a risk.
not_available If this goes sour, it could start a firestorm.
not_available And for what? You wouldn't do the same thing? 
not_available I don't mix relationships with my job.
not_available Whatever you had with this woman, I hope it's worth it.
not_available This isn't about what I had with a woman.
not_available Her name is Audrey Raines.
not_available She served this country with honour.
not_available We owe her.
not_available So get in the truck.
not_available Come in.
not_available You wanted to see me? Close the door.
not_available The president has just asked me to resign.
not_available What? 
not_available And I am going to comply with his request.
not_available I wanted to tell you personally before you found out from someone else.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Why go along with this? Why don't you just tell him that you refuse? He has a tape of our conversation, the one where we conspired to commit perjury, and he's threatening to use it against me unless I step down.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Tom Lennox recorded it.
not_available Bottom line is, I'm not being given a choice here.
not_available This is all my fault.
not_available If I hadn't asked you to lie, none of this would be happening.
not_available You were trying to protect me.
not_available I could have turned you down.
not_available Don't blame yourself.
not_available Noah I'm so sorry.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Ah, hell at least we'll have a lot more time to spend together.
not_available The president said it would take a week.
not_available But I want this letter of resignation in his hands by the time he finishes his press conference.
not_available I am through being the loyal opposition.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
not_available Please sit.
not_available First, I wanna say that I am grateful to report that Abu Fayed, the man responsible for these attacks, has been killed, and that all nuclear devices have been recovered.
not_available I want to acknowledge the brave men and women in our various law
not_available enforcement agencies, and let us not forget our armed services.
not_available All these people have worked so hard to bring this crisis to an end.
not_available Their dedication, their perseverance, is without equal.
not_available Despite the brutality of these attacks, we did not allow the violence, borne of extremism, to push us to extremes.
not_available And as Americans, we can and should take pride and comfort in that fact.
not_available Let me, uh, conclude by asking for your prayers tonight, for all those who grieve this day, for all those whose lives have been shattered.
not_available Let us reach out and begin rebuilding.
not_available Let us reach out and begin the process of national healing.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll take some of your questions now.
not_available Yes.
not_available Ian.
not_available Mr President, how certain are you that the crisis is over, and there are no more weapons on our soil? Based on the intelligence, I can say with full confidence that the worst has passed and the individuals responsible for these attacks have been apprehended or else killed.
not_available Yes, Andrea.
not_available Robin, sir.
not_available Robin, yes.
not_available Robin.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's been a very long day.
not_available Please, go ahead.
not_available Mr President, there are several thousand Muslim Americans being held in detention facilities across the country.
not_available What will happen to these people? I've already directed Homeland Security to begin dismantling these detention facilities.
not_available All detainees are to be released once the immediate crisis has passed.
not_available Excuse me Um, now that the crisis has passed, we will be, uh, we will be reviewing the, uh, situation regarding individuals that we have in custody.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not being very clear.
not_available Uh, let me say again regarding your question, Andrea, that, uh Robin.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Robin.
not_available Let me say again regarding regarding your question that the, uh the, uh detention facilities that that that we will We're going to Call Medical right away.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, we need to clear this room.
not_available Please exit by the south door.
not_available All signs indicate the president has suffered a cerebral haemorrhage brought on by injuries he sustained earlier.
not_available Meaning he shouldn't have been brought out of the coma.
not_available However detrimental that decision was to him, I'm confident that, in light of his actions today, he would continue to support it.
not_available I'm glad you're so confident, Karen, since it was your reckless action that resulted in his stroke.
not_available It's unclear if the stroke was inevitable, but in any event, I'll take responsibility.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Now is not the time for recriminations, self
not_available imposed or otherwise.
not_available When will we know the extent of the damage and the prospects for recovery? After the MRI.
not_available He's being prepped for transport to Bethesda as we speak.
not_available Based on my impressions, the damage was severe.
not_available We can't expect the president to regain consciousness any time soon.
not_available So it is incontestable.
not_available Wayne Palmer won't be able to continue as Commander in Chief.
not_available There's no denying that this is a great tragedy for the nation and for those of us who know the president personally.
not_available Just take care of him, Doctor.
not_available Of course.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Notify the Senate.
not_available Have the SecDef and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs authorise me under the 25th Amendment.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Tom, have the press secretary issue a statement.
not_available President Palmer's been incapacitated.
not_available No need for alarm.
not_available Executive authority's been transferred to me.
not_available Our hopes and prayers are with him.
not_available All right, sir.
not_available And I'll also need you available to review everything on the president's agenda.
not_available All right, sir.
not_available There's something on the agenda you'll want immediate clarification on.
not_available What's that? Wayne Palmerjust issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand Russian technology over to the Chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage.
not_available Can you explain this? 
not_available Yes, that was a personal request from Bauer.
not_available They have a long
not_available standing relationship.
not_available As Jack Bauer was responsible for recovering the suitcase nukes today, the president wanted to honour his service.
not_available Karen, I asked you to explain it, not excuse it.
not_available Understood.
not_available Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese.
not_available It will only be used to secure the hostage.
not_available Incidentally, sir, the hostage is Audrey Raines, daughter of James Heller.
not_available Even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome.
not_available Now, I am happy to honour Agent Bauer's service to this country, but not at the risk of giving classified technology to the Chinese, and potentially damaging our relationship with Russia in the process.
not_available You tell CTU to stop Bauer immediately.
not_available Sir, the president expressly That's all for now, Karen.
not_available You too, Tom.
not_available Unbelievable! Less than a minute behind his desk, and he's disregarding the president's wishes.
not_available But we both share Daniels' unease at handing military secrets over to the Chinese.
not_available I know, Tom, but that is not the point.
not_available No, here's the point.
not_available Daniels is now the acting president, whether we like it or not.
not_available I'm off to the hospital.
not_available I'll see you there.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available How's President Palmer? 
not_available Not good.
not_available The doctor says that he has a haemorrhage.
not_available They don't know the extent of the damage, but obviously he's not able to serve.
not_available Daniels is going to assume the office.
not_available And the first wave of his hand, he wants to stop Jack's operation.
not_available Jack has to return to CTU as soon as possible with the component.
not_available Does he understand the circumstances under which Palmer agreed to it? No, he's not that kind of a man.
not_available He doesn't operate in shades of grey.
not_available Jack won't give up without a fight.
not_available You just have to get Jack back to CTU as soon as possible, OK? OK, I'll take care of it.
not_available Listen up.
not_available The White House has ordered us to shut down Jack's operation.
not_available How far away are support teams? 
not_available Six miles.
not_available Have them standing by, ready to move in.
not_available Contact CHP.
not_available Have them set up roadblocks.
not_available Chloe, I want you to stand down on this.
not_available Why? 
not_available You've shown me I can't trust you.
not_available Morris, you cover comm.
not_available Jack won't go along with this.
not_available I know.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Mike, it's Bill.
not_available Can Jack hear you? Yes or no.
not_available Yes.
not_available There's been a change of profile.
not_available Noah Daniels is acting president.
not_available He wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU.
not_available Understood.
not_available What's your current location? We're about two miles east of the 180 interchange.
not_available OK, I need you to exit at the 70.
not_available Make the first left.
not_available We'll have a backup team ready to take Jack into custody and recover the component.
not_available All right.
not_available Disarm Jack as quickly and quietly as possible before he finds out.
not_available No problem.
not_available CTU has got a report from Caltrans.
not_available The 180 is closed due to high winds.
not_available They're concerned about possible fallout.
not_available They want us to take 70 instead.
not_available Fine.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Jack, what's the problem? Earlier today, I shot my own partner, a friend of mine, because he tried to stop me from doing what I have to do.
not_available Don't think for a second I won't do that to you.
not_available Slowly, I want you to pull over.
not_available Now.
not_available Take the keys out, put them on the centre consol and give me your phone.
not_available Jack, you don't wanna do this.
not_available Slowly get out of the truck.
not_available Back up towards the fence.
not_available Daniels is the acting president.
not_available He called this off.
not_available Shut up and grab the fence! 
not_available This is gonna end badly, Jack.
not_available You can't go against the White House! Jack! Jack!
