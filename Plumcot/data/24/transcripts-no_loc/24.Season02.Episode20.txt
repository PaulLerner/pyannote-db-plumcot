
not_available Jack Bauer just called with some new information.
not_available He has evidence the Cyprus recording is counterfeit.
not_available I'm calling off the attack.
not_available Stopping and restarting military action could cost tens of thousands of American lives.
not_available An acceptable risk if the alternative is waging war against three innocent countries.
not_available What do you know about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment? If the majority of his Cabinet feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties, the president could be removed from office.
not_available And the vice president becomes acting president.
not_available As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott who should be charged with treason.
not_available I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne.
not_available Mike! Until you hear from me, do not let her out.
not_available I can lure them away from here.
not_available You and Kate get the chip over to CTU.
not_available Meet me at Moorpark and Vineland.
not_available If I'm not there in 15 minutes, get it to Tony Almeida.
not_available Yusuf! Behind you! He's a damn towelhead.
not_available Stop it! We got the evidence that proves the Cyprus audio was forged.
not_available It's a memory chip containing the original source recordings.
not_available Do not kill him until he talks.
not_available Jack, I need the chip.
not_available It's not for sale.
not_available My answer's final.
not_available When Ronnie's finished, you'll give me another.
not_available The chip, Jack.
not_available He's dead.
not_available If you are just joining us, the White House has confirmed the blast in the Mojave Desert that occurredfour hours ago at10.59pm PST was in fact a nuclear explosion.
not_available We'll stitch you up and getyou out of here and on your way.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Looking for epinephrine.
not_available This is a treatment room.
not_available I have a patient Where's the epinephrine? 
not_available Storage room.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Clear.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Go again.
not_available Increase the joules.
not_available You are not gonna die on me, you son of a bitch.
not_available That's Kingsley.
not_available You talkto him.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Let me talk to Stark.
not_available He's a little busy, sir.
not_available Did Bauer give you the chip? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available Notyet.
not_available What's taking so long? It's under control.
not_available What am I hearing in your voice? Answer me, Raymond.
not_available Stark pushed Bauer too far.
not_available He's flat
not_available lining.
not_available Whatever he broke, he'd better fix.
not_available And if Ronnie can't handle it, do ityourself.
not_available Where's the epinephrine? 
not_available The doctor's got it.
not_available If you don't revive this man, you're dead.
not_available I need your men to put him on the gurney.
not_available Put him up on the gurney.
not_available Give him as much as he can take.
not_available Let's go! Let's go! What are you waiting for? Do it! Give him the paddles.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still in v
not_available fib.
not_available Hit him again! Clear.
not_available It's too late.
not_available It's not gonna work.
not_available Hit him again! Clear.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available I got a sinus rhythm.
not_available I need a Baxter set and a bag of normal saline.
not_available What did Kingsley say? He said I just got promoted.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available You thought death would save you.
not_available You're not gonna die until I kill you myself.
not_available Now, where is that chip? We'll be convening the Cabinet within the hour.
not_available Does the president have any idea what's going on? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available It's critical he doesn't find out.
not_available It's not going to be that easy.
not_available Lynne Kresge was about to warn him, but I was able to intervene.
not_available Where is she now? I had to put her under guard.
not_available I know it's difficult.
not_available It's difficult for all of us.
not_available I just hope we're doing the right thing.
not_available Mike.
not_available Do you thinkthese are the circumstances in which I wish to assume the presidency? You know me better than that.
not_available This country was attacked, with a nuclear weapon.
not_available And the president will not commit to a military response.
not_available I hope you're not wavering yourself.
not_available No.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Good.
not_available So, your responsibility is to make sure that the Cabinet votes to remove him from office.
not_available I have a responsibility to make sure the vote takes place, not to manipulate the outcome.
not_available Poor choice of words.
not_available But my point is the same.
not_available You're doing the right thing, Mike.
not_available History will recognise that.
not_available Anything from Jack Bauer? 
not_available Not that I've heard.
not_available Mike I know you think delaying a military response is the wrong call.
not_available Only because you're relying on a single source.
not_available Jack Bauer says he has evidence that we're being manipulated into this war.
not_available I have to give him the opportunity to produce the proof.
not_available If there were anything I could say to make you change your mind There isn't.
not_available Look, Mike, I knowthis is an unpopular decision.
not_available And even though you don't agree either, your standing by me means a great deal.
not_available Send Lynne into my office.
not_available She's drafting my statement.
not_available I'll see if I can find her.
not_available What do you mean? She wasn't feeling well.
not_available She took a few minutes' downtime last I heard.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Let her rest.
not_available I'll go over it with Jenny.
not_available Please open this door.
not_available Whoever you are, you are conspiring against the US president.
not_available Do you have any idea what that means? Hello? You have no idea what's at stake here.
not_available Please open the door! Hey, get his wallet.
not_available How much? 
not_available A couple of hundred.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Come on! 
not_available Just take it.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available I'm driving.
not_available The chip Wait.
not_available Wait! You took something from him.
not_available It's mine.
not_available Why are you with him anyway? Only thing worse than these bastards is people like you.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, it's not like that.
not_available I just need that plastic case you took from him.
not_available This? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This? What is it? It's got information on it.
not_available It's not worth anything.
not_available Please, come on.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available What'll you give us for it? I'll pay you.
not_available I've got money.
not_available How much? 
not_available It's not here, it's at my house.
not_available Forget it, Marcus.
not_available Let's just go.
not_available Where's your house? 
not_available Hancock Park.
not_available It's not that far from here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Yeah, let's do it.
not_available Let's go getyour money.
not_available First I'm gonna put him out of his misery.
not_available No.
not_available No! 
not_available This is for messin' with our country.
not_available Oh, please! No! 
not_available Marcus, man, come on.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All circuits are busy.
not_available Please try your call again later.
not_available Give him more epinephrine.
not_available He's already had too much.
not_available He's strong.
not_available He can handle it.
not_available Now prepare a syringe of beroglide.
not_available Beroglide? lt'll collapse his lungs Just do it.
not_available Now, this beroglide stuff, it's amazing.
not_available This will paralyse your diaphragm, and you'll slowly suffocate.
not_available You'll feel like you're drowning, until you tell me where the chip is.
not_available I already told you, I don't know where the chip is.
not_available Kingsley wants to talkto you.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Help me loosen the rope.
not_available What? 
not_available Help me undo the rope.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available He's on the phone.
not_available The other guys are far away.
not_available They'll just think you're working on me.
not_available Please.
not_available This is the only chance we've got.
not_available He'll kill me.
not_available He's gonna kill you anyway.
not_available These men were willing to kill millions of people earlier tonight.
not_available I am the only chance you've got to get out of here alive.
not_available We don't have any time.
not_available Come on.
not_available Do it.
not_available Feed it through the bottom.
not_available Hurry.
not_available Hurry.
not_available He's coming.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I had to disconnect his IV first.
not_available Get the beroglide.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Start him off with 2cc.
not_available Mr Chappelle.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is Tony in his office? 
not_available He went to IT.
not_available He'll be a minute.
not_available What's the status on the phones? 
not_available Grid's down in most of the city.
not_available How about wireless? 
not_available Cell service is pretty much out too.
not_available Are you using Satcom? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Save Satcom for your highest priorities.
not_available We're sharing it with half a dozen other agencies.
not_available OK.
not_available Tony.
not_available Hey, Ryan.
not_available Good work.
not_available Good work on what? I know Bauer's trying to change our position on the Cyprus audio.
not_available That's not exactly true.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You don't have to explain.
not_available I'm just glad you're not letting the tail wag the dog.
not_available Ryan, uh Jack may not be wrong about this.
not_available He's Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available I don't wanna hear that.
not_available We're about to bomb the Middle East into next Wednesday.
not_available We're supposed to be processing intel to support that.
not_available I've got most of my people on it.
not_available I want all your people on it.
not_available Don'tyou think we need to eliminate doubt about the authenticity of this recording? Your department has already authenticated that recording.
not_available Don't make me the bad guy here, Tony.
not_available Mason may have recommended you to direct CTU, butyou'll need my blessing to stay on.
not_available I assume that's whatyou want.
not_available What I want is to do what's right in this situation.
not_available What's right is to followthe chain of command.
not_available Put everyone on domestic response.
not_available No! Goddammit! 
not_available Calm down.
not_available What do you mean, you can't get through to him? 
not_available Unreachable? I want him now.
not_available I'll try again, sir.
not_available Aaron? Yes, Mr President? 
not_available Close the door, please.
not_available How many presidents have you worked for? 
not_available I came in on Reagan's second term.
not_available I haven't been able to establish contact with my vice president in the last half
not_available hour.
not_available What do you make of that? I wouldn't know howto respond to that, Mr President.
not_available I just pulled our bombers out of the air, against everyone's recommendations.
not_available Now my vice president suddenly is unreachable.
not_available Should I draw any conclusions? 
not_available Sir, I'm not qualified to give an opinion Aaron, you've been doing this nearly 20 years.
not_available You know howthe system works.
not_available Is Prescott planning something behind my back? I'm going 20
not_available 10, please cover position three.
not_available Roger that.
not_available For what it's worth, I thinkthe choices you've made today have been the right ones.
not_available That's not what I asked.
not_available There are always those in the administration who feel that delay is a weakness.
not_available If enough individuals share this view, then 
not_available Aaron.
not_available Is Prescott coming after me? I'm not sure.
not_available Butyou have good instincts, sir.
not_available I'd listen to 'em if I were you.
not_available Thank you, Aaron.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Max is very unhappy.
not_available Max can be unhappy.
not_available We're all entitled to our feelings.
not_available Peter, spare me your usual metaphysical observations.
not_available Our entire project depends on military action the president just suspended.
not_available For now.
not_available Now is all that matters.
not_available Now you're being metaphysical.
not_available Peter Palmer won't be able to stand the political pressure from his own administration, let alone the will of the people.
not_available He's not gonna have any choice but to respond to the nuclear weapon.
not_available You're assuming that this man Bauer hasn't already delivered proof to his people that the Cyprus audio was false.
not_available Bauer won't be a problem.
not_available Tell me where the chip is, I'll make it stop.
not_available You'll kill him.
not_available No.
not_available But he'll wish he'd stayed dead.
not_available I'm all done playing games with you.
not_available Nowtell me what I wanna know! Tell me! 
not_available They'll hear you upstairs.
not_available Then shut up and close the door! Fill the syringe and double the dosage.
not_available I'll tell you where the chip is.
not_available Where? Again.
not_available It's in It's in a p What did you say? They're taking the chip to They're taking it where? Stay down.
not_available How much longer has he got before he's dead? As long as 15 minutes.
not_available You tell me who was on the other end of that phone, and I'll make it quick.
not_available Peter Kingsley.
not_available You wanted to see me, sir? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Close the door, please.
not_available Have a seat, Mike.
not_available I've been feeling a little disconnected from my people in the last hour.
not_available I've been managing the Joint Chiefs and Homeland Security.
not_available If you want me closer Notyou, Mike.
not_available Back in Washington.
not_available Who? 
not_available Prescott.
not_available I think he's avoiding me.
not_available With what we've gone through in the last 18 hours, he's just being pulled in ten different directions.
not_available We were, and in some ways still are, on the brink of war.
not_available I'm the commander in chief.
not_available When I call, there's only one direction.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I'll get him on the phone right away.
not_available Do that.
not_available Oh, and Mike? This statement that Jenny made a pass on, it's not working.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available The facts aren't updated.
not_available And I don't think Jenny's been apprised of everything.
not_available I want Lynne to go over it.
not_available Why don'tyou give it to me? I'll get it to her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Prescott.
not_available It's Mike Novick.
not_available Can you talk? Yeah.
not_available Are you going forward or not? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Nothing's changed.
not_available The sooner you can execute, the better.
not_available We're going as fast as we can here.
not_available David Palmer is not a stupid man.
not_available He knows something is going on.
not_available It won't take him long to figure out what it is.
not_available How does he know? 
not_available For one thing, you haven't returned his calls.
not_available I'll call him now.
not_available I thinkthat's a good idea.
not_available Mike, I'm counting on you.
not_available You gotta keep him busy until I can get everyone together.
not_available How much longer? A half
not_available hour.
not_available 45 minutes tops.
not_available The sooner the better.
not_available I'm all alone out here on this.
not_available He's asking about Lynne.
not_available I can't keep up the act much longer.
not_available You won't have to.
not_available Just hold your mud, Mike.
not_available CTU.
not_available Dessler.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available I need to speakto Tony.
not_available J Jack? 
not_available Michelle, I don't know if you can still hear me.
not_available Kate and Yusuf have got the chip.
not_available I'm going to Vineland and Moorpark, just in case they're still waiting for me there.
not_available Michelle? 
not_available Dammit.
not_available Jack? Tony? What's up? 
not_available Call just came through from Jack.
not_available What'd he say? 
not_available We lost the signal.
not_available You try him back? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I put an auto
not_available trace on the number.
not_available See if Dispatch picked it up in the log.
not_available Find out if it was a cell or land line.
not_available OK.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available What's that all about? Jack Bauer tried to contact us.
not_available We lost connection.
not_available I said I don't want Bauer distracting you or your resources.
not_available Whatever he's doing out there is irrelevant.
not_available I'm not so sure it is.
not_available Jack says he's got proof that the Cyprus audio was fabricated.
not_available He's bringing it here within the hour.
not_available If he's got proof, let him produce it.
not_available But I wantyou to keep your eye on the ball, Tony.
not_available Jim, we both know you've been one of the most outspoken opponents to my decision to call off this attack.
not_available Any criticisms I may have had have been expressed behind closed doors, out of reach of any public scrutiny.
not_available I know we haven't had a chance to talk oneon
not_available one since all this began.
not_available So if you have something to tell me, go ahead.
not_available There's nothing, sir.
not_available My door is always open, Jim.
not_available If you have something to say, I would expectyou to bring it to me first.
not_available Of course, Mr President.
not_available Thanks for getting backto me.
not_available I still don't trust him.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Sorry to interrupt, sir.
not_available What is it? Lynne Kresge is injured.
not_available She fell down some stairs.
not_available What happened? 
not_available We're not sure.
not_available It appears she may have been running from a fire in an upstairs room.
not_available Is she OK? On
not_available site physician says she's critical.
not_available Show me where.
not_available So, what'd you find out from Dispatch? Well, Jack called me from a cell.
not_available Came from somewhere between Encino and Studio City.
not_available OK, so he was in an urgent care centre right around here about two hours ago.
not_available To get to CTU he'd take the 101 or the 5.
not_available Do you want me to pull up the satellite? No, that would raise a red flag with Chappelle, which is the last thing I need.
not_available What about police channels? If he couldn't contact us, maybe he tried someone local.
not_available Can you monitor those without being detected? Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Focus on the downtown precincts.
not_available OK.
not_available Yusuf! Jack, they tookthe chip.
not_available What are you talking about? Where's Kate? They took her to her house.
not_available Hancock Park.
not_available She offered to exchange money for the chip.
not_available Come on, let's getyou out of here.
not_available Jack, I'm not gonna make it.
not_available Go and get the chip, Jack.
not_available Yusuf, just hang on.
not_available Just hang on.
not_available Yusuf, come on.
not_available Yusuf, hang on! Yusuf! Yusuf, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available Everybody, be cool.
not_available You live here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available By yourself? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Damn.
not_available I don't have my keys.
not_available Is this really your house? 
not_available Yes.
not_available There's a spare key under the pot.
not_available Get inside.
not_available Get in here! Shut it off.
not_available She's setting us up, man.
not_available I said, shut it off.
not_available Shut it off! What's the code? 
not_available 51224.
not_available 51224.
not_available Show us where the money's at.
not_available Doctor, what's her status? She sustained neurological damage.
not_available We won't knowthe extent till we get her to the hospital.
not_available Will she live? 
not_available It's too early to say.
not_available Can I talkto her? 
not_available That may not be a good idea.
not_available I asked the doctor a question.
not_available You can try.
not_available But she's slipping in and out of consciousness.
not_available Lynne.
not_available Lynne.
not_available Lynne, it's me.
not_available David Palmer.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available We're getting you to the hospital, but I need you to tell me howthis happened.
not_available Sir, she took a severe blowto the head.
not_available She has a concussion and she's not coherent.
not_available She's trying to say something.
not_available D D D It's OK.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available What is it, Lynne? What is it? It's all right, Lynne.
not_available They're going to take good care of you.
not_available We need to get her to the hospital.
not_available Go.
not_available Come on, Tony.
not_available Pick up the phone.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available All services are busy.
not_available Dammit! 
not_available Chappelle's going to find out.
not_available What are you talking about? He said not to waste time looking for Jack, but that's all you and Michelle are doing.
not_available Why aren'tyou working on the field intel? Don't shine me on.
not_available I'm trying to help you keep your job.
not_available Really? By doing what? 
not_available Not saying anything.
not_available OK.
not_available Then don't say anything.
not_available Um I want something in return.
not_available And what would that be? 
not_available Michelle worked for me at District.
not_available Things worked much better that way.
not_available She's not qualified to be my boss.
not_available That's why things have been so messed up here tonight.
not_available So, uh you want Michelle's job.
not_available Is that what this is about? Yes.
not_available And I assume you wanna keep yours.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr Chappelle, could you come over here a second? What do you need, Almeida? Carrie's got something she wants to tell you.
not_available What is it, Carrie? Well? Carrie tried to extort a promotion out of me by promising to keep her mouth shut.
not_available That about right? Mouth shut about what? He and Michelle are still trying to find Jack Bauer.
not_available I was trying to give Tony the courtesy of a warning.
not_available I was gonna tell you, Mr Chappelle That's enough, Carrie.
not_available Get backto work.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thought I made myself clear, Tony.
not_available We're past Bauer.
not_available No, sir.
not_available You are.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm director of CTU.
not_available I'm allocating resources to ensure we have all the facts.
not_available If you're not comfortable with me making my own decisions, relieve me of my duties.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Don't thank me.
not_available I just don't have anyone to take your place right now.
not_available I don't like insubordination.
not_available Come on.
not_available You better hurry up.
not_available It's there.
not_available What the hell is this? 
not_available There's at least 20,000 euros.
not_available Euros? 
not_available It's European money.
not_available I look European to you? Where's the cash? 
not_available That is cash.
not_available It's as good as dollars.
not_available We want cash money.
not_available You understand me? Marcus? You thinkthis is real? No, they keep the fake ones locked upThat's it? 
not_available That's it.
not_available Now what do we do? Look, just take it all.
not_available Just gimme the chip.
not_available She knows what we look like.
not_available She knows our names too.
not_available We had a deal.
not_available He's right.
not_available We can't just leave you here.
not_available Take everything! I won't tell anyone.
not_available I won't tell the police, I promise.
not_available Just give me the chip! Don't do this.
not_available Let's take the stuff and go.
not_available The second we walk out of here, she's calling the cops.
not_available I can't get locked up again.
not_available No! Kate, are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They've got the chip.
not_available How many rooms at the end of the hall? 
not_available Two.
not_available Bedroom and bathroom.
not_available Stay down.
not_available All I want is the chip! My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm a federal agent.
not_available All I want is the chip, and then I'll letyou go.
not_available You shot my friend, man.
not_available You expect me to believe you? Right now you don't have a choice.
not_available You come in here and I'm gonna smash this thing.
not_available I'll put it right under my foot.
not_available We're looking for Jack Bauer.
not_available He was on a cellphone between Encino and Studio City.
not_available We need to find him as soon as possible.
not_available I need everyone to make this priority one.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, we can begin.
not_available I'd like to thank you for assembling at such short notice.
not_available I'm sure you're all wondering why I've asked you here, why I've asked you to keep the news of this meeting to yourselves.
not_available Excuse me, Mr Vice President.
not_available Shouldn't we wait for the president? President Palmer will be joining us later.
not_available I'm not sure I understand you.
not_available The first part of this meeting will be a closed session.
not_available Closed to the president? 
not_available I'm afraid that's the point of the meeting.
not_available To some of you this will come as a surprise.
not_available For most of you, though, I hope it comes as a relief.
not_available But it is my sincere belief that, based on his response to today's events, David Palmer is unfit to continue as president of the United States.
