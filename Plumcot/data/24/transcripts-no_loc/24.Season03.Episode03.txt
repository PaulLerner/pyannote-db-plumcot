
not_available Previously on 24 What if I can get us a copy of keeler's playbook? What exactly do you mean by "playbook"? His entire prep for tonight's debate.
not_available Damn it, I told you to drop that.
not_available Will you just listen to me? There is something you need to see.
not_available There's nothing i need to see.
not_available It's about anne.
not_available It's something that we didn't know about her.
not_available Something that could damage all of us.
not_available Can I talk to you now? 
not_available Yeah, Of course.
not_available Kim, what's up? Chase and I have been going out for a while, and it's starting to get serious.
not_available I really care for him, dad.
not_available So what do you think? 
not_available I don't know what I think.
not_available We want the release of ramon salazar.
not_available If you refuse to comply, the virus will be released.
not_available It looks like the virus was delivered in a crystalline form.
not_available Maybe what you're looking for is a white powder.
not_available It would look like a bag of cocaine or heroin? Yeah, that may even be the strategy.
not_available Someone thinks they're selling a bag of coke.
not_available when, in fact, they're handling the virus.
not_available Where did you get that money 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Okay, we needed it.
not_available I got it.
not_available So this is how you're going to help you're family? By dealing drugs? I'm not dealing them.
not_available It's a stupid delivery.
not_available That kid's walking around with a bag of cocaine that's got the virus in it.
not_available He doesn't know it.
not_available I need to find him and stop him from putting it into circulation.
not_available You didn't shoot up, did you? Why? You think you can hide it? I'm not trying to hide it from you.
not_available I'm trying to quit.
not_available / Okay.
not_available People don't just quit, jack.
not_available I am not.
not_available going on record with this addiction.
not_available Do you understand me? You're the only person who knows about it, so it's going to stay that way.
not_available Give me an update.
not_available Kyle's still in his house.
not_available What about the package? It's with him.
not_available And ramon? 
not_available Just waiting to come home.
not_available Good.
not_available The following takes place between 3:00 p.m and 4:00 p.m.
not_available Adam, have you downloaded everyone's folders for the meeting? Not yet.
not_available I'm still pulling up some of the medical details about the virus.
not_available Don't waste a lot of time on that.
not_available The only thing our people need to know is that it kills within 24 hours of exposure and we believe Kyle Singer is transporting it.
not_available I got all that.
not_available What about our approach to Singer? Jack's going to meet nicole duncan, head of health services, los angeles.
not_available They're going to take a haz
not_available mat team over to Singer's apartment.
not_available He's waiting for her now.
not_available ¿µ¾î'ëº» ÀÚ¸·ÆíÁý/½ÌÅ© ÇÑ±Û¹ø¿ª Á¦ÀÛÁö¿ø Hi, Jack.
not_available How you doing? I'm okay, Nicole.
not_available How have you been? Until this afternoon, I was doing fine.
not_available You know, I, uh I tried to reach you after I heard about Teri.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available After that, I kind of withdrew.
not_available But I appreciated the calls.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We should get going.
not_available I just finished running Macer's epidemiological model.
not_available Her estimates were off.
not_available Better or worse than we thought? Twice as bad.
not_available She had nine percent of the population infected within a week, but it's closer to 20%.
not_available And the infectionto
not_available mortality rate is higher than her estimate.
not_available Almost 95% lethal.
not_available I've been hunting germs for 12 years and I've never seen anything like this.
not_available Great.
not_available Are you feeling okay? Yeah.
not_available Why? You're perspiring.
not_available I've been non
not_available stop since noon.
not_available Look, we're going to be about eight minutes out.
not_available It would be great if we could go over the quarantine protocols before we get there.
not_available No problem.
not_available Good.
not_available If you refuse to comply, the virus will be released.
not_available I want the release of Ramon Salazar Gael.
not_available Here, take a look at this.
not_available Closing in on the point of origin of this call.
not_available You see this code artifact here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I found a few more on this recording.
not_available I think it's coming from a domestic switching node.
not_available You think the call was made from inside the U.S.? Maybe.
not_available I'm piping it over to your system.
not_available See if you can find a match.
not_available Okay.
not_available But do it after the meeting.
not_available What meeting? Tony's shifting resources to help Jack in the field.
not_available He's closing in on the virus.
not_available Gael.
not_available Yeah? Jack needs that audio feed in place when he gets to Kyle Singer's apartment.
not_available I know, but Tony needs me to take care of something right now.
not_available I'll get it to you after the meeting.
not_available I need you to do it before the meeting.
not_available Jack's on his way there.
not_available So come do it now.
not_available I can't! Stop bugging me.
not_available I'll get it to you.
not_available Fine.
not_available Have you thought about how it will be when Ramon comes back? How it will be? Like it was before.
not_available Things have changed, Hector.
not_available Nothing's changed.
not_available He's only been gone three months.
not_available You've changed.
not_available You've been in charge while he's been in prison.
not_available Are you willing to give that up so easily? What is it? Bauer's telling CTU he's about to intercept the package.
not_available How? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available I'm about to find out.
not_available Is Gomez still on Kyle Singer? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Then we're fine.
not_available Hey, how was the interview? Fine.
not_available What's up, dad? Your mother told me you paid the rent.
not_available All three months we owed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I came into a little money.
not_available How does a 19year
not_available old kid who doesn't have a job come into a little money? Tim and I, we went down to the track the other day.
not_available He knows this guy over at the stables, so, uh, 
not_available we got a tip.
not_available Where did you get the money? Dad, what does it matter? Honestly, the rent's paid for three months.
not_available All right? The pressure's off us now.
not_available Did you do something illegal? No.
not_available I told you we went to Santa Anita, and we got lucky.
not_available I didn't do anything illegal.
not_available Don't lie to me.
not_available I've got enough to worry about.
not_available Now, this is my house.
not_available I pay the rent! I take care of you and your mother.
not_available And when you get that job, you go ahead and pay me back, huh? Wait a second.
not_available We're not done here! No, we're done here.
not_available Don't walk away from me! You should be thanking me instead of crawling up my ass.
not_available Kyle! Kyle! Open the door! Open the door! His name's Kyle Singer.
not_available We think he's transporting the virus, although it's likely he doesn't realize what he's carrying.
not_available How could he not know? Health Services believes that the virus was made to look like heroin or cocaine.
not_available We know that Kyle Singer was hired to deliver a package from Mexico to a dealer in LA.
not_available He thinks he's smuggling drugs.
not_available That's the working theory.
not_available Now, here's the thing.
not_available Once Singer delivers that bag of powder, it gets cut up and distributed throughout the city.
not_available At that point, it becomes impossible to contain.
not_available Was LAPD grabbing Singer? No.
not_available Why not? Can't they get there faster? LAPD is not trained to handle haz
not_available zone.
not_available Jack Bauer's going to go in with a team from Health Services.
not_available We're going to run the operation from here, updating the president in real time.
not_available Now, we have to approach Singer with care.
not_available He has no idea how deadly this powder is.
not_available I'm not fighting.
not_available I'm just asking the questions.
not_available He should respect us.
not_available Of course he does now will you please calm down? $1,800 is He said he won the money at the track? He could come up with a better lie than that.
not_available Well, maybe he's telling the truth.
not_available Oh, come on, Helen.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available Wherever.
not_available What's in the bag? 
not_available Some clothes.
not_available Well, open it.
not_available What? Open the bag.
not_available I'm warning you: Open that bag or I'm going to open it myself.
not_available Mom? 
not_available Kyle, listen to your father.
not_available It's none of his business.
not_available As long as you're living in my house, it is! Your house? This isn't your house.
not_available You can't even pay the rent.
not_available Oh, Kyle Come on, will you quit snooping, please? Don't even think about it.
not_available What is this? Huh? Coke? Heroin? 
not_available Give it back, dad.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available I need it.
not_available What do you mean, you "need" it? What are you, some kind of junkie? No.
not_available I'm just delivering it to this guy, okay? And if I don't get it to him Who? It's just a guy, okay? 
not_available Who?! Give me a name.
not_available Kyle, answer your father.
not_available You just give it to me, okay?! Stop it! Hey, stop it, both of you! Both of you! Both of you! Stop! Sam! Sam, don't, Sam! Kyle! I can't reiterate this enough.
not_available This is a credible threat.
not_available Salazar's people will release this virus if we don't find it first.
not_available So lets get going.
not_available Okay, we're going to need a white room with full audio and video capability.
not_available Get me 3b if that's available.
not_available Log him in.
not_available I'll be there in a minute.
not_available I thought you were supposed to be with my dad.
not_available I was.
not_available He sent me back here.
not_available Why? To question Parker.
not_available Parker? He already turned in Kyle Singer.
not_available What else are you going to get from him? Nothing.
not_available And that's the point.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Your dad's sidelining me, Kim.
not_available He's making me sit out.
not_available Why? Why do you think? Because of us? Chase, I'm sorry 
not_available He says he's protecting me but I'm not the one he's trying to protect here.
not_available You're not blaming me, are you? Look, all I'm saying is, we shouldn't have told him.
not_available What were we supposed to do? Keep sneaking around until someone catches us? We could have waited.
not_available Until when? He'd have the Same response no matter when we told him.
not_available I got to deal with this kid Parker.
not_available Jeffery.
not_available The food's exceptionally bad today.
not_available Aren't there laws in this country for cruel and unusual punishment? Tell Annicon, I'm ready to talk.
not_available Bauer couldn't tell me, but Salazar's got some kind of leverage.
not_available Enough to get him released.
not_available I'm not about to let this son of a bitch erase the last two years of my life.
not_available Call your friend at the state department, see what he can tell you.
not_available Annicon.
not_available Mr.
not_available Annicon? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is Jeff Benson, Salazar's guard.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available Sir, Salazar asked to see you.
not_available Why? He says he's ready to talk.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available University of Southern California Don't ask me why, just do it.
not_available I hope you can get a refund.
not_available A refund? From whoever sold you that load of crap.
not_available David, Keeler is going to use this against you in this debate.
not_available Now, ignoring it's not going to make it go away.
not_available Neither will dignifying it with a response.
not_available He's going to claim that Anne perjured herself, which, in case you've forgotten, 
not_available is a felony.
not_available Anne is no felon.
not_available The allegation itself is enough to damage you.
not_available Now, come on, David please, think.
not_available You know you can't go into this debate without some kind of response.
not_available What do you propose? Talk to Anne, make sure she's told you everything.
not_available She has told me everything.
not_available Are you sure? Ever since I started seeing Anne, you've taken every chance to undermine our relationship.
not_available Just because you don't like her 
not_available You're absolutely right, I don't like her.
not_available This isn't about me and Anne.
not_available It's about you and Anne.
not_available Now, if she's got nothing to hide, fine, David, she's got nothing to hide.
not_available But you'd better find out before you face off with Keeler on national television.
not_available Did you ask your friend Jack Bauer what's going on? You did, didn't you? But he wouldn't say.
not_available Must be very frustrating, Luis, being kept in the dark.
not_available You have something to tell me? I asked you here, didn't I? 
not_available Then start talking, because you used up my patience an hour ago.
not_available you are dog with a bone, Luis.
not_available Once you bite down, you don't let go.
not_available When I'm out of here, I don't want you on me anymore.
not_available When you're out of here? You were right.
not_available In a few hours, I'm going home.
not_available Really? And how will you manage that? Hector's a good brother.
not_available Unless he's got a key to this place, 
not_available you're not going anywhere.
not_available But he does have a key.
not_available And when he turns it, the last two years of your life, all the hours you've spent away from your family, all the work you've done to put me in here will go away just like that.
not_available I wanted you to hear it from me, Luis.
not_available I wanted it to be the last thing you ever heard.
not_available Your son will be returned to you now.
not_available I'm just saying that Kyle is in over his head.
not_available We're not calling a lawyer.
not_available He hasn't even been arrested.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Maybe he won't be.
not_available If we leave it alone, don't do anything, maybe this whole thing will just go away.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available Why not, Sam? Why do we have to let anybody know? 
not_available Because it's against the law not to.
not_available What are you suggesting we do, call the police? Maybe they'll give us a reward and then we can pay our rent.
not_available All right, that wasn't fair.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, my god! Hey, what are you doing? I'm going to get rid of it! You want to visit your son in jail?! 
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Helen! Get back! Get back! Who are you people? Where's Kyle Singer?! Kyle Singer! 
not_available He's not here.
not_available Isolate him and draw blood for a full panel.
not_available Get an oral swab.
not_available Seal off all these windows and vents.
not_available No! in here! In here! No! 
not_available Put her in quarantine.
not_available Tony, the virus is out.
not_available I repeat, the virus is out.
not_available Copy that, Jack.
not_available Where is it? In the sewage system.
not_available Get DWP to shut down the lines from ground zero.
not_available It might also be airborne.
not_available Get the fire department and LAPD to set up a perimeter.
not_available Tell them we've got a level
not_available three hot zone.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Come in.
not_available Wayne said you wanted to see me.
not_available What's wrong? Keeler.
not_available He's bringing your ex
not_available husband into this debate.
not_available The SEC's investigation into his company.
not_available Well, Ted was convicted, and served his sentence.
not_available You know that.
not_available I know what you told me.
not_available I told you everything there is to know.
not_available Ted's company was introducing a hypertension drug 
not_available and you reviewed the research.
not_available Yes.
not_available Which later turned out to have been fabricated.
not_available Which Ted knew at the time, and I didn't.
not_available Now Ted's claiming that you both knew.
not_available He can't reverse himself 8 years after giving sworn testimony.
not_available Well, he is.
not_available And he's willing to go on record with the press.
not_available I don't know what to say, except he's a liar.
not_available It's your word against his.
not_available David you have reason to be suspicious.
not_available God knows, you've been betrayed by some of the people you've trusted most, but I'm not sherry.
not_available I told you the whole truth once.
not_available I'm not going to defend it.
not_available Because if there's anything less than complete trust between us I do trust you, Anne.
not_available You should.
not_available Yes.
not_available We need to talk, David.
not_available I'm with Anne now.
not_available Ah, let me guess¡¦ She denied everything.
not_available I believe her.
not_available Yeah, well, listen, I might be able to make this whole thing go away.
not_available How? Meet you in the auditorium alone.
not_available All right.
not_available So have you had a chance to take a look at Nicole's field report yet? Yeah.
not_available I'm almost done.
not_available What are your impressions? Based on what I've read so far, I'm optimistic.
not_available So you think we'll be able to contain the virus? At the very least, we should be able to limit the casualties.
not_available Even though the virus was airborne? Well, there is some risk of it spreading, but Nicole's team acted fast.
not_available They evacuated and sealed off the apartment building and quarantined the Singers.
not_available When do we get the test results? 
not_available Five minutes, ten tops.
not_available So looks like we lucked out, huh? 
not_available Yeah, we deserve a little luck.
not_available All right, look, I got to go.
not_available Make sure you keep me in the loop, all right? 
not_available Okay, you do the Same.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tony, LAPD's setting up the perimeter, but they need wind vectors for the last 15 minutes.
not_available Call meteorology.
not_available Extension 212.
not_available Tony, local news picked up the story about the dead body being dumped at Health Services.
not_available Great.
not_available They want a statement.
not_available What do you want me to tell them? Nothing.
not_available Tony, warden Mitchell is on the phone.
not_available He's calling from the prison.
not_available He says it's urgent.
not_available Almeida.
not_available Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Singer? What the hell is going on here? Because this is not about drugs.
not_available We think you've been exposed to a virus.
not_available A virus? 
not_available It's called Cordillera Virus.
not_available We believe that your son carried it in from Mexico this morning without knowing.
not_available What do you mean "carried it in"? How? He thought he was carrying drugs.
not_available So, we've been exposed? I'm afraid so.
not_available Wh
not_available what does that mean? Are we sick? We're going to have to keep you quarantined until we get the results back from your tests.
not_available Excuse me for one moment.
not_available Yeah, this is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Tony.
not_available Tony, I think Kyle Singer's been exposed.
not_available Yeah, we've already got an all points out on him.
not_available Have you set a perimeter? Yeah.
not_available We're doing everything we can to contain this thing.
not_available All agencies and departments are in the loop on a needto
not_available know basis.
not_available Okay, good work.
not_available Listen, Jack, I know this isn't a best time to tell you, but I just got some bad news.
not_available I figured you'd want to know about it.
not_available What's wrong? Luis Annicon was murdered.
not_available Murdered, how? 
not_available Salazar's guard.
not_available We've got him in custody.
not_available He claims that Salazar had a son kidnapped and threatened to kill him if he didn't do it.
not_available Jack, I'm sorry.
not_available I know you two worked closely on this case.
not_available Tony, I'm going to have to get back to you.
not_available Is everything okay? 
not_available I'm going to get back to you.
not_available Jack? 
not_available These results can't be right.
not_available They are.
not_available Check it again.
not_available I have.
not_available Blood and saliva, atmospheric and surface tests, they're all negative.
not_available We can't find even a¡¦ a trace amount of this virus.
not_available What the hell are you doing? You haven't showered down yet.
not_available We're not at risk.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available I watched the powder get out.
not_available It's harmless, Jack.
not_available Some form of silicate, but that's all.
not_available What? 
not_available There is no virus in the powder.
not_available We tested five Samples.
not_available There weren't even trace amounts.
not_available Atmospheric and surface analysis also came up negative, and Kyle's parents tested negative, as well.
not_available You're sure about this? The only thing I'm not sure about is if we're on the right trail.
not_available No.
not_available No, the body that was dropped off at Health Services was linked to Kyle Singer.
not_available Why would Salazar's people pay him to bring across a bag of worthless powder? Fine, Jack, but where do we even start looking? I don't know.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Macer said the only way to transport the virus was in crystalline form, right? Yeah, that's the only way it can survive outside a living body.
not_available What if it was never outside a living body? What do you mean? What if the virus was transported in a living host? What if Kyle Singer was infected earlier this morning in Mexico before he even left? But Salazar has no leverage if Singer was walking around, infecting people.
not_available That's the point.
not_available He wouldn't be contagious yet.
not_available The incubation period is 14 hours.
not_available Right.
not_available Think about it.
not_available We know for a fact that Kyle Singer was in Mexico 11 hours ago.
not_available Hector Salazar hasn't threatened to release the virus for another three hours.
not_available The math adds up.
not_available We need to find Kyle Singer.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Linda.
not_available Kyle, I told you, I have nothing to say to you.
not_available No, listen to me, okay? I'm in trouble.
not_available Yeah, because you're dealing drugs.
not_available I need your help.
not_available What happened? My dad found the stuff.
not_available We got in a fight, I split, but he's still got it, okay? And I got to get this them, all right? These guys are hard core.
not_available I got to make it right.
not_available Make it right? How? I know, I was thinking, you know, maybe, maybe I could pay them enough, you know, just 
not_available to keep them off my back.
not_available You want me to give you money? No, no, no, just borrow.
not_available How much? It's about 20 grand on the street.
not_available I don't have that kind of money, Kyle.
not_available Didn't you say your dad keeps some cash around the house? 
not_available Not that much.
not_available Linda, listen to me! These guys they will kill me if I don't give them something.
not_available Please please, anything will help right now.
not_available Now you want me to get involved in this? Just please let me borrow something, anything.
not_available I'll pay you back, I swear to god.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm at the mall.
not_available I'll get there as soon as I can.
not_available Thank you.
not_available CTU knows the powder is not real.
not_available Now they're going after Singer.
not_available What do you want me to do? Stay with him, and as soon as he's alone, 
not_available Grab him and take him into containment.
not_available Done.
not_available You can't let the cops get him.
not_available We need Singer to make this work.
not_available Of course there's no way we'll ever release Salazar.
not_available CTU is very close to containing the threat.
not_available Yes, that's right.
not_available All right, Stan.
not_available I'll make sure you're kept in the loop.
not_available What have we got, Wayne? I just talked to Anne's ex
not_available husband.
not_available Now, listen, all Ted Packard wants is money.
not_available If we pay him off, he'll recant before this debate.
not_available That's blackmail.
not_available That's business.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available David, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than trying to defend against this allegation, which is going to hurt you.
not_available I've faced down worse lies.
not_available I think I've earned some credibility.
not_available You read the polls this morning? Because Keeler is closing the gap, and this race is much closer than it should be.
not_available And listen, I know it's distasteful there, but in cost
not_available benefit terms, it's a no brainer.
not_available Anne won't think so.
not_available Anne doesn't have to know.
not_available I can't keep it from her.
not_available Well, that's your choice.
not_available But if this comes out, Anne is going to find herself on the front page of every single newspaper in this country, and David, she's not Sherry.
not_available She's not equipped to handle that kind of scrutiny, and you will not be able to protect her from it.
not_available Now, between this debate and the threat of this outbreak, you have enough on your plate to worry about.
not_available Don't be a martyr.
not_available Keep it simple.
not_available We could have the money within the hour.
not_available Do it.
not_available What's going on? They don't have their suits on.
not_available What does that mean? Are we okay? Yes.
not_available The powder was harmless.
not_available Oh, thank god then you put us through all this for nothing.
not_available You scared the hell out of us.
not_available Mr.
not_available Singer, we still need to find your son.
not_available Is there anything that you can tell us that would help? Why? You just said the powder was harmless.
not_available We believe that your son was infected with the virus in Mexico earlier this morning before he came home.
not_available We have three hours to find him before he becomes contagious.
not_available What are you saying, that our son could die? 
not_available Yes, that could happen.
not_available Oh, god.
not_available I know how difficult this must be for you, and I'm sorry.
not_available But we need to find your son, we need to find him now.
not_available Have you tried his cell phone? 
not_available Yes.
not_available The line's been disconnected.
not_available No, wait.
not_available Oh, wait, wait, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available He took my phone this morning.
not_available What's the number? Okay.
not_available I'm going to need one of you to call him.
not_available This is my fault.
not_available I never would have done any of this if I couldn't take care of my own family.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available You know, it's true.
not_available Tony, it's Jack.
not_available Yeah, Jack, I just spoke to LAPD.
not_available They've got a priority APB on Singer.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available I think we've got a number on him.
not_available All right, look, we'll thread the line through a tracing matrix.
not_available Okay.
not_available The number is 818555
not_available 0103.
not_available I want you to route the call back to my cell phone.
not_available You got it.
not_available I want you to trace that number and reroute the call to Jack's cell phone.
not_available I'm going to need one of you to make the call now, I need you to keep him on the line as long as possible so we can trace him.
not_available What am I supposed to tell him? The truth.
not_available Tony, you set? Yeah, we're ready.
not_available Linda.
not_available Kyle, it's your father.
not_available Dad? We need to talk.
not_available Look, I don't know what you want to talk about.
not_available I already know how pissed off you are, okay? Look, um, whatever you did I know you were just trying to help out your mom and me.
not_available Yeah, well, look, unless you're willing to give back the stuff you took, I got to deal with the situation, okay? Kyle! Please, don't hang up.
not_available Please! Listen.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available What I'm telling you is important.
not_available Please, you have to come home.
not_available Dad, why do you sound different? I need you to trust me onsomething I'm about to tell you.
not_available Dad? You may have gotten a virus, something you picked up in Mexico.
not_available How'd you know I went to Mexico? It doesn't matter.
not_available But you may be sick.
not_available And if you are, then you need to get checked out by a doctor.
not_available Dad, I don't know what you're talking about, all right? 
not_available But I feel fine.
not_available I know it sounds crazy, but it's real.
not_available Now, there's e some people here who are trying to help.
not_available Cops? No Tony, have you got a lock on this trace? 
not_available We're going to lose this kid.
not_available How much longer? I've got the cell tower, but it's covering a three
not_available mile radius.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available This fight, one minute you tell me that you love me, the next minute, you're selling me out to some cops.
not_available They're not police, Kyle.
not_available They're just trying to stop this virus before it becomes an outbreak.
not_available Dad, I already told youI feel fine, all right? They're saying that you're not going to start feeling sick for another few hours.
not_available But by then, it's going to be too late.
not_available Tony, have you got a lock yet? How much longer? What do you want me to do? You want me to turn myself in? Because you may be sick.
not_available And if you are, other people are going to get infected.
not_available Tony 
not_available We got it, Jack.
not_available He's at the Los Feliz Mall, between Vermont and Sunset.
not_available Okay, get his photograph over to mall security.
not_available Tell them not to approach him.
not_available Look, Jack, you're 20 minutes away by car, I can land a team there in ten minutes.
not_available Fine.
not_available Tony, I don't want you taking Chase.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I just don't.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available We'll notify you as soon as we have him in custody.
not_available Please, help our son.
not_available We will.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, I'm not sure you've heard yet, But Tony's heading off site for a while.
not_available He is? Yeah.
not_available I'm taking over for a few hours.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let people in your area know.
not_available Okay, I will.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What was that? Michelle.
not_available She's taking over CTU for a couple of hours.
not_available Where's Tony? They have a location on Singer.
not_available Jack can't get there in time, so Tony's going.
not_available What? Tony's not field ops.
not_available Seems like they're really going out of their way to cut you out of the loop.
not_available Did you do something to piss off Jack? Bad idea, Chase.
not_available You're just going to make things worse.
not_available Tony I just heard they found Kyle Singer.
not_available Is this for real? We'll see.
not_available I'm meeting Jack over there right now.
not_available Look, I'm done with this kid Parker.
not_available He's said all he's gonna say.
not_available I want back on the case.
not_available Yeah, well, we're handling it now, Chase, all right? Because Jack doesn't want me there, right? Did he tell you why he's cutting me out? I don't really care.
not_available He's your boss, it's his call.
not_available This isn't right.
not_available Did he tell you this is because of Kim? He found out we were seeing each other, and this is how he's going to make me pay for it.
not_available Take it up with Jack.
not_available Just want to keep the line open for Tony.
not_available Leave a message for Jack Bauer.
not_available Damn it, Jack.
not_available Chase.
not_available Chase.
not_available Look, I know my dad can be hard, but he will come around.
not_available How do you know? Because I know my father.
not_available Maybe you don't know him as well as you think.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? Nothing.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Forget it, Kim.
not_available Don't you think I feel bad enough already? Because I do.
not_available We shouldn't have told him.
not_available Well, the only other option I can think of is for us to stop seeing each other, which as far as I'm concerned, is not an option.
not_available Or is it? Chase, what do you want? 
not_available I want to be able to do my job.
not_available Kim, we need you at your station.
not_available Tony's about to land.
not_available Tony Almeida, CTU.
not_available I think we found the guy you're looking for.
not_available He's in the rotunda.
not_available Bronson, lock down the east exit.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Pierson, I want you to run point from the security office.
not_available Alright.
not_available How long have you been using, Jack? What? I did a rotation in rehab.
not_available You learn to pick out when someone's using.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available You know exactly what I'm talking about.
not_available How long? For a while now.
not_available It was the only way I could maintain my cover with the Salazars.
not_available Are you high now? 
not_available No.
not_available It's empty, Jack.
not_available Nicole, I told you I'm fine.
not_available I'm not so sure.
not_available If you're not so sure, then turn me in.
not_available I don't want to turn you in, Jack.
not_available I'm worried about you.
not_available You don't have to be.
not_available I've kicked it.
not_available I have a responsibility to stop this virus, and I am taking a calculated risk that you are more of an asset than a liability.
not_available Just please don't screw this up.
not_available I won't.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Hey, Jack, Security found Singer.
not_available I'm about to pick him up.
not_available Okay, where are you? Second floor rotunda, top of the north escalator.
not_available Where are you? We're coming into the loading dock, north entrance.
not_available Have you got a visual? 
not_available Yeah, I got him.
not_available Where have you placed your men? 
not_available We posted at all the main entrances.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available We should be there in a minute.
not_available All right.
not_available Have your men cover all the parking level exits.
not_available Let's go! I don't want to cause any kind of commotion.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available CTU's here.
not_available They're about to move in on the kid.
not_available Just stand down.
not_available It's too hot.
not_available This is my only chance.
not_available We can't let the kid get caught.
not_available No, no, wait.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available Gomez! Wait here, I want to make a clean grab.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Kyle.
not_available Who are you? My name's Tony Almeida.
not_available I'm a federal agent, but I'm here to help you.
not_available What your father told you about your being sick is true.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available You come with me, I'll prove it to you.
not_available Get out of the way! Move! Nicole, he's been hit in the neck! Jamie, give me your walkie
not_available talkie.
not_available We have an officer down.
not_available Kyle Singer is not in custody.
not_available I repeat, Kyle Singer is not in custody.
not_available Maintain cover on all exits.
