
not_available Tell me about Ron Wieland.
not_available He's going public with the rumor.
not_available About the bomb? We're holding him at the OC.
not_available When the crisis passes Ill let him go.
not_available Sir, you better come out here.
not_available What I find most troubling is that our president knows about this threat and is not saying anything to the public.
not_available Who was controlling that room? 
not_available Armus.
not_available I want to see him now.
not_available Kim, Im scared! Where are you taking her? She can't go back to LA.
not_available I checked you out.
not_available Your father does work for CTU.
not_available Now you tell me, what did he tell you was gonna happen today in LA? It's a nuclear bomb.
not_available What's my father's connection to all this? He wrote a cheque to Syed Ali for $475,000 in return for consulting services.
not_available Maybe they were doing business.
not_available Syed Ali's only business is bankrolling terrorists.
not_available Im a consultant for the CIA.
not_available Let's go! Nina, how big is the bomb? What did he tell you? 
not_available Everything.
not_available No! We're losing him! Jack 
not_available Secure her! I know where the bomb is.
not_available I was illegally detained inside the president's retreat for the last six hours.
not_available That tells you how much he did not want this information come out.
not_available No, Karen.
not_available That does me no good.
not_available What am I looking for? Wieland has a source inside of this administration, and I need to know who.
not_available Im on it.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then you get back to me with that.
not_available OK.
not_available No, I need the information.
not_available Good.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available Wieland's been contained for six hours.
not_available After you met with him, someone let him out.
not_available And you think it was me? Even if I had the resources, which I don't, why in God's name would I want to see Wieland cause a panic, especially today? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available David, I had nothing to do with this.
not_available I swear on the lives of our children! Mr President Wait here.
not_available You find Armus yet? I wanna know how Wieland got past him.
not_available Take a look.
not_available What's this? A digital playback from the surveillance feeds at OC.
not_available That's Armus.
not_available This happened 25 minutes ago.
not_available Armus let him out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available We haven't found him.
not_available Mr President, if Armus is working covertly against you Its not covert now! Its in my face! 
not_available We will find him, sir.
not_available We'd better.
not_available Because whomever he's working for is trying to keep me from finding this bomb! How long till we go down? 
not_available Any minute.
not_available The pilots found us a place to crash land.
not_available Ive gotta get the coordinates to George.
not_available George? 
not_available Jack, what's happening? We're going down.
not_available The pilots don't know what's going on.
not_available It felt like some kind of explosion.
not_available We're losing all kinds of power.
not_available They think they can make a safe crash landing on a soft riverbed located in sector J.
not_available The coordinates are 343044 north, Did you get that? 
not_available Yeah, we got it.
not_available Nina, there's a chance we're not gonna make it through this.
not_available We need to know the location of the bomb now! We've given you everything you've asked for! Please! Can she hear me? Hold on, Ill put you on speaker.
not_available Nina, you got your pardon from the president.
not_available What more do you want? Even if I survive this, Jack's gonna kill me.
not_available Phillips is there to protect you.
not_available He can't protect me from Jack! Nina, all I want is the location of the bomb.
not_available I give you my word, I will not harm you in any way! I don't believe you.
not_available Where is the bomb? Rick, holster your weapon! Do one last good thing with your life! 
not_available Phillips, what is going on? Phillips, that's an order! Take your seat! This is the captain.
not_available We're not going to make it to the riverbed.
not_available Everyone assume crash position and get ready for impact.
not_available George, we're going down! We're not gonna make the riverbed.
not_available The coordinates I gave you, they're going to be off Get the crash
not_available site coordinates from ATC and send in search and rescue.
not_available ATC, this is CTU.
not_available I need the exact coordinates.
not_available Ill prepare a statement in the next hour.
not_available In the meantime, let's find Armus.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Sherry I owe you an apology.
not_available Why? What did Mike say to you? Richard Armus was the one who let Wieland go.
not_available But Armus doesn't have his own agenda.
not_available He must be working for someone else.
not_available We're looking into it now.
not_available Im sorry I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
not_available Its all right.
not_available I don't expect you to change your attitude towards me overnight.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available David What are you gonna do? Talk to the press.
not_available Im not sure how, but I may have to go after Ron's credibility.
not_available Ron's credibility? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Make it look like his report was motivated by personal dislike, that it's not based in fact.
not_available Yes, but it is based in fact.
not_available Believe me, I wish there was another way.
not_available Maybe there is.
not_available Why don't you just tell the truth, David? Its what you do best.
not_available I mean, you pulled it off with Keith, with our divorce.
not_available You've earned the public's trust.
not_available Just use it.
not_available What? Im just wondering if you've really changed, or if you've just gotten better at pretending.
not_available Sir? 
not_available Yes, what is it? We just got word from CTU in Los Angeles.
not_available The plane Jack Bauer was returning in just went down.
not_available It crashed? We're still waiting for details.
not_available Oh, my God! Rick.
not_available Rick! Rick! Myers I haven't found her.
not_available I don't even know if she made it.
not_available Find her Im gonna find her.
not_available You gotta hang in there.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available Search and rescue will be here any minute.
not_available Just hang in there.
not_available Ill be right back.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available These images were taken around the time the pilot reported the explosion.
not_available They were shot down.
not_available By some kind of groundto
not_available air missile.
not_available Compile a list of anybody that might have had access to their flight plan.
not_available lf Nina didn't die in the crash, whoever it was will want to finish the job.
not_available I have search and rescue scrambling now.
not_available Make sure they're well armed.
not_available Get me their ETA as soon as you have it.
not_available George, Richards told me you had Warner and Naiyeer transferred to room seven.
not_available That's right.
not_available I separated them for a reason.
not_available Its not working, so let's put them together and play them off each other.
not_available One minute you're trying to save your own ass, then you act like you give a damn about anybody Back off! 
not_available No, Im not gonna back off.
not_available Not today.
not_available Now, what's going on? Remember the warehouse in Panorama City? Weapons
not_available grade plutonium, airborne in the firefight.
not_available You were exposed? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Said Id be lucky if I made it through tomorrow.
not_available I don't know what it say, George.
not_available Im sorry.
not_available Me too.
not_available Does anybody else know about this? Just Jack.
not_available You.
not_available Can we keep it that way? Do you need anything? Is there something I can do? Just do you job.
not_available Let me do mine.
not_available So you both claim not to know Syed Ali.
not_available Its not a claim.
not_available Its the truth.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Id rather stand.
not_available Sit down! Where the hell do you think you are? Wake up! A cache of weapons
not_available grade plutonium was found in a warehouse in Panorama City! A nuclear weapon was assembled there and it's set to be detonated today.
not_available A nuclear bomb? We also found this in the warehouse.
not_available What do you make of that, guys? This is a bill of lading from our company.
not_available For a container sent to Syed Ali, which means at least one of you is lying right now.
not_available Ill let you two work that out between yourselves.
not_available Whoever talks first gets immunity.
not_available Its a one
not_available time offer.
not_available It expires in ten minutes.
not_available They're gonna come for us soon.
not_available What's taking them so long? I don't know, but they'll be here.
not_available We're leaving soon.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available Central booking.
not_available LAPD? That's downtown.
not_available I know where it is.
not_available Aw, man.
not_available What did I tell you? I don't believe this.
not_available Someone from CTU is supposed to pick us up.
not_available Can you call George Mason? Captain says it's out of their jurisdiction.
not_available Look, you're both suspects in a capital crime.
not_available We told you why we can't go back to LA.
not_available The bomb.
not_available Yes.
not_available I checked it.
not_available There's been no departmental alert or elevated threat status.
not_available They do not want the entire city to panic at once.
not_available Do you think we're making this up? Call CTU.
not_available They'll tell you.
not_available Im a cop.
not_available I have my orders, OK? Ill sign you two out before I take you back to the city.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available We can't go back to LA.
not_available When my dad finds out, he'll fix things.
not_available We shouldn't be counting on your father.
not_available No offence, but you were right when you said how messed up he is.
not_available Everything Ive said about my father is because I was angry and I blamed him for what happened to my mom.
not_available Maybe you were right.
not_available No.
not_available No, listen, it wasn't his fault, and he did the best he could.
not_available It just all turned out wrong.
not_available No, this is crazy.
not_available How can they keep us here without letting us see a lawyer? Huh? What are we gonna do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Because nothing we say will make any difference.
not_available They'll make it look like we're involved.
not_available With a nuclear bomb? Ive done nothing wrong! This is crazy! I have nothing to hide! What about you, Bob? What about me? You got anything to hide? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available No.
not_available You made the authorization to Ali.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available Then who did? Don't interrogate me.
not_available That's exactly what they want.
not_available Yeah? Im not asking for them.
not_available lf you didn't make the authorization Naiyeer's levels are even.
not_available Warner's spiking all over.
not_available They also said that you work for the CIA.
not_available I let the CIA pass information through our distribution network a couple of times.
not_available That's it.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? Because it is none of your concern! 
not_available I think it concerns me now! I think a nuclear bomb pretty much concerns everyone! Don't you? You know what Im thinking, Bob? Im thinking that all your generosity and acceptance is just a load of crap.
not_available Reza, you better sit down and shut up before you say something you will regret for the rest of your life.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available I can track the shipping order! Bob's code signature will show that he authorized the transaction order! 
not_available Get off of me.
not_available No, just stop it.
not_available The database is at the office.
not_available Ill take you there.
not_available Step outside.
not_available Im not taking the fall for you, Bob.
not_available Come on.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available Hey, where's George? 
not_available With Naiyeer.
not_available He broke.
not_available Could you tell him the search and rescue is about 12 minutes from the crash site? OK.
not_available Tony.
not_available Yeah? What's going on with George? 
not_available As far as what? He's sick, isn't he? He's got some kind of radiation poisoning, doesn't he? Where'd you get that? Hazmat's all over the warehouse he raided this morning, so it's gotta be hot.
not_available His nose was bleeding, and Shipler told me he was throwing up in the bathroom.
not_available And it doesn't take a doctor to figure it out.
not_available Besides, I can read your face pretty well by now.
not_available Look, he doesn't want anybody else to know, OK? How bad? 
not_available Pretty bad.
not_available Can he run things in his condition.
not_available Yeah, I think so.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available lf he's compromised mentally or physically, we can't He can do his job, Michelle.
not_available He wants to do his job like Ive never seen.
not_available He's determined to stop this bomb.
not_available So am I, which is why I think he should step down.
not_available Ill keep an eye on him.
not_available And the second he misses a step, Ill make sure he backs off.
not_available No, you can't baby
not_available sit him.
not_available Im not baby
not_available sitting him, Michelle.
not_available Now, you gotta trust me on this.
not_available Can I see that information as soon as you get it? I made some notes on David's speech.
not_available I thought maybe you might want to incorporate them.
not_available I haven't even shown that to the president yet.
not_available Jenny showed me a draft.
not_available She shouldn't have.
not_available She's known me for a long time, Lynne.
not_available She knows what I have to offer.
not_available Mrs Palmer, the president believes that you can be an asset to him during this time of crisis.
not_available That's why you're here.
not_available He did not give you license to insinuate yourself into Wait, wait, wait.
not_available Put your back down, Lynne.
not_available I am not here to trespass on your territory.
not_available I am here to help.
not_available That's why Im coming to you first before I go directly to David.
not_available Mrs Palmer, that sounds like a threat to me.
not_available Unless David's speech is pitch
not_available perfect, which it is not, Wieland's allegations might bring down this presidency.
not_available I don't need you to tell me how important this is.
not_available Then you owe it to David to look at my revisions.
not_available Give me your hand.
not_available Come on.
not_available We got a survivor here.
not_available This doesn't look like search and rescue.
not_available Who are they? Are they coming for you? 
not_available I don't know! Don't even think about it! Keep going! Go, go! Keep going! Keep going! Take cover in the creek bed.
not_available There's too many of them for me to handle.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Give me your hands.
not_available I need you to run recon for me and handle the ammunition.
not_available You screw with me now, and we both die.
not_available Do you understand? Jack, we need to get to higher ground so I can spot for you.
not_available Take the ammunition.
not_available Go.
not_available Go! Would you like some water, Kate? Maybe some tea? How do you know my name? 
not_available I know more than that.
not_available I know you are 29 years old, unmarried.
not_available I know you have an economics degree from Stanford.
not_available Who are you? My name is Syed Ali.
not_available You know who I am? Ive heard your name mentioned.
not_available What else have you heard about me? Nothing.
not_available Kate, what have you found in your father's files? You were looking in places you do not belong.
not_available You must have seen some things.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Really? Let go of me! Let go of me! I told you, I don't know what you are talking about.
not_available You got the wrong guy.
not_available Paul? Oh, my God.
not_available What are you doing? He tells us your father works for the CIA.
not_available This is not new information.
not_available Tell us what you saw and who you told.
not_available We didn't tell anyone because we didn't see anything! He's telling you the truth! Please don't do this! Listen to me.
not_available Nothing can get in the way of this sacred day.
not_available Tell us what you saw and who you told.
not_available We didn't see anything, I swear! The files deleted themselves Don't lie to me, Kate! Im not lying! She's not lying! They were selfdeleting files! We don't know anything! What are you 
not_available No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Jack, I can spot you from here.
not_available Im set.
not_available Where are they? Im out! 
not_available Last pack, Jack.
not_available Where are they? 
not_available Ten o'clock, within 50 meters.
not_available That's it! Where are they now? 
not_available Ten o'clock, two o'clock, higher ground.
not_available Drop it, Jack.
not_available I said drop it! I don't wanna shoot you just yet, but I will if I have to! Drop the gun! Drop it! Its over! Stand down! Stand down or he's dead! Stand down! She's the only one who can get us to the bomb! I wanna talk to the president! Now! Megan.
not_available Megan! 
not_available Come here.
not_available Kim! Are you all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Im scared.
not_available I know.
not_available Its scary, but you're doing so good.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Wait.
not_available Where are you taking her? Do you know where you're going, baby? Aunt Emily.
not_available She's my mom's sister.
not_available Do you know where she lives? 
not_available Santa Barbara.
not_available Santa Barbara? Santa Barbara.
not_available That's so good.
not_available Why can't you come with me? Oh Oh, I will soon, OK? 
not_available I don't wanna go.
not_available I know.
not_available OK, let's go.
not_available Your aunt's waiting.
not_available Go on, OK? You can go now.
not_available Go on.
not_available Go on.
not_available Don't cry.
not_available No, no, shh.
not_available Im gonna see you soon, OK? Santa Barbara, that's like, what, 
not_available Its more like a hundred.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available She's gonna be OK.
not_available Mr Mason, Tony.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack's alive.
not_available Seven hostiles were killed, but there's a complication.
not_available What? 
not_available Nina Myers took Jack hostage.
not_available She's demanding to speak to the president.
not_available Have Richards and Maccabee take him to Bob Warner's office.
not_available Let me talk to her.
not_available She'll be here when you get back.
not_available We were supposed to get married in an hour.
not_available Just let me explain everything to her.
not_available You have one minute.
not_available Watch him.
not_available Im gonna make a call.
not_available What did they do to you? 
not_available They just asked me questions.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available Are you sure? Larry is on his way with a criminal lawyer.
not_available He's one of the top guys in the city.
not_available Im not gonna need a lawyer.
not_available But your father might.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Reza, what's going on? Its your father, Marie.
not_available They think that he might have something to do with Syed Ali.
not_available My father? 
not_available Yeah, he tried to use me.
not_available Used you how? To do business with Ali, who they say is part of this terrorist group.
not_available My father? Part of a terrorist group? 
not_available They have proof.
not_available They have this transaction that's connecting one of us to Ali.
not_available And I know I didn't write it.
not_available Im sorry to put you in this impossible situation.
not_available I love you, and I wanna be with you.
not_available But right now, something really bad might happen if I don't help them.
not_available After everything he's done for you, to turn on my father He turned on me.
not_available He turned on us.
not_available What else was I supposed to do? Marie 
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Marie.
not_available We have a secured line ready.
not_available That's Nina Myers.
not_available Mike, you should talk to her first.
not_available I don't want to give her access to me until she gives us something in return.
not_available Miss Myers this is Mike Novick.
not_available Im the president's Chief of Staff.
not_available I asked to speak with the president.
not_available He's not available.
not_available Do you wanna stop this nuclear bomb or not? 
not_available Of course we do.
not_available Then put the president on.
not_available Im authorized to negotiate on his behalf.
not_available What I want is nonnegotiable.
not_available What do you want? Ill tell you where the bomb is in exchange for immunity.
not_available The president's already granted you a total pardon.
not_available Except this is a crime I haven't committed yet.
not_available What crime? The murder of Jack Bauer.
not_available Add that to my pardon, and Ill tell you where the bomb is.
not_available And if we don't comply? We don't have a choice.
not_available Is that you, Mr Bauer? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Please tell the president that he has no other choice but to accept her deal.
not_available Is CTU on a secured line? 
not_available Yes.
not_available This is George Mason.
not_available We're on a designated channel.
not_available Except Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.
not_available Do you have alternatives to what she's asking? Any weaknesses that we can exploit? None.
not_available She's a survivor, sir.
not_available She knows Bauer.
not_available She knows if she doesn't kill him now, he'll hunt her down and find her later.
not_available So, in your assessment, Nina Myers is our best chance to stop this bomb? Sir, she may be our only chance.
not_available Ms Myers, this is President Palmer.
not_available Im listening.
not_available Is Jack Bauer there? 
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Im here too.
not_available Ms Myers if the information you provide culminates in the successful interception of the nuclear device, you will get everything you asked for.
not_available You will be pardoned in advance for the murder of Jack Bauer.
not_available I can live with that.
not_available Start talking, Nina.
not_available The bomb will be detonated by a man named Syed Ali.
not_available We know about Ali.
not_available We need to know where he is.
not_available He's at a house in Chatsworth, on Starling Court.
not_available Contact the local law enforcement to set up a perimeter.
not_available Coordinate among the relevant agencies.
not_available Ms Myers, you're not to take any action until we put our hands on this bomb.
not_available Agreed.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Is there anything you want me to do? Please make sure that my daughter is safe, sir.
not_available Tell her that I love her.
not_available Ill do that.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Mr President Please, you don't need to say anything, sir.
not_available There was only one right choice to make, and you made it.
not_available Im sorry, Jack.
not_available He's right, Mr President.
not_available Its the only way we're going to find this nuclear device before it's too late.
not_available Sir The press corps is waiting.
not_available You've made some changes.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Its better.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available For God's sake, stop it! What do you want? I don't know what you want! Yes, you do.
not_available We didn't see anything.
not_available We didn't tell anyone anything! I swear! I don't know anything! How can I tell you what I don't know? I believe you.
not_available lf she knew anything, she would have told us.
not_available Kill her.
not_available It won't take them long to find Ali.
not_available This isn't how you thought it would end, is it, Jack? This isn't over yet.
