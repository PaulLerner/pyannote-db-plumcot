
not_available What we're doing here is very simple.
not_available We're going to release a certain substance so it flows into your pipelines.
not_available Take the canisters to the main distribution tank, quickly.
not_available Is Wayne Palmer dead yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Explain.
not_available We rolled his car, but he survived and got away.
not_available It was sloppy.
not_available We'll make it right.
not_available 
not_available You better.
not_available You know what's at stake.
not_available Get down! It's the truth.
not_available Audrey Raines was my contact at the Department of Defense.
not_available You met with her face to face? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dammit, Audrey! Tell me the truth! 
not_available I am telling you the truth! You already lied.
not_available Tell me what you know, or I promise this will become very unpleasant.
not_available Bill, we have a connection.
not_available Henderson made calls to Collette.
not_available That voids her agreement.
not_available You have three seconds to tell me where the target is, or I will kill you.
not_available Where is the target?! A natural gas distribution centre.
not_available Once the Sentox hits the main tank and goes right into the pipes, it's impossible to stop.
not_available From there, it goes to people's homes.
not_available The Sentox is in the system.
not_available I need C4 and a timer.
not_available Get these people out.
not_available What are you doing? To deliver the Sentox, it had to mix with natural gas.
not_available If we can ignite that gas before it leaves the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated.
not_available Bierko! 
not_available That's it.
not_available The main tanks are going.
not_available Get out! Jack, are you clear? Jack, respond.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Curtis, this is Audrey.
not_available Any sign of Jack? Nothing.
not_available I've got men searching the main tank area.
not_available Rescue units have arrived.
not_available They're assessing the situation.
not_available Chloe, what are we getting from the air monitors? 
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Trace readings of the nerve agent, below danger levels.
not_available It looks like the Sentox was incinerated.
not_available Jack's plan worked.
not_available I'm going to brief the White House.
not_available Apprise me of any developments.
not_available Miles.
not_available Curtis, have we searched the area for Jack? It's under way.
not_available He hasn't gone out the north exit.
not_available CTU, Jack's OK.
not_available Get a medical team over here now.
not_available Jack! Are you OK? Give me a hand.
not_available I got him.
not_available Bierko! 
not_available I need him conscious.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The nerve gas, did it leave the plant? 
not_available There's no trace.
not_available It worked.
not_available Good.
not_available He's in shock.
not_available We need to transport him.
not_available I want him taken back to CTU Medical.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Curtis, organise an escort team.
not_available You get him back to CTU alive.
not_available You got it.
not_available On my count.
not_available Three, two, one.
not_available Team A, meet me by the staging area.
not_available We need an escort to CTU.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Bill, it's Jack.
not_available Is your line still secure? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What's your status on Henderson? 
not_available He's still an active protocol.
not_available You need to make him a priority.
not_available Bill, listen to me.
not_available I know Henderson.
not_available He couldn't have planned this.
not_available He's a soldier and a patriot.
not_available However misguided, he believes what he's doing is right.
not_available He was willing to let his wife die in order to protect someone very powerful.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Bill, I'm scared.
not_available I think this is bigger than anything we could ever have imagined.
not_available Karen, you're not hearing me.
not_available They managed to prevent an attack.
not_available It doesn't negate the fact CTU's performance has been one misstep after another.
not_available I'm not disputing that, Mr Vice President.
not_available Then why hesitate to carry out your mandate? Have Homeland absorb CTU.
not_available CTU is still actively looking for Christopher Henderson.
not_available A shake
not_available up right now could hamper that.
not_available I won't hold up this takeover because of a procedural mop
not_available up.
not_available Henderson will be caught.
not_available Understood? 
not_available Clearly.
not_available Whatever hoops you have to jump through, just get it done.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available 
not_available Keep me informed.
not_available I guess we should get started.
not_available Buchanan is not gonna take this lying down.
not_available Despite what the vice president said, CTU saved a lot of lives.
not_available If Buchanan mounts a challenge, it will be seen in that light.
not_available This could be reversed.
not_available If we were to find someone who would go on record citing Buchanan's mismanagement, how he superseded Lynn McGill's authority, how he allowed CTU to be compromised, it'd go a long way to mitigating his successes.
not_available It'd give us the protection we need.
not_available Buchanan's people are extremely loyal.
not_available I'm not thinking about a member of CTU.
not_available I'm thinking of Audrey Raines.
not_available She was here all morning.
not_available She saw what went on.
not_available And her loyalty is split between CTU and DOD.
not_available We could take advantage of that.
not_available Let me draft a statement and present it to her.
not_available We're being rolled up, Audrey.
not_available Homeland's taking over.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Karen told me herself.
not_available No, they can't do that.
not_available Not after what you've accomplished today.
not_available I'd like to think we've earned a reprieve, but I doubt it.
not_available CTU is in the middle of an investigation.
not_available Henderson is still at large.
not_available I know, it doesn't make any sense.
not_available Karen's taking orders from the vice president.
not_available He wants this to happen.
not_available Why? 
not_available I've been asking myself the same question.
not_available We lost him.
not_available 
not_available How did you lose him? Palmer knocked Cobb out and took his weapon.
not_available We tried to pursue, but someone came to Palmer's aid.
not_available Who? 
not_available That's unclear.
not_available They got away.
not_available All right.
not_available We're going to our fall
not_available back.
not_available Scrub the scene and get over here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You're all right, Mr Palmer.
not_available Just take it slow.
not_available Aaron.
not_available We're at the presidential retreat.
not_available Can you try to sit up? 
not_available I think we need to get you looked at, sir.
not_available There isn't enough time for that.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available Then maybe you can explain to me what's going on.
not_available Why were those men trying to kill you? Because David had a source inside the White House.
not_available Someone was trying to prevent me from seeing her.
not_available Who's this source? Mrs Logan's assistant.
not_available Evelyn Martin? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She and David were trading emails.
not_available I need to find out the content of those messages.
not_available I think David was killed because of information Evelyn gave him.
not_available I drafted a letter to the families of the victims of the Sunrise Hills Mall.
not_available It's here for your review.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Your schedule's there.
not_available You have a 9am with the press office and the president wants you in on his briefing.
not_available Evelyn, are you all right? I'm fine.
not_available I'm just tired.
not_available It's been a long day.
not_available I'm surprised any of us got through it.
not_available Oh, do you have your credentials with you? There's still a curfew in place.
not_available I have them with me.
not_available Good.
not_available Try to get some rest.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Evelyn.
not_available Hi.
not_available I really need to talk to you.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr Palmer.
not_available I need to go home.
not_available Ma'am, please.
not_available This won't take but a second.
not_available You were sending emails to my brother.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available I traced the IP account right to your address, so, yes, you do know what I'm talking about.
not_available I need to know what you told David.
not_available I didn't tell him anything.
not_available Evelyn.
not_available I have the record of your correspondence.
not_available David deleted the content of the messages, but I know, Evelyn.
not_available I know you were in contact with him, so please don't lie to me again.
not_available Tell me what I need to know.
not_available Someone killed David.
not_available They killed him.
not_available And then just tried to kill me.
not_available Now, I think they knew I was coming here to see you, so I think that means we're both in danger.
not_available Please, I have to go now.
not_available Give me what I need! Talk to me! I can't! They kidnapped my little girl.
not_available They kidnapped my little girl.
not_available They kidnapped my baby.
not_available They said they would give Amy back to me if I gave them the evidence.
not_available What evidence? I have proof about who's behind everything that's happened today.
not_available They're gonna kill my baby.
not_available They're gonna kill Listen to me.
not_available Listen.
not_available Even if you turn over this evidence, they're notjust gonna give you back your daughter.
not_available That's not what these people do.
not_available Now, you've gotta trust me, Evelyn.
not_available Please, talk to me.
not_available Ma'am, if I may.
not_available Mr Palmer's right.
not_available You know too much.
not_available They'll kill you both.
not_available I'll give you the evidence that I have if you get me back my daughter.
not_available I got Henderson's work records for the past ten years.
not_available There's a lot.
not_available I'll start data mining, see if there's anything we can use to track him down.
not_available That's Chloe O'Brian.
not_available That's Jim Hill from Homeland.
not_available I'm Jim Hill, Homeland Security.
not_available Could you show me your station? Chloe O'Brian? 
not_available Yeah? I'm taking over your station.
not_available I need your access codes.
not_available Who are you? What's going on here? May I have your attention, please? These men and women are from Homeland Security.
not_available I've just authorised a unitwide backslash protocol.
not_available CTU is being absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, I realise this is sudden, and this has been a very difficult day, but let's cooperate to make this transition as smooth as possible.
not_available There is still work to be done.
not_available Vladimir Bierko is en route to CTU, and Christopher Henderson remains an open protocol.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Ms Raines, would you mind joining me in the situation room? Why? 
not_available We need to speak in private.
not_available Fine.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Wayne Palmer.
not_available Are you all right? I just heard about the explosion.
not_available I'm fine, but I wish the people responsible for your brother's assassination were in custody.
not_available Yeah, well, maybe I can help you with that.
not_available How? I'm at President Logan's retreat.
not_available I'm with Evelyn Martin, Mrs Logan's assistant.
not_available What does she have to do with this? 
not_available She has proof other people were involved.
not_available Who? 
not_available She won't tell me.
not_available Why not? Her daughter's been kidnapped.
not_available They'll kill her unless Evelyn hands over the evidence.
not_available This has to be Henderson.
not_available They'll call with a place to meet.
not_available I wanna be on that call when it comes.
not_available CTU will provide operational support.
not_available We're gonna need a place to meet.
not_available I passed an old barn about a mile west of the retreat, off service road 19.
not_available Service road 19.
not_available I'll be there in 20 minutes.
not_available See you then.
not_available Jack's gonna meet us.
not_available We should go.
not_available Listen, they may be watching you, so I don't think we should leave together.
not_available What do you want to do? 
not_available We'll separate.
not_available Get to your car.
not_available We'll meet in the parking lot.
not_available OK.
not_available See you soon.
not_available "The acting director's failure to enhance security, in the light of the threat, effectively invited the subsequent attack that resulted in loss of personnel"? You can't possibly expect me to sign this.
not_available It's a complete distortion, designed to place blame on Bill Buchanan and CTU.
not_available But you agree that today's attacks represent a serious failure that needs to be addressed? Thanks to CTU, hundreds of thousands of people are alive who would be dead.
not_available But if CTU had been operating effectively, those people would never have been at risk.
not_available I couldn't more strongly disagree with this statement.
not_available Well, I'm disappointed with your decision, but I appreciate your loyalty.
not_available Of course.
not_available Oh, just to confirm, as onsite liaison for DOD, you participated in today's decision
not_available making process.
not_available What's your point? 
not_available Serious mistakes were made here today that resulted in the loss of American lives.
not_available It would be a shame to see the taint of CTU's mismanagement spread to your agency.
not_available And your career.
not_available By signing this, you isolate the fallout for today's mistakes to Bill Buchanan and CTU 
not_available where it belongs.
not_available I'm proud of what we did here today.
not_available The people of CTU are heroes, especially Bill Buchanan.
not_available This takeover is completely unwarranted, and I won't help you justify it.
not_available Hello.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Jack, where are you? 
not_available I'm on my way to see Wayne Palmer.
not_available Wayne Palmer? Wayne told me the aide to the first lady has evidence that proves who's behind David Palmer's assassination.
not_available She won't give it to Wayne because her daughter's been kidnapped to keep her quiet.
not_available They want to trade the evidence for the girl.
not_available Oh, my God, Jack.
not_available I'm gonna need you to retask a satellite to those coordinates.
not_available That could be difficult.
not_available Why? CTU is being rolled up.
not_available Karen is replacing everyone with people from Homeland.
not_available What? That doesn't make sense.
not_available I know.
not_available Even if she has a reason to, we're tracking down Henderson.
not_available We'll never bring her team up to speed.
not_available I know that she's taking orders from Vice President Gardner himself.
not_available Maybe you should talk to Karen directly.
not_available No.
not_available She's the one in control.
not_available When I was interrogating Henderson, he was protecting someone very powerful.
not_available He'd have let his wife die rather than give him up.
not_available And now Vice President Gardner is shutting down CTU when we're actually in a position to bring Henderson in.
not_available Do you really think Gardner's involved? We can't afford to take the chance that he's not.
not_available All right, what do you want me to do? 
not_available Get Chloe to retask the satellite.
not_available Chloe has been let go, along with the rest of her department.
not_available I need the satellite.
not_available Figure out a way to get Chloe back on.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available I could approach senior CTU staff.
not_available That's a waste of time.
not_available They're worried about theirjobs.
not_available We could promise them some security.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I've reconsidered my position.
not_available I'll sign your statement.
not_available May I ask why the sudden change of heart? I don't agree with everything in the statement, but I see the need to shield DOD of any possible controversy that could reflect back on my father.
not_available Miles.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I want one thing in return.
not_available What's that? 
not_available That Chloe be kept on and assigned to me.
not_available Why Chloe? I'm gonna need considerable server access to compile my report for DOD.
not_available Chloe can help me finish it in half the time.
not_available Other people can do thatjob.
not_available I have a working relationship with Chloe.
not_available She's an asset that you cannot afford to lose.
not_available Do we have a deal? Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Evelyn Martin will leave the presidential retreat in a couple of minutes.
not_available It's time to get going.
not_available What about the girl? I'll take care of her.
not_available Wayne Palmer.
not_available 
not_available I'm at my car.
not_available No one's around.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available 
not_available OK.
not_available I'm extremely uncomfortable sending the two of you off without protection.
not_available We've been over this.
not_available If you leave the compound again, we risk raising suspicion.
not_available I know it, sir, but I don't like it.
not_available Wayne.
not_available Well, this is a surprise.
not_available We didn't know you were coming.
not_available Are you here to see the president? No.
not_available Mr Palmer came here to give me a memento from his brother.
not_available It's a service medal.
not_available Sorry, I just knew you and the president were gonna be dealing with this crisis today and I just I didn't want you people to feel obliged to see me.
not_available It would never ever be any obligation on our part, especially under the circumstances.
not_available I just want you to know how sorry I am.
not_available Your brother was one of the greatest men to ever occupy the office.
not_available His loss, to all of us, can't be expressed in words.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I know the president would also like to express his condolences to you personally.
not_available That means a lot, sir, but unfortunately I have a plane to catch.
not_available I'm flying David's body back to Washington, so Oh, I understand.
not_available Safe trip.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I'll walk you out, sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mr Buchanan.
not_available Ms O'Brian, we're not done here.
not_available How can they get away with this? 
not_available This is not over.
not_available Just follow instructions.
not_available Everyone's getting fired.
not_available I'll do everything I can to get that rescinded.
not_available Once what we accomplished today is made public, I am confident we'll be back at our posts.
not_available The best thing you can do is stay focused and follow your orders.
not_available Do you understand me? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available O'Brian, don't transfer your station to Valerie.
not_available You got a pass.
not_available I did? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So get back to work.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Why am I staying? Because Ms Raines requested that you keep your position.
not_available What does Audrey Raines have to do with this? Ms Raines signed a statement documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU and by you in particular.
not_available So, for the moment, she gets what she wants, and she wants O'Brian.
not_available Audrey would never sign anything like that.
not_available I did sign it, Bill.
not_available Why? Because it's the truth.
not_available You realise this effectively kills any chance we have of rescinding that order? Yes, I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available I got a call from a man about an hour ago who told me that he had my daughter, and if I ever wanted to see her alive, I'd have to follow his instructions.
not_available Did he give you proof he had her? 
not_available I talked to her.
not_available She sounded so scared.
not_available Did you tell anybody else about this? I couldn't.
not_available He said that if I did, he would know.
not_available We have a deal.
not_available I'll do everything I can to get your daughter back, but No, I told you before.
not_available I can't tell you anything until I have Amy back.
not_available You called David with this information.
not_available Why him? I knew him.
not_available He and the first lady were friends.
not_available He was truly a wonderful man.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, he was.
not_available I still can't accept talking about him in the past tense.
not_available Itjust I just can't believe he's gone.
not_available I told him this information because I trusted him.
not_available I never thought for a moment that it would endanger him.
not_available I have your brother's blood on my hands and I will never forgive myself.
not_available Evelyn you did nothing wrong.
not_available It's them.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Jack, the call's coming through.
not_available Patch me in.
not_available Are you ready for this? 
not_available Hello.
not_available What took you so long to answer, Evelyn? I was passing through security.
not_available I just left.
not_available Are you alone? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Why was Wayne Palmer at the retreat? 
not_available Wayne Palmer? Please don't waste my time.
not_available He was there for a reason.
not_available It wasn't to drop off his rÃ©sumÃ©.
not_available I think he was there to speak with you.
not_available I didn't even know he was there.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available 
not_available I didn't see him.
not_available If you're lying to me, it is your daughter who will suffer.
not_available I'm telling you the truth.
not_available Please, you have to believe me.
not_available Did you bring what we discussed? Yes.
not_available Please, let me talk to Amy.
not_available Very well.
not_available All right, sweetheart.
not_available This is your mommy.
not_available Say hello.
not_available Mommy? 
not_available It's me, honey.
not_available Are you OK? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Are you coming to get me now? Mommy's gonna be there real soon.
not_available I want you to keep being brave, OK? You promise me? 
not_available I promise.
not_available I love you, my baby.
not_available I love you too.
not_available OK, that's enough, sweetheart.
not_available Very good.
not_available Now take down this address.
not_available 4615 Tarpin Street.
not_available Got it? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I've got it.
not_available 
not_available Hello.
not_available Audrey, it's Jack.
not_available I just got off the call.
not_available It was Henderson.
not_available Have you got Chloe back online? Audrey? 
not_available Sorry, Jack.
not_available Yes, Chloe's still here.
not_available I'll give you the address for the satellite.
not_available All right.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available All right.
not_available Give me a few minutes.
not_available Chloe, come with me.
not_available Don't talk to me.
not_available It's for Jack.
not_available Jack? Chloe, Jack needs your help.
not_available Please.
not_available Fine.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available I had to keep Karen from replacing you.
not_available That's why I signed.
not_available I didn't have a choice.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You're the only one Jack and I trust here.
not_available Jack needs one of the satellites retasked.
not_available Why? 
not_available Here's the address.
not_available We need a full sweep.
not_available I'm gonna need an explanation.
not_available I will give you one, but we need to hurry.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available Wayne.
not_available Jack.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available Good to see you too.
not_available Evelyn, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I promise you we're gonna get your daughter back.
not_available But right now I need to know what you know.
not_available I already told them I wouldn't give up any information until I have my daughter.
not_available Fine.
not_available Excuse me for one second.
not_available Audrey Raines.
not_available 
not_available Let me speak to Chloe.
not_available OK, Jack.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You're on speaker.
not_available Jack, Audrey told me.
not_available I can't believe the vice president's involved.
not_available 
not_available I know.
not_available Where are we with the satellite? It's coming up now.
not_available I'm sending the image to your PDA.
not_available There are men all over the place.
not_available How many? 
not_available I'm counting ten.
not_available OK, I want you to keep the satellite on target and download real
not_available time images to my PDA.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack.
not_available I'll go with Evelyn to make the exchange.
not_available Find somewhere safe and stay there until this is over.
not_available I'm going with you.
not_available I can't allow that.
not_available This will be dangerous.
not_available I was a marine, Jack.
not_available I know that, Wayne.
not_available And you never saw combat.
not_available There is a big difference between training to kill someone and actually having to do it.
not_available I can't put you in harm's way, out of respect to your brother.
not_available Your family needs you now.
not_available These are the people who killed my brother, Jack.
not_available They shot a bullet right through his neck, and then he died in my arms.
not_available Put yourself in my position.
not_available Could you just walk away? No.
not_available Neither can I.
not_available I'm coming with you, Jack.
not_available Thank you for your support, Mr Prime Minister.
not_available Give my regards to your lovely wife.
not_available We'll talk soon.
not_available It'll take me a day to return these calls.
not_available That's wonderful, Mr President.
not_available World leaders, prominent Americans 
not_available they're all lining up to offer their congratulations.
not_available Sir, were you aware that Wayne Palmer was on the premises? He was? Yes, I just spoke with him a half
not_available hour ago.
not_available He just left.
not_available You didn't speak with him? No.
not_available What was he doing here? He said he had a memento from President Palmer to give to Aaron Pierce 
not_available a medal.
not_available That explains it.
not_available David and Aaron were very close.
not_available I'm just surprised he didn't want to speak with you.
not_available It's no secret that his brother and I had our share of disagreements over the years.
not_available It's possible Wayne harbours ill feelings towards me.
not_available That must be the reason.
not_available Are you clear on the plan? 
not_available I don't think I can do this.
not_available Do you want to see your little girl again? These men didn't hesitate to kill Palmer and won't hesitate to kill you and your daughter.
not_available Right now I am your last chance.
not_available We have to stick to the plan.
not_available Do you understand me? Once you have your daughter in your arms 
not_available I know what to do.
not_available We are going to get her back.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Call out, "Testing, one, two, three.
not_available " 
not_available Testing, one, two, three.
not_available Chloe, did you get that? You're coming through.
not_available I'm refreshing your screen.
not_available OK, we're at the southeast corner entrance.
not_available There's a tunnel through that door that leads to a conveyor belt to the middle of the plant.
not_available Be careful.
not_available There's a hostile at the exit.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Draw your weapon.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Bravo, check, have you got a visual on the mark? Negative, sir.
not_available All units holding.
not_available Copy.
not_available This way.
not_available Let's go.
not_available There's too many of them.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available I need you to take out a guard so I can climb this structure and take out the sniper.
not_available It's about 100 yards north of here on the other side.
not_available Can you do that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can do it.
not_available Wait! One of them's moving.
not_available Go.
not_available Mr Palmer, can you hear me? 
not_available Copy.
not_available I'm south of the lower belt, moving west.
not_available Continue to the end.
not_available Your target's north.
not_available Jack, it's all clear.
not_available This is Bravo.
not_available I think I hear a car.
not_available Vehicle headed north.
not_available Single occupant, female.
not_available Over.
not_available Bravo, what have you got? I repeat, Bravo, what have you got? Bravo, come in.
not_available Woman is alone in the car.
not_available Say again.
not_available I didn't get that.
not_available I repeat, woman is alone in the car.
not_available Copy.
not_available We've taken out four men.
not_available Evelyn is in position.
not_available Wayne, I want you to wait for my signal.
not_available Copy.
not_available We need Henderson alive.
not_available Do not shoot to kill.
not_available 
not_available Yes.
not_available Open all the doors and the trunk of the car.
not_available Very good, Evelyn.
not_available Now go to the front of the car and drop the keys on the ground.
not_available I have the evidence with me.
not_available I want my daughter.
not_available Bravo, hold your position.
not_available I'm coming out.
not_available I have a visual on Henderson and the girl.
not_available OK, Evelyn.
not_available Give me the evidence.
not_available I'll give you the evidence once you give me Amy.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let her go.
not_available OK, honey.
not_available Go see Mommy.
not_available Mommy! 
not_available She's moving.
not_available Give me the evidence, Evelyn.
not_available Get down.
not_available Get down.
not_available Bravo, check, come in.
not_available Bravo.
not_available Come in, Bravo.
not_available Wayne, I didn't get him.
not_available If you've got a shot, take it.
not_available Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car.
not_available Do you have him on satellite? We saw, but he's leaving the grid.
not_available We're scanning the plant, not the neighbourhood.
not_available Well, then reprogram it.
not_available We can't lose him.
not_available Is she all right? 
not_available Evelyn's been hit.
not_available The bullet passed through.
not_available It hasn't hit an artery.
not_available It's not serious, but it needs to be dressed.
not_available You got your daughter, now tell me what I need to know.
not_available Who is behind this? Is it the vice president? Evelyn, is it the vice president? 
not_available He has nothing to do with this.
not_available You promised me you would control this.
not_available I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.
not_available He outmanoeuvred me.
not_available Sir, Bauer and Palmer won't be around long enough to tell anybody else what they know.
not_available I'm putting together another team.
not_available I will handle this, sir, I promise you.
not_available I will not let you down.
not_available See that you don't.
