
not_available TANNER: Get to cover now, sir! Sir, move, move! No! No! DAVIES: In the light of this morning's unfortunate events, President Heller would like to offer some words.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen What are you going to do about today's incident? I wish there were words that could explain what happened There are words! It was murder! You can't control your soldiers or your weapons! Yates designed an override device that can take control of as many as 10 U.S.
not_available drones.
not_available That device is now in the hands of a known terrorist.
not_available The new drones carry six Hellfire missiles.
not_available You have any idea what that could do to a city like London? Looks like Interpol has a facial rec match.
not_available We got her.
not_available Simone Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Multiple EU warrants on terrorism
not_available related charges.
not_available Is she related to Margot Al
not_available Harazi? Yes.
not_available Why? Because she was responsible for an attack on a military housing complex in Iraq.
not_available Most of the victims were women and children.
not_available Well, Simone is her daughter.
not_available It's no small thing to kill a man.
not_available To see the Hie go out of him.
not_available I didn't think I could do it.
not_available But I did.
not_available And so will you.
not_available Because what we're doing is necessary and just.
not_available MARGOT: We are fighting a war, Naveed.
not_available All that matters is winning.
not_available The drone pilot's name is Tanner.
not_available It's all over the news.
not_available CHELL: Tanner's about to arrive at the U.S.
not_available embassy in London, where the handover will lake place.
not_available I'm gonna need you to build me an identity, high
not_available level clearance.
not_available Enter it into the visitors log at the embassy.
not_available How quickly can you get that done? The ID's not working.
not_available Get out, Jack.
not_available Get out of there now.
not_available JACK: I can't.
not_available I have to get into the embassy.
not_available Chloe, I'm inside the embassy.
not_available How? What's going on? JACK: I created a diversion.
not_available Bit of an understatement.
not_available We've got a problem.
not_available Agent Morgan and her partner saw me outside.
not_available How did they manage to do that? I'm not sure.
not_available She's good.
not_available I got to get in and out of here with the flight key as quickly as possible.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Where am I going? They're keeping Tanner on the second floor, east wing, room 217.
not_available You're gonna need an access pass.
not_available I got one.
not_available This wouldn't have happened if Chell didn't screw up his ID at the gate.
not_available You wanted this to happen, didn't you? And who brought him in here? I just want him out.
not_available People are gonna die.
not_available Is that what you want? And who would be responsible for that? Hmm? I put this group together, at some risk to life and liberty, all of us here, to expose governments, not to assist them with the crises they've created by putting drones in the skies.
not_available Get out of my sight.
not_available How will you get Jack out of there? I'm in the embassy security camera system.
not_available I've got a building schematic.
not_available I'm gonna talk him out.
not_available The building is full of U.S.
not_available Marines.
not_available I didn't say it was gonna be easy.
not_available But I'm gonna do everything I can.
not_available I owe Jack.
not_available I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for him.
not_available Then we have that in common.
not_available Your friend is lucky we still might need his help.
not_available Adrian was just doing what he thought was right.
not_available Right for who? MAN OVER PA: All Marines, we need all hands to cover the embassy.
not_available Heads up.
not_available Captain Cordero, Agents Ritter and Morgan.
not_available We're in pursuit of a dangerous fugitive who escaped CIA custody earlier today, Jack Bauer, and he's somewhere in this embassy.
not_available Well, my priority right now is to secure this building.
not_available CIA business will have to wait.
not_available Captain, Bauer's the reason that all of this happened.
not_available He shot two protesters to incite the crowd and cover his entrance into the embassy.
not_available You're sure about that? We saw him do it.
not_available We have reason to believe that he's here for Lieutenant Tanner, the drone pilot, and we need to get to him right now, or God knows what he's gonna do in there.
not_available With me.
not_available Lopez, Osborne, your men, let's go.
not_available MARINE: Yes, sir.
not_available CORDERO: Find out what holding room Tanner is in, call the officer guarding him.
not_available Patch me in.
not_available Lieutenant Tanner? Yeah.
not_available Can I help you? Sir.
not_available Diplomatic security.
not_available I have orders to move you and Lieutenant Tanner.
not_available I wasn't informed about this.
not_available Security's just been breached.
not_available We have protesters in the building.
not_available Sir, if you don't follow me now, I cannot guarantee the safety of you or the prisoner.
not_available You stay rig ht there.
not_available Don't be afraid.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I know your drone was hijacked.
not_available You know I'm innocent? Yes, I do.
not_available The technology that was used to control your drone is gonna be used in a massive terrorist attack against civilians later today.
not_available The only way that I can stop that attack from happening is from the data from your flight key.
not_available Lieutenant, please, where are they holding it? Wait, how do I know whether or not to believe you? Son, right now, the point is that I believe you.
not_available From everything that I can see, no one else does.
not_available You want your name cleared? I'm your only shot.
not_available It's on Captain Denovo.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jack, Agent Morgan and her partner, they're headed your way with Marine back
not_available up, JACK: Got the flight key.
not_available CHLOE: Get out of there, Jack.
not_available They're on your floor.
not_available Thank you, Lieutenant.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Chloe, get me out of here.
not_available The end of the hallway, take a left.
not_available That should lead you to a rear stairwell.
not_available Let's get a medic up here right away.
not_available This is Captain Cordero.
not_available Get me a keypad override on 217.
not_available Casualty down.
not_available Room is clear.
not_available Ah, he's gone.
not_available Bauer was here.
not_available All right, what did he do and what did he take? I have nothing to say to you.
not_available He took Tanner's flight key.
not_available And he was wearing an embassy security jacket, and he has a pass.
not_available Prepare to move.
not_available I want an override on all security passes.
not_available Lock down every door and keypad now.
not_available CHLOE: Go all the way down to the basement, Jack.
not_available A door leads to the storage area.
not_available From there, you'll have access to the street level.
not_available JACK: I got it.
not_available Okay, I'm there.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Everything's locked down.
not_available The key's useless.
not_available Find me another way out.
not_available Jack, I don't see another way.
not_available They've got more Marines joining the search for you.
not_available They're everywhere.
not_available Hold on, hold on.
not_available Every U.S.
not_available embassy has its own shielded communication room.
not_available I can use their system to upload the data from the flight key.
not_available That's not gonna help you get out of the embassy, Jack.
not_available I know.
not_available Just find me the comms room.
not_available Okay, but I don't think you understand.
not_available You're not getting out of there.
not_available It's over.
not_available They're gonna put you in prison.
not_available Jack! Yates's override device is officially interfaced with our system.
not_available All we need to do now is get its software talking to ours.
not_available Oh, how long? Well, I need to check each of the How long? Naveed will be able to take control and pilot the drones in less than an hour.
not_available I missed you.
not_available But it kept me sane knowing that when all this is over, we'll have time for everything we've put on hold.
not_available Travel, have a family.
not_available Sounds wonderful, but it doesn't change how I feel.
not_available You have doubts.
not_available I understand.
not_available But you don't have a choice.
not_available Do you realize what my mother will do to you if you refuse? I'm not gonna give her the chance.
not_available What are you talking about? Leaving.
not_available You and I, together.
not_available You can't be serious.
not_available Even if I agreed, it's impossible.
not_available My mother's people watch who comes and goes.
not_available We wouldn't get past the front door.
not_available Yasir makes a supply run every other day between 5:00 and 5:30.
not_available He's due for one later.
not_available No one watches the back gate while he's gone.
not_available But that gate is locked.
not_available I have keys.
not_available And a car parked down the road.
not_available You've made up your mind.
not_available You've planned this.
not_available I could have left a week ago, but I waited for you.
not_available Naveed, I love you, so, please, please just go through with this and then we can leave, and we never have to be a part of my mother's plans again.
not_available You believe she'll let you go? Ever? I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
not_available But I'm leaving today, as soon as Yasir goes on his run.
not_available You're putting me in a terrible position.
not_available I know, and I'm sorry.
not_available But you need to make a choice.
not_available Your mother or me.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll come.
not_available You okay? Yeah? Mmm.
not_available We got a flash that the embassy's on lockdown.
not_available What's going on there? Bauer's here.
not_available He shot two protesters and forced his way inside the embassy and he got to Tanner.
not_available So they are working together.
not_available I'm not sure if that makes sense anymore.
not_available He didn't try to release Tanner when he had the chance.
not_available He just took his flight key.
not_available Level two clear.
not_available We're moving down.
not_available So Bauer wanted the flight data to Tanner's drone.
not_available Why? We're gonna ask Bauer when we get to him, but right now he's still somewhere inside the embassy and we're going floor by floor.
not_available All right, keep me posted.
not_available There's a fire door on your left.
not_available Comm room is coming up on your right.
not_available Got 'em.
not_available Don't turn around.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Get inside.
not_available Everybody on their feet now! Now! Move slowly towards the corner.
not_available Sit on the ground and don't move.
not_available Chloe, I'm inside.
not_available You need a terminal with a USB port.
not_available I got it.
not_available Plugging in the flight key now.
not_available Okay, go to a command line, open a T
not_available net window.
not_available I'll give you a secure IP address.
not_available JACK: Hold on.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's 2.718.281.828.
not_available Done.
not_available How close are the Marines? Really close, Jack.
not_available Chloe, no matter what happens to me, you get this evidence to President Heller, okay? Okay.
not_available Give me your word.
not_available You have my word, Jack.
not_available What the hell was that? I don't know.
not_available The data on the flight key is encrypted.
not_available It needs to be unlocked from his end before it can be transmitted.
not_available JACK: What do we need to do then? Well We could send you a software program that will decrypt it and then upload it to us.
not_available You should be receiving that now.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available How long is this gonna take? I've no idea.
not_available It depends on the level of encryption they've used.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Jack, they're in the corridor, right outside.
not_available You have to buy more time.
not_available Which direction are they coming from? Rounding the corner on your left.
not_available Can you see if the Marines are wearing body armor? CHLOE: Looks like it to me.
not_available You, in the black jacket, what's your name? Jenny.
not_available Jenny, slowly come towards me.
not_available I need you to open the door on my command.
not_available It's all right, Jenny, you're doing great.
not_available Just put in the code.
not_available Chloe, where are they? They're on you, Jack.
not_available Open the door now.
not_available Cup of tea? Yes, please.
not_available You're trying to find the right words to tell me something.
not_available A problem.
not_available It's that obvious? It's Naveed, isn't it? He says he can't go through with it, pilot the drones.
not_available He has a plan to leave, and I've said I'll go with him.
not_available Just to give us time to work out what to do.
not_available Please don't hurt him.
not_available And do you think a stern talking
not_available to will get him to change his mind? No, but But what? I love him.
not_available And he's very lucky that is the case.
not_available This family has worked too hard for too long to let anything or anyone get in its way.
not_available Naveed may be your husband, but you must understand, I will do whatever's necessary to get him to pilot those drones.
not_available I wish there were words that could bring back the fathers and husbands lost today on both our sides.
not_available My hope is that you will hear me out, so that we might find a way to move forward together.
not_available Moving forward together begins with an understanding of the threat that we face, a determined enemy sworn to destroy our way of life.
not_available Thousands of our citizens killed in attacks against our cities and our infrastructure.
not_available Thousands killed on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq.
not_available But we can prevail.
not_available This is Mark Boudreau.
not_available Sir, this is Head of Station Navarro calling to give you an update on the Bauer situation.
not_available Have you apprehended him? Not exactly, sir.
not_available Bauer has barricaded himself inside the communications room at the American embassy.
not_available And He's taken hostages.
not_available What? Why? We're still trying to get a complete picture, but you gave me specific instructions to keep Bauer's presence here in London a secret.
not_available And I just wanted to give you advanced warning that that will no longer be possible, obviously.
not_available Agent Navarro, we'll talk about my disappointment with your performance later.
not_available But now, tell me, have the Marines taken control of the situation? Yes, sir, they have.
not_available And I assume it's only a matter of time before they send this up the chain of command to the President.
not_available The President needs to hear it from me.
not_available I need to know what you know.
not_available Okay, the decryption program is up and running, but slowly.
not_available I can see that.
not_available Hang on a second, Jack.
not_available You wrote this.
not_available Can you speed it up? No, trouble's on his end.
not_available Look.
not_available The terminal he's using only has a single
not_available core processor.
not_available Really? Or are you just saying that to screw over Jack again? How do I know you're telling the truth? I'm doing this for you, not for him.
not_available Jack, there's nothing we can do.
not_available At this rate, it'll take 20 to 30 minutes to get the data unlocked and transmitted to us.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Who am I talking to? My name is Captain Kevin Cordero.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I'm sure we'd both like to find a way to end this situation without loss of life, yours or the hostages.
not_available I'd like us to work together Captain, the situation is simple.
not_available I have three hostages.
not_available Keep your men back and no one gets harmed.
not_available Make a move on this room, and I kill all three of them.
not_available Are we clear? Loud and clear.
not_available We go in, I'm not giving that son cf a bitch a chance to fire on my men again.
not_available I need them to take me seriously.
not_available I have no intention of hurting any of you.
not_available I understand how difficult this is.
not_available Please, just try and stay calm.
not_available Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available We didn't get to introduce ourselves earlier.
not_available I'm Agent Ritter, CIA.
not_available This is Agent Morgan.
not_available Look, we're not here to prove any kind of case against you, Lieutenant.
not_available We just want to talk to you about Bauer.
not_available ERIK: And speaking of Bauer, you should know that right now, he's three levels below us, completely surrounded by Marines.
not_available So any help you were expecting from him, don't.
not_available Talk to us, Lieutenant.
not_available What's the point? No one but Bauer's believed a word I've said all day.
not_available What is your relationship with Bauer? I just met him today.
not_available You expect us to believe that? Look, if you didn't know Bauer before this, then, uh, why did he go to so much trouble to find you? He said he knew I didn't kill all those soldiers, that my drone was hijacked, and someone was gonna use the same technology to launch a full
not_available scale attack.
not_available So why did he need your flight key? He said it could help him prove what happened.
not_available And stop the attack.
not_available Okay, thank you, Lieutenant.
not_available We should've pushed him harder.
not_available I think he told us everything he knows.
not_available Which wasn't much.
not_available But you did You're buying that story? Look, when Bauer cornered me in the tower block, he said that he was in London to stop an attack on President Heller.
not_available Meaning what? You believe what he told Tanner? Even though there's not a single piece of evidence to support it? That's not what I'm saying.
not_available What I'm saying is that if there's even a chance that there's gonna be some kind of an attack, then we need to know about it.
not_available We have to talk to Bauer.
not_available I would like to thank you, on behalf of myself and my country, for this opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation for the special relationship that binds our two great nations together.
not_available God bless the United Kingdom.
not_available And God bless the United States of America.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You hear that? You were fantastic.
not_available Or they're extremely polite.
not_available It was perfect Can I talk to you privately? Thank you.
not_available What's going on? There's a situation at the embassy, sir.
not_available Protesters broke through the gates about a half an hour ago.
not_available The Marines have reestablished a perimeter, but it's turned into a hostage situation.
not_available Hostages? Who's taken hostages? Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack? MARK: He fired into the crowd of protesters, shot two Marines, and is threatening to kill the embassy employees he's holding.
not_available Why in God's name would Jack do this? All I know is, the CIA picked him up several hours ago on an operation, but he escaped custody.
not_available What Is that when you found out about this? It was.
not_available The fear was that he was in London for your visit.
not_available I was in the process of gathering all the facts together for you when he resurfaced at the embassy.
not_available What's the situation on the ground right now? MARK: According to General Cobum, the assault team is ready to go in.
not_available They're just waiting for your go
not_available ahead.
not_available So they can kill him.
not_available That's what you're saying? MARK: it's not a fait accompli.
not_available I'm not making any decisions till I talk to him.
not_available To Bauer, sir? I I'm not sure that Yeah.
not_available Make it happen, Mark.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I checked without being obvious.
not_available Yasir's going on his run, we're good to go.
not_available You told her.
not_available It wasn't easy for her.
not_available My daughter loves you very much.
not_available Trying to back out is a stain on your honor, Naveed.
not_available I will give you one chance to rectify that Tell me you'll pilot the drones.
not_available I won't murder innocents.
not_available There are no innocents.
not_available Not when they elect murderers and collaborators like Heller and Davies to lead them.
not_available That's nonsense.
not_available And it's time someone here stood up and said it.
not_available This is wrong.
not_available And if Simone ever got free of you, she'd see that, too.
not_available This isn't conscience.
not_available This is cowardice.
not_available If my husband were alive, he'd be sickened by you.
not_available Everything he sacrificed, everything he stood for.
not_available You will pilot the drones.
not_available I will not.
not_available No matter what you do to me.
not_available I swear.
not_available I believe you.
not_available Simone.
not_available Mum? Come here, please.
not_available Her left hand.
not_available No.
not_available No! MARGOT: Her left hand! SIMONE: What are you doing? Whatever's necessary, my love.
not_available SIMONE: No! Do it.
not_available No! Stop this! MARGOT: Only you can do that, Naveed.
not_available Again.
not_available Okay, all right! All right, just stop.
not_available Stop.
not_available SIMONE: No, no, please! NAVEED: Please.
not_available You'll do what's necessary? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, just stop hurting her, please.
not_available Please.
not_available Captain Cordero, we just need to talk to Bauer.
not_available Not when he's that unstable.
not_available We don't know what could set him off.
not_available Lives are at stake here.
not_available If what Bauer told Lieutenant Tanner is true, then many more lives will be at stake.
not_available We just need to know if there's any truth to it.
not_available I'm not introducing any other variables into this equation.
not_available This conversation is over.
not_available All right, this ceiling vent here gives us direct access, but the problem there is we have to drop men down into the room one at a time.
not_available We go in, we go in in numbers, understood? SOLDIER: Yes, sir.
not_available Look, I know you don't want to hear this, but he's probably right.
not_available Bauer shot those two Marines square in the middle of their vests, where he knew the rounds wouldn't penetrate.
not_available That's what I call someone in control.
not_available What are you doing? Going over Corderdo's head.
not_available Jordan, you with Navarro? Sir.
not_available Putting you on speaker.
not_available It's Kate.
not_available Were you able to debrief Tanner? Yeah, we did, and Bauer told Tanner that he has intel about an imminent attack using our own drones, but The Marine captain here in charge is refusing to let us talk to Bauer so we can get a confirmation on this.
not_available It's a military operation, I can't overrule him.
not_available But you know people who can.
not_available You've been speaking with the President's Chief of Staff.
not_available Who isn't very happy with us right now for losing Bauer in the first place.
not_available Sir, the President needs to know about Bauer's claims.
not_available Bauer will get his chance to address the President directly.
not_available What? President Heller will be reaching out to Bauer personally at any moment to see if he can get him to surrender.
not_available Well, can you patch us in to the call? I'll have Jordan tie you and Erik in.
not_available Is it possible that Bauer really is trying to stop an attack? You're talking about the man who practically laid waste to my station this morning.
not_available Just thinking If we'd listened to what Kate said before, we wouldn't have lost Bauer in the first place.
not_available What are you saying? That it doesn't pay to dismiss what she says.
not_available I'm not dismissing her.
not_available I'm remaining objective.
not_available Which is something you're not doing, for obvious reasons.
not_available I'm not blind, Jordan.
not_available You're letting your feelings for her cloud your judgment.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Kate's not infallible.
not_available Remember how wrong she was about her husband.
not_available Some mistakes you just can't recover from.
not_available The call from the President's coming through.
not_available Captain, I thought we had an understanding.
not_available Jack? It's me.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available To be honest with you, Jack, I never thought I'd have to hear your voice again.
not_available I liked it that way.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm told you just shot two people out in front of the embassy.
not_available I barely grazed them, sir.
not_available How do you know that? Because I pulled the trigger.
not_available And now you're holding hostages.
not_available JORDAN: Kate.
not_available Are you and Erik getting this? Yeah.
not_available I'm sure you know that there's some decisions to be made here, but before we do that, I would like to see if you and I could resolve this.
not_available So tell me, why are you here and what do you want? Mr.
not_available President' I'm here because I believe the U.S.
not_available drone fleet is vulnerable and will be used in a terrorist attack later today.
not_available Explain that, Jack.
not_available A hacker by the name of Derrick Yates created an override device which can take control of as many as 10 U.S.
not_available drones.
not_available I believe he was the one who hijacked Lieutenant Tanner's drone and used it as a test flight to prove to his buyers that the device worked.
not_available Shortly after that I found him murdered.
not_available Now I believe that the device is in the hands of Margot Al
not_available Harazi, a known terrorist.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I promise you, she will use this device without mercy.
not_available What are you doing in that room, Jack? Uploading data from Lieutenant Tanner's flight key.
not_available I'm working with people who believe they can use this data to prove that the device exists.
not_available Our plan was, as soon as we had the evidence, I would turn myself in and present it to you.
not_available Who are these people you're working with? Mr.
not_available President, I can't say.
not_available Sir, I need 15 minutes.
not_available Fifteen minutes and I can get you the evidence you need.
not_available And I promise I will hand myself over without incident.
not_available Why didn't you come to me first, Jack? With all due respect, Mr.
not_available President, it was your State Department that labeled me a terrorist and made me a wanted man, a man who was never even offered an opportunity to tell his side of the story.
not_available Which, by the way, sir, I felt I had earned.
not_available So, no, I did not feel comfortable going to talk to your people.
not_available I knew that I had to either arrive with the device or evidence that the device existed.
not_available That would be the only way they would believe me.
not_available The only way you would believe me.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available Stay by this phone.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Sir.
not_available Whatever differences we had, I never lied to you.
not_available I always told you the truth.
not_available I'm telling you the truth now, and I suggest you believe it.
not_available I hear you, Jack.
not_available Chloe, did you gel that? We don't have much time.
not_available Could he be right? Could this Lieutenant Tanner's drone have been hijacked? We analyzed the data on Tanner's flight key, and found no evidence of that.
not_available And, frankly, the drone network was designed to avoid exactly that scenario.
not_available Well, nothing's impossible.
not_available I mean, the real question is, why would Jack make this up? To cover up what he's really doing.
not_available Earlier today, he broke a former associate out of CIA custody.
not_available Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Chloe? She's a member of Adrian Cross's group, Open Cell, who liberated 30,000 secret government documents, endangering the lives of agents on the ground.
not_available They are Jack's people.
not_available The terrorist threat is a cover to buy him time lo upload data to Open Cell.
not_available He asked for only 15 minutes? Every second we hesitate could cost lives.
not_available Why don't we just kill the upload? We can't, sir.
not_available He's in a secure comms room.
not_available It's why he chose it.
not_available And what if Jack is telling the truth on this attack? Are you willing to take that risk? Or risk even more damage from Open Cell? He's a designated terrorist.
not_available We don't negotiate with terrorists.
not_available With all due respect, sir, this is a clear call.
not_available Maybe a clear call for you, Mark.
not_available Not so for Audrey and I.
not_available We know Jack Bauer.
not_available You don't.
not_available You're right.
not_available All I've ever seen is the damage he leaves in his wake.
not_available Let's not forget the killing spree that he went on four years ago, when he nearly assassinated the Russian president And then he fled the country, because he didn't want to spend the rest of his life in jail.
not_available This is not the same man you once knew.
not_available Tell the Marines to go in when they're ready.
not_available CHLOE: I need to show you something.
not_available These drone attacks are from a few years ago.
not_available The latest drones carry even more powerful missiles.
not_available You hardly need to convince me that governments shouldn't be killing civilians by remote control.
not_available Imagine this happening here in London when Margot Al
not_available Harazi gets control of 10 drones.
not_available Think of the people that will die.
not_available I'm not really seeing your point.
not_available lam trying to help.
not_available My point is that the Marines think that Jack is a threat.
not_available They're going to kill him, along with any chance we have of stopping this.
not_available So if you can think of a better way to convince the government that Jack is telling the truth, then tell me now.
not_available Please.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Me, too.
not_available What is it with you and Bauer? Why can't you just let him go? Bauer's already shot two Marines, so this is a hair
not_available trigger situation.
not_available You even get a sense that he is a threat, and I will back up whatever decision you have to make in there.
not_available Understood? ALL: Yes, sir.
not_available The instant you get a shot, take Bauer out.
not_available Clear? What Bauer told the President today explains everything that he's done.
not_available Going after Yates and the flight key.
not_available Why did he break Chloe O'Brian out? He said Yates was a hacker.
not_available Maybe she knew him.
not_available Margot Al
not_available Harazi's details check out.
not_available Shes believed to be hiding somewhere in England.
not_available Her husband was killed in a drone attack.
not_available The Marines are looking for any excuse to take Bauer down, and if that happens, we're gonna lose our best chance at stopping this attack.
not_available Kate, we'll do an all
not_available agency sync on what we know about Margot.
not_available Last knowns, everything, just in case she does make some kind of move.
not_available But that's all we can do right now.
not_available The President has spoken.
not_available Understood? Yes.
not_available Come here.
not_available Captain Cordero said there was a ceiling vent that drops right down into the comms room, and I'm pretty sure this is the entrance.
not_available ERIK: Yeah? You have to cover me.
not_available I'm gonna go in.
not_available You do that, and Bauer will put a bullet in you.
not_available Maybe, but I don't believe that he actually wants to kill anybody.
not_available I'm just gonna try and get him to surrender.
not_available Oh, he wouldn't come out for the President, but he'll come out for you? Look, if I can convince him that I am on his side Kate.
not_available Kate, don't It's my risk to take.
not_available Sweetheart, you're angry, and I understand.
not_available You have a history with Bauer.
not_available Don't patronize me, Mark.
not_available All I did was argue the facts in there.
not_available Yeah, because of your personal agenda.
not_available I'm not the one who's letting their personal feelings get in the way.
not_available Oh, really? Then why didn't you tell me that Jack was in London when you first found out? Like I said, I was gathering the facts.
not_available I don't believe that I am telling you that this is the wrong call.
not_available Jack is telling the truth, and that's based on me knowing him better than anyone else in that room.
not_available That is my measured opinion.
not_available And God help us if I'm right.
not_available CHLOE: No, no, no.
not_available No.
not_available Jack, they're cutting the cameras.
not_available I can hear them getting ready.
not_available Heller must have given the order.
not_available You need to surrender.
not_available This is your only chance.
not_available No.
not_available Then all of this would have been for nothing.
not_available I'm gonna hold them off as long as I can.
not_available Till the transmission goes through.
not_available CHLOE: Jack, they're gonna kill you.
not_available Give yourself up.
not_available Jack! When they blow the door' it's going to sound like hell.
not_available Just stay down and keep still.
not_available You'll be safe.
not_available I promise.
not_available Cover your ears and keep your heads down.
not_available Sir? We're picking up another heat signature approaching the room.
not_available Show me.
not_available It's Agent Morgan.
not_available She's trying to get Bauer to turn himself in.
not_available Give her that chance.
not_available I have my orders, Agent.
not_available I'm executing them.
not_available Yeah, shoot first, ask questions later? Get him out of my sight.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Shot fired.
not_available Repeat, shot fired.
not_available SOLDIER: Sir! How long? Sixty seconds.
not_available Bauer, it's Agent Morgan! Hold your fire! I'm unarmed.
not_available Back off! I heard your call with the President.
not_available He may not have believed you, but I do.
not_available I'm going to come down into the room now.
not_available I repeat, lam unarmed.
not_available I can get you out of here alive.
not_available That's not the priority.
not_available I know, the flight key is.
not_available How much more time do you have left on the upload? Less than five minutes.
not_available You don't have that much time! Those Marines are gonna come through that door, and they're gonna kill you.
not_available But you do have another option.
not_available You can give me the flight key, and I can finish the upload for you and get it out of here.
not_available Why the hell should I trust you? Because I really do believe you.
not_available And 'cause you don't have another play.
not_available Listen to her, Jack.
not_available Ready, sir.
not_available On three, two, one.
not_available Go.
not_available Do not fire! Do not fire! I have Bauer in my custody! This is my prisoner.
not_available Back off! This is a CIA matter now.
not_available He's in our custody.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Erik, I need your cuffs.
not_available Get Navarro on the phone, and tell him to get us out of here.
not_available Shut down everything, all transmissions! Secure the hostages! MARINE: It's all right.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Get him to a medic out there.
not_available I said back off! Back off.
not_available NEWSREADER: This will be President Heller's first address to Parliament and the first foreign head of state to address a joint session since the Canadian Prime Minister, Jay Gelnick, almost two years ago.
not_available According to Department of Defense records, pilot Christopher Tanner is a 2011 graduate of the United States Air Force We are officially online.
not_available MARGOT: Look at that.
not_available IAN: Filtering for U.S.
not_available drones operating over Europe.
