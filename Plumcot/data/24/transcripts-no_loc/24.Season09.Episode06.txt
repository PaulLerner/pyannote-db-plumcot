
not_available Are you happy? Is he good to you? I know that I should have defended you more when I heard all those things Audrey, no.
not_available Everything they said is true.
not_available I killed those people.
not_available I looked into the protocol of handing Bauer over to the Russians.
not_available Rendition requires the President's direct approval.
not_available So, I went ahead and drafted the executive order, which he needs to sign.
not_available You're a terrible liar, Naveed.
not_available You switched off one of the security buffers so they could find us.
not_available You still need me to pilot the drones.
not_available MARGOT: Ian's a quick learner.
not_available He's been watching you.
not_available Please, Margot, don't do this.
not_available I treated you like a son.
not_available Trusted you with my daughter.
not_available Margot, please.
not_available If you love Simone, you have to know that she wouldn't want you to do this.
not_available Ask her.
not_available Simone? Simone? I think you have your answer.
not_available Two years ago, a missile destroyed a meeting hall in Ghundi Kala.
not_available The U.
not_available S.
not_available claimed they were targeting my husband, who they called a terrorist.
not_available I demand justice from the man responsible for this slaughter, President James Heller.
not_available Unless President Heller surrenders himself to me in three hours at a place of my choosing, thousands of people in London will die in his stead.
not_available We've confirmed that Margot Al
not_available Harazi has six U.S.
not_available drones under her control.
not_available We believe they're headed for London.
not_available So I was right.
not_available What's going on? Possible hit on the Al
not_available Harazi tape.
not_available The back
not_available trace program was being bounced from proxy to proxy, but it suddenly spat out an IP address.
not_available We think we've located Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Our local station chief, Agent Navarro, is personally leading a raid on where we think she's hiding out.
not_available CHLOE: Someone inserted a redirect.
not_available Your team's headed into a trap.
not_available Steve, your team is in danger.
not_available Get out of there right now! Take them.
not_available Steve? Let's go.
not_available MARK: Confirmation from joint base Lower Heyford.
not_available "Satellite confirmed target site explosion "was result of missile strike from Vanguard
not_available class drone." Oh, my God.
not_available It was an ambush! How many agents did we lose? It's too soon to say, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I'm sorry for your losses, but my immediate concern is for London.
not_available Thai drone is still loaded with missiles, and there are five more drones en route.
not_available We have AWACS and fighters in the air, searching.
not_available And naturally, we're going to coordinate with the RAF.
not_available Well, I must insist that our people be given full access to all technical data and codes pertaining to the drone program.
not_available COBURN: Respectfully, Prime Minister, the security protocols for that information are highly sensitive.
not_available Am I to believe you're hiding behind protocols, General? I was assured that the CIA had this matter in hand.
not_available HELLER: General, please.
not_available Provide the Ministry of Defense with all the information that the PM is requesting.
not_available As you say, sir.
not_available And, General, let's start coordinating our efforts with the RAF.
not_available I'm repeating myself.
not_available DAVIES: I have to go and confer with the cabinet.
not_available We have to decide when and how to make this public.
not_available MARK: I'll see you out.
not_available I know the way, thank you.
not_available Is there anything you want me to do? Have the Secret Service bring Jack to my office.
not_available Sir, I've been loath to bring this to your attention.
not_available We have intelligence, unverified, that Heller's being secretly treated by a neurologist.
not_available Possibly for Alzheimer's.
not_available Poor bastard.
not_available Do you mean I'm counting on a man to protect our soil who hasn't got his wits about him? God help us.
not_available Come in.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Jack Bauer's here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You can leave us.
not_available Sit down, Jack.
not_available We were duped into thinking we had the location of Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available When we got there, the assault team was blown up with a missile from one of the drones controlled by Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available So, the drones are in range of London? One of them is.
not_available The others are expected in two or three hours.
not_available This arms dealer that you know, are you sure he can lead us to her actual whereabouts? Mr.
not_available President, I can't be absolutely certain, but I believe he can.
not_available He's done business with her for years.
not_available She trusts him.
not_available And right now, he's the only chance we've got.
not_available Would he be willing to make a deal? No, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Like I told you before, he can't be bought, and we'd never be able to break him in time to stop these attacks from happening.
not_available All right.
not_available NAVARRO: Latest count is four confirmed dead and six wounded.
not_available Agent Ritter's got some burns, but he'll be all right.
not_available I just put out the cover story that it was a gas main explosion, per your orders.
not_available Good.
not_available Sir, I've got President Heller on the line for you.
not_available All right.
not_available Jordan, patch him through.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, this is Steve Navarro.
not_available I have you on the speakerphone with Jack Bauer.
not_available He's got a play to find Margot Al
not_available Harazi, but he needs to operate in the dark.
not_available No surveillance, no tracking of any kind.
not_available Do you understand? I'm not sure I do, sir.
not_available HELLER: You are to give Jack Bauer whatever he needs.
not_available Plus, silence.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available I'm gonna need a car, unmarked, civilian.
not_available A clean phone with a scramble caller, field interrogation kit and a small weapons package.
not_available Fine.
not_available Jordan, you'll take care of that? I'll send them right over.
not_available You have an agent, Kate Morgan.
not_available I want her assigned to me.
not_available NAVARRO: I'm afraid I can't help you there.
not_available Agent Morgan's no longer on roster.
not_available What are you talking about? Why? She'd already been earmarked for transfer back to Langley.
not_available I only had her in the field provisionally.
not_available Well, put her back in the field.
not_available Jack wants her, Jack needs her, Jack gets her.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available I'll get started.
not_available What's wrong? The President just sanctioned a mission for Jack Bauer.
not_available Bauer wants you with him.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What? I don't know details, except we're under orders not to monitor the operation.
not_available And I don't like it, Kate.
not_available Without any surveillance or tracking, we can't provide you with any backup.
not_available Did Navarro okay this? He told me to tell you there's a chopper warming up on the pad to take you where Bauer's waiting.
not_available Right now? That's what he said.
not_available The drone that took out the CIA team has four missiles left.
not_available I'm flying it within cloud cover to minimize the chance of it being visually located.
not_available And the others? They're on their way here now and invisible to radar.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm worried about Simone.
not_available I understand what you had to do with Naveed.
not_available You just shouldn't have done it in front of her.
not_available She had real feelings for him.
not_available I have no reason to doubt your sister's dedication to me or the cause.
not_available She was in love with him.
not_available When you secondguess your sister, you're second
not_available guessing me.
not_available You don't need to watch this.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available FARAH: Naveed, it's your sister.
not_available First you tell me to pack my bags, and then you don't pick up the phone.
not_available I'm worried about you.
not_available Are We still getting out of London? Call me back.
not_available Did you know about this? No.
not_available No.
not_available If Naveed had planned to take his sister out of London, then he must have told her about our operation.
not_available No, no.
not_available We don't know that.
not_available Go to her.
not_available Find out exactly what she knows and if she's told anyone else.
not_available And if she has? Think of what we've sacrificed thus far.
not_available What you have sacrificed.
not_available I trust you to do what needs to be done.
not_available The CIA just delivered this clean phone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm Mark Boudreau.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available I just didn't expect the Chief of Staff to make the delivery.
not_available I understand my wife came to visit you? Just curious.
not_available What happened? Maybe you should ask her.
not_available I'm asking you.
not_available We talked.
not_available When I first met Audrey, she was in pretty bad shape, in large part because of you.
not_available I'm worried what your presence here may do to her.
not_available What do you want from me? Your help.
not_available Stay away from her.
not_available Mr.
not_available Boudreau, if I live through today, which, by the way, is highly unlikely, I'm going straight to prison.
not_available I'm the last thing you need to worry about.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.
not_available Agent Morgan is en route and should be arriving any minute.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I have to go.
not_available She said you were good.
not_available A good man.
not_available And that she's happy.
not_available Hello? Chloe, it's me.
not_available Jack.
not_available I saw you arrested.
not_available Where are you? I don't have time to explain.
not_available Is Belcheck with you? Yeah, he's here.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna need help from both of you.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available How will you explain our military presence on the streets? Surely you can't say it's because a half dozen stealth drones are soon to be over London and under terrorist control.
not_available I have no intention of causing a panic.
not_available The elevated threat levels will be framed as a precautionary measure.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available President Heller is calling for you.
not_available Ah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Well, I hope you have some good news for me.
not_available I may soon enough.
not_available Listen, Alastair, if you're thinking of putting a military presence on the streets, I wish you'd hold off.
not_available And why would I do that? I'm concerned it'll compromise a covert operation we're running to locate Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Yes, with all due respect, you'll understand that after your last operation, I'm going to need more specifics.
not_available Jack Bauer intends to draw out a business associate of Al
not_available Harazi's.
not_available Bauer is a disgraced agent with international warrants out against him.
not_available Why not just move in and pick up this contact ourselves? Jack convinced me the man won't deal and the man won't break.
not_available Bauer needs to go in there and do it himself.
not_available Well, you'll forgive me if I don't have your confidence in Bauer.
not_available Remember, it is my country that will suffer if you're wrong.
not_available Alastair, listen.
not_available Please do not deploy any military for at least an hour.
not_available All right.
not_available But you'll keep me apprised of every development.
not_available I will.
not_available And thank you.
not_available Allowing a man with Jack Bauers record to direct an operation Maybe James is losing his mind after all.
not_available I hope you don't think I'm speaking out of turn, PM, but should you be placing this kind of faith in his judgment? Especially in the light of his condition? Get hold of Woodfeld at MI
not_available 5.
not_available I want to know exactly where Jack Bauer is going and who his contact is.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm clean.
not_available I was given clear instructions not to have any operational surveillance.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available I just wanted to make sure you understood the rules and that you'd follow them.
not_available If you don't trust me, then why request me for this? 'Cause you strike me as someone who can handle pretty much anything that's thrown at you.
not_available Why are they sending you back to the States? Is that relevant? I was married to a man who was convicted of selling state secrets to a foreign government.
not_available Were you implicated? No.
not_available But I didn't catch it when it was happening right under my nose.
not_available Are you familiar with an arms dealer named Karl Rask? Yeah, we've been hunting him for years.
not_available Rask's in London? Yes, he is.
not_available I also know for a fact that he's been working with Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available I think he knows where she is, and he can contact her.
not_available He's not just gonna give you that information.
not_available Of course he's not.
not_available He's loyal to his clients, but he's also greedy.
not_available That's how I'm gonna get him.
not_available You seem to know a lot about Rask.
not_available How? For the last two years, I've been working for him.
not_available Unfortunately for us, I think the second he sees me, he's gonna want to kill me.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I've uploaded everything we have on Karl Rask to your phone.
not_available And the bank account? Set up in your name.
not_available If you can get Rask to log into the account, it will insert a virus into his system.
not_available We should be able to trace any of his interactions with Margot from there.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available So, I went and I saw Jack today before he left.
not_available Apparently, you saw him as well? Yeah.
not_available I was gonna tell you.
not_available I told him I was concerned about him being back, what it would do to you.
not_available Mark, that wasn't necessary.
not_available Well, it was probably more for me than it was for you.
not_available What did Jack say? He said not to worry, that he was gonna be gone soon.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available MAN: Mr, Boudreau, you have a call from the Russian embassy.
not_available It's the Deputy Foreign Minister.
not_available I got to take this.
not_available Okay.
not_available MARK: Deputy Minister.
not_available Mr.
not_available Boudreau, I hope I'm not calling at an inopportune time.
not_available We are aware of the terrorist threat you are contending with.
not_available Please tell President Heller to let us know if we can be of any assistance.
not_available That's very considerate of you.
not_available I'll pass it along.
not_available In the meantime, I'm reviewing the transfer order that the President signed for Jack Bauer.
not_available How soon can we expect to take custody of him? Well, there's been a change in circumstances.
not_available The President has rescinded the rendition order.
not_available You're aware of how strongly my government feels about Bauer being made to face justice.
not_available You cannot just rescind it without explanation.
not_available I understand It would be appreciated for President Heller to explain to Moscow why he is reversing his order.
not_available Well, the President is not available right now, so So when may I tell my superiors to expect a call from him? I'm curious, Mr.
not_available Boudreau.
not_available Is there some reason you are uncomfortable involving President Heller? Of course not.
not_available I'm sure we don't need to make an issue out of this whole thing.
not_available Let's just talk about it and we'll figure something out.
not_available Let's meet privately.
not_available When? I'll get back to you.
not_available Today.
not_available Get back to me today.
not_available Okay, Chloe.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We're on our way.
not_available I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around you working for someone like Rask.
not_available In the last 11 months, two of Rask's clients, significant clients, have been taken down.
not_available A human trafficking ring and an international drug cartel.
not_available I'm using my position in Rask's organization to make sure people like that can't keep doing business.
not_available Why? Who have you been working for? No one.
not_available This time I'm doing it for me.
not_available And Rask wants to kill you.
not_available I disappeared on him when I discovered the threat against President Heller.
not_available So, naturally, he'd think I was the leak.
not_available He'd be right.
not_available Okay.
not_available So what's your plan? Rask had me working with a guy named Nils.
not_available Nils is dead.
not_available I need Rask to believe that Nils was the informant, not me, and that you were his CIA contact.
not_available You want to hand me over to Rask.
not_available It's the only way I know how to make this work.
not_available What do you need me to do? Chloe uploaded evidence onto this phone linking you to the CIA investigation into Rask's operation.
not_available I need to plant it on you and offer you up.
not_available A sign of goodwill.
not_available He's gonna want to interrogate me.
not_available I know.
not_available That's why I want to deliver you unconscious.
not_available If you're unconscious, there's no one to interrogate.
not_available Five cc's of propofol should give me enough time to get everything we need.
not_available And if there's not enough time? I've got a guy on the ground.
not_available He'll be covering you.
not_available But it's not a guarantee.
not_available Look, this is a long shot.
not_available There is a very good chance that we will both end up dead.
not_available If you don't want to do this, I can't force you.
not_available It's a lot to ask.
not_available Just make it count.
not_available Sir, there's something you need to look at.
not_available Files related to Kate's husband.
not_available Can it wait? We're in the middle of an operation.
not_available I think you'll want to see this, sir.
not_available I was doing some routine maintenance sweeps, and I found something weird in our archives.
not_available A partition was removed and some sectors are missing.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available Those partitions are locked.
not_available They can't be deleted.
not_available That's what I thought.
not_available It's possible they transferred sensitive files during Adam's trial.
not_available I'll make some inquiries.
not_available Well, in the meantime, I need authorization to run a Phoenix Retrieval, see if I can bring back any ghost data from the missing files.
not_available You better hold off on that for now.
not_available We've got enough on our plates as it is.
not_available I can run it in background.
not_available Stay focused on Al
not_available Harazi and the drones.
not_available We'll figure out who screwed up and how when we have more time.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Simone.
not_available What are you doing here? I went to your house, and your neighbor told me you were here.
not_available Is Naveed with you? Is there something going on? What do you mean? Naveed left me a scary message.
not_available Telling me to pack my bags, saying he wanted us to leave town with him.
not_available No, your brother's just been stressed.
not_available The deadline for his dissertation's coming up.
not_available I'm actually the one who suggested we spend some time out of London, just to clear our heads.
not_available Why didn't he tell me himself? He asked me to tell you.
not_available He feels really bad.
not_available I'm so sorry if Naveed made it sound serious.
not_available I just wish he would have told me.
not_available I know how important this PhD is to him.
not_available CHILDREN: Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Aunt Simone! Yasmin, you have grown so much.
not_available The doctor said two inches this year.
not_available We have to buy new clothes every month.
not_available There's been a development, sir.
not_available Bauer stopped for a few minutes beneath an overpass near Wandsworth.
not_available We believe that's the CIA agent he was with.
not_available Thermal indicates she's still alive, but he's put her in the boot.
not_available DAVIES: What the devil's he doing? CAROLINE: Looks to me like he's betraying the Americans.
not_available Should we alert them? No.
not_available No, we handle this ourselves.
not_available Assemble a team.
not_available Get out of the car, Jack! Slowly.
not_available Never expected to see your face around here again.
not_available He's clean.
not_available I sent you and Nils to make a payoff weeks ago.
not_available With $200,000 of my money.
not_available Nils is dead.
not_available JACK: I know.
not_available I was the one who killed him.
not_available He was ratting you out.
not_available He was working with the CIA.
not_available You expect me to take your word for it? 'Course not.
not_available I have his CIA contact.
not_available She's in the trunk of my car.
not_available No.
not_available You open it.
not_available JACK: She's still alive.
not_available I shot her up with propofol to keep her quiet.
not_available RASK: Search her.
not_available Okay, Jack.
not_available Where's my money? It's in an account, waiting for you.
not_available Why the hell do you think I came back? I'm trying to make things right.
not_available You should keep her alive.
not_available She's valuable.
not_available She's an asset.
not_available RASK: We have something that can counteract the propofol.
not_available Wake her up and find out everything she knows.
not_available Bring him.
not_available BELCHECK: I'm in position.
not_available I see her.
not_available CHLOE: Remember, this is our only chance of finding Margot.
not_available You can't move in on Kate until Rask accesses the account I've set up.
not_available She might not have that kind of time.
not_available Yes? Everything's okay.
not_available Farah doesn't know anything about the operation.
not_available Where did she think she was going with Naveed? I explained that he was just stressed and needed some time away.
not_available And she believed you? Mmm
not_available hmm.
not_available I'm sure of it.
not_available All right, I'm coming back.
not_available We're too close to finishing this.
not_available We can't take any chances.
not_available Didn't you hear what I said? That Farah's completely in the dark.
not_available And you also said Naveed could be trusted.
not_available She has her daughter with her.
not_available Then you have two loose ends to take care of.
not_available Is that a problem? No.
not_available Good.
not_available Get back as soon as you can.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Would you like to join us for dinner? YASMIN: Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available FARAH: Give some to your aunt.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Wake up.
not_available Wakey, wakey.
not_available Open those eyes.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available MAN: I'm curious.
not_available What did you offer Nils to make him turn? Eh? Was it immunity? Money? Or was it something else? Are there any other operatives we need to be worried about? No.
not_available No.
not_available Nils was it.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available KATE: No.
not_available Jack.
not_available They're not wasting any time.
not_available You better hurry.
not_available All Rask has to do is sign into the account.
not_available You disappeared for over two weeks without telling anyone.
not_available CIA was all over me.
not_available It was too risky to contact you.
not_available So where's my money? In my account, GGS, Hamburg.
not_available I can log you in.
not_available I know GGS.
not_available When you set up an account, you must have dealt with Metzger, right? What does it matter who helped me set up the account? Just answer my question.
not_available Looking up GGS's personnel records now.
not_available Did you deal with Metzger? What's his first name? I don't like being tested like this.
not_available It's a simple question! Answer it! I don't see anyone named Metzger, but part of the bank's employee directory is locked.
not_available Describe Metzger.
not_available If you opened an account there, you would have met him.
not_available Still trying to get into the directory.
not_available He might be bluffing about someone named Metzger working there, he might not be.
not_available There's no Metzger at the bank.
not_available There is, and you're lying.
not_available You are the one who informed on me.
not_available Why are you really here? Like I said before, there's no Metzger at the bank.
not_available Do you want your money or not? You're right.
not_available There is no Metzger there.
not_available Did you see that? Can't even get him to break a sweat.
not_available The log
not_available in and confirmation codes are here.
not_available Your money's waiting.
not_available Set up a secure link.
not_available This will take a moment.
not_available Morgan is in trouble.
not_available I help her now, or never.
not_available CHLOE: Wait.
not_available You can't.
not_available We have to wait for Rask to access the account.
not_available BELCHECK: You don't understand.
not_available He's going to kill her.
not_available I have to take him out.
not_available Belcheck? Belcheck, do you copy? Jack, somethings happened to Belcheck.
not_available He's not responding.
not_available MI
not_available 5 AGENT: Another hostile down.
not_available Advance team in position.
not_available We've got targets in an adjacent.
not_available MAN ON RADIO: Leave if alone.
not_available Our orders are to apprehend Bauer's contact in the main warehouse.
not_available Proceed to your designated positions.
not_available Await my order.
not_available Received.
not_available Proceed to the main warehouse.
not_available You're connected.
not_available There's going to be another raid.
not_available MAN: When? Your next operation.
not_available We have several.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me tell you what you want to know, okay? Let me tell you exactly what you want to know.
not_available Rask is on the bank site.
not_available All he needs to do is enter the pass code.
not_available Everybody, freeze! Nobody move! MI
not_available 5! Enough of your lies.
not_available I've got it, Jack.
not_available The virus is in his system.
not_available MAN: We have to get out of here! Hold it! Put the weapon down! Now! Come on.
not_available Give me an excuse to blow your brains all over the wall.
not_available On your knees.
not_available Now! MAN: Drop the gun.
not_available I said drop the gun! My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm working undercover on behalf of the President of the United States.
not_available Please come with us.
not_available He's got a grenade! JACK: Son of a bitch.
not_available CHLOE: Jack, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available What the hell is MI
not_available 5 doing there? I don't know.
not_available Did you manage to get anything on Margot from Rask's system? There are a lot of transactions.
not_available What am I looking for? For an operation like this, she'd have had to go dark about 30 days ago.
not_available Start there.
not_available Look for high
not_available dollar transactions, work your way backwards.
not_available Okay.
not_available I got 'em.
not_available Is there any contact information associated with the transfers? Just a phone number, a mobile.
not_available JACK: Run it.
not_available See if you can pull a location.
not_available CHLOE: Already tracing.
not_available I need to narrow it down, but the phones somewhere in South London.
not_available You sure you don't want something to drink? I'm glad you're staying for dinner.
not_available Yasmin now has an incentive for finishing her homework quickly.
not_available Are you okay? Simone? Answer me.
not_available What's wrong? Is it about Naveed? It is, isn't it? Are you two having problems? You need to leave now.
not_available What? Grab your daughter and leave London right now.
not_available Why? What's going on? Has something happened to Naveed? Please.
not_available I can explain later.
not_available But you need to leave now before it's too late.
not_available Too late? Too late for what? SIMONE: Wait.

not_available One of my analysts has been digging around Adam Morgan's data files.
not_available He knows about the missing sectors.
not_available I trust you were able to dissuade him from locking further.
not_available I did for now.
not_available But he thinks he might be able to retrieve the deleted files.
not_available You told me that wouldn't be possible.
not_available I said it was unlikely.
not_available Is he working with Agent Morgan? Still trying to clear her husband? I don't know! I don't think so.
not_available Make sure nothing is recovered.
not_available If the evidence you planted against her husband gets out, there won't be any way for us to protect you.
