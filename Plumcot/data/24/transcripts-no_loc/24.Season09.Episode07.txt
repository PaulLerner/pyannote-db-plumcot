
not_available Previously on 24 But unless President Heller surrenders himself to me, thousand of people in London, will die in his stead.
not_available Naveed, it's your sister.
not_available I'm worried about you.
not_available Are we still getting out of London? Did you know about this? No.
not_available If Naveed had planned to take his sister out of London, he must've told her about our operation.
not_available Go to her.
not_available I trust you to do what needs to be done.
not_available Grab your daughter and leave London right now.
not_available Wait, what are you doing? 
not_available Calling the police.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Please.
not_available Yasmin, get out! I'm so sorry.
not_available Somebody help! Yasmin, wait! Mr.
not_available Boudreau, I'm reviewing the transfer order that the president signed for Jack Bauer.
not_available Is there some reason you are uncomfortable involving President Heller? Let's meet privately.
not_available I was married to a man who was convicted of selling state secrets to a foreign government.
not_available I found something weird in our archives, case files related to Kate's husband.
not_available I need authorization to run a phoenix retrieval.
not_available You better hold off on that for now.
not_available One of my analysts has been digging around Adam Morgan's data files.
not_available If the evidence you planted against her husband gets out, there won't be any way for us to protect you.
not_available Margot Al
not_available Harazi has six U.S.
not_available drones under her control.
not_available This arms dealer that you know are you sure he can lead us to her whereabouts? 
not_available I believe he can.
not_available He's done business with her for years, she trusts him.
not_available Jack Bauer intends to draw out a business associate of Al
not_available Harazi's.
not_available Sir, Heller's being secretly treated for Alzheimer's.
not_available Get hold of MI5.
not_available Assemble a team.
not_available We'll handle this ourselves.
not_available Set up a secure link.
not_available Jack, if you can get Rask to log into the account, we should be able to trace any of his interactions 
not_available with Margot from there.
not_available Nobody move, MI5! 
not_available I've got it, Jack.
not_available Did you manage to get anything on Margot? Just a phone number, a mobile, but the phone's somewhere in South London.
not_available She just ran out in front of me.
not_available Uh it was like, she was chasing someone.
not_available Uh a little girl.
not_available What girl? There, her.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, there.
not_available Do you know that woman? Is she your mum? She killed my mum.
not_available Hey.
not_available What'd you think you're doing?! He's with me.
not_available I've given you some leeway, because of what you did for my men.
not_available But there are still protocols.
not_available I don't give a damn about your protocols.
not_available MI5 shouldn't have been here.
not_available You interfered with my operation; almost got us killed.
not_available I had my orders.
not_available From who? The Prime Minister's office.
not_available Your president can take it up with him.
not_available I'm sure he will.
not_available How're you holding up? I'm okay.
not_available Just tell me it was worth it.
not_available We got a number.
not_available Chloe's running it down.
not_available Did you get an address? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I opened the CCTV cameras in the area.
not_available There are police and paramedics everywhere.
not_available A woman was hit by a bus.
not_available I just got a closer look at her.
not_available It's Simone Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Is she alive? I think so.
not_available I don't know, it doesn't look good.
not_available She's just been put into the ambulance.
not_available Any sign of Margot? Not that I can see.
not_available Which hospital are they taking her to? Chloe, Chloe which hospital? Um St.
not_available Edward's, it's the closest in the area.
not_available Jack, I got to go.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What happened? Simone Al
not_available Harazi just got hit by a bus.
not_available They're taking her to St.
not_available Edward's Hospital.
not_available It was back
not_available channeled to us about 20 minutes ago.
not_available Took our communications guys a little while to figure out what it was.
not_available Are you sure that this is contact information for Margot Al
not_available Harazi? Yes, sir.
not_available Why would she send this? It's part of her game, sir.
not_available The deadline for you to surrender yourself is approaching.
not_available She is daring you to discuss terms.
not_available Can we use this to locate her? I've already asked it's a secured video data stream; there's no way to trace it back to its source.
not_available Thank you, Mark.
not_available I have to take this.
not_available Jack.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available What's happening with your guy, did he give up AlHarazi's location? We're still running numbers, but we got a lead on her daughter, Simone Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available She was injured in a traffic accident.
not_available We don't think her mother knows about it yet and we want to try and keep it that way.
not_available She's being transported in an ambulance to St.
not_available Edward's Hospital.
not_available I'll have her put under immediate guard.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I'm gonna need full access to her.
not_available I have no authority here and I don't want to keep working against British police.
not_available Is there anything you can do? You'll have complete cooperation.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, there's one more thing.
not_available Our operation was interrupted by MI5 agents, it was a disaster.
not_available They said they were ordered there by Prime Minister Davies.
not_available How the hell did that happen? I'm sorry about that, Jack.
not_available I had to take him into our confidence, in order to convince him not to put soldiers on the street.
not_available He promised me he wouldn't interfere.
not_available Sir, that wasn't the deal we made.
not_available At least five of his men were killed.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Prime Minister Davies is here to see you.
not_available He's here.
not_available The prime minister has arrived, I got to go, Jack.
not_available James, I
not_available I take it you've heard what's happened? I explicitly asked you to allow Jack Bauer to handle this alone! Now you gave me your word.
not_available I only agreed to hold off a military presence on the streets.
not_available Trusting a fallen agent is another matter entirely.
not_available Our surveillance shows that he was betraying you You had no business surveilling him in the first place! We are approaching less than an hour to Margot Al
not_available Harazi's deadline.
not_available When you fail to deliver yourself to her, she plans to reduce this city to rubble and flames; I can't just sit idly by and do nothing.
not_available Nobody is sitting idly by we're working our asses off here.
not_available You and I need to be working together! We have worked together and we have known each other for years, James.
not_available I consider you a friend and under normal circumstances I am not one who would ever doubt your judgment.
not_available But? But is there something you've been holding back from me, James? Concerning your health? What about my health? If what I've heard is true you have my deepest sympathy.
not_available If you had a concern regarding my health, you should've come to me directly and asked.
not_available I'm asking you now.
not_available If I thought for one moment that my health risks anyone's life I would resign this presidency immediately.
not_available My mistake, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Please, accept my apologies.
not_available There's still a chance that we can avoid a full
not_available scale attack.
not_available Despite your intervention Bauer has a line on Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available Now, can we count on your cooperation this time? I personally give you my word that he will have everything he needs.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We've got a GCS 3, no response to stimuli.
not_available BP's still good, 140/60.
not_available Head and probable internal injuries.
not_available Compound fracture to the right radius.
not_available Missing finger on the left hand, not related to the accident, looks like a recent injury.
not_available Hello? UUh, who
not_available who is this? I'm with the London Ambulance Service.
not_available We have a trauma patient, a 20s female with reddish
not_available brown hair.
not_available Are you a friend of hers or a relative? She's my daughter.
not_available What, what
not_available what's happened? She was struck by a bus.
not_available We're taking her to the A&amp;E; Department at St.
not_available Edward's.
not_available I
not_available Is she going to be all right? We're doing everything that we can for her.
not_available And you need to make your way to the hospital as soon as possible.
not_available The police are probably gonna want to talk to you.
not_available Of course.
not_available I I'll be there straightaway.
not_available Could you tell me your name? Simone's been in an accident.
not_available The police are involved.
not_available The police? Do they know who she is? I don't know! What about Naveed's sister and child, did she take care of them or not?! Who do we have in the area? St.
not_available Edward's Hospital.
not_available Uh, Kareem he lives nearby.
not_available Send him.
not_available Have him find out how badly she's hurt and if they know who she is.
not_available Oh.
not_available Gavin.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Oh, nothing.
not_available What do you want? Erik wants me to pull up the body cam files from earlier.
not_available I need your access code.
not_available Why don't I just send you the files directly.
not_available Hey, suit yourself.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available Just send over the files as quick as you can.
not_available Yes? You said you were going to stop your analyst from retrieving the deleted partitions from Adam Morgan's files.
not_available That's right.
not_available I ordered him to leave it alone.
not_available I'm afraid your order's not being followed.
not_available He's running a data retrieval program right now.
not_available You have access to our systems.
not_available Of course we do.
not_available If he sees those partitions, he's going to know that you're the source of intel I've been selling to China.
not_available How long before they reckon you framed Adam? He's just a kid.
not_available You'd prefer prison for the rest of your life? Is there someone you can send me? A cleaner? Look, I'm just a middleman here.
not_available You've been well
not_available paid.
not_available Sort it out.
not_available Quickly.
not_available Are you in charge? Chief Inspector Helen McCarthy.
not_available You must be Bauer.
not_available The Home Office told me to expect you.
not_available I'll give you any support you need.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is Agent Morgan.
not_available Where's Simone Al
not_available Harazi? She's still unconscious.
not_available Doctor's working on her now.
not_available What happened? According to witnesses, she was chasing after a young girl when the bus hit her.
not_available Girl's name is Yasmin Azizan.
not_available She claims Simone murdered her mother.
not_available Two officers checked out the address, found the mother, Farah Azizan, dead from a stab wound.
not_available What's the connection? Girl's not saying much.
not_available She's in shock.
not_available Where is she right now? Downstairs in A&amp;E; being checked over.
not_available Okay, I'm gonna go talk to her.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need to clear this entire wing, authorized personnel only.
not_available Okay, I'll get on to it.
not_available The doctor's waiting to speak to you.
not_available What's her condition? 
not_available We're still looking.
not_available We're trying to get her stable before we do a CT scan.
not_available Is she awake? 
not_available No.
not_available But she's coming around.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available I'm gonna need to talk to her before you send her in for that scan.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available Doctor, I'm not asking.
not_available Right now there are more lives at stake than just hers.
not_available I need you to do what you can to stabilize her and get her conscious.
not_available Do you understand me? Please.
not_available Okay, 40 milligrams of adrenaline, please.
not_available Mr.
not_available Warrington, please come to Dr.
not_available Stanhope can see you now.
not_available Is this Yasmin? Mind if I sit with her a while? I'm all done here.
not_available Hope you like ginger beer.
not_available My name's Kate.
not_available You mind if I ask you a couple questions? You're American? Mm
not_available hmm, yeah.
not_available That's right.
not_available You know I know that this isn't easy for you and all, and I'm really sorry about your mom.
not_available Can you tell me about what happened, about the woman who did this? Aunt Simone? She's your aunt? Simone Al
not_available Harazi you're related to her? Shabazz.
not_available Her name's Simone Shabazz.
not_available She married my uncle Naveed a couple of years ago.
not_available I was in my room doing my homework when I heard shouting.
not_available They were arguing? I heard my mum say that she was going to call the police.
not_available She was shouting for me, telling me to get out.
not_available When I came down I saw I saw my mum and the blood.
not_available Hey, it's okay.
not_available Do you remember anything that your aunt Simone said? She told Mum that we had to get out of London.
not_available She said she was trying to protect us.
not_available From her mother.
not_available Right, uh Margot.
not_available Do you know her? Do you know where she might be? I never met her.
not_available Okay, well, you know what, you are a very brave girl.
not_available Thank you so much for talking to me.
not_available I'm gonna try and come back and see you again, okay? What's going to happen to her Aunt Simone? I don't know.
not_available I hope she dies.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Were you able to talk to Simone? No, doctor's still working on her, 
not_available trying to get her conscious.
not_available Right.
not_available This girl Yasmin is Simone's niece.
not_available She doesn't know Margot, but she said that before the situation went south, Simone was urging them to get out of London.
not_available She said that she was trying to protect them 
not_available from her own mother.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah, according to the girl.
not_available I mean, it sounds to me like Simone was betraying her own mother, which means we've got a great chance at turning her.
not_available I'm on my way back to you.
not_available Okay.
not_available How is she? I haven't seen her yet.
not_available I don't know where she is.
not_available It was easy getting in, but the police are starting to lock the place down.
not_available They know who she is.
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available They're going to do everything they can to get her talking.
not_available I don't think she's going to need much persuading.
not_available What does that mean? The girl, um, Yasmin she left her alive.
not_available An American woman was questioning her.
not_available She said Simone was warning them to get out of London.
not_available Said she was trying to protect them from you.
not_available Find out exactly where she is in the building.
not_available We'll take care of the rest from here.
not_available Will do.
not_available Have everyone start packing up.
not_available Start loading, we're leaving.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available She's betrayed me once.
not_available I won't let her do it again.
not_available Move the drone to within range of the hospital.
not_available I've just attended a meeting of the government's emergency committee.
not_available Where I received a full report from the appropriate ministers and officials.
not_available As most of you are already aware, we received notice of an imminent terrorist threat to London short while ago.
not_available Since we believe this threat to be credible, I've ordered that our capital city be put on critical alert.
not_available As a precaution, I'm _ Jordan, can you step in here for a moment? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Again, this is simply a precaution.
not_available We have not seen a successful attack on this country in seven years.
not_available But the absence of an attack Everything okay? There's a dead drop over in Camden.
not_available One of our highlevel assets left a package with possible leads to Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available I need you to pick it up.
not_available Me? You're sending me into the field? We're shorthanded.
not_available We lost a lot of agents today.
not_available Erik's not fit enough to go out, so I'm relying on you.
not_available If you're not up to it, just say the word.
not_available No, no.
not_available Sure.
not_available I can do that.
not_available It's important this stays between us.
not_available The drop's at a houseboat on the lock.
not_available Make the pickup and bring the package back.
not_available Straightforward enough for you? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you for trusting me with this, sir.
not_available You've earned it.
not_available Soldiers have been instructed to help keep order until the crisis passes.
not_available Emergency services will remain operational throughout the alert.
not_available The underground, rail and bus services You all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Davies is finally going public on the terror threat.
not_available I know.
not_available I had a conversation with the prime minister earlier.
not_available He knows about my condition.
not_available He asked me about it.
not_available What did you say? I didn't handle it very well.
not_available But it doesn't matter.
not_available It won't be long before others find out.
not_available Everything I do, every decision I make will be second
not_available guessed.
not_available It will be impossible for me to govern.
not_available Dad, you said that you wanted to just finish out your term.
not_available It was arrogant, vain and stupid of me to even think that.
not_available Mark, when the crisis is over and we get back to Washington, I want you to set up a meeting with the vice president so we can bring him up to speed on the transition, yeah? Yes, sir.
not_available Can you hear me? Simone, can you hear me? Where am I? You've been in an accident.
not_available Right now I need you 
not_available to listen to me.
not_available Yasmin.
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's safe.
not_available She told us that you tried to get her and her mother to leave London.
not_available You tried to protect them.
not_available Do you remember that? I know you.
not_available You were following me on the underground.
not_available My name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Simone, your instinct was to protect your family members from what your mother is doing today.
not_available I want you to think of the hundreds of thousands of innocent people that will die if we don't stop her.
not_available Please help me.
not_available Right now you're the only person that can stop this from happening.
not_available Just because I took pity on Farah and Yasmin doesn't mean I would ever betray my mother to you.
not_available Your mother who did this? My mother loves me.
not_available She would never do anything to harm me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I shouldn't have done that.
not_available I just hate these people.
not_available For thinking there could be anything that would justify what they're doing.
not_available She wasn't gonna talk anyway.
not_available The young girl, the niece, Yasmin.
not_available Do you think she can turn her? 
not_available Jack, she's traumatized.
not_available She watched her mother die by Simone's hand.
not_available She's terrified of her.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available Margot's deadline's almost up.
not_available Hey.
not_available I thought we locked down this entire floor.
not_available Authorized personnel only.
not_available Who's he? 
not_available We did.
not_available Excuse me, I need to see your ID.
not_available Uh, sorry.
not_available I I think I'm on the wrong floor.
not_available It's not right.
not_available Get down! You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take the elevator.
not_available Cover the exit.
not_available Okay.
not_available Damn it.
not_available You take the left.
not_available Now.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available I got him.
not_available You! Stop! Stay down! Move! Move! Stop right there! Don't shoot! Damn it! He's dead.
not_available Who the hell is he? Stand down.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Margot must've sent him.
not_available He texted her Simone's location.
not_available She replied you got eight minutes to get out.
not_available Well, what does that mean? She's sending a drone to kill her daughter.
not_available You need to clear this hospital now.
not_available Now! 
not_available Get everyone out! Move! We got to get Simone.
not_available Keep going.
not_available I'll meet you outside.
not_available One minute to target.
not_available Chloe, were we able to pull anything off the number I just gave you? Negative.
not_available It was a re
not_available routed connection.
not_available It's a dead end, Jack.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Doctor, I've got her.
not_available You can go.
not_available She can't walk.
not_available She's gonna have to.
not_available Go! WhWh What's happening? 
not_available Your mother's targeting you with a drone.
not_available No.
not_available She's willing to kill everybody here just to keep you quiet.
not_available She wouldn't do that.
not_available You honestly believe that? Stay here then.
not_available Wait.
not_available Please.
not_available Please don't leave me here.
not_available We got to go now.
not_available Get up.
not_available Uh, Yasmin, the girl did you see her leave? I didn't notice.
not_available Yasmin! Yasmin, hey, sweetie, it's Kate.
not_available We got to get out of here.
not_available Listen, I know you're scared.
not_available But I'm gonna take care of you, okay? Come on.
not_available We got to get out of here.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hospital in range.
not_available Come on! Let's go! Come on! Starting the targeting sequence.
not_available Zoom in.
not_available They're evacuating.
not_available They may have gotten Simone out already.
not_available Fire anyway.
not_available Jack! Follow me! Target acquired.
not_available It's all right, sweetheart.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available Chief Inspector, take the girl.
not_available As soon as Simone is secure, I'll contact you.
not_available It's gonna be okay! Scan the area.
not_available If they got her out, find her.
not_available I got her.
not_available There they are.
not_available Lock on target.
not_available And fire.
not_available Target acquired.
not_available She's got a visual on us.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Stay on them.
not_available Take the shot when you can.
not_available Simone, she's not gonna stop until she kills you.
not_available We've got to stop her.
not_available You're the only one who can help us.
not_available All you need to do is tell us where your mother is.
not_available Jack! Trying to acquire target.
not_available Got them.
not_available Firing.
not_available Damn it! I need to bring it down to 20,000 feet.
not_available He won't be able to evade it then.
not_available Okay, but how much time? We're down to our last missile.
not_available The other drones aren't in range yet.
not_available If we miss, we don't have another chance.
not_available Damn it! Hold on.
not_available We're gonna switch cars.
not_available Follow my play.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available You're all right.
not_available Acquiring the new target vehicle.
not_available Bloody hell.
not_available I couldn't get a lock.
not_available Jack.
not_available I see it.
not_available We got to switch cars.
not_available Grab my bag.
not_available Wait here.
not_available Get out of the car! Now! Get out! Move! Go.
not_available Is there an infirmary at your CIA station? Yes.
not_available Okay, that's where we're going.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You don't you move.
not_available I've got them.
not_available Yes! Take it back.
not_available It's empty! Jack, she's in bad shape.
not_available Deputy Minister, thank you for taking the time to see me.
not_available London is under curfew.
not_available We shouldn't be out here.
not_available So I shall make this brief, Mr.
not_available Boudreau.
not_available I insist that you hand over the criminal Jack Bauer.
not_available Well, circumstances have changed.
not_available President Heller has enlisted Bauer's help in the current terrorist situation.
not_available The rendition order was signed in haste, shall we say.
not_available But not by President Heller, I think.
not_available Excuse me? That's why you're so reticent to put him on the phone to Moscow.
not_available He doesn't know about this.
not_available We know about your wife's history with Bauer.
not_available I understand why a man like you would take actions against 
not_available a rival.
not_available Leave my wife out of this.
not_available But if I'm not mistaken, forging a president's signature would be considered an act of treason.
not_available What do you think will happen to your career, to your marriage, if you were found out? Look, it's, uh it's pointless to try to intimidate me.
not_available Bauer is out on the field on presidential order.
not_available I couldn't get my hands on him if I wanted to.
not_available So what are you saying now? That the man responsible for murdering my good friend Mikhail Novakovich, and attempting to assassinate our president, will not be turned over to us to face justice? I'm saying give me time.
not_available Once Bauer serves his purpose, everyone gets what they want.
not_available Time we do not have.
not_available Make it sooner than later, for your sake.
not_available I expect your call.
not_available How is she? Her pulse is weak.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Jack, I'm watching the devastation at the hospital.
not_available Brutal.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We managed to get Simone out.
not_available She's in bad shape.
not_available We're taking her over to the CIA station.
not_available They have an infirmary.
not_available We're gonna try and keep her alive.
not_available Did you talk to her? Did she tell you where Margot is? No, sir, not yet.
not_available Any realistic chance that we'll find Margot before the deadline? Mr.
not_available President, we're still trying.
not_available And to be honest with you, we're running out of time.
not_available I'm going to have to see you, Jack.
not_available Sir? I'll explain it to you when you get here.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available The president needs to see me.
not_available And what about her? Residence is on the way.
not_available You can drop me off, and then take her over to the infirmary.
not_available Come in.
not_available Contact information on Margot AlHarazi back
not_available channeled, per your request, sir.
not_available Put the jacket on the chair.
not_available Not a word about this to anyone, including Boudreau.
not_available Do you understand? Of course.
not_available What exactly are we, uh? Thank you.
not_available Margot Al
not_available Harazi.
not_available President Heller.
not_available I'm surprised.
not_available I didn't think you were man enough to make this call.
not_available You gave me a deadline, and asked me to surrender myself to you.
not_available I still have time to comply if I choose.
not_available The fact you've made contact suggests to me you've already reached your decision.
not_available If I do as you ask and surrender myself to you, can I trust you to keep your word? You're asking if you can trust me? If either of us should be suspicious, it's me.
not_available Is this a tactic to buy yourself more time? No tactic.
not_available No one else knows about this.
