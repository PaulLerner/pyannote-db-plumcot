not_available lt accesses their private residence.
not_available We got her.
not_available l want to know where you got it.
not_available Omar gave it to me.
not_available l gave Miss Reed this key card for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.
not_available Sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed? l trust your complete discretion in this matter.
not_available We have a problem.
not_available My brother confessed to the affair.
not_available l don't know if the frame's going to hold.
not_available There is no reason to diverge from the plan.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available Your brother wiIl be dead before the hour is out.
not_available What are you doing here? l thought l told you to leave me alone.
not_available "C.T.U.
not_available Senior Data Analyst." Well, sounds like an important job.
not_available Damn it, what do you want from me? Place to crash, for starters.
not_available You can stay the night.
not_available I want you out tomorrow.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, we're evacuating immediately, due to a possible bomb threat.
not_available Madam President, you and Secretary Kanin need to move now.
not_available President Hassan, if you'll follow me.
not_available Yes? Îe's in the third car.
not_available Î¤he motorcade's coming up the ramps now.
not_available Officer, this is going down now.
not_available You can either stand here and do nothing, or you can help me stop it.
not_available Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now.
not_available The assassin is part of the evacuation detail.
not_available There is no bomb in the U.N.
not_available It's too late.
not_available Hassan's car just exited the tunnel.
not_available Cole, you need to stop that car, or Hassan's a dead man.
not_available Cole.
not_available What was that? What happened? 
not_available The following takes place between 7:00 p.m.
not_available and 8:00 p.m.
not_available Î¤his is a damn disaster, Brian.
not_available What do you mean, you don't know what happened? How is Îassan? Is he all right? We don't know yet, Madam President.
not_available lt appears the bomb threat at the U.N.
not_available was a hoax 
not_available designed to get him out of the building.
not_available It appears? An l.E.D.
not_available was planted on Îassan's evacuation route.
not_available And you drove him right into it.
not_available One of our agents detected the ambush, and tried to head him off just as the bomb exploded.
not_available You better pray he got there in time.
not_available Security, there.
not_available Now! Stand down.
not_available I'm with C.T.U.
not_available Sir, we need to move you to another vehicle now.
not_available Sir, you do not want to stay here.
not_available Get him in.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Move! Move! 
not_available Cole? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Î¤hank God you're okay.
not_available I got lucky.
not_available Look, Hassan escaped the blast.
not_available He's fine.
not_available He's heading toward C.T.U.
not_available Eastbound on 48th Street in a black S.U.V.
not_available Got him.

not_available Entering a white low
not_available rise north of the U.N.
not_available Call it in.
not_available I'm in pursuit.
not_available Chloe, I need to put out a priority A.P.B.
not_available Move! Go! Move! 
not_available Come on, clear the area! 
not_available What is it now? They've got a lead on the assassin.
not_available I'm gonna need my weapon.
not_available Your bag's right behind my seat.
not_available East 47th Street
not_available That's just above the U.N.
not_available You're gonna need to turn now.
not_available Now.
not_available Now.
not_available U.N.
not_available 4, come in.
not_available U.N.
not_available 4, this is C.T.U.
not_available 2.

not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l can't reach him.
not_available Try again.
not_available Î¤hat's my husband in that car up there.

not_available He survived.
not_available Farhad, how is he? 
not_available He's alive.
not_available God is with us.
not_available Can you tell me what happened? 
not_available Take that hall.
not_available You got it.
not_available A car in the motorcade swerved in front of him.
not_available Î¤hey're locking down the entire area.
not_available What would you suggest we do? lt's over.
not_available Get out now.
not_available lt can't be long before they realize it's you.
not_available Farhad? 
not_available Sir, you need to stay in the car.
not_available Sir, I need you to get back in the car.
not_available Oh! 
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available Slide your weapon back to me.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Slow.
not_available Now, you're going to walk me out of here.
not_available Call in.
not_available Say the southwest corner is clear.
not_available Tell them to move the search team to the northeast.
not_available Do it.
not_available You want to live? Make the calI.
not_available This is Cole Ortiz, in the southwest corner of the building.
not_available l'm in pursuit of the assassin.
not_available Îe's with me now.
not_available You okay? You okay? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available l'm okay.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, Brian Hastings.
not_available We spoke on the phone.
not_available We're glad you're here.
not_available Please follow me.
not_available Is my family here? No, sir.
not_available We'll try and get you all together shortly.
not_available Are they all right? 
not_available Your wife and daughter are fine.
not_available And my brother? Was he hurt? No, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, it appears your brother was involved with the attack.
not_available My brother? Yes, sir.
not_available That can't be right.
not_available Bring him to me.
not_available I need to talk to him.
not_available Unfortunately, we don't know where he is at the moment.
not_available Then how can you be sure it was him? Mr.
not_available President, after the explosion, he killed one of my men to facilitate his own escape.
not_available Î¤here were witnesses, including your wife and daughter.
not_available Îe's the insider we've been looking for.
not_available There's no doubt.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available I'm sorry for interrupting.
not_available You asked for any updates about the assassin.
not_available And? Îe's dead.
not_available Jack just called it in.
not_available Îe uplinked some video footage that you need to see.
not_available l'll be there in a minute.
not_available Don't let me keep you from your job.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I owe you my life.
not_available Conference room.
not_available Uh, Mr.
not_available Hastings, uhMeredith Reed, the woman you brought here for questioningWhere is she? 
not_available Still here.
not_available Looks like she'll be cleared of any wrongdoing.
not_available l'd Iike to taIk to her.
not_available l'll arrange it.
not_available Î¤hank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available l saw that.
not_available What? The way you looked at me when he thanked me for saving his life.
not_available You think he should have been thanking you? l was actually thinking he should thank Jack, then Cole, then maybe me.
not_available l underestimated you, Chloe.
not_available You saw what was really going on.
not_available I did not.
not_available lt was a major save.
not_available My report will state that.
not_available Chloe said you have some video to show me.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Î¤ake a look.
not_available Î¤hese are images uplinked by Jack Bauer from the bomb site.
not_available Î¤he assassin who was targeting Hassan.
not_available We have an I.D.? Not yet.
not_available But I believe we do have a workable lead.
not_available These are tattoos off the two men who attempted to take out our informant this afternoon.
not_available Same as the assassin.
not_available We believe they indicate membership in a particular Russian crime syndicate.
not_available What's a Russian gang have against the leader of the Islamic Republic? I don't know.
not_available Couldjust be hired muscle.
not_available But when the photos arrived, I ran them by the F.B.I.
not_available Turns out, they had an agent undercover working with the Russian mob here several years ago.
not_available A woman.
not_available Contact her.
not_available Already done.
not_available l have a helicopter bringing her in now.
not_available Chloe, I think you worked with her.
not_available Renee Walker.
not_available Says here she's no longer with the F.B.I.
not_available lt's true.
not_available She resigned over an internal dispute.
not_available Meaning she was fired, and her records have been sealed.
not_available What are we getting into here? 
not_available Sir, we are only using her to brief us.
not_available Î¤hese Russian groups are secretive to the point of paranoia.
not_available She's the only one who ever got close.
not_available President Omar Hassan was not harmed in the attack, and has since been taken to a secure location.
not_available Confirmed fatalities now stand at three, 
not_available including a police officer.
not_available Yes? Why is my brother still alive? 
not_available You're upset, Farhad.
not_available Justifiably.
not_available Your man failed.
not_available Once you have the materials in your possession, your brother, his peace conference
not_available None of that matters.
not_available Isn't that what you told me? All you have to do is stay calm and stick to your plan.
not_available Or should l be looking for another buyer? l'll be there soon.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll have a nice meal waiting.
not_available And we'll talk.
not_available l've been informed that the bomb threat was a hoax.
not_available That's confirmed.
not_available We swept the negotiating chamber with sniffer dogs and ground
not_available penetrating radar.
not_available l can assure you, it's safe.
not_available I'm glad to hear it.
not_available Hassan is standing by at C.T.U.
not_available How is he, Rob? Well, he narrowly escaped being blown to pieces by his own brother, so not too welI.
not_available But your call to him can't just be all sympathy and concern.
not_available We need to know where he stands visa
not_available vis the talks.
not_available lt's hardly the time.
not_available No, it's exactly the time.
not_available Î¤he signing is scheduled for tomorrow.
not_available Dozens of world leaders are already en route to New York.
not_available We need to know if we stilI have a peace process.
not_available Put him on.
not_available Sir, I have President Taylor for you.
not_available Madam President.
not_available l cannot begin to say how relieved I am that you survived this terrible attack, Omar.
not_available Î¤hank you.
not_available I'm mortified that this outrage happened on U.S.
not_available soil.
not_available l'm the one who should be embarrassed.
not_available My brother Farhad did this.
not_available Îe betrayed me, and worse, he put you in harm's way.
not_available l should have realized what he's up to.
not_available We can only be betrayed by the people we trust.
not_available Îe fooIed all of us.
not_available Sir, this is Rob Weiss.
not_available You've heard Farhad escaped.
not_available Can I ask what you think his agenda might be, aside from targeting you? Uh, what l mean, sir, is, does he have a plan? Yes, he has a plan.
not_available Regime change.
not_available lsn't that what you Americans call it? Mr.
not_available President, we're doing everything we can to apprehend Farhad, but while he's at large, I'd understand it if you wished not to continue the talks.
not_available Îowever, l hope that l can persuade you to reconvene.
not_available We have come so far together, and to let this moment slip
not_available Would be to hand Farhad victory.
not_available l will not give him this satisfaction.
not_available lf you are all ready to continue with these talks, so am I.
not_available l am delighted to hear it.
not_available Ifyou could persuade Mr.
not_available Hastings here to release me
not_available We'll coordinate with C.Î¤.U.
not_available so that you can return to the U.N.
not_available as soon as possible.
not_available I
not_available I know that you want to be with your wife and daughter.
not_available Î¤hank you.
not_available Thank you, Madam President.
not_available You want your office back, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available It's fine, sir.
not_available Can l ask what you and President Taylor agreed? Î¤hat I should return to U.N.
not_available as soon as possible.
not_available We'll make the arrangements.
not_available Uh, before I leave, l would like to thank the young man who saved my life.
not_available That would be Agent Ortiz.
not_available Îe's returning to C.Î¤.U.
not_available right now.
not_available You really should go to Medical.
not_available Soon as I hand the body over to Forensics.
not_available What are you going to do? Finish my debrief, try and catch that last flight to Los Angeles.
not_available Thanks, Jack.
not_available It's been an honor.
not_available Take care of yourself, okay? Îey.
not_available I'm glad you're okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Me too.
not_available We I.D.'d the assassin using your video footage.
not_available We think he was working for one of the Russian crime syndicates here.
not_available Any idea which one? Not yet.
not_available But we're bringing in someone to brief us.
not_available Good.
not_available Uh, Jack? lt's Renee.
not_available What? Why? Six years ago, she worked undercover with the Russian mob.
not_available F.B.l.
not_available says she's still one of the best experts they have.
not_available Îave you spoken to her? No.
not_available l tried phoning her a few times.
not_available She never returned my calls.
not_available She made it clear she didn't want to speak to me, so I
not_available I let it go.
not_available l heard she had a rough time.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Like, a really rough time
not_available Some sort of a breakdown.
not_available She should be landing any minute.
not_available Look, she didn't want to talk to me then, she's not gonna want to talk to me now, and I want to respect that.
not_available So, please, don't tell her l'm here, okay? Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available l'll be waiting for you up in Debrief 1 .
not_available We'll get you a full set of photos as soon as possible.
not_available Î¤hanks.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Agent Ortiz.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available l want to thank you for saving my life.
not_available You're welcome, sir, but it wasn't just me.
not_available lf it weren't for Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian, I wouldn't have been in place to make the save.
not_available I'll thank them too, but you risked your life for me.
not_available You put yourself between me and the bomb.
not_available My family and l are in your debt.
not_available What's that? lt's a hazardous materials alert.
not_available Hazardous materials? 
not_available Please wait here, sir.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hendricks? What's going on? 
not_available The body triggered a hazmat alarm.
not_available We're reading radioactive contaminants.
not_available What sort of contaminants? 
not_available Rad count's low, so it could be uranium.
not_available It's just trace elements.
not_available There's no danger.
not_available U
not_available 235? lt's highly enriched uranium.
not_available You mean it's weaponsgrade? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How the hell did he come into contact with that? l don't know, but he had to have been exposed to it recently.
not_available I think l know the answer.
not_available What is it, sir? Sir, we're talking about nuclear materials.
not_available lf you know something, you need to tell us.
not_available l need to talk to Mr.
not_available Hastings right now.
not_available Hey, Renee.
not_available lt's good to see you.
not_available This way.
not_available Didn't know you were back at C.T.U.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Morris lost his job a year ago.
not_available l asked to be reinstated, and this is where they assigned me.
not_available So what about you? l heard you've been working for a security firm.
not_available Uh, I was.
not_available Didn't work out.
not_available So it's confirmed, and you're certain.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available highly enriched.
not_available Thanks.
not_available lt's Forensics.
not_available Î¤hey confirmed the composition of the radioactive material.
not_available lt's U
not_available 235, 94.7% pure.
not_available Weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available Ifyou have an explanation, sir, I'm eager to hear it.
not_available Before we started this peace initiative, my country was close to developing a nuclear weapon.
not_available Yes.
not_available Our intelligence was aware of that.
not_available You may also be aware that we could not enrich enough fissile material to arm it.
not_available Soon after our countries began to negotiate the peace process, my brother came up to me and said that someone had approached him with weapons
not_available grade uranium.
not_available Who? Someone who had access to decommissioned Soviet stockpiles.
not_available You think it was the same Russians who were trying to kill you today? Yes, I do.
not_available l told my brother to stay away from them, but obviously he had other plans.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the nuclear material that you were offered
not_available You have any idea where it is? Î¤hat man was contaminated recently.
not_available Doesn't that mean the materials are here in the U.S.? Farhad always used to tell me that our country will always be at the mercy of the West unless we become a nuclear power.
not_available You must find the Russians before they can get the uranium to my brother.
not_available We'll do what we have to do, sir.
not_available l'll notify my security forces to cooperate fully.
not_available Patty, get me the file on Renee Walker's undercover operation.
not_available The stars mean these men were part of the criminal elite
not_available Vory V Zakone.
not_available This one spent time in a Siberian prison camp
not_available I.K.
not_available 10.
not_available Î¤he number of spires means length of sentence.
not_available Î¤hree years? Three life terms.
not_available Must have escaped.
not_available Now these
not_available Broken cross here, here and here.
not_available Same on all three.
not_available So what does it mean? Brian Hastings, director of C.T.U.
not_available l appreciate that you came in.
not_available So what does it mean? lt means "You can break our arms, you can break every bone in our body
not_available We'll never talk." lt's supposed to be the symbol for a group called Red Square.
not_available Supposed to be? 
not_available We tried to find them and never got close.
not_available A lot of rumors that they're ex
not_available miIitary, special forces, intelligence, whatever.
not_available l'm not sure they actually exist.
not_available They exist, Ms.
not_available Walker.
not_available And we need to find them.
not_available Why? You're aware of the attack in Midtown today? You mean the smoking crater by the U.N.? Yeah, it was hard to miss.
not_available Well, we believe it's just the beginning, and that the group responsible is in possession of unsecured nuclear materials.
not_available Now, Dana asked you here today to brief on background, but I have a much bigger ask.
not_available You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob.
not_available Your cover is still intact.
not_available What are you saying exactly? Are you asking me to go back in? Dana, Chloe, would you give us a moment, please? l wouldn't be asking if it weren't important, but yes, l want you to go back in.
not_available And this doesn't seem in the least bitl don't know
not_available ironic to you? l know that you left the F.B.l.
not_available under difficult circumstances.
not_available "Difficult" doesn't even begin to describe it.
not_available l can get you your badge back.
not_available l laid down my badge, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available I took it from my pocket, and I laid it down.
not_available So why would you possibly think that I want it back? Well, what do you want? What do I want? Nothing.
not_available You have weapons
not_available grade uranium in the hands of the Russian O.C.
not_available I can do something about that, so I'll go back in, but not for a badge.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We brief in 1 0 minutes.
not_available Hey.
not_available Just wanted to say good
not_available bye.
not_available You're off finally? Yeah.
not_available Îow did Renee's debriefing go? lt was going fine until Hastings kicked me out.
not_available Why'd he kick you out? 
not_available lt just started to get really uncomfortable.
not_available ls that her undercover file? Yeah.
not_available I'm just trying to get up to speed.
not_available They found traces of uranium on the assassin.
not_available Îastings says there's nuclear materials in play.
not_available Yeah, l heard.
not_available What's that got to do with Renee? Îe asked her to go back under with the Russians.
not_available What is it? Hey.
not_available Jack.
not_available Chloe didn't tell me you were here.
not_available l asked her not to.
not_available l didn't think you'd want to see me.
not_available Right.
not_available You tried to get in touch, and I didn't call back.
not_available Sorry.
not_available l was so happy to hear that you were okay though.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm surprised that you're back at C.Î¤.U.
not_available I'm actually not.
not_available l'm moving back to Los Angeles with my daughter.
not_available l'm supposed to be on a plane with her right now.
not_available Well, what are you doing here? Old informant knocked on my door.
not_available Everything went downhill from there.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Î¤he attack in Midtown.
not_available That's why I'm here too.
not_available l heard Îastings wants you to go undercover with the Russians again.
not_available Îe does.
not_available l've agreed.
not_available You really think that's a good idea? They need me.
not_available l'm not worried about them.
not_available l'm worried about you.
not_available l know what you did.
not_available Really, Jack? What did I do? You almost killed Wilson during your interrogation.
not_available ln fact it was so bad, the F.B.I.
not_available had to let you go.
not_available Even after everything you did that day.
not_available Renee, l know where you are, and it's a dark place.
not_available Yeah, and l've come back.
not_available It takes longer than you think.
not_available l wouldn't have signed up for this if I wasn't ready.
not_available l don't think you are.
not_available Renee, this is too important.
not_available You need to let them take care of it.
not_available They will.
not_available l appreciate what you're trying to do.
not_available Really.
not_available You said you were going to Los Angeles to be with your daughter, right? Please don't do this.
not_available Go to California, Jack.
not_available l have a briefing.
not_available You will receive an official apoIogy for your detention here, but in the meantime, l hope you can accept my sincere personal regrets.
not_available l'm sure you understand that given the threat to President Hassan, we were under extreme pressure.
not_available l would have thought that came with the job, along with the ability to handle it.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Ms.
not_available Reed.
not_available Î¤hank God you're alI right.
not_available l was lucky.
not_available l heard it was Farhad who tried to have you killed.
not_available l can't believe he would betray you.
not_available He betrayed both of us, Meredith.
not_available And then I betrayed you.
not_available What are you talking about? l told them about us.
not_available l was scared.
not_available I panicked.
not_available l hope you can forgive me.
not_available There's nothing to forgive.
not_available But you stood by me.
not_available You didn't deny me.
not_available Even though you had a million reasons to.
not_available Before that moment, l
not_available l never really knew what you felt for me.
not_available You should have.
not_available Didn't I make it clear? 
not_available What? What is it? l nearly died today, and l saw how fragile it all is
not_available Not only my life, but everything I've ever worked for, any good l might be able to do.
not_available l just can't jeopardize that.
not_available l understand.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available Meredith.
not_available Six years ago, l was undercover with these men.
not_available They were running an arms trafficking ring.
not_available We broke up the ring and arrested everyone except for the man in charge
not_available Vladimir Laitanan.
not_available He's our target.
not_available lt was through him l first heard about the group Red Square.
not_available lf anyone can connect us to them, it's him.
not_available Everything I've read about Laitanan says he disappeared without a trace.
not_available How are you going to find him? Through this guy.
not_available Ziya Dakhilov.
not_available He's out on parole.
not_available He'll take us to Vladimir.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available offered Ziya full immunity if he gave up Vladimir.
not_available Îe turned it down and kept his mouth shut and did his time.
not_available l'm not F.B.I.
not_available l'm a former felon, remember? I'll be offering Ziya the deal ofa lifetime.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Îe'lI take it.
not_available Once l've made contact with VIadimir, I'll tell him that l've heard whispers of nuclear materials on the market.
not_available l'll say I have a buyer for them.
not_available Who's that going to be? Agent Ortiz? You up for this? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Îow much money are we talking about? For nuclear rods? We need to show offshore accounts of 1 00 million at least.
not_available Probably twice that.
not_available Okay, l'll get on that.
not_available Chloe will work up a backstory to cover the time after your release from prison.
not_available Now, you and Agent Ortiz need to figure out where you met, how long you've known each other.
not_available Jack.
not_available I thought you'd left.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, but could l have the room with Mr.
not_available Îastings alone, please? You too, Renee.
not_available l think l'll stay.
not_available So what's going on, Jack? 
not_available Agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six years.
not_available l think you're making a mistake by putting her in.
not_available Why don't you tell him what's really on your mind, Jack? I'll tell him what I told you.
not_available l'm concerned about her, and this operation.
not_available So what does that mean? She's not ready for this.
not_available You must have other options.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, no one else knows these Russians.
not_available No one else can get you as close.
not_available Unfortunately, I'm your only choice.
not_available l appreciate your concern, Jack, but she's right.
not_available She's our only way in.
not_available Fine.
not_available Î¤hen l want to go with her.
not_available I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy? 
not_available l'll act as a buyer.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available Agent Ortiz has already agreed.
not_available He doesn't have the experience.
not_available Î¤hen this is how he gets it.
not_available Not with nuclear weapons on the line.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings, l'm officially requesting that you send me in with Agent Walker.
not_available Jack, if you're willing to do this, I'd be foolish to object.
not_available We'll work up a cover for you, and dovetail it 
not_available with Agent Walker's alias.
not_available We're going to have to work fast.
not_available The Russians are going to want to unload the nuclear fuel rods as quickly as possible.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available Are you sure this information is reliable? 
not_available It checks out.
not_available All right then.
not_available Farhad is here.
not_available Bring him in.
not_available You look worried.
not_available Every cop in the country is hunting this man, but we let him come here? So, how does looking like a scared girl help us? This man is our buyer.
not_available Well, we found him.
not_available We can find another.
not_available Josef, my son, we are on the verge of the biggest deal of our lives.
not_available Farhad is paying us more than anyone dreamed possible, and you want to send him away because he makes you nervous? Sit down, please.
not_available A drink first, then some food.
not_available I want to see the rods.
not_available They will be on the same ship that will transport you back to your country as soon as we have completed our financial arrangements.
not_available You'll be paid, Bazhaev, after I have the rods.
not_available They are in a secure place.
not_available Show me.
not_available You've seen the photographs.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available I want proof that the rods exist, or you will not be paid.
not_available You want proof, huh? Okay.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Josef.
not_available My younger son.
not_available Îe was transporting the rods
not_available and he was careless.
not_available There.
not_available You have your proof.
not_available Îow long will it take to get the rods to the ship? 
not_available Five hours.
not_available l want to be there to supervise the loading.
not_available Whatever you want, my friend.
not_available Now, where is my money? l'll make the calI.
not_available Agent Walker worked undercover as Renee Zadan for 1 6 months before the bust went down, and she was incarcerated.
not_available We're focusing on the period of time just after her release, when she was supposed to be in Mexico working with Jack.
not_available We're synchronizing two years of travel materials, mostly to and from Mexico City.
not_available What all do we know about this Ziya character that she's visiting? Not much.
not_available He pled out to a class
not_available three felony one month after the bust.
not_available Îe's now in Long Island City working in an auto parts store as a condition to his early release.
not_available Î¤hat's where Jack and Renee are headed now.
not_available Where exactly are they? En route.
not_available Just leaving Manhattan.
not_available Good.
not_available Chloe, download the cover materials to them.
not_available Walk them through it.
not_available Make sure there's no surprises.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available You should be receiving a consolidated timeline, plus detail files for travel and residency.
not_available Have they downloaded to your P.D.A.
not_available yet? Yes, we got it, Chloe.
not_available Oh, and Dana would like for me to review the facts with you, if that's okay.
not_available We're fine, Chloe.
not_available I know how to prep a cover.
not_available l'm sure you do, it's just that
not_available lt's all right.
not_available As soon as we got something, we'll get back to you.
not_available Okay, I guess I will leave you then.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You got a problem? No.
not_available Just that you've got everyone treating me like l'm an invalid.
not_available No one's treating you like an invalid.
not_available It's standard procedure.
not_available They're trying to sync up two cover stories.
not_available Îe's not gonna quiz me on the facts, Jack.
not_available Îe's gonna take one look at me and decide if l'm lying.
not_available I know.
not_available And whatever happens after that, we need to be ready.
not_available lt's hard being with you when you don't think that I'm up to this.
not_available l never said you weren't up to this.
not_available l said l was concerned about you.
not_available It's different.
not_available Whatever you call it, the fact is, you don't trust me, not really.
not_available So here we are
not_available Me and my babysitter.
not_available How are we on aerial? Already in place, and they're not even there yet.
not_available Jack and Renee are two minutes from target.
not_available They should arrive just before he closes up shop.
not_available Walsh.
not_available Someday you're gonna have to tell me how you picked that name.
not_available l can't talk now.
not_available l like your apartment, Jenny.
not_available Real homey.
not_available And I gotta compliment you on your housekeeping skills.
not_available Everything is in its place.
not_available And I've been admiring your photos.
not_available I hope you don't mind.
not_available l've noticed kind of a theme.
not_available You and your boyfriend, I'm guessing.
not_available ls that right? Yes.
not_available l hope it's not too serious.
not_available We're getting married, Kevin.
not_available Wow.
not_available Who would have guessed? When I saw you, you weren't exactIy wearing an engagement ring.
not_available So tell me about him.
not_available Kevin, don't.
not_available Don't what? l'm curious.
not_available Can you blame me? Îe's
not_available Îe's just a guy that I met.
not_available A guy you met.
not_available What does that mean, "a guy you met"? l just spent seven years in prison with some guys.
not_available ls that the kind of guy you mean? l'm beginning to see that we need to talk about this in person.
not_available Look, l told you that I'm in the middle of a crisis here.
not_available l can't.
not_available l don't have time.
not_available You know what, Jenny? ln my experience, when something's important, you make time for it.
not_available Don't you think? Jenny, are you there? Don't call me that.
not_available What? l said
not_available You don't tell me what to call you and what not to call you.
not_available Do you understand that? l'll call you whatever I want.
not_available You don't tell me anything, Jenny.
not_available Now, get back here.
not_available l said that l will as soon as I can.
not_available Yeah, well, it better be soon.
not_available That's him.

not_available l know, but I want to.
not_available We're closed.

not_available Well, eventually, yeah.
not_available But it's like anything else.
not_available You gotta work your way up.
not_available So why you here? l'm looking for VIadimir.

not_available Really? Why I do that? Why do you think? I don't know.

not_available Unless, of course, you're making so much money here that that's of no interest to you.
not_available See? Your greedy little eyes are saying "Show me the money." So what's the problem, Ziya? Parole bracelet? They know where I am 24
not_available 7.

not_available How do you know? 'Cause l'm constantly having to deal with people like you, that's how.
not_available l can get it off if l can just hold it steady.
not_available But they say you can't cut bracelet.
not_available l'm not gonna cut the bracelet.
not_available What have you done? What the hell have you done? 
not_available Like he said, he was trapped here.
not_available And you think he's gonna help you now? That's it.
not_available This is over.
not_available This is over! Maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started.
not_available Find something to cauterize that wound.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Who was that? U.N.
not_available Security.
not_available They're waiting for us.
not_available Sir? Are you sure you want to return to the U.N.
not_available now? Maybe you should take some time.
not_available lf we delay the disarmament talks, we give Farhad exactly what he wants.
not_available He fought me on these negotiations from the beginning.
not_available l should have seen his betrayal coming.
not_available None of us imagined he would ever do this.
not_available Îe is capable of much worse.
not_available lf he gets his hands on those uranium rods, the peace process is over, and so is my presidency.
not_available We're doing all we can to stop him.
not_available Have our security forces made any progress in the capital? Everything is under way, just as you ordered.
not_available Do you have a problem with that, Tarin? You've ordered the arrest of public officials without warrant, closed our borders.
not_available Soldiers patrol the streets, raiding homes.
not_available People are terrified.
not_available You think we are making a mistake, huh? l think we might be making the situation worse.
not_available Our own country's media is accusing you of using an iron fist.
not_available So shut them down.
not_available Sir? 
not_available Just shut them down.
not_available My brother
not_available My own brother tried to murder me today.
not_available Îe had help from people in our government.
not_available We have to take control of our country right now.
not_available Otherwise our enemies will take control.
not_available I will lose everything.
not_available It has to be done, Tarin.
not_available I have no choice.
not_available Farhad has forced me to do this.
not_available In one dayin one day
not_available he nearly destroyed everything I spent years working for.
not_available He is a traitor, and when we find him he will suffer for it.
