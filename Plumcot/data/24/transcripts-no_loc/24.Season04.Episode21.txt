
not_available People of America, you wake up today to a different world.
not_available One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you.
not_available "Wake up today to a different world.
not_available " Do we take that literally? He'll set off the warhead before dawn? A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian secured a hard drive belonging to one of Marwan's associates.
not_available It may contain information that could lead us to the warhead.
not_available I'll give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it's necessary.
not_available Mr.
not_available Koo.
not_available There's a man in your consulate by the name of Lee Jong.
not_available We need to take Mr.
not_available Lee into custody immediately for questioning.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lee is a Chinese citizen.
not_available I can't hand him over to you without going through channels.
not_available Jack.
not_available Is there any doubt in your mind that Lee is working with Marwan? No, sir.
not_available The emails he sent left no room for doubt.
not_available Then we have to get Lee now and find out what he knows.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this.
not_available Ever.
not_available I got him.
not_available Hostiles in pursuit.
not_available Bring up the van.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available The consul is dead.
not_available He was shot when armed men broke into this building and took Mr.
not_available Lee with them by force.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lee.
not_available Tell me where Habib Marwan is.
not_available Dammit, we're losing him.
not_available What is it? We can drain off the fluid, but we gotta get him to surgery now.
not_available Jack, what's going on? This is our only connection to a stolen warhead.
not_available Save him.
not_available I already have a patient.
not_available You have a new one.
not_available If you don't save him, millions will die.
not_available Jack! 
not_available I have my orders.
not_available I'm doing my job.
not_available Pauls crashing.
not_available Jack.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Jack, you son of a bitch! You killed him! 
not_available Gauze.
not_available Is he gonna make it? 
not_available We'll do our best.
not_available I just need him long enough to get the information about Marwan.
not_available I know, Jack.
not_available You made me aware of that when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines.
not_available One milligram atropine.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I don't have time now.
not_available OK, Jack, we need to leave.
not_available Tape.
not_available I'm gonna have a milligram of atropine standing by.
not_available Gauze.
not_available Gauze.
not_available Want me to run this in now? I'll be right outside.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available How could you? How could you kill him, Jack? How could you do it? 
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available No No No, Jack, I can't I can't be near you right now.
not_available Please, Audrey.
not_available Just tell me what you want me to do.
not_available Leave.
not_available I want you to leave, Jack.
not_available Jack, call the White House right away.
not_available Mike Novick needs to speak with you.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available OK, fine.
not_available What? Paul Raines just died.
not_available There was only one doctor, and I had to make a choice between Lee's life and Pauls.
not_available And I chose Lee.
not_available You did the right thing, Jack.
not_available You OK? No, I'm not OK.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Just tell me when Lee's out of surgery.
not_available I will.
not_available Mike Novick's office.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Please hold.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available Have you gotten anything useful out of Lee? 
not_available No, he's still in surgery.
not_available How's that coming along? 
not_available Not great, but he's hanging in there.
not_available We took a huge risk getting this guy on the assumption he can help us find the warhead.
not_available Trust me, Mike, I know.
not_available And we also have a new situation.
not_available What is it? When you broke into the Chinese consulate, Koo Yin, the consul, was shot.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available My men never fired.
not_available Then he was accidentally hit by one of his own people.
not_available How badly was he hurt? 
not_available He died, Jack.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Talk to the members of your team.
not_available Make sure that each one of them has an alibi for where they were during the ambush.
not_available OK.
not_available This is an extremely incendiary situation.
not_available I'm about to talk to President Palmer now.
not_available We're trying to avoid a serious confrontation with China.
not_available We'll handle it from here.
not_available Thanks, Mike.
not_available How did this happen? The network security module lit up.
not_available Someone's trying to jam our servers.
not_available Could this be a high network load? No, it's a denial of service attempt.
not_available What do you want me to do? Did it do any damage? No, the system is self
not_available defending.
not_available Use the Security Auditor tool, it'll lead us to Marwan's network.
not_available That was my point from the start.
not_available Chloe.
not_available We're in active code.
not_available We don't have time for your personality disorder.
not_available You understand? Chloe? Yes or no? Yes, sir.
not_available This is Yasir.
not_available Is the warhead in place? 
not_available Yes, but I cant jam their satellite.
not_available You assured me you could handle it.
not_available CTU must have just installed new software.
not_available This wasn't in place last week.
not_available We move our schedule forward by an hour.
not_available There won't be as many casualties if people aren't at work.
not_available If you cant jam their satellite signal, they'll find us.
not_available We can't let that happen.
not_available I understand.
not_available How long do we keep the president in the dark? Eventually he'll find out that you authorized the raid on the consulate.
not_available We have to keep it from him as long as we can.
not_available Were you able to find Jack? 
not_available Yes, he's back at CTU.
not_available The man they grabbed at the consulate, Lee Jong, is still in surgery.
not_available Was he able to tell us anything? 
not_available No.
not_available What did Jack say about the consuls death? 
not_available It wasn't our people who fired.
not_available Chinese won't care.
not_available He died as a result of our trespass.
not_available We have to construct a scenario that doesn't implicate the US government.
not_available They must know we did this.
not_available We called them about Lee Jong half an hour before the abduction.
not_available The Chinese don't want a confrontation any more than we do.
not_available If we can create plausible deniability, they may play along.
not_available How do we do that? Call CTU.
not_available Have them find out which anti
not_available Chinese factions have attacked their consulates in the last five years.
not_available Most of these groups you're talking about are Asian extremists.
not_available Bauer's team was predominantly American.
not_available Bauer's team was masked.
not_available No one saw their faces.
not_available Curtis, come here.
not_available The Chinese consul was shot and killed during Lee's extraction.
not_available How? We never got a shot off.
not_available It must have been friendly fire.
not_available We've gotta make our alibis cross
not_available check.
not_available No one outside of this operation is to know we were near the Chinese consulate.
not_available Jack, are we gonna be brought into this? 
not_available I don't know yet.
not_available AII I know is, now that the consuls been killed, everything's changed.
not_available It's our responsibility to make sure the US government is never implicated in this.
not_available Don't worry, Jack.
not_available Everyone here gets it.
not_available OK.
not_available Curtis, you advise the rest of the team.
not_available You got it.
not_available Yasir.
not_available They're ready for you to make the changes.
not_available Do you think they'll find us before we launch? Not if I move up the launch.
not_available They're looking for the warhead in their cities.
not_available They have no idea that it's going to be delivered by missile.
not_available Morrison? 
not_available Yes, sir? Open up the guidance firmware.
not_available I'm going to upload a new instruction set.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available OK, go ahead.
not_available We'll be ready to start the launch as soon as I've reprogrammed the onboard.
not_available Good.
not_available Prep your databases.
not_available When Lee come to, we have to move quickly.
not_available What about the warhead? 
not_available We're meeting on it now.
not_available I need you to free up a server for a large DOD block transfer, through a locked channel from Heller's office.
not_available Has that been authorized? No, not yet.
not_available I still have to talk to Audrey.
not_available Well, that's gonna be weird.
not_available What? Talking to Audrey.
not_available You had to do what you did and her husband died.
not_available Probably destroyed your relationship 
not_available Free up the server.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack, I just want you to know, if you ever need anyone to talk to, as a friend, I'm here for you.
not_available Not now, but later.
not_available When things calm down.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Audrey, I'm sorry to bother you.
not_available I need you to authorize a block transfer.
not_available We need all pertinent DOD databases sent over here to CTU.
not_available Were you able to keep Lee alive? Yeah, he's stabilized.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll call Marcy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The warhead was stolen in eastern Iowa.
not_available We don't know how it's being transported.
not_available Are we monitoring air traffic? 
not_available Nothing's been picked up.
not_available On the ground, how far could they have gone? A 300
not_available mile radius, which includes three metropolitan areas.
not_available Have those cities been alerted? 
not_available The president wants that restricted.
not_available We've raised alert levels, but haven't mentioned specifics.
not_available Marwan and his people have control of the warhead.
not_available We have to figure out when and where he's gonna set it off.
not_available Look at everything from satellite to local police.
not_available We have a small window.
not_available It's still the middle of the night.
not_available A trail is going to be a hell of a lot easier to follow now, than in two hours when people start going to work.
not_available Let's get to it.
not_available Howard Bern.
not_available There's a program at Division you can filter those markers through.
not_available Yeah? I've a Mr.
not_available Cheng from the Chinese consulate who wants to speak to Michelle.
not_available Michelle Dessler.
not_available My name is Cheng Zhi, head of security for the Chinese consulate.
not_available I'm sure your office is aware of the incident that happened here earlier tonight.
not_available Yes, we were sorry to hear about it.
not_available Is there anything we can do to help? I would like to come and discuss this matter with you.
not_available Of course.
not_available My office would be glad to make an appointment in the morning.
not_available No, I need to do that right now.
not_available I'm afraid that's impossible.
not_available You must know we're in the middle of a security crisis The murder of our consul on Chinese soil could be construed as an act of war.
not_available What's that have to do with us? 
not_available I believe your agency stormed the consulate and kidnapped Lee Jong.
not_available That is an outrageous accusation.
not_available An hour earlier, your government called and asked for permission to speak to Lee Jong.
not_available 30 minutes later, we were attacked.
not_available It is unlikely these two events are unrelated.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available Cheng, I can't help you.
not_available I suggest you cooperate voluntarily, otherwise I'll be forced to go above you on this.
not_available I'm sure you'll do what you have to.
not_available I mean no disrespect, but I do have to get back to work.
not_available Very well, Ms Dessler.
not_available You will be hearing from me soon.
not_available Comm confirmed we got the data.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You should get some rest.
not_available With everything going on, I can't.
not_available You could go back to the hotel.
not_available Don't tell me what to do.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What? Jack, what do you want from me? You made a choice that killed Paul and I'm trying to deal with it.
not_available We both have a job.
not_available Let's just do it.
not_available Jack.
not_available Michelle says the head of security at the Chinese consulate just called.
not_available He made it sound like he has evidence linking CTU to the abduction.
not_available What kind of evidence? 
not_available He didn't say, he wants to come talk to us.
not_available They don't have any evidence.
not_available We don't have time to deal with them now.
not_available I agree, but we don't have much choice.
not_available I need you to help me figure out how to deal with this, Jack.
not_available I need to check on Lee.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available All right.
not_available CTU just sent this over.
not_available These five groups have all made attempts to sabotage Chinese targets around the globe in the last two years.
not_available This group.
not_available People's Freedom Coalition? They've referenced Lee Jong's involvement with the Chinese nuclear programme.
not_available So an attack and the grab of Lee Jong by this group would be plausible.
not_available It would allow the Chinese to save face.
not_available If the Chinese can't prove we entered the consulate, that may be all they need.
not_available If you want, I can start leaking it to the media.
not_available Do it.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available David, what have you done? 
not_available Excuse me? I just got a call from the Secretary of State about a covert action against the Chinese.
not_available That's correct.
not_available I sanctioned it.
not_available Why would you do such a thing? 
not_available It was the only option.
not_available You know how fragile our relationship with China is? An attack on their consulate.
not_available A military engagement.
not_available A covert operation, similar to those carried out on a routine basis around the world.
not_available Don't give me a social studies lesson.
not_available We marched on Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals, and in the process the Chinese consul was killed.
not_available We were unlucky, sir.
not_available Unlucky? I'd say we were unlucky.
not_available That's the kind of thing that could start a war! How do I fight terrorists while provoking a nuclear superpower? I would advise you to calm down, sir, if we're gonna get through this day.
not_available We didn't bring this crisis on ourselves.
not_available But we're gonna be the ones to settle it.
not_available This is a dirty business, and we're gonna have to get our hands dirty to clean it up.
not_available Now, please, Mr.
not_available President, you brought me here to help you.
not_available Let me do it.
not_available Tony, what's the latest on Lee? 
not_available He's out of surgery.
not_available He'll be able to respond to questions soon.
not_available When that happens, I want everyone from comm on standby.
not_available Whatever information Lee gives us I want worked up with no time lags.
not_available We're clear about this? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Good.
not_available Secretary of State Taylor just authorized the head of security at the consulate 
not_available to come here and question us about the raid.
not_available What? In the middle of all this? All right, this breaks down very simply.
not_available They want to prove we attacked the consulate tonight.
not_available We have to make sure they can't.
not_available That ambush has to land on someone.
not_available Novick's working on that from Washington.
not_available We just have to make sure all our bases are covered.
not_available Finding that nuclear warhead is our number one priority.
not_available I'll go over the strategy with Jack.
not_available When Cheng gets here, send him to the situation room, all visible screens masked.
not_available OK.
not_available This situation with the consulate is dragging us down.
not_available We shouldn't divert resources from the warhead.
not_available Well, hopefully this will just be a formality, and we can get rid of him quickly.
not_available If we don't get information from Lee, Audrey's husband will have died for no reason.
not_available What is she still doing here? I think she wants to stay busy so she doesn't have to think about it.
not_available It's funny.
not_available When I met Audrey this afternoon, it seemed like she and Jack were totally together.
not_available A few hours later, everything's changed.
not_available Michelle.
not_available I hate being without you.
not_available I never wanted it to be this way.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng's here.
not_available Send him to the situation room.
not_available Buchanan and Jack are waiting there.
not_available Shouldn't we keep him more isolated? 
not_available No.
not_available We have to give the impression we have nothing to hide.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng? I'm Curtis Manning.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Manning.
not_available Our regional director is waiting for us in the situation room.
not_available If you'll follow me? Mr.
not_available Cheng.
not_available Bill Buchanan.
not_available Pleasure to meet you in person.
not_available My condolences for your consul.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jack Bauer from the DOD.
not_available He's working for us today.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng, please, take a seat.
not_available I know of Mr.
not_available Bauer, of course, from his previous service to this country.
not_available We knew you were in Los Angeles today.
not_available When did you arrive? Flew in a couple days ago, with Secretary Heller.
not_available I assume, then, Secretary Heller is still here? For security reasons he's at our district office.
not_available Why aren't you with him? 
not_available We felt I could be more helpful here at CTU.
not_available That's odd.
not_available Not really.
not_available I used to run this office.
not_available If there's anyone capable of leading a covert operation at short notice, you'd be ideal.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng, this kind of 
not_available It's all right, Bill, I've got it.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng, I can assure you that neither CTU nor I had anything to do with the terrible events that took place at your consulate tonight.
not_available I assume you know this man.
not_available Howard Bern, one of your field agents.
not_available This was taken by one of our surveillance cameras tonight.
not_available This photograph has been altered.
not_available To make it clearer.
not_available Or to set up a scenario you can utilize for political propaganda.
not_available No.
not_available We ran this image through our database.
not_available The computer picked Mr.
not_available Bern as a near
not_available perfect match.
not_available Did your database include members of the People's Freedom Coalition? According to our information, they're most likely behind this.
not_available That would be pointless.
not_available This man is not Asian.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng, we both know that the PFC has initiated terrorist activity around the globe, utilizing European mercenaries, half a dozen of which are a closer match to this photo than Agent Bern.
not_available I take it Mr.
not_available Bern is not available to question? 
not_available No, he's not here tonight.
not_available Of course.
not_available You know it would not be in America's best interests to provoke the Chinese government.
not_available Then what are we playing these games for? you asked us to give up Lee Jong.
not_available Before our government can comply, the consul was attacked, Lee Jong disappeared.
not_available Now you tell me you do not have Lee Jong, Howard Bern is not available.
not_available What are you hiding? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available We're just extremely busy.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available We are faced with unprecedented Are we positive? OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We have confirmation on Marwan's last location.
not_available Follow up on that.
not_available I'll handle the rest of Mr.
not_available Cheng's questions.
not_available I'd like to see the hourlies for Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Have Bern meet me in the east corridor.
not_available Get a chopper ready now.
not_available Meet Jack in the east corridor now.
not_available Flight ops.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Jack Bauer's requesting a helicopter standing by.
not_available OK.
not_available Done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Follow me.
not_available What's going on? Camera at the consulate picked up your face.
not_available I was wearing my mask.
not_available Trust me, I saw the freeze
not_available frame.
not_available It was you.
not_available Jack, the guy ripped the mask from my face, I pulled it right back down.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available Leave the city.
not_available We're working out a scenario.
not_available You're gonna have to answer questions for the Chinese.
not_available I didn't think anyone saw me, so I didn't bring it up.
not_available Don't worry, we'll handle it.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available You gotta go.
not_available There's a chopper waiting for you.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Lee Jong's coming out of anesthesia.
not_available He should be ready for questioning.
not_available Agent Raab's there.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available You ready? 
not_available All my databases are active.
not_available Doctor, that's enough.
not_available He's mine now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tell him he's in critical condition.
not_available I'll ask questions.
not_available When he answers, I'II let the doctor treat him.
not_available He understands.
not_available I know he worked on the warhead.
not_available Now he needs to tell us where it is.
not_available He doesn't know, but he knows where Marwan might be.
not_available Might be? In the van he told me he knew where he was.
not_available Marwan's been moving around.
not_available Where? 
not_available He has three locations Marwan's using.
not_available What are they? 
not_available The Rockland building.
not_available We know.
not_available A bar downtown.
not_available We know that too.
not_available A factory on Sixth.
not_available Where on Sixth? 
not_available Sixth and Alameda.
not_available Get me an exact address.
not_available That's the one we're looking for.
not_available Assemble a team, make sure Curtis is on it.
not_available They need to be ready to move now.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Yes? The investigator from the Chinese wants to talk to you.
not_available Why does he want to talk to me? To protect Jack's cover, we put together some new hourlies.
not_available They show you and Jack working together at the time of the ambush.
not_available Buchanan wants me to lie to protect Jack? 
not_available Not to protect Jack.
not_available To protect the United States government.
not_available Is that gonna be a problem? Where are the hourlies? Edgar's sending them to your system.
not_available I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.
not_available I understand.
not_available But whatever you decide, you're still gonna have to talk to Cheng.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Lee gave us a probable location on Marwan.
not_available I'm being called in for questioning.
not_available By who? Cheng, from the Chinese consulate.
not_available Come here.
not_available Why you? Buchanan modified the hourlies so it looked like you were with me during the abduction.
not_available Whatever Buchanan laid out, stick to it.
not_available We need to sideline Cheng now.
not_available Why? Lee's incriminated himself, the Chinese won't try to protect him.
not_available That's not what this is.
not_available The Chinese consul was killed during Lee's extraction.
not_available The government cannot be held responsible.
not_available What are you doing? You have broken every major protocol set by CTU and the DOD for what? Is any of this working? You're still alive.
not_available Your father's still alive.
not_available And we stopped all but one of the power plants from melting down.
not_available Yeah, it's working.
not_available And we have to fight to keep it working.
not_available Do what you have to, Audrey.
not_available I'm sorry, I've gotta go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello.
not_available I got Jack's approach on Marwan's location.
not_available Good.
not_available Upload it to the teams, send a copy to Tony.
not_available He's running point on this end.
not_available You got it.
not_available I am surprised that after you were kidnapped, that you stayed on to work here.
not_available That must have been very difficult.
not_available I wasn't physically hurt.
not_available I want to help find the people who planned these attacks.
not_available Very admirable.
not_available Now, I looked through the hourlies for Mr.
not_available Bauer, your associate.
not_available I notice from 1am to 3am, you and he were working on some data processing tasks.
not_available Yes, that's correct.
not_available Who did you give the information to? Edgar Stiles.
not_available Why does that matter? They go to all this trouble to reenlist a man who used to run this place, Jack Bauer, and he's doing data processing? 
not_available It's much more subtle than it sounds.
not_available There are hundreds of lists to cross
not_available reference, and with Mr.
not_available Bauer's experience, we were able to narrow the search.
not_available I am surprised.
not_available Why's that? Meaning no disrespect, the log shows that your husband, Paul Raines, was at the clinic during those same hours.
not_available And unfortunately he passed away.
not_available What's your point? I don't believe you were with Jack Bauer, mining data.
not_available You were waiting for your husband in surgery, and you're lying to me now to cover for Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng, I'm not going to allow you to stand there and accuse my people of Lying.
not_available And I'm not going to stand here to endure half
not_available baked alibis.
not_available You can believe whatever you want.
not_available My answers stand.
not_available Now, if we are done, I do have to get back to work.
not_available If you'll excuse me.
not_available Manning.
not_available President Palmer for Jack.
not_available It's the White House.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, this is David Palmer.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available CTU tells me you got something from Lee.
not_available We got a location on Habib Marwan.
not_available We're en route with tactical teams.
not_available We're hopeful we can end this soon.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available This warhead can detonate any moment.
not_available We know, sir.
not_available Jack.
not_available Tell me about the representative from the Chinese consulate, Cheng.
not_available Is he still at CTU? 
not_available He was there when we left.
not_available Are we OK there? They have a surveillance photo of one of my team members.
not_available We told them the photo wasn't clear enough to be conclusive.
not_available That'll hold them for a while.
not_available I see.
not_available Thank you, Jack.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available And good luck.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available All right, Mike.
not_available I'm gonna need you to advise the president that Cheng has to leave CTU now.
not_available Logan was clear that he wanted Cheng to have access.
not_available And he has.
not_available But now Cheng is slowing them down.
not_available He's got to go.
not_available CTU needs to be able to do their job without the added pressure of a cover
not_available up.
not_available You think you can get President Logan to sign off on that? I'll see what I can do.
not_available Yes.
not_available No, not now, Keith, I have too many things to deal with first.
not_available Yes, you do that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What is it, Mike? The Chinese security officer, Cheng, is still at CTU, and seems to be slowing things down.
not_available He wouldn't be there if Palmer hadn't attacked his consulate.
not_available It's too late to change that now, sir.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available If we order Cheng to leave CTU now, itll look like we've got something to hide, and we'll just be giving the Chinese all the justification they need to escalate this crisis.
not_available If we don't find that warhead before it's deployed, ten million Americans could face annihilation.
not_available We could be at war with a billion Chinese.
not_available My advice is to worry about the Americans now and the Chinese later.
not_available Your advice? Or David Palmer's advice? Both of ours.
not_available When I agreed to let you bring Palmer in, it wasn't so you could ally against me.
not_available That's not what's happening.
not_available Tell me what's happening.
not_available You and David Palmer are running this country while I'm taking phone calls.
not_available Would you like me to ask President Palmer to leave? No.
not_available Call CTU.
not_available Tell Bill Buchanan to escort Mr.
not_available Cheng out of the building.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Put Michaels in play now.
not_available We're outside the factory, our men are in position.
not_available Can you confirm Marwan's inside? I can't say, but I'm detecting a microwave uplink.
not_available Can you intercept it? 
not_available No, it's got encryption.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available We ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How do we confirm Marwan's inside? We don't.
not_available But we're out of time.
not_available We move now.
not_available Give all teams a go.
not_available All right.
not_available All teams, it's a go.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, this matter will be pursued.
not_available I will return with a formal order for an extensive investigation.
not_available I understand.
not_available If I were you I'd focus my attention on the People's Freedom Coalition.
not_available I'm quite sure they are your perpetrators.
not_available We'll do everything we can to help you.
not_available Sir.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Jack's team's outside the building.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Mr.
not_available Cheng, excuse me, please.
not_available I have to get back.
not_available My men will escort you from the building.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Edgar? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Edgar Stiles? Communication analyst, right? Yeah, I'm busy.
not_available I forgot to ask Mr.
not_available Buchanan one thing.
not_available Maybe you could help.
not_available You should ask him.
not_available It's not classified.
not_available Audrey Raines had mentioned to me that you were helping her earlier with some DOD files.
not_available Yeah, until she was called to the clinic.
not_available So it was just you and Jack then? What? 
not_available Edgar, come here.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Bye.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Idiot.
not_available Just keep your mouth shut.
not_available I didn't say anything.
not_available Michaels, are you in position? 
not_available Roger that.
not_available He's at your two o'clock.
not_available Take him out.
not_available Copy that.
not_available We're ready.
not_available Start the sequence.
not_available We're done here.
not_available Get the car.
not_available He's cornered.
not_available Counter flank and push him back to me.
not_available Copy.
not_available Freeze! I've been waiting for this.
not_available You're too late.
not_available That hurts, doesn't it? Jack.
not_available Jack, what are you doing? We still need him.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Kill me.
not_available That won't stop the missile.
not_available What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Jack, we got a problem.
not_available Better take a look at this.
not_available Secure the prisoner.
not_available Oh, my God, they've got a missile.
not_available Have you got your comm unit? Patch it through.
not_available Tony, can you hear me? Yeah? 
not_available I'm looking at a live feed of the warhead.
not_available It's on a missile.
not_available Missile? How can that be? I don't know.
not_available We're trying to get the feed over to you now.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Once he does, lock it on.
not_available All right, we got it.
not_available Coming up on the screen.
not_available Have you got it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How much time have we got? Tony, can you see this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you get the source of the transmission? Hang on a second.
not_available No, it's on an encrypted uplink.
not_available No way to trace it.
not_available Do a geography scan, see if you can pull a location.
not_available Chloe, anything specific on the visual? Looks like a forest area.
not_available Trees, a structure 
not_available Tony, we're out of time.
not_available We're trying.
not_available We can't ID the location, it's too general.
not_available Edgar, see if you can pick up a heat signature.
not_available I'll try, but it's a wide radius.
not_available There won't be time to stop this.
not_available Chloe, do you have anything? I'm trying the four
not_available band satellite, but it's not working either.
