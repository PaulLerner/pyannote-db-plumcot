
not_available Can I assume there is no change in the status of President Hassan? I'm afraid not.
not_available Then he is still being held by terrorists.
not_available If Hassan dies, there is no treaty.
not_available If I didn't know better, I'd think you were hoping for that to happen.
not_available Jack thinks that someone inside of CTU is working for the terrorists.
not_available Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash.
not_available If someone did call and tip him off, we can get the number off the memory.
not_available It's Dana's phone.
not_available I spoke to Hastings.
not_available He cleared me through.
not_available Stay where you are and keep your hands where I can CHLOE: She just entered the parking garage.
not_available The only reason you've got any leverage right now is because President Hassan is alive.
not_available So stop screwing with me! They are gonna force him to make a statement, and then they're going to kill him.
not_available SAMIR: Just read the statement, no more.
not_available You will renounce the peace agreement.
not_available I will never do that.
not_available MARCOS: He's stronger than we thought.
not_available Bury him.
not_available SAMIR: I will tell the world of his crimes.
not_available This man is not our president! He's an arrogant HASTINGS: Jack, looks like Samir's wrapping up.
not_available We need you to get in there right now! JACK: I have a visual on Hassan.
not_available Ready to engage.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yes? Excuse me, ma'am.
not_available I have Jack Bauer on the line for you.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Jack Madam President, I don't know what to say except that I'm sorry.
not_available I trust there was nothing you and your team could have done differently.
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available President Hassan was dead before we even got there.
not_available Then you don't owe me an apology.
not_available I failed you, ma'am.
not_available It was Hassan's choice to surrender himself in order to save American lives.
not_available It was out of your hands.
not_available Don't put this responsibility on yourself.
not_available Madam President, you need to keep this peace agreement alive.
not_available There can't be any agreement when the IRK is without a leader, Jack.
not_available The hardliners there will take advantage of the vacuum and
not_available and reverse all the progress we made with Hassan.
not_available I'm gonna have to address the delegates in a few minutes and announce the dissolution of the peace summit, and, and formally release them.
not_available Ma'am, if you give up, it means they win.
not_available I don't see another choice, Jack.
not_available I
not_available I wish to God I did.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Jack.
not_available What's his condition? He took a round to the shoulder, another through the abdomen, but it exited clean.
not_available BP looks steady.
not_available Look, we need this guy for questioning.
not_available Is he going to make it or not? Doesn't look like any vitals were hit.
not_available He'll live.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll transport him back to CTU.
not_available Medical will take him for now.
not_available Jack.
not_available President Taylor is going to formally announce the end of the peace conference.
not_available Jack, you did everything you could.
not_available It wasn't enough.
not_available We should get back to CTU.
not_available Why? The fuel rods have been recovered.
not_available The peace conference is over.
not_available Everybody who was responsible is either dead or in custody.
not_available JACK: Cole.
not_available What's the status on Samir? He's still unconscious, but the EMTs say he'll make it.
not_available Okay, good.
not_available I want you to stay with him.
not_available I'm handing over complete authority and responsibility for his transport to you.
not_available Are you heading back to CTU? No.
not_available We're going home.
not_available We're done.
not_available COLE: Hastings is still probably going to want to debrief both of you.
not_available I'm sure he will.
not_available He knows how to find me.
not_available I'm sorry it ended up like this, Jack.
not_available Me, too.
not_available You're a good agent, Cole.
not_available I wouldn't be standing here without you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I hope everything works out.
not_available I'll pack my kit up downstairs.
not_available WOODS: Madam President.
not_available The delegates are assembled in the lounge, as you requested.
not_available Let's get this over with.
not_available FEMALE REPORTER: discontinue the peace summit that was to be a cornerstone of her administration.
not_available President Hassan apparently had been kidnapped earlier, and then taken to Jamot.
not_available On behalf of my country, you have our deepest sympathy for this terrible tragedy.
not_available Though, on a personal level, I imagine you have mixed feelings right now.
not_available Beg your pardon? Hassan had you arrested without cause during his purge of suspected enemies.
not_available Allowed you to be brutally interrogated.
not_available I would think you have little love for the man.
not_available President Hassan was under tremendous duress, and he lost his way, but I never stopped believing in what he stood for.
not_available Of course.
not_available I meant no offense.
not_available I'm sure you didn't.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available While we have not learned the identity of the terrorist in the video President Taylor.
not_available Minister Jamot.
not_available If you can spare a few moments, I need to speak with you.
not_available I will be happy to sit down with you after I have addressed the other delegations.
not_available I know you're intending to announce the end of the peace summit, but there may be a way to prevent that from happening.
not_available Before you do anything, I need you to hear what I have to say.
not_available All right.
not_available Ma'am, what about the delegates? Just just give me a moment.
not_available Let's go in here.
not_available Please.
not_available Federal agents mounted an operation to rescue President Hassan from the terrorists that commenced approximately 30 minutes ago.
not_available Yes? Samir's men were all dead, thanks to the Americans.
not_available Samir was the only one left, but I took care of him.
not_available So, there's no connection to us? We're in the clear? Maybe not.
not_available There was a woman there who might have recognized me.
not_available What woman? She may be CTUI'm not sure
not_available but I've seen her face before.
not_available Where? Six years ago, when we were using that mobster, Vladimir Laitanan, to smuggle military weapons out of the country, she was with him.
not_available Are you sure it was her? I don't forget faces.
not_available Where is she now? In a taxicab, just ahead of me, with Jack Bauer.
not_available Bauer? Are they going to CTU? I don't think so, no.
not_available Then, it seems unlikely she recognized you.
not_available Better not to take the chance.
not_available I'll take out Bauer, too, while I'm at it.
not_available The Americans believe the IRK were solely behind the recent attacks.
not_available Killing Bauer and this woman would only alert them to the fact that others were involved.
not_available How long before they discover that it was us? It will take even less time if this woman remembers me.
not_available What are my orders? Continue to follow themkeep them in sight
not_available and I'll get back to you.
not_available I don't have the words to tell you and Kayla how sorry I am.
not_available I know you did everything in your power.
not_available Jamot, I wasn't aware that you were here.
not_available I only arrived a short time ago.
not_available I want you to know that, in our last few hours together, Omar expressed his regrets to me, not the least of which was his treatment of you.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hassan, I realize our timing is intrusive, but there's something we need to discuss privately.
not_available Did you find him, President Taylor? The man who killed my father? Samir Mehran.
not_available Yes.
not_available He was badly wounded, but he'll live to stand trial.
not_available And, believe me, he will pay dearly for what he's done.
not_available Kayla, darling, I need to speak with President Taylor alone.
not_available Give us a few minutes.
not_available What is it that you wish to talk to me about? Mrs.
not_available Hassan, as you know, for almost a year, your husband and I worked to make this peace agreement a reality.
not_available Now, in that time, I saw the kind of leader he was.
not_available He managed against difficult odds to bring a fractious and contentious parliament together.
not_available But, now that he's gone, your country is going to be thrown into turmoil.
not_available I am aware of the challenges that we are facing.
not_available Why are you telling me this? Clearly, someone needs to take the reigns of the IRK government.
not_available Someone who believes in the same ideals and principles as Omar Hassan, and who shares his strength.
not_available Minister Jamot believes that that person should be you.
not_available What?! I'm not the only one who believes it.
not_available I've spoken to our delegation, as well as with the other members of our cabinet back home.
not_available You represent our best.
not_available Our only real chance to preserve our government and your husband's agenda.
not_available You are out of your mind! I am no politician.
not_available But you are a martyr's wife.
not_available And history has proven that to be something far more powerful.
not_available You have always been popular with the people.
not_available The vast majority of them want peace.
not_available They will rally around you.
not_available The Council of Guardian will have no choice but to recognize you as successor to the presidency.
not_available But I have a choice.
not_available You assume too much of me, Jamot.
not_available I realize that this is a lot to consider, especially now while you're grieving, but without a unifying figure to hold your country together, everything your husband worked for will be for nothing.
not_available President Taylor, my marriage to Omar was far from perfect.
not_available We had many problems for a very long time.
not_available I know only too well how difficult it is for a marriage to survive a life in politics.
not_available But through it all, I never stopped loving him.
not_available Or sharing his desire for better relations with the West.
not_available If it is the will of my people and of my government, I will take my husband's place at the peace conference.
not_available It will be my honor to stand with you.
not_available We'll make the announcement together from the United Nations.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hassan, thank you.
not_available She's going to do it.
not_available Oh, that's incredible news, Madam President.
not_available I want every delegate contacted personally.
not_available Tell them to cancel any plans to leave the country.
not_available We are returning to the UN.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I'll also call CTU and implement those changes we discussed if I still have your permission.
not_available That's your decision.
not_available Do what you think is best.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Where's Bauer? Jack left the scene, took Renee with him.
not_available Hassan's death hit him pretty hard.
not_available Samir's been taken to Medical to get patched up.
not_available Is he conscious? Barely.
not_available You let me know the second he's ready for questioning.
not_available All right.
not_available Put him through.
not_available CTU.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available This is Tim Woods with Homeland Security.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll put you through to Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Actually, I'm calling to speak with you, Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Me? Are you sure? I know this is an unusual circumstance, so I'll get straight to the point.
not_available President Taylor and the foreign dignitaries are returning to the UN shortly where the president will announce her intent to move forward with the signing of the peace agreement.
not_available Well, excuse me, but how can she do that without President Hassan? I'm not at liberty to say just yet, but our immediate concern is whether CTU is capable of handling security for the rest of the process.
not_available It's already been infiltrated by an enemy agent, compromised more than once today.
not_available We cannot have any more mistakes.
not_available Are you suggesting I'm responsible for those mistakes? On the contrary.
not_available I reviewed the hourly reports, and from what I see, you've made some astute calls, and have proven to be very resourceful throughout this crisis.
not_available Okay.
not_available So why are you calling me? I'm relieving Brian Hastings of his post effective immediately.
not_available We're now in the process of vetting suitable candidates to replace him, but until we find someone, you'll have provisional command.
not_available You're You're putting me in charge? For the time being.
not_available I know your record at CTU's L.A.
not_available branch, and how important you were during the Sangala crisis.
not_available There's nobody in that building that has more experience than you do.
not_available Sir, you're making a mistake.
not_available What happened with President Hassan, and everything else
not_available it wasn't Mr.
not_available Hastings' fault.
not_available Chloe, I don't have time to debate this with you.
not_available Division feels you are the most qualified to step in, and I agree.
not_available My decision's made.
not_available Now accept it, and let's move on.
not_available Does Mr.
not_available Hastings know? Division's informing him as we speak.
not_available Just try to make the transition as quick and painless as possible.
not_available I'll be in touch as soon as the president arrives at the UN.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Come in.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hastings? It's okay, Chloe.
not_available I just want you to know, I don't think it's fair what they're doing, laying all the blame on you.
not_available Everything that happens here is my responsibility.
not_available The successes and the failures.
not_available I recruited Dana Walsh into this agency, so I let the snake into the garden.
not_available I need to review protocols with you.
not_available Let's not waste any time.
not_available Did you live here long? No.
not_available Just during my recovery.
not_available You know, I still think I got some coffee around here.
not_available What's her name, your granddaughter? Teri.
not_available Kim named her after her mom.
not_available Jack, listen, I know that we've said a lot of things to each other, and you've made promises to me about I just want you to know that I'm not gonna hold you to them.
not_available It's been a terrible day, and I know that we
not_available we say things in the moment, and I just I don't want you to Hello? Somebody there? Take my briefcase to Marine One, and tell the Secret Service I'll be ready to leave shortly.
not_available And send Mr.
not_available Novakovich in.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Mr.
not_available Novakovich.
not_available Thank you for seeing me, Madam President.
not_available Not at all.
not_available What can I do for you? I just had a curious phone call from Tim Woods indicating that you are intending to move forward with the peace initiative with the IRK.
not_available That's correct.
not_available May I ask how you propose to do this, considering their leader is dead? Well, I intended to answer that question during my address to the Assembly, but since you're asking Dalia Hassan will be signing the agreement in her husband's stead.
not_available That's an interesting idea, Madam President, but I don't see how she would have the authority to sign such a document.
not_available She's getting it from her government now.
not_available Their parliament called an emergency session to ratify her as provisional president.
not_available The letter confirming that is forthcoming.
not_available Madam President, I appreciate your optimism, but I don't understand how you can believe that installing Hassan's widow as some kind of figurehead will alleviate our concerns about the instability of the IRK government.
not_available With President Hassan dead, the opposition will only get stronger.
not_available Hassan's death will galvanize his supporters and every advocate of this peace process to endorse her as his successor.
not_available You can't be certain of that.
not_available Once again, Mr.
not_available Novakovich, you're giving every indication that Russia has no interest in this peace accord.
not_available I'm sorry that you feel that way, Madam President, but the fact remains that we are no longer confident that any meaningful progress can be made.
not_available Respectfully, my country will be declining to sign your peace document.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do I need to take this up with President Suvarov myself? If you like, but I can assure you, I have full authority on this matter.
not_available Any decision that I make represents the formal position of the Russian government.
not_available Good day.
not_available Agent Peters, I need to see Secretary Kanin now.
not_available MAN: Yes, Madam President.
not_available Liberty's on the move.
not_available We managed to clear a blockage in one of your coronary arteries, and the X
not_available rays show the heart muscle damage to be less than we expected.
not_available In other words, I'm a tough son of a bitch.
not_available You're a lucky man, I'll say that for you, Mr.
not_available Secretary.
not_available I guess that means I can resume my duties.
not_available Although the procedure was noninvasive, I'd prefer it if you took it easy for a little while.
not_available That isn't a no.
not_available Hello, Ethan.
not_available How are you feeling? Well, uh, I've seen better days.
not_available Would you give us a few moments, please? Thank you.
not_available You heard about Hassan? Tim Woods told me.
not_available He also filled me in on the IRK plan to install Dalia Hassan.
not_available What do you think? Her family's well connected and powerful.
not_available I think it's an inspired idea.
not_available Well, the Russians don't.
not_available Novakovich told me in no uncertain terms they won't accept her.
not_available They're using it as an excuse to pull out of the signing.
not_available Even if the IRK has a new leader, the peace agreement won't stand without Moscow's endorsement.
not_available I need your help, Ethan.
not_available You got the Russians to the table.
not_available What can I do to keep them there? There may be someone who can help us here.
not_available But you're not gonna like it.
not_available Who? Charles Logan.
not_available Logan? Ethan, you can't be serious.
not_available The man's a criminal.
not_available I don't care if he was pardoned.
not_available I didn't agree with President Daniels' decision, either, but the fact is he's left several messages at my office over the past hour.
not_available Apparently, he's aware of the Russians' reticence in signing the agreement; he's offered his assistance.
not_available How could he possibly know about this? Well, despite his political downfall, he's managed to maintain a uniquely close relationship with Moscow.
not_available His messages indicated he has information which might prove useful in keeping the Russians at the table.
not_available What information? He didn't say.
not_available (sighs): Allison I don't trust this man any more than you do, but I'd be remiss if I didn't urge you to at least hear him out.
not_available Okay, listen up, everyone, please.
not_available I've never been very good at good
not_available byes.
not_available But I want to tell you what an honor it's been for me to have served with each and every one of you.
not_available Division is now vetting names to replace me.
not_available In the meantime, Chloe O'Brian will be in charge, and I'm sure you will show her the same level of loyalty and commitment that you've all shown me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sir Aw, don't worry, Chloe, you can do this.
not_available I hope so.
not_available I just want to say, we had a rough start, but I eventually really enjoyed working for you.
not_available Well, I'm happy to say that I was wrong about you.
not_available If I had listened to you in the beginning, maybe things would have turned out differently.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available I'll be at Division debriefing.
not_available But I'm available to you if you have any questions.
not_available (exhales): Thank you, sir.
not_available Good luck.
not_available GUARD: Mr.
not_available Hastings.
not_available I have Agent Ortiz on the line.
not_available They have a situation in Medical.
not_available This one's all yours, Chloe.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Cole, it's Chloe.
not_available Where's Hastings? He's not here.
not_available What happened? Samir's just gone into cardiac arrest.
not_available What? DOCTOR: I need four milligrams epinephrine and 275 lidocaine.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Clear! Going again at 360.
not_available Clear! What happened? I thought his injuries were not life
not_available threatening.
not_available So did I.
not_available Where the hell is Hastings? He's been removed by Division.
not_available Who's in command? I am
not_available until they find a replacement.
not_available You were with Samir the whole time? All the way from the scene, yeah.
not_available What about at the scene? He may have been out of my sight for a few minutes.
not_available Emergency personnel were with him.
not_available Look, we got to move his body to the morgue for an autopsy.
not_available Not yet
not_available order a preliminary toxicology panel.
not_available But they'll run a full panel during the autopsy.
not_available I want it done now! Chloe, he was barely conscious.
not_available He couldn't have taken something to off himself.
not_available No, but somebody could have given it to him.
not_available Do what she says.
not_available I'll be in Hastings' office
not_available my office.
not_available Let me know when you find something.
not_available A few of the more conservative members of our delegation may continue to resist you, but we can we can persuade them.
not_available Perhaps if I spoke to them personally.
not_available A very good idea.
not_available Miss Kayla, I didn't get a chance to tell you how deeply sorry I am.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well I will see you both back at the U.N.
not_available The U.N.? I thought you were going home.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available There are new developments.
not_available I'll explain them to you on the way.
not_available What is going on, Mother? Why did President Taylor and Jamot want to speak with you alone? They have asked me to consider staying on to complete your father's work.
not_available I don't understand
not_available what does that mean? Our party wishes to appoint me as the new president.
not_available What was your answer? You told them you couldn't possibly accept, not after what's happened.
not_available Kayla! Our country is on the verge of a coup by the people responsible for the murder of your father.
not_available Someone must lead.
not_available You can't beat them, don't you realize that by now? I don't believe that; I won't.
not_available And the greatest blow I can strike against them is to sign the peace agreement.
not_available This will be your father's legacy.
not_available It will be a death sentence for you! You want peace to live, but all these people want is anarchy.
not_available Oh, Mother, they'll kill you! Enough! You are not the only one who has suffered today.
not_available This was not an easy decision for me, but it was mine to make.
not_available I do not need you to remind me of the danger.
not_available I need you to help me be strong.
not_available Now, pull yourself together
not_available there is a car waiting for us.
not_available Well, I'm sure the media does want a response, but I'm not ready to give them one just yet.
not_available They'll have to wait.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The press secretary says the Russians are already leaking to the news channels their intention to "reluctantly" pull out of the talks.
not_available They don't like wasting time.
not_available Has my guest arrived? Yes, ma'am.
not_available I had Secret Service bring him in through the freight entrance and then deliver him discreetly to conference room number three, as you asked.
not_available Thank you, Tim.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Madam President, let me convey my condolences on the loss of President Hassan.
not_available I know you worked closely with him.
not_available This must be very hard for you.
not_available Thank you for your sympathy, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you alone.
not_available This is my executive assistant, Jason Pillar.
not_available I assure you he can be trusted.
not_available Well, forgive me if I don't give much weight to your endorsement.
not_available He needs to leave.
not_available Will you excuse us, Jason? Let's get something straight.
not_available I agreed to this meeting only at the behest of Secretary Kanin.
not_available Now, I'm not sure you're entirely aware of the situation.
not_available My understanding is, the Russians are rejecting Dalia Hassan as a legitimate successor, and as a result, won't sign off on the peace agreement.
not_available You're well informed.
not_available I have close friends in Moscow.
not_available In some ways, people there appreciate me more than people in my own country.
not_available It wasn't their constitution you trampled.
not_available The Russians have been trying to back out of this agreement from day one.
not_available Do you honestly think your relationships can change their minds? I'm certain I can.
not_available How? Let's just say I'm going to be able to exercise some leverage.
not_available What kind of leverage? If it gets the job done, does it really matter? It does to me.
not_available I can promise you no laws'll be broken, nothing will tarnish you or your presidency, but the details really must stay between me and the Russians.
not_available You and President Hassan created the framework for the most significant peace in a generation, and you got (chuckles): the entire world behind it.
not_available To let the Russians tear down what should be the crown jewel in your administration Don't play me.
not_available This is about you trying to repair your reputation.
not_available Is that so hard to understand? You participated in a conspiracy to cover up the assassination of David Palmer.
not_available I was trying to protect the country from an unnecessary trauma Don't! You were doing what was best for yourself.
not_available Yes.
not_available You're right, Madam President.
not_available You're right.
not_available I suppose I've spent so many years trying to justify my actions that it's become difficult for me to own up to the truth.
not_available I made mistakes, terrible mistakes, that stained the office of the presidency and for which I will be paying the rest of my life.
not_available But I still can be of value to my country.
not_available I can still do some good.
not_available Look, we both know you wouldn't have called me unless you were out of options, so we can continue to dwell on the past, or you can let me pursue the only chance you have of resurrecting the peace process.
not_available Please.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What do you intend to do first? Arrange a meeting with the Russian delegate Novakovich.
not_available Uh, get a message to him at his hotel.
not_available Tell him that you are sending over your official emissary to have a talk with him.
not_available What if he doesn't agree to this meeting? Make sure he knows it's me.
not_available He'll agree to it.
not_available God help you if you make me regret this.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available You okay? Perfect.
not_available Promise? Hmm.
not_available I am so thirsty.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Do you want me to get you something to drink? Okay.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Jack, your cell's ringing.
not_available Don't worry about it, let it go.
not_available Hello.
not_available Jack's phone.
not_available Renee, it's Chloe.
not_available I need to talk to Jack.
not_available What's wrong? Samir Mehran is dead.
not_available I think he was assassinated.
not_available What do you mean, assassinated? I ran a preliminary toxicology report.
not_available It showed traces of an unidentified toxin in his bloodstream.
not_available Someone must have injected him with it, probably at the scene.
not_available There was, there was an EMT there.
not_available He looked familiar.
not_available There was so much going on, I
not_available I didn't take much notice.
not_available Familiar? From where? I need you to get my FBI case files.
not_available Get me everything you have on Red Square.
not_available You think he was from the Russian Mob? He looked like somebody who was with Vladimir Laitanan during the time I was under.
not_available That was six years ago.
not_available Are you sure? Honestly, no.
not_available Just send me the case files, all the surveillance photos that were taken, and I'll see if he's in there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jack you need to hear this.
not_available Samir Renee! CHLOE: Renee? JACK: Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Jack.
not_available Renee, are you there? Jack.
not_available Don't talk, I'm gonna get you to a hospital.
not_available Did something happen? Who is this? It's Chloe.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Renee's been hit by a sniper through the window of my apartment.
not_available We're still taking fire.
not_available I need a trauma team at St.
not_available Andrew's now.
not_available Hold on, stay with me.
