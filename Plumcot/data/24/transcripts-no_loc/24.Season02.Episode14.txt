
not_available There's no chance that this bomb is ever gonna go off with a Special Ops team following it every step of the way.
not_available Jack Bauer found the Coral Snake commandos.
not_available All six members of the team had been killed.
not_available If there's something thatyou haven't told me Ask Sherry.
not_available She's the one you wanna talkto.
not_available My father works for the government.
not_available He said someone's gonna detonate a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today.
not_available I'm gonna show you something.
not_available What is it? It's a bomb shelter.
not_available It happened.
not_available The bomb went off? The radiation.
not_available We gotta get down below, before it's too late.
not_available Hello? 
not_available There has been a change of plans.
not_available Why? What's going on? Marie, our mission depends on you now.
not_available I'm counting on you.
not_available They're a rogue unit, acting on their own authority.
not_available How do I find them? 
not_available Somewhere at the airport.
not_available Our best bet is still you getting past them to the bomb.
not_available There is a nuclear warhead somewhere on
not_available site.
not_available There it is! Go, go! Putyour hands above your head! Keep 'em there! This isn't a bomb.
not_available It's been rigged to look like one.
not_available This is not the bomb.
not_available This is a decoy.
not_available I repeat: we are still looking for the nuclear device.
not_available OK, let's go easy with this.
not_available Go.
not_available You have to process the prints here.
not_available Bring in your mobile equipment.
not_available You! Where's the real bomb? Where's the real bomb? Do you understand me? Do you speak any English? Do you speak any English? 
not_available Search him.
not_available I'll get us a translator.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available This is Jack Bauer requesting a translator in hangar 21.
not_available I repeat: I am requesting a translator in hangar 21.
not_available Mr Mason, Jack Bauer is on line two.
not_available Good.
not_available George.
not_available How's the search going over there, Jack? Still no new leads on where the bomb is.
not_available What about that plane you found the decoy in? It's clean.
not_available Use reverse
not_available time satellite to trace the plane to its original location.
not_available That's where they would've loaded the decoy.
not_available Find out who the players are.
not_available Here and here.
not_available George? You with me? George, can you hear me? Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available George! Yeah, I'm on it! Reverse
not_available time satellite.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm really sorry about everything that's happened to you today.
not_available But if you can't think clearly, you need to let someone else take over command.
not_available There isn't anybody else, Jack.
not_available What about Tony? I got it together.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available All right? Yeah, OK.
not_available We do have another problem.
not_available What? The six dead commandos you found, turns out a seventh may have escaped.
not_available I examined all the gunshot wounds.
not_available Three of the commandos knewthe shooter 
not_available their wounds were at close range.
not_available The others showed signs of a struggle, which indicates they had time to react.
not_available So the seventh didn't escape.
not_available Right.
not_available He was a shooter.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Get me an ID on the seventh commando as soon as you can.
not_available I'm working on it.
not_available Good.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available A wallet, no ID, no credit cards.
not_available He wants to talk.
not_available Where the hell is my translator? Mr Warner, it's your daughter Kate.
not_available Kate? Dad? Kate, where are you? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm at an airport.
not_available The airport? Are you leaving the city? Notyet.
not_available I'm helping one of the agents on an investigation.
not_available Dad did they tell you about Reza? Yeah, I I can't believe what they're saying about Marie, that she's with these terrorists, that she killed Reza.
not_available I I know, Dad.
not_available Kate 
not_available Dad, hold on a second.
not_available It wasn't the bomb.
not_available We arrested the pilot.
not_available I need you as a translator.
not_available Dad, I'm gonna have to call you back.
not_available Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Dad, I love you.
not_available I love you, too, sweetheart.
not_available What exactly did Roger Stanton tell you? 
not_available Sherry was somehow involved in this.
not_available The nuclear threat? 
not_available He didn't elaborate.
not_available That's all he said.
not_available They said it was urgent.
not_available Is it about the bomb? Have they found it? Notyet.
not_available Sit down.
not_available I just spoke with Stanton.
not_available He confesses that he's known about the bomb for weeks.
not_available For weeks? Why would he withhold that from you? He wanted to wait until the bomb was on US soil before he intercepted it.
not_available So he knows where the bomb is.
not_available The men he had tracking it did.
not_available But they're all dead.
not_available The bomb's still out there, and we don't know where it is.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Am I telling you something you already know? What? 
not_available Tell me now.
not_available Have you done the unthinkable and put yourself in league with Roger Stanton? That's outrageous! Of course not! What did he say? Sit down.
not_available David 
not_available Sit down! He said you were involved, working against me.
not_available He's lying, David! I never even met Roger Stanton until this afternoon! 
not_available That's not true.
not_available He's playing you! Whatever he's doing, he wants you to believe I Just stop it! Sherry right now we are teetering on the brink of a war that will lead to the deaths of millions of people.
not_available We have to stop this disaster today, right now, before it begins.
not_available If there is something you're not telling me, anything that could help us find this bomb, as President of the United States, I order you No, as someone thatyou claim you love I'm asking: help me, Sherry.
not_available I got a phone call a few months ago in the middle of the night from a friend of mine who's high up in NSA.
not_available He told me that Roger Stanton wanted to speakto me first thing in the morning, and so we met at a park in Virginia.
not_available What did he want? 
not_available He wanted to recruit me.
not_available To do what? He wanted to know who was loyal to you and who could be turned.
not_available He wanted He wanted to know where you were weak.
not_available And you told him? Yes.
not_available But I only did it to gain his confidence.
not_available I was not aligning myself with him.
not_available I was doing it for you.
not_available David, I know you don't believe me, but just give me 30 minutes to prove to you that I'm telling the truth, that I did all of this to protectyou, not to hurtyou.
not_available I think he's saying he did it for his family.
not_available They promised him money.
not_available Ask him who "they" is.
not_available Syed Ali.
not_available Ask him if he knows about a second bomb.
not_available Eh? I don't thinkthat was right.
not_available I think we have different dialects.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Just keep trying.
not_available Jack, the translator's here.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available The subject's there.
not_available Kate? 
not_available I'm really sorry, Jack.
not_available You did great.
not_available You did great.
not_available Agent Baker will take you backto the controlled area.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Ask him if he knows about a second bomb.
not_available He said he doesn't know anything.
not_available ID, please.
not_available Can I see your ID? Who are those people over there? They're locking down the airport, checking everyone.
not_available Excuse me for one second.
not_available Ask him where he went to school and the name of his sponsor.
not_available I can't believe the bomb went off.
not_available What did you hear? How many people? I don't know.
not_available The transmission just went dead.
not_available Are you gonna be OK? My dad, I need to get in touch with my dad.
not_available We will.
not_available But for right now, we have to stay down here, where it's safe.
not_available We have no idea which way that radiation cloud is gonna travel.
not_available I'll see if I can pick something up on the shortwave radio, OK? LA's favourite alltalk radio all the time, 24
not_available 7.
not_available The school voucher debate is really beginning to heat up again here What did they say? The radiation is interfering with the antenna.
not_available It could be hours before we're able to pick up anything.
not_available What's gonna happen to us? 
not_available Shh, it's OK.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available Don't be scared.
not_available You got nothing to be scared of.
not_available We're safe down here.
not_available I promise.
not_available You must be the new assistant Division sent.
not_available Carrie Turner.
not_available You must be George Mason.
not_available Excuse me You look worse than I expected.
not_available Is there something I can help you with? 
not_available No, I'm set.
not_available I've been following everything from Division.
not_available I'll be taking over from Paula, so if there's anything you need the server to do, I'll make it happen.
not_available Good.
not_available The situation reports have changed in the past hour, so you have to refresh all the computer monitors.
not_available No problem.
not_available Just make sure everyone keeps their hands off my system.
not_available OK.
not_available Mr Mason who do I report to directly? You report to me.
not_available No offence, Mr Mason, but rumour has it you're not gonna be around much longer.
not_available So who do I report to? I finally get someone around here who I like, and I'm not gonna be around to enjoy it.
not_available Tony Almeida.
not_available And Michelle D
not_available Dessler.
not_available Did you say Michelle Dessler? 
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available Why? We worked together at District.
not_available I was her boss then.
not_available And you're telling me this why? It'll be fine.
not_available It's not important.
not_available Mr Mason? My God.
not_available Mr Mason? Mr Mason! Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Picture ID? 
not_available Thank you for your cooperation.
not_available We will try to getyou out of here as quickly as we can.
not_available Arms straight out.
not_available Just stand perfectly still.
not_available Prepare to give the scanners any metal objects in your pockets beforehand.
not_available It will speed the process through the line.
not_available Marie! 
not_available No need to be concerned.
not_available Please just cooperate.
not_available We appreciate it.
not_available Whoa, excuse me.
not_available You can't go there.
not_available What? Everyone is searched before they're let go.
not_available It's my sister.
not_available It's important.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Wait, here.
not_available I'm with Jack Bauer, CTU.
not_available OK.
not_available Go on.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Could you get in touch with Jack Bauer? Tell him Marie Warner is here.
not_available He'll understand.
not_available Dispatch, we need to locate a Jack Bauer with CTU.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Marie.
not_available I need your badge, Kate.
not_available Where've you been? 
not_available Give me your badge.
not_available Marie Shut up.
not_available You stupid idiot.
not_available Why did you have to start snooping around? What's going on? You have always treated me like I was some helpless injured animal.
not_available Like I couldn't get by withoutyou looking over me.
not_available What happened to you? I opened my eyes.
not_available That's what happened to me.
not_available I was pathetic, just like you.
not_available Until I met Syed.
not_available Until I sawthe lies and hypocrisy of my life, of this country, of people like Dad, who help the government.
not_available He works for the CIA.
not_available I know.
not_available So what? So what? Do you have any idea the suffering they cause around the world? Oh, please.
not_available What are you, six years old? You think Dad is the enemy now? I can't believe how ungrateful you are.
not_available I should be grateful? Yeah, absolutely.
not_available Dad and I turned our lives upside down for you after Mom died.
not_available This is what we did it for? So you could be brainwashed by some lunatic? Wake up! You're about to become the biggest murderer in American history! What are you gonna do? 
not_available Give me your badge.
not_available No.
not_available Fine.
not_available Marie, listen to me.
not_available There's a nuclear bomb in the city.
not_available No matter whatyou believe, you don't want all those innocent people to die.
not_available Give me the badge.
not_available No.
not_available I don't believe you'd shoot me.
not_available I will because this is more important than your life.
not_available Or my life.
not_available My arm! Secure the weapon! You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I take it that's your sister.
not_available At least give her something for the pain.
not_available I will when she tells us what she knows.
not_available You can't let her suffer.
not_available You're gonna have to let me do this my way.
not_available You have to trust me.
not_available I know you love her.
not_available But I have to worry about the millions of lives at stake.
not_available She is the only person who knows where this bomb is.
not_available I need to use every advantage I've got to find it and stop it.
not_available Surely you understand that.
not_available Just let me do this.
not_available Give me your arm.
not_available Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb.
not_available You can go to hell, you bastard.
not_available I'm not telling you anything.
not_available You wanna know why the pain's so severe? The bullet's still in your arm, lodged against the bone.
not_available Tell me where the bomb is, and I'll getyou something for the pain and treatyour arm.
not_available Please, Marie, just talkto me.
not_available Just talkto me.
not_available Tell me where the bomb is.
not_available No! I know you think whatyou're doing now will further your cause.
not_available Deep down, I don't think you wanna go through with it.
not_available I don't think you can justify killing millions of innocent civilians.
not_available Nobody's innocent in this country.
not_available I'm not afraid to die.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I've seen people who are willing to die.
not_available I've looked them straight in the eye, just like right now.
not_available You're not one of them.
not_available I wanna give you a painkiller, butyou must help me first.
not_available Please tell me where the bomb is.
not_available Where's the bomb? I'm gonna checkthe radio.
not_available Do you have any sugar? Yeah, yeah, it's in the back corner, on the shelf there.
not_available Is the TV hooked up to the same antenna? Everyone can take out their golf clubs delivery is Swung on.
not_available prominent civic leaders and Hollywood stars record numbers today gathered at beaches to celebrate the beautiful weather of California, which will continue throughout the weekend.
not_available Still nothing.
not_available This is our man? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Seventh commando.
not_available Captain Jonathan Wallace.
not_available Led a sniper unit in the Gulf War, led an assassination detail in Malaysia.
not_available Have you got this to Jack? 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Start up a shared volume with OC on this guy.
not_available Hello, Michelle.
not_available Carrie, what are you doing here? 
not_available Division sent me over to replace Paula.
not_available Right.
not_available Do you need help getting into any of the locked volumes on the network? No, actually.
not_available I'm all up and running.
not_available You look great, by the way.
not_available Stop it, Carrie.
not_available Stop what? You're not my boss today, all right? If you're here to replace Paula, then technically you work for me.
not_available Fine.
not_available Give me an order.
not_available There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
not_available We've been charged with finding it.
not_available So why don'tyou start by analysing these? Fine.
not_available Tony, do you have a second? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What is it? I think it's time I step down.
not_available I'm not feeling so hot here.
not_available Is there anything I can do? 
not_available Actually, yeah.
not_available Tomorrow, when this is all over, say goodbye to everybody for me and let them know what an honour it was working with them and what a great job I think they all did, everybody.
not_available Sure.
not_available This morning when I told you I couldn't wait to get out of here I don't feel that way any more.
not_available Here you go.
not_available What's this? Access codes for the CTU and Division.
not_available I can't take this, George.
not_available Only the CTU director is allowed that kind of access.
not_available You're the new CTU director, Tony.
not_available You can't promote me, George.
not_available Only Chappelle can do that.
not_available I just talked to Chappelle.
not_available You're the new guy.
not_available Listen, George I'm sorry, I Hey, don't.
not_available Good luck.
not_available I'll be operating from up here, so I'll need my access codes piped into the system.
not_available Got it.
not_available Everyone's ready.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available In case you haven't heard, George Mason was exposed to a lethal dose of plutonium this morning.
not_available I'm afraid he hasn't got much time.
not_available He just left the office and won't come back, which means that I'll be in charge until further notice.
not_available Now, on a normal day, we'd be mourning George, just like we would've mourned lvers and Clark and Paula and the rest of our co
not_available workers who were killed here today.
not_available Unfortunately, we have to hold our thoughts of them until we can get through this present crisis.
not_available So let's get backto work.
not_available Tony.
not_available It was a nice thing you just did.
not_available What's going on at the airfield? Jack's still interrogating Marie Warner.
not_available We don't have anything new.
not_available All right.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Sure.
not_available Stay with me, Marie.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Steve, walk with me.
not_available Get her Demerol for the pain.
not_available She's going into shock.
not_available I need her lucid.
not_available For how long? 
not_available Five minutes should do it.
not_available Kate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What did she say? 
not_available She hasn't said anything yet.
not_available I'm gonna need your help.
not_available Help? How? You're her sister.
not_available I need you to bring her backto reality.
not_available You know her like that.
not_available I don't.
not_available I thought I did.
not_available She's a different person from the Marie I knewthis morning.
not_available No, Kate.
not_available She's the same girl you grew up with.
not_available She's just regurgitating everything Syed Ali taught her.
not_available I need you to remind her of the things she used to love.
not_available You can do this, Kate.
not_available You can get to her.
not_available All right.
not_available She's going to be a little groggy because of the painkiller, OK? You all right? Yeah.
not_available Hey, Marie.
not_available Hi, Kate.
not_available Get away.
not_available I don't need you.
not_available Why won'tyou help us? 
not_available I am gonna help you.
not_available I'm gonna help you stop being a part of the problem.
not_available So it's OK with you if Dad and I died today? I killed Reza.
not_available And I loved him.
not_available Why would I care aboutyou and Dad? Because we care for you.
not_available Because we love you.
not_available Why are you doing this? Marie, you could save everyone.
not_available You could stop this terrible thing from happening.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available I can't.
not_available Marie, I'm begging you.
not_available Please.
not_available No.
not_available My arm God! Kate, I need you to step back.
not_available That's the Demerol wearing off.
not_available Tell me where the bomb is, and I'll getyou more.
not_available Please tell me where the bomb is.
not_available Marie, just tell him, please.
not_available Where is the bomb? 
not_available Give her something for the pain.
not_available No, no.
not_available Marie, please.
not_available Tell me where the bomb is.
not_available Where is the bomb? Katie, make him stop! 
not_available No, Marie.
not_available You make him stop.
not_available The pain will get worse.
not_available Just tell me where the bomb is.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Just tell me where the bomb is.
not_available In the suitcase.
not_available Where's the suitcase? 
not_available In the van.
not_available What van? Where was the van headed? 
not_available Downtown.
not_available Where downtown? At the Arco Towers.
not_available What kind of van was it? What colour? What make? Uh green.
not_available I don't know what make.
not_available We're looking for a green van.
not_available The nuke may be inside.
not_available Send a team down to the Arco.
not_available When is the bomb set to go off? 
not_available Three hours.
not_available How do you knowthat? 
not_available I sawthe timer.
not_available Describe it.
not_available What? 
not_available The timer.
not_available Describe it.
not_available I don't You're lying to me.
not_available A bomb that size wouldn't have a visual timer.
not_available I'm not lying.
not_available It's at the Arco Towers.
not_available Send them all downtown now.
not_available Why now? What's the hurry? I thought I had three hours.
not_available You told me I had three hours.
not_available No, I'm not lying! Why do you want me and my team to leave here so fast? The bomb's still here, isn't it, Marie? No.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Teams A and B, do a grid search on every outbuilding at the airport, starting north, heading south.
not_available The bomb is on
not_available site.
not_available I repeat: the bomb is on
not_available site.
not_available Oh, Marie.
not_available They're not gonna find it in time.
not_available We're all gonna die.
not_available I'll sleep on the floor.
not_available You can have my bed.
not_available Mr President, your call's ready.
not_available Steve Hillenburg at Langley.
not_available Yes, a CIA operative.
not_available He's on an isolated feed.
not_available Nobody else knows about this but the three of you.
not_available Sherry's waiting.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hello, Steve.
not_available Mr President.
not_available What's your involvement in this? I got a call from Sherry about four months ago.
not_available She told me Roger Stanton was trying to recruit her in an effort to undermine your presidency.
not_available She wanted an independent source to confirm that she was doing it to help you.
not_available So you've been building a case against Stanton for the last four months without my knowledge.
not_available Plausible deniability, sir.
not_available What we were doing was illegal, but we felt it was necessary.
not_available It could've backfired and landed Sherry and me in prison.
not_available We didn't want this to touch you if that happened.
not_available OK, let's say I accept that.
not_available What proof do you have that exonerates Sherry? I have photographs, taped conversations, debriefs, files filled with the work Sherry did.
not_available These meetings that Sherry and Roger had, where'd they take place? Sherry? Um For the first month, we met at a hotel in Hilton Head.
not_available I didn't sleep with him.
not_available I didn't ask.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll contactyou if I need anything else.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available You know, I don't care what you think of me right now.
not_available The most important thing is thatyou realise that I never, and I mean never, was a part of Stanton's conspiracy.
not_available You know what, Sherry? You might be telling me the truth.
not_available Then again, you might not.
not_available Right now, I don't have the time or energy to figure out whether I can trustyou.
not_available You have to trust me, David.
not_available Your presidency is in jeopardy and so is this country.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available No.
not_available You'll leave now.
not_available David you need me.
not_available If you resist in any way, I'll have no choice but to place you under arrest.
not_available Yes, sir? 
not_available Please escort Mrs Palmer to her car.
not_available We got a ventilation system in here and an air supply, but it still stays cold.
not_available But don't worry because we got tons of blankets.
not_available You tired? 
not_available I'm OK.
not_available You're still worried about your family, aren'tyou? Try not to think about them too much.
not_available You're probably right.
not_available So, did you grow up in LA? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, yeah? Me too.
not_available What part? 
not_available We moved around a lot.
not_available My foot is still hurting.
not_available Do you have any aspirin? Yeah, yeah, sure.
not_available I got tons.
not_available You're gonna let me out of here right now.
not_available I knowthe bomb didn't go off.
not_available Kim 
not_available Stay away! OK, it's OK.
not_available Just calm down.
not_available I wasn't gonna hurtyou.
not_available Then let me go! 
not_available I just wanted some company, that's all.
not_available Then what are you doing out here? This is where I belong.
not_available I don't.
not_available I wantyou to stay.
not_available I don't wanna stay.
not_available Why not? What's wrong with me? I'm not good enough? 
not_available It has nothing to do with you.
not_available Then why? You think I'm psycho? I don't know if you're psycho.
not_available I don't even know you.
not_available Wouldn'tyou rather be with someone who wants to be here? You don't even wanna get to know me? Please let me out of here, Lonnie.
not_available Please.
not_available Here.
not_available What? Take it.
not_available There's cougars out there.
not_available If you see one, fire a shot in the air and they'll take off.
not_available Turn right out the front door.
not_available About 200 yards away, you'll see a deer trail.
not_available That'll lead you to the highway.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Kim? Maybe you'll come back sometime? I don't think so.
not_available Go, go, go! Over here! Let's go! Bring 'em in! What do we got? 
not_available It's nuclear.
not_available And there's the trigger.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available We found the bomb.
not_available Initiate a level
not_available one local evac now.
not_available It's armed.
not_available How much time have we got? I can't tell.
not_available Could be any second.
