
not_available Do it now! Do it! How many people died in this? 
not_available No less than 12,000.
not_available Four more nuclear weapons were stolen along with the one that went off.
not_available CTU is trying to determine where Fayed was at the time.
not_available The worst
not_available case scenario is that he is still alive and has the remaining nuclear weapons.
not_available My engineer died in the blast.
not_available The device used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed.
not_available I have four more bombs whose triggers need to be made operational.
not_available You need someone who can replicate what that device did, with modern equipment.
not_available McCarthy will find someone for us.
not_available Tell the men these bombs will go off today.
not_available Walid heard conversations about the bombs.
not_available If there is an active cell inside that detention facility, we need Walid to find out more.
not_available He's wiring you.
not_available It's a two
not_available way radio.
not_available Now you're gonna tell me what we found in your wallet.
not_available Understand? You're gonna say I asked about this man.
not_available Make them believe you're working with him.
not_available What if they find out he's wearing a wire? Guards inside are keeping an eye on him.
not_available I sent Fayed to negotiate with an ex
not_available Soviet general about tactical nuclear weapons.
not_available What was the name of the general? 
not_available Dmitri Gredenko.
not_available Assad gave us the name of a Russian general Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes.
not_available Gredenko did business with BXJ Technologies, specifically with your father.
not_available My father? I haven't spoken to him for nine years.
not_available We'll send someone to talk to him.
not_available I should do this.
not_available He'll talk to me if I go alone.
not_available You'll never guess who just called.
not_available Who? 
not_available Your brother Jack.
not_available What's he want? 
not_available The old man.
not_available We should've killed Jack instead of handing him to the Chinese.
not_available Look at the bright side, you got out, you're here.
not_available Just relax a little.
not_available Gray, people in this country are dying, and I need some information.
not_available Are you gonna give it to me, or do I have to hurt you? What do you want from me? 
not_available The truth! It is the truth! I swear to you on my family's life.
not_available Not good enough.
not_available Although the crisis we face today is a grave and dire one, we will rise above it.
not_available Our great nation has been challenged as never before.
not_available This time, against this enemy armed with these weapons, we must rely on the strength and faith of every single American.
not_available And that faith is unshakable.
not_available We must rise above our fears, above our bigotries, and stand our ground.
not_available Our goal is the defeat of the enemy and the preservation of our values.
not_available Now, we have achieved that goal in the past, and so we shall again.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I wish he had not said that.
not_available Sir? He made a promise he can't keep.
not_available The American people have to get used to the fact these new security measures are a way of life.
not_available They're not some temporary Band
not_available Aid.
not_available Now you're making policy unilaterally, Tom.
not_available The president was absolutely clear about your proposals.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What is this about, Karen? "National Guard supplanting police in major cities.
not_available " "Expanding detentions based on soft intel.
not_available " You authorised these without presidential consent.
not_available Now, how many times do you think we are going to be going over this? I am taking preparatory steps to allow the president to act swiftly, should he decide to act at all.
not_available Nobody is authorising anything.
not_available That's what you said about the detention facilities, and those preparatory measures turned into an illegal paramilitary operation.
not_available Well, however you may choose to characterise it, the president agreed That's because you distorted the facts.
not_available Is it that you think I'm some bleedingheart liberal preaching civil liberties? Is that it? I'll tell you what I think The Constitution is wonderful thing, but back in the days of the Founding Fathers, the weapon at hand was a single
not_available shot musket.
not_available It took a half a minute to load and fire.
not_available Fayed just killed 12,000 people in less time without even taking aim.
not_available I love the Constitution, but I won't be ducking behind it when the next nuke goes off.
not_available I'm a realist.
not_available I am willing to do what it takes to protect this country.
not_available No, you are not.
not_available I am looking a little further down the road.
not_available These warrantless arrests and detention centres will cause irreparable damage.
not_available Why don't you hop over to the Justice Department? You are using this crisis to advance a very dangerous agenda, Tom, and take advantage of presidential power, and I will not let you do it.
not_available And if you think that you are going to wear me down, you are sadly mistaken.
not_available Actually, you're wearing me down.
not_available You won't make the same mistake again.
not_available You're gonna give the file to Sharon, and she's gonna handle it.
not_available Get it done.
not_available I need Karen Hayes to go away.
not_available I'm putting the last I need this now.
not_available I need the president to sign off on my proposals.
not_available She has gone from being an irritant to an obstacle.
not_available She will be gone soon.
not_available I'm waiting to hear from a few more people, then you can approach her.
not_available This work you're doing for me, it doesn't go unnoticed.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Mr Buchanan.
not_available Yes? Are you aware of the new security mandate? 
not_available I haven't looked.
not_available What's going on? Anyone with a Middle Eastern background has to put a redundancy layer on their logins.
not_available I see.
not_available Normally I'm not sensitive to this kind of thing, you know that.
not_available But this is not the time to profile people with grade
not_available four security clearance.
not_available I'm not gonna argue with you.
not_available You'll give me an exemption? I'll take it to the Attorney General, but it won't happen right away.
not_available How can I work with one hand tied behind my back? You and I knew when I hired you that a Muslim working counter terror would have to put up with unfair measures.
not_available This is one of them.
not_available I know, but today of all days 
not_available Especially today.
not_available I need you to stay focused on the big picture.
not_available When this is behind us, I will take this issue to the Attorney General, I promise you.
not_available You heard from Jack? 
not_available Not since he went to see his brother.
not_available Want me to try and reach him? 
not_available He'll call us when he has something.
not_available You lie to me again, the bag goes back on.
not_available Do you understand me? Start talking, Gray.
not_available Dad Dad didn't want anyone to know where he went.
not_available He didn't even leave a number? 
not_available No, you can't reach him, Jack.
not_available He After the bomb was detonated, he told me he was cutting himself off.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I think he told you where he was going.
not_available No.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available Fine.
not_available Oh, no, no! I don't know! All right, all right, all right, all right! He went to see a guy who works for us.
not_available His name's Darren McCarthy.
not_available Why? It was my fault.
not_available I made a mess.
not_available Dad's trying to clean it up.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available You were right.
not_available It's about the nukes.
not_available The connection you found between Dad and Gredenko had to do with a contract that was awarded to us.
not_available Through the company.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It all went through BXJ.
not_available What did a general have to do with a contract? It was his job to release the old nukes into the US for decommissioning.
not_available BXJ was hired to dismantle some of the smaller bombs and to recycle their cores into energy production.
not_available We do it all the time.
not_available What happened? I hired McCarthy to oversee the job but I didn't check him out carefully enough.
not_available He made the lowest bid and you hired him.
not_available I I My head was into other things at the time.
not_available He came with good references.
not_available I saw no reason to get all anal about it.
not_available The nukes the terrorists have, including the one detonated in Valencia, were supplied by McCarthy and stolen from you? Yes.
not_available In a nutshell, that's it.
not_available Sam told me Dad left yesterday, which means you both knew about this and didn't report it.
not_available We thought we could take care of it more efficiently.
not_available How many people have died because you're trying to cover your ass? I had no idea this was going to happen.
not_available What Dad and I are doing to stop this is more effective than what your people will do.
not_available What exactly are you doing? Dad put together a security team.
not_available He went out to look for McCarthy.
not_available Where? He was staking out McCarthy's office.
not_available He checked in about an hour ago.
not_available Where is this office? It's in Simi.
not_available We're going.
not_available I'm not leaving my family, Jack, not today.
not_available Oh, yes, you are.
not_available Get up! the wind should push the mushroom cloud away from Los Angeles Graem, where are you going? 
not_available Jack and I have to go find Dad.
not_available Find him? 
not_available He's not reachable.
not_available We have to pick him up.
not_available I want you to stay here with Josh.
not_available Don't either of you go outside the house.
not_available I'll be back as soon as I can.
not_available What's the address? 
not_available His office in on Route 23.
not_available CTU.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Let me speak to Bill.
not_available He's being briefed on Fayed.
not_available Picked up any threads? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available I've got one.
not_available Send two field units to 5137 Olsen Avenue in Simi Valley.
not_available It should be off the 23.
not_available I want them to wait for me there.
not_available Get Bill to call me back as soon as he's out.
not_available OK, I will.
not_available So that's it, Jack? You're just gonna sell out Dad and me? Get in the car.
not_available We've monitored ground movement since the bomb went off.
not_available We've locked down streets, done searches.
not_available Nothing.
not_available No sign of Fayed.
not_available He could still be hunkered down within the perimeter.
not_available We've got NEST teams in the area now.
not_available That'll take hours.
not_available Yeah, Morris.
not_available If we could do it quicker, we would.
not_available We can use the fallout to our advantage.
not_available If Fayed is in the perimeter, he'll move the opposite way.
not_available He'll have to be monitoring the fallout.
not_available He's got technology in the "on" position.
not_available Let's use radio
not_available frequency satellite.
not_available Good.
not_available Get on it.
not_available Jackjust called in.
not_available He's following a lead in Simi Valley.
not_available He wants you to call him.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available He asked me to send two teams.
not_available Any leads on finding Gredenko? Not yet.
not_available CIA is trying to track him down in Moscow.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available If you give CTU McCarthy's name, they will eventually come after the family.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available CTU is not interested in networking a series of indictments.
not_available Will you not be so simple
not_available minded for once? CTU, like every other federal organisation, is made up of human beings with ambition.
not_available When the dust settles, they will dig deeper.
not_available Unfortunately for you, right now you have to trust me.
not_available After what you did to me at the house, all I trust in is your sadistic tendencies.
not_available Bauer.
not_available What did you find out? 
not_available Run a locator check on a Darren McCarthy.
not_available Who is he? 
not_available An independent munitions contractor.
not_available He worked for BXJ Technologies.
not_available How does McCarthy figure into all this? My father's company hired him to decommission the nukes.
not_available He brokered them to Fayed.
not_available Except for McCarthy, your father's company had nothing to do with Fayed? 
not_available I don't know BXJ's involvement yet.
not_available Where are you? Heading to McCarthy's office in Simi Valley.
not_available I might get something off his computer.
not_available We have teams standing by.
not_available Let me know.
not_available Copy that.
not_available You know, if you're doing this to come after me, eventually Dad will get caught in the middle.
not_available Or maybe you want that.
not_available Maybe you want Dad to go to prison too.
not_available Boy, Jack, it's good to see your loyalty is still with your family.
not_available If I were you, I wouldn't talk about loyalty.
not_available It's not easy.
not_available That's why they'll pay seven million dollars.
not_available Can't Taylor Pascal do it? He's a theoretical physicist.
not_available He doesn't have the background to reprogram a trigger.
not_available Who does? 
not_available I'm still looking.
not_available Fayed needs someone now.
not_available Get me a name, dammit! Where are we going now? What do you care? 
not_available Darren, I don't feel safe in this city.
not_available I was here when you mentioned that earlier.
not_available OK.
not_available It seems to me like whatever this is you're trying to do is a long shot.
not_available You're just gonna waste all this time, and it's gonna be harder to get away.
not_available Get out! 
not_available What? Your negativity is not what I need right now! I need less stress, not more! How sure a thing is this seven million? Now, that's the type of question that I love hearing from you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you found an engineer? No, not yet.
not_available Why not? Oh! Give me a break, Fayed! This is not some easy one
not_available stop shopping.
not_available You said within the hour.
not_available I know what I said.
not_available It's just taking longer.
not_available I told you I'd find someone.
not_available Now I will.
not_available That's the last of the group.
not_available What do you do with them now? 
not_available Patch the images to CTU.
not_available They can cross them with watch lists.
not_available Didn't you already vet these people? 
not_available CTU has more resources.
not_available They can go deeper, find the connection to Fayed.
not_available Samuels sent us images of the men Walid is with.
not_available Excellent.
not_available When Nadia gets the manifests, I'll cross them against our watch lists.
not_available Wait.
not_available Nadia didn't give you the manifests? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I haven't a clue, mate.
not_available Hey, you were supposed to send the manifest to Comm.
not_available Why don't we have it? 
not_available I'm backed up.
not_available Why are you backed up? I'm doing my best.
not_available You got a problem with it, take it somewhere else.
not_available Hey, I'm just trying to understand what the problem is.
not_available The detention facility's one of our only live leads.
not_available Go ask Buchanan.
not_available OK.
not_available We've got a support team in place.
not_available If Jack needs more backup, he'll let you know.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is it, Milo? Nadia.
not_available She's falling behind on her tasks.
not_available What's going on with her? Nothing.
not_available Partition her workload and hand some of it out to another analyst.
not_available She's only working on one process.
not_available She's doing things for me.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Is there something going on here you don't want me to know about? Yes.
not_available Either give Nadia enough time to finish the work or give it to somebody else.
not_available Sir, I'm the technical leader on the floor.
not_available If you want me to do my job effectively, I need to know what's happening.
not_available Nadia's of Middle Eastern descent.
not_available She's been flagged by Homeland Security.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available She's lived in this country since she was two years old.
not_available She's a Republican.
not_available You're wasting your breath.
not_available There's nothing I can do about this right now.
not_available Let it go.
not_available I don't see how we can.
not_available Aren't we trying to find four nukes that might still be in this city? 
not_available I need everybody working at full speed.
not_available I understand that.
not_available Now get back to work.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hi.
not_available Have you heard about this latest mandate? 
not_available No.
not_available What is it? 
not_available They're racially profiling our own agents.
not_available What? 
not_available Itjust came down from the White House.
not_available One of my best people is hamstrung.
not_available She has to work twice as hard to get through security measures.
not_available They're not security measures, Bill.
not_available They're the paranoid delusions of Tom Lennox.
not_available Is there anything you can do? I can talk to the president.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available It went off in Valencia over an hour ago.
not_available How many were killed? 
not_available We don't know yet.
not_available There are four more visitors.
not_available What does that mean? I'm not sure.
not_available Do you think it may have something to do with Valencia? How did you get the information? 
not_available Why are you asking so many questions? Whatever happens out there affects us in here.
not_available We need to share everything we know.
not_available Heydar's been in contact.
not_available How? He smuggled in a cellphone.
not_available How? Cellphone? How did he get a cellphone in there? These facilities were put up quickly.
not_available The security is pretty porous.
not_available You need to get the phone and find out who he's talking to.
not_available If Walid can get the phone, I can trace any call that's been made.
not_available A live conversation is worth more than a list of numbers.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then after that, get Walid out of there.
not_available No.
not_available They're talking to him.
not_available That's a big get.
not_available We have to keep listening in on whatever they say.
not_available This is Agent Samuels.
not_available I need to get into a cell tower.
not_available Grid location 15, 27.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Grid location 15, 27.
not_available It's done.
not_available They will come forward if we need them to testify? Yes, I put the screws to every one of them.
not_available They're all yours.
not_available Good.
not_available Oh, Karen.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Now would be better.
not_available Have this signed then send it out.
not_available This just simply isn't working for me.
not_available I can't have you stand in my way any more.
not_available What? I need the president's undivided attention, and you, frankly, are dividing it.
not_available I'm not gonna stop doing my job just because it irritates you.
not_available I thought I made that perfectly clear.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd like you to tender your resignation.
not_available My resignation.
not_available What are you smoking? No, no, no.
not_available I'm here to blow away all the smoke.
not_available I wanna talk about your husband's incompetence and your covering it up.
not_available I don't like this conversation.
not_available What are you talking about? Abu Fayed in CTU custody in Seattle, and Bill Buchanan signed off on his release.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available The case that you're referring to involved over 20 detainees.
not_available Not prisoners, Tom, detainees.
not_available At the time, there was not enough evidence to hold them.
not_available It's a little greyer than that now.
not_available If what you're saying is true, how come that incident wound up bluecoded at Homeland in a dead
not_available end file? I've got Peter lanona here, Curt Wag, Myra Mock.
not_available They're all in the pipeline, all ready to testify that you sequestered that file to protect your husband.
not_available I did nothing illegal or incorrect.
not_available All of those detainees were cleared of any conspiracy charges.
not_available Nevertheless, one of these "detainees" detonated a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
not_available You think your husband could survive that story? Or you? Do you want to get in the ring with me? You've got skeletons in your closet, and I will not hesitate to pull them out.
not_available We've all got our skeletons, Karen.
not_available It's proof we don't all have.
not_available I've got mine.
not_available How long before you get yours? You're a son of a bitch.
not_available I never claimed otherwise.
not_available Look, I am not out to hurt you or your husband personally.
not_available I just need room to work.
not_available Your resignation within the hour.
not_available Can we go a little slower? There's no rush.
not_available Morris, I'm going as fast as I can.
not_available Go back to your station.
not_available I'll send it over.
not_available Why is it taking you five minutes to do something that should take ten seconds? Because I borrowed two of her processors to run a batch job.
not_available She's running on 20%.
not_available Oh, yeah? Then why didn't somebody tell me this? 
not_available I just did.
not_available Fine.
not_available Don't keep any secrets from me, darling.
not_available We're on the same side.
not_available Why did you lie for me? 
not_available I talked to Buchanan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's pretty frustrating.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I'm logging you in under my user ID.
not_available That's illegal.
not_available You didn't do it.
not_available I did.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There.
not_available You should be fine.
not_available his relationship with his deputy chief of staff.
not_available So I think that would speed things up.
not_available I believe they're at site R.
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available I need to speak with you.
not_available I'm squeezed for time.
not_available Can we talk later? 
not_available No, sir, we can't.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mr President, I am tendering my resignation, effective immediately.
not_available What's going on, Karen? 
not_available It's a personal matter, sir.
not_available Is there something wrong with you or Bill? 
not_available No, we're fine.
not_available It's I cannot elaborate.
not_available You and Tom have been locking horns these past few weeks.
not_available Is that it? 
not_available I'd rather not say.
not_available That is unacceptable.
not_available Mr President I need you.
not_available I need different points of view.
not_available It's difficult to sit in a room with someone who opposes you, but that is part of yourjob.
not_available And I have never seen anyone handle it better than you.
not_available I am sorry, Karen, but I cannot accept your resignation.
not_available Not now, not today.
not_available No disrespect, sir, but you're going to have to.
not_available Mr President, I am here to tell you that the past few weeks have been some of the most difficult weeks I have ever seen a president face.
not_available And I am truly honoured to serve under you here in Washington.
not_available I appreciate that you value my advice, but, sir, the truth is, you have been your own best counsellor.
not_available You know what to do, sir.
not_available And I have no doubt, absolutely no doubt that you will continue to rise to this challenge.
not_available Is there anything I can do to change your mind? No, sir.
not_available There is not.
not_available I would appreciate it, however, if you would reassign me to LA CTU.
not_available I feel I will serve best there.
not_available I'll approve you for military transport west.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Mr President.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available So am I.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, excuse me, Karen.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Oh, Karen, I'm glad I caught you.
not_available I've got a state department white paper I was hoping you could look over and take to the president.
not_available No.
not_available You'll have to give it to Tom.
not_available Well, I thought you handled that.
not_available Give it to Tom.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yes.
not_available Karen Hayes is out.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The last one is a black Kia.
not_available California licence plate.
not_available NinerYankeeSierra
not_available Uniform 108.
not_available It's not registered to McCarthy.
not_available Cross
not_available reference the names of the registered owners.
not_available See if any of them correlate.
not_available What about the backup teams? Where are they? Holding a two
not_available block radius.
not_available Send one to the parking lot here.
not_available Tell the other to stand by.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Where's McCarthy's office? 
not_available Second floor.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right.
not_available I've got the phone.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll give you a number to dial.
not_available CTU can access the phone's records.
not_available After dialling the number, hit the star button twice.
not_available The number is 310597
not_available 3781.
not_available Again, the number 310597
not_available 3781.
not_available Once we get everything off the SIM, you can put the phone back.
not_available Hurry.
not_available It won't be long before he discovers it's missing.
not_available He got the phone.
not_available There's nothing else he can do.
not_available Let's just see what we get.
not_available CTU.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available It's Agent Samuels.
not_available We've got the phone.
not_available I'm piping a stream to you now.
not_available Work up every number you get.
not_available It's coming through.
not_available How does it look? This data's encoded.
not_available There's over 120 numbers or so.
not_available I can't tell if they're recently dialled or stored.
not_available I'll get back to you in a few minutes.
not_available But you got everything, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Walid did a greatjob of getting that phone.
not_available Then please let him go before he gets hurt.
not_available I'll tell you one last time, Ms Palmer.
not_available These men know something about the bombs that we don't.
not_available Walid has earned their trust.
not_available That's a situation that we've lucked into, and we will not terminate it as long as he can continue to harvest information.
not_available All right, Walid, you can put the phone back.
not_available OK.
not_available Walid.
not_available Yeah, Chloe.
not_available These guys aren't connected to anyone.
not_available What? They knew about the other four bombs.
not_available They found out from a web page.
not_available What? 
not_available The cellphone had a browser on it.
not_available The cache had a web page.
not_available They could have connected in.
not_available Was the website password protected? 
not_available No, but a lot of people know about them.
not_available They aren't terrorists, they're spectators.
not_available Why didn't they report the website? Because you have them locked up! Why would they give you information that would incriminate them further? 
not_available Thanks, Chloe.
not_available I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.
not_available This is Agent Samuels.
not_available Notify the guards we are taking Walid Al
not_available Rezani out.
not_available I was at home with my wife and my children and they barged right in and they grabbed me.
not_available No search warrant, nothing.
not_available They say this country is about freedom.
not_available This is not freedom.
not_available My phone.

not_available I was walking back, he fell in front of me.
not_available Search him.
not_available No.
not_available Get away from me.
not_available Open the gate.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available I need to get in there right now.
not_available What are you doing? You spied on us? You're worse than they are! Son of a bitch! Hey! No! Let us in.
not_available Get on the ground! Oh, my God! Walid! Walid! 
not_available My God.
not_available I'm OK.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available You're hurt.
not_available I need a medical team on site.
not_available Civilian down.
not_available Don't move.
not_available CTU.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, we're here.
not_available The parking lot's almost empty.
not_available The building's been evacuated because of the bomb.
not_available Does Jack want us in there? 
not_available No.
not_available Keep an eye on exits and entrances and wait for my call.
not_available All right.
not_available Standing by.
not_available Which one's his office? 
not_available Last door on the right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Take a seat.
not_available What are you doing? Looking for anything in McCarthy's system that connects him to BXJ or the nukes.
not_available What's that? 
not_available McCarthy's employment contract with BXJ.
not_available Whoa, whoa.
not_available What happened there? Some kind of electronic shredding trail.
not_available Ten minutes after the bomb went off, McCarthy started deleting files.
not_available Get up.
not_available Now.
not_available Come on, Jack.
not_available Don't make a noise.
not_available Don't you move.
not_available Stop.
not_available You know him? Yeah.
not_available He's my son.
not_available I'm surprised to see you here, Jack.
not_available We all feared the worst.
not_available Give me my gun back.
not_available What are you doing here, Jack? I'm working with CTU.
not_available We're looking for Darren McCarthy.
not_available McCarthy's not here.
not_available I know you're covering up.
not_available Gray told me.
not_available Did he? And where is he? 
not_available McCarthy's office.
not_available There's nothing there, Jack.
not_available Believe me.
not_available Get Graem in here.
not_available Wait.
not_available You'll need these.
not_available I didn't trust him not to run.
not_available I'm doing everything I can to find McCarthy.
not_available What in the hell are you thinking? I only learned about it yesterday.
not_available When Graem told me about the weapons The second you knew the bombs were missing, why didn't you call? He told me that the bombs couldn't be detonated, the triggers were deactivated.
not_available He was wrong.
not_available Evidently.
not_available Look, Jack, I'm just trying to keep my son out of prison.
not_available Dad, where is McCarthy? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available When I do, we can pick him up together.
not_available He wants us both in prison.
not_available What I want is to find the nukes.
not_available If you're held accountable for what you've done, that's the bed you've made.
not_available Oh, you hear that, Dad? Family love.
not_available We'd be better off if he was still in a Chinese jail.
not_available Who are you calling? 
not_available CTU.
not_available Jack, look, work with me.
not_available I'll tell you what I know, but for now keep Graem out of it.
not_available We're talking about prison, Jack.
not_available He's your brother.
not_available Graem knew what he was doing was wrong.
not_available He should have been more careful.
not_available When he knew they were stolen, he should have reported it! You always do what you should.
not_available How about when Dad needed you and you disappeared? 
not_available Jack, give us a chance to clean this up.
not_available Dad, there are four more bombs out there.
not_available I cannot, I will not, be responsible for thousands of lives to protect this family.
not_available Wrong.
not_available Protecting family is everything.
not_available I think your dead wife would agree.
not_available You son of a bitch! 
not_available Jack! All right.
not_available Let's do it your way.
not_available No, Dad.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available He's right.
not_available Call CTU.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Hey! What are you doing? Put the gun away.
not_available You work for me.
not_available No, Dad, he doesn't.
not_available This is insane.
not_available You don't think I'd let you loose without keeping an eye on you? 
not_available Tell them to put the guns away.
not_available Shut up, Dad.
not_available Well, I'm glad we can all finally put our cards on the table.
not_available Family.
not_available Pff! Let's go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've found someone.
not_available Yeah? He's got the background to reprogram the trigger, but you'll have to force him to do it.
not_available And he hasn't left town? 
not_available No, he's here.
not_available OK.
not_available Text me everything you got on him.
not_available They're looking at your place.
not_available What makes you think they can't find you here? A, I'm not that stupid, and B, we're not gonna be here long enough for anyone to know.
not_available Mm.
not_available I really hope you know what you're doing, Darren.
not_available Always.
not_available When I'm done with this deal, I may just buy you a small country.
