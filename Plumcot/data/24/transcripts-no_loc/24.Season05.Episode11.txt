
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available Jack, we've authenticated the thumb
not_available drive data.
not_available Omicron definitely made the Sentox for the military.
not_available Who is this Henderson? 
not_available Someone I used to work for.
not_available Where? 
not_available CTU.
not_available He's the man who recruited me.
not_available Things ended badly between us.
not_available What are accusing me of now, Jack, being in bed with terrorists? I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox program.
not_available I've got to merge some files, find out who was working on this project.
not_available We need I.T.
not_available They're next door.
not_available I listened to everything Bauer had to say about the thumb
not_available drives.
not_available CTU does not have enough information to hurt us.
not_available What about Bauer? Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.
not_available Oh, my God How could I be so stupid? Mr.
not_available McGill, we think there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade.
not_available My people are not going to chase that white elephant.
not_available They're busy trying to locate Now let my people focus on their work, or I will have you escorted out of here! Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.
not_available What are you suggesting? 
not_available Section 112.
not_available Curtis, take Mr.
not_available Stiles and Ms.
not_available O'Brian, put them in holding, and then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.
not_available Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you of your command under the "incapacity clause" of section 112.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan is riding with the Suvarov's.
not_available Get my wife on the phone.
not_available The terrorists were very specific: if I don't allow them to attack the motorcade, they're going to release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations.
not_available You need to get out of the car! We're under attack; we need backup now! I thought we had an understanding.
not_available It happened outside of my authority.
not_available I told no one.
not_available If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president, then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, this is our final conversation.
not_available Good
not_available bye.
not_available No Wait! How long has he been conscious? 
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available Before you go in, you should be aware of something.
not_available Tony's been asking for his wife.
not_available He doesn't remember? He remembers the explosion, but that's all.
not_available We have to tell him Michelle is dead.
not_available No, absolutely not.
not_available He's undergone severe trauma.
not_available This kind of stress will raise his blood pressure and make the vascular damage worse.
not_available Please, just hold off on telling him until his condition has stabilized.
not_available Would you excuse us, please? Tony.
not_available How are you feeling? They told me they took Michelle to Cedars.
not_available Yes, they couldn't treat her here.
not_available Why? How badly was she hurt? Is she going to be okay? As far as I know, yes.
not_available What the hell's going on here, Bill? They killed President Palmer, and they tried to kill Michelle and me.
not_available David Palmer was the primary target.
not_available They killed him because he was going to expose someone inside Logan's administration.
not_available They set Jack up to take the fall.
not_available Did they get Jack? 
not_available No.
not_available He's alive.
not_available He's working with us here on a provisional basis.
not_available Bill, I need to talk to Jack.
not_available You need to rest.
not_available No, I don't need to rest.
not_available I need to talk to Jack.
not_available Now.
not_available I'll tell him.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Could you do me a favor? Could you get a message to Michelle? Tell her I'm okay.
not_available I will.
not_available Tony We need you to get better.
not_available Copy, Blacktop One.
not_available We're standing by.
not_available The Navy helicopter is on its way, ma'am.
not_available It'll take us back to the retreat.
not_available He didn't warn the motorcade.
not_available Ma'am? Charles, he knew about the attack, and he just let it happen, Aaron.
not_available That can't be true.
not_available He didn't just let it happen.
not_available He He gave the terrorists the Suvarov's motorcade route.
not_available Ma'am, why would he do that? How soon before you're ready? I'll be leaving in a couple of minutes.
not_available I just need to finish setting the arming mechanism.
not_available Make sure you place the canister to maximize casualties.
not_available It must look as if this is one of our primary targets.
not_available It'll be taken care of.
not_available Yes? Do you have the key card yet? I'll have it within the hour.
not_available They're can be no miscues.
not_available I'm using up one of my canisters to create this diversion.
not_available Without the key card, it's all for nothing.
not_available Call me when you have it.
not_available I will.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm going to be there soon.
not_available Make sure you bring the money.
not_available You'll have it.
not_available And you'll have your precious card.
not_available Careful.
not_available It's all we got left.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available In a little while, be able to buy all you want.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan and the Suvarov's have been treated.
not_available The chopper is picking them up now.
not_available What do I say to my wife, Mike? She put you in an impossible situation It's my job to handle impossible situations, and I failed, and not for the first time.
not_available Mr.
not_available President 
not_available I should never have given in.
not_available I should have ordered back the motorcade.
not_available Sir, with all due respect, you don't have time for self
not_available recrimination.
not_available The terrorist attack failed.
not_available We have to assume they'll make good on their threat to use the Sentox on American soil.
not_available Has CTU made any progress, or are they just waiting for the other shoe to drop? They're looking for a lead, working the scene where the motorcade was ambushed.
not_available Bill, they're airlifting the bodies of the terrorists to CTU.
not_available When will they be here? Any minute.
not_available I'm meeting them in the morgue.
not_available Let me know what you find.
not_available You got it.
not_available Jack's calling in.
not_available Put him on speaker.
not_available Jack, we're in an emergency briefing with department heads.
not_available Bill wants to put you on speaker.
not_available I thought Lynn took Bill off the active roster.
not_available Bill's been reinstated, and Lynn's been relieved of duty.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Put me on.
not_available All right.
not_available You're on.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available What did you find at Omicron? Christopher Henderson was responsible for setting up the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.
not_available He just tried to kill me by blowing up a bunker that the Sentox was developed in.
not_available I managed to survive, but unfortunately the servers that control the data were destroyed and Henderson managed to escape.
not_available Chloe, are you there? 
not_available Go ahead, Jack.
not_available Can you hack into Henderson's office computer? I already did it.
not_available Henderson's home workstation is clean.
not_available He wiped his hard drive five minutes ago.
not_available There's still an active socket.
not_available What's that mean? It means he's exchanging data with an off
not_available site link.
not_available Can you locate it? Yeah.
not_available The registry listing is Tarawood Drive? That's his home address.
not_available I'll send a tac team.
not_available No, Bill.
not_available I need to go in alone.
not_available Why? Henderson's good; he'll be able to detect a tac team moving in.
not_available How do you want to play this, Jack? He left me for dead.
not_available I'm the last person he expects to see.
not_available I should be able to walk up to his front door.
not_available All right.
not_available But I want you in constant contact with CTU.
not_available Right now, Henderson is our primary link to finding this nerve gas.
not_available I know.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available You've reached the private client line for Banco Buenos Aires.
not_available Please leave a message at the tone or press the star button for immediate assistance.
not_available Client identification code, please.
not_available Eightfoursevenseven
not_available C, as in "Charlie." How can I help you, Mr.
not_available Henderson? I'd like after
not_available hours access to my personal safety deposit box, please.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Bill, we found a schematic of some kind of ventilation system on one of the terrorists.
not_available It's from the Suvarov attack.
not_available Since that's the most efficient way to deliver the Sentox, this could potentially be their next target.
not_available Do we know what building the schematic is from? Not yet.
not_available But I sent a copy off to Building and Safety.
not_available They're running it against their archive.
not_available Upload it to Chloe and Edgar.
not_available I want them working on this, too.
not_available Better make it fast.
not_available There's a number handwritten in the margin
not_available 18:00 hours.
not_available That means the attack could happen in the next hour.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That was Curtis.
not_available He's going to upload a set of schematics to our server.
not_available This is the likely target of their next attack.
not_available There was a time
not_available stamp on it.
not_available The attack could occur sometime in the next hour.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available The only thing Curtis could tell at first glance is that it's the ventilation system in some kind of industrial building.
not_available How big? Big enough to hold several thousand people.
not_available Let's find it.
not_available How you doing, Tony? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Have you heard anything else on my wife's condition? I haven't heard anything new.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Tony.
not_available You'll have to get back to Recovery.
not_available Get away from me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Almeida, please 
not_available I said get away from me! Tony, come on.
not_available Michelle 
not_available Thank God that you're all right.
not_available Let go of me, or I'll Martha, please 
not_available Listen, don't touch me.
not_available Martha, I'm sorry.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I didn't think that I had any choice.
not_available Charles It isn't just that you You didn't stand up to them.
not_available You should have stood up to them.
not_available Martha Yuri, Anya, I can't tell you how glad I am that you're both all right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It was awful.
not_available I'm deeply embarrassed that something like this could happen on U.S.
not_available soil, but I promise you, whoever did this will be brought to justice.
not_available Excuse me, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Of course.
not_available We both know who is responsible for this.
not_available We believe it was the same group who attacked Ontario Airport this morning, but we thought that they were all killed in the siege.
not_available Obviously, you were wrong.
not_available The situation is much more serious than you know.
not_available These terrorists have possession of a military
not_available grade nerve agent.
not_available And they've threatened to use it against the civilian population of Los Angeles.
not_available How long have you known this? 
not_available We just found out about it.
not_available But given this change of circumstances, I'm asking you to honor the terms of our treaty.
not_available Allow my intelligence and law enforcement agencies access to whatever intelligence your security people have on these separatists.
not_available You will have our help.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I hope you won't find this offensive, but there's something that's been troubling me.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan
not_available her behavior.
not_available She has not been herself.
not_available I'm sure that she is very upset by what just happened.
not_available Yes, I imagine she would be, but I noticed this before the attack.
not_available From the time she entered the car with Anya and me.
not_available Yuri, the truth is, my wife has been under a doctor's care for quite a while now.
not_available She suffers from depression and anxiety.
not_available It's been very difficult for both of us.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Guard said you wanted to see me? How long are you going to keep me here? You're not going out there any time today, Lynn.
not_available District Marshal's reviewing your case.
not_available I need to ask you a favor, Bill.
not_available I know I don't deserve it.
not_available I was unfair to you earlier.
not_available What is it? I need to make a phone call.
not_available Lynn, if you think you can get out of this with a few phone calls, you're mistaken.
not_available I won't let that happen.
not_available It's not that, I swear it.
not_available I'll give you the number, you can clear it yourself.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available My sister.
not_available I need to talk to her about a personal matter.
not_available It can't wait a few hours? No, it can't.
not_available Bill, please, she's in a little bit of trouble and I'm the only one who can help her.
not_available I don't need to clear it.
not_available Get Mr.
not_available McGill a phone.
not_available Give him some privacy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello.
not_available Jenny, it's me.
not_available Listen, I don't care that you took my wallet.
not_available Keep everything that's in there.
not_available I just need to get my key card back.
not_available What key card? 
not_available My CTU access card.
not_available It's of no value to you.
not_available It just lets me in and out of this building.
not_available Well, can't you just get them to give you a new one? I mean, that's what I did when I lost the key to my laundry room.
not_available Damn it, Jenny, this isn't a laundry room.
not_available This is a secure government building.
not_available Now, if you don't want me to call the police, you'll get me back the key card today.
not_available You hear me? 
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available Listen, I got to go.
not_available Where's that card from Lynn's wallet? Why? 'Cause I want to give him back his key card.
not_available We don't need it.
not_available That's how I'm getting us all this money.
not_available You told me we were just going to take his cash and a credit card.
not_available Yeah, we're taking a credit card.
not_available $20,000 line of credit, right here.
not_available $20,000? Who's going to pay you that kind of money? Yes, Mr.
not_available President? I'd like to speak with my wife.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available She asked to be left alone.
not_available Evelyn, I want to see my wife now.
not_available Move away from the door.
not_available Sir, she ordered me not to let anyone in.
not_available I'm not anyone, Evelyn.
not_available I know, sir, but she specifically mentioned you.
not_available I have to get to a meeting.
not_available Would you please tell my wife that I would like to speak with her? Of course, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd like you to find Aaron Pierce right now.
not_available I want to know how he's doing.
not_available Is there a message you want me to get to him? If he's all right, tell him I'd like to see him.
not_available Chloe, come here.
not_available I think I got a match.
not_available There's a discrepancy here.
not_available That's because they're from two different layers.
not_available The one Curtis had was structural, but this is an electrical blueprint.
not_available You're right.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Edgar matched the schematics we got from Curtis.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available Tyler Memorial.
not_available Westwood.
not_available A hospital.
not_available Tell Curtis to activate a tac team.
not_available I'll call Tyler Memorial, tell them to evacuate.
not_available Operations.
not_available Put me through to Tyler Memorial Hospital.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available I'm on
not_available site at the Henderson house.
not_available Do you copy? Jack, we found Intel in the body of a dead terrorist.
not_available There is going to be an attack.
not_available Where? 
not_available Tyler Memorial Hospital.
not_available We think it's happening within the hour.
not_available Okay, I copy.
not_available I'm moving in now.
not_available Miriam 
not_available Who? Christopher's wife.
not_available He's not here.
not_available Tell Chloe I'll get back to her as soon as I have access to his computer.
not_available All right, we're on it.
not_available This is Curtis Manning with CTU.
not_available I need to speak to the ranking security officer on site.
not_available You're talking to him.
not_available Tom Wegman.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wegman, I'm heading to you now with a tactical team.
not_available The nerve gas will most likely be released into a ventilation unit.
not_available You need to seal off the sub
not_available basement.
not_available I've called in a second security shift.
not_available We'll get that area locked down.
not_available Good.
not_available How long before the hospital's evacuated? Uh, an hour, maybe two.
not_available This attack could occur within the next 30 minutes.
not_available This is a large facility, Agent Manning.
not_available We have 600 patients, many of whom need assistance.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wegman, if this nerve agent is released into the ventilation system, everyone inside that building will die.
not_available Do what you have to do, but get those people out of that building.
not_available Right.
not_available Hello, Miriam.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available We thought you were dead.
not_available Where is he? What are you doing, Jack? Miriam, where's Christopher? He's still at work.
not_available Did he call you? You're scaring me.
not_available In the last hour, has he called you?! No.
not_available Now tell me what the hell is going on.
not_available I need to see his computer.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Where is his computer?! I'm not going to tell you anything until you tell me what is going on.
not_available Christopher developed a chemical weapons system called Sentox
not_available VX nerve gas for Omicron.
not_available He enabled terrorists to gain control of it, now it's being used against civilian targets in Los Angeles.
not_available So where is his computer?! 
not_available Miriam, I am telling you the truth.
not_available We have proof that he brokered the deal.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Less than an hour ago he tried to kill me.
not_available Move towards the living room.
not_available Keep walking towards the den.
not_available I want you to take a seat on the couch.
not_available Look, why don't we just call him? I'm sure there's an explanation.
not_available Miriam, take a seat.
not_available You don't need the gun, Jack.
not_available You're not going to shoot me.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available I need access to Henderson's hard drive.
not_available I need you to talk me through it.
not_available Okay, Jack.
not_available Yes? You wanted to see me, ma'am? Oh, yes, Aaron, come in.
not_available I didn't really get a chance to say thank you before.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available I know that you'll say it was all just in the line of duty.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available The country's lucky to have men like you.
not_available I'm lucky.
not_available I hope you'll allow me to say that.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Logan.
not_available Would you excuse us, Aaron? What is it, Mike? The President's been trying to reach you.
not_available I know.
not_available But I don't want to see him.
not_available Would you like me to convey that to the President? You can convey whatever you want, Mike.
not_available Mike Mike, I want you to know nothing happened in there.
not_available Whatever didn't happen, make sure it doesn't happen again.
not_available Manning? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tom Wegman, hospital security.
not_available Thanks for mobilizing your people so quickly.
not_available Have you uplinked with CTU yet? We're doing that now.
not_available We've doubled security at all sub
not_available basement ingress points.
not_available Nobody's getting down there unless they go through us.
not_available Good.
not_available The bad news is we have 26 patients in ICU that can't be moved.
not_available Seven of them are high
not_available dependency newborns.
not_available We can't even relocate them without the specialized transport units which we don't have on site.
not_available What about nearby hospitals? All neonatal transport units are in service.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available I want a visual sweep of all high
not_available probability target points within the hospital.
not_available Team A, start at the north end, Team B take south.
not_available Move.
not_available It's Viktor.
not_available I'm at the hospital.
not_available And why are you calling me? They must have found out about the attack.
not_available The hospital's being evacuated.
not_available All of the elevators and stairwells are guarded.
not_available Calm down, Viktor.
not_available Bring up the schematics of the hospital.
not_available There's another entrance to the sub
not_available basement.
not_available An electrical conduit.
not_available There's a good chance it isn't guarded.
not_available How do I find it? In the Radiology wing down corridor six.
not_available Call us when you're there.
not_available We'll talk you through it.
not_available I'll call you in a few minutes.
not_available Viktor, I need you to finish this task, even if it means you don't get out.
not_available I won't fail you.
not_available DOD just concluded a briefing with Russian Intelligence.
not_available We were given a name.
not_available Vladimir Bierko.
not_available He made billions in the postSoviet economy
not_available weapons and oil.
not_available He bankrolled several underground radical publications promoting the separatist cause, but it's believed that he was more than just a sympathizer.
not_available The Russians think he's financing these attacks? They think that he's directing the attacks himself.
not_available Based on what? A number of communiqués that were intercepted by the Russian security force, supported by the fact that Bierko vanished from Russia 3 months ago.
not_available We posted Bierko's profile to the interagency servers.
not_available Homeland Security has issued an emergency brief to local law enforcement.
not_available Do you think there's any hope of finding him before the attack on Tyler Hospital? The most promising lead we have is a man named Christopher Henderson.
not_available Unfortunately, he escaped.
not_available Jack Bauer believes there may be files on Henderson's computer that could lead us to Bierko.
not_available He's trying to acquire those files now, sir.
not_available Well, let's hope he succeeds, Bill.
not_available The country's already suffered three devastating attacks today.
not_available We need to stop this madman.
not_available Yes, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.
not_available Have you found anything yet? The only thing on Henderson's hard drive is domestic stuff: bill
not_available paying programs, downloaded music.
not_available Chloe, Henderson isn't trading music files with his office.
not_available There's something else on the computer.
not_available Find it.
not_available I'm doing the best I can.
not_available Why don't you face it, Jack? Christopher is innocent.
not_available He was innocent when you forced him out of CTU, and he's innocent now.
not_available Maybe you didn't hear me earlier, Miriam, he tried to kill me.
not_available If he did, then he was defending himself.
not_available No, he blew up the server room at Omicron while I was still inside.
not_available He was destroying evidence that would have implicated him in this conspiracy.
not_available This is so familiar.
not_available You're accusing him of being a criminal.
not_available Why do you hate him so much? I want you to know something.
not_available Chris never hated you, not even after what you did to him.
not_available When he thought you were dead, he looked in on Kim.
not_available He cared about your daughter, Jack, just like he cared about you.
not_available We both did.
not_available You know that.
not_available I found something, Jack.
not_available What is it? It's a shadow drive.
not_available It was partitioned from the primary hard drive.
not_available What's on the shadow drive? A backup log that contains data points for every satellite phone call Henderson has made in the last year.
not_available Can you crossreference those numbers with the telephone numbers the terrorists used earlier this morning? I got into the log, but the phone lists are password
not_available protected.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Christopher had a secret file on his computer.
not_available There's a list of numbers.
not_available And that implicates him? We need access to that list.
not_available Do you know the password? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Miriam, we believe there's going to be another attack within 30 minutes.
not_available Thousands of lives are at stake.
not_available Please, if you know that password, I need it now.
not_available I can't help you.
not_available Chloe, you're going to have to try and hack into it.
not_available I'll see what I can do.
not_available Hurry.
not_available I'll show this to Manning.
not_available Agent Manning? One of our guards caught this.
not_available This guy's dressed as an orderly, but I've never seen him before.
not_available An orderly has no business being where he is.
not_available That was five minutes ago.
not_available Where is this? Sub
not_available basement.
not_available Team A, meet me in the southeast stairwell.
not_available Team B, form a soft perimeter.
not_available We have a possible suspect in play.
not_available CTU, did you copy that? 
not_available Yes, we copy.
not_available Edgar, I need you to uplink the hospital video surveillance for facial recognition software.
not_available See if you can get a match.
not_available Got it.
not_available Curtis has a suspect.
not_available We're running the image through facial recognition.
not_available Halfway through the database.
not_available Got something.
not_available All right, put it up.
not_available Curtis, we have a suspect.
not_available His name is Viktor Grigorin.
not_available He's a Russian national.
not_available Served time for drug smuggling and weapons trafficking.
not_available Copy that.
not_available All teams, suspect is a confirmed hostile.
not_available Repeat: a confirmed hostile.
not_available Freeze! Don't move! Agent Manning, you need to come look at this.
not_available Search him.
not_available Don't! It might be set to go off if it's moved.
not_available Chemical Response Team, we need you down here now.
not_available All teams, we've located the canister, and it is armed.
not_available Repeat: the canister is armed.
not_available CTU, Chemical Response Team is on the way in.
not_available The hospital evacuation is still in progress.
not_available There are still a lot of people in here.
not_available Copy that, Curtis.
not_available Edgar, notify LAPD and all relevant agencies.
not_available I want a mandatory evacuation of the downtown core.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Jack, Henderson is using an interlaced encryption key.
not_available What does that mean? It could take me a half a day to crack it.
not_available Damn it, Chloe, we don't have that kind of time.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's a little tougher than it looked at first glance, okay? Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Jack, you should know that Curtis and his team intercepted a terrorist at the hospital.
not_available Did they take him into custody? 
not_available No.
not_available He's dead.
not_available But they found a nerve gas canister.
not_available They're trying to disarm it now.
not_available There are patients there that can't be evacuated.
