
not_available How long will Prescott detain me? 
not_available Until after the press conference.
not_available In two hours he'll announce our response to the bomb and his ascension to president.
not_available I've done with Bauer.
not_available He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere.
not_available We're onto other things.
not_available You've been reassigned.
not_available You can't reassign me now.
not_available You have made yourself a liability I can't afford.
not_available This is Kim Bauer.
not_available I need my dad.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I'm at the Mathesons' house.
not_available Gary's here.
not_available He has a gun.
not_available He killed the policeman that brought me.
not_available I wantyou to point the gun at his chest and pull the trigger now.
not_available Is he dead? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll send someone to pick you up.
not_available Go downstairs and wait for them.
not_available I am certain the Cyprus audio has been forged.
not_available I have in custody the man who engineered it.
not_available I'll bring him in soon.
not_available How will it work? 
not_available I'll make a recording for them, on the spot.
not_available Shift it around, reframe segments, same specs as Cyprus.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available This is taking too long.
not_available We're the only ones who can help you.
not_available Without us, you don't stand a chance.
not_available Alex! Alex! Thank you.
not_available How's Chappelle? 
not_available Still unconscious, but he's starting to stir.
not_available The drug I gave him is short
not_available acting.
not_available He may need more.
not_available How long can you keep pumping him full? Long enough for Jackto deliver Hewitt.
not_available How are we coming on the chopper? It should land at Hewitt's in ten minutes.
not_available We should have him here in half an hour.
not_available Is Carrie asking about Chappelle? 
not_available Notyet, no.
not_available Image processing should keep her busy for a while.
not_available Excuse me, Mr Almeida? Brad Hammond from Division wants Mr Chappelle.
not_available Do you know where he is? No, I'll take it.
not_available This is Tony Almeida.
not_available How can I help you, sir? Where's Ryan? 
not_available Uh, I'm not sure.
not_available His office says he arrived at CTU three hours ago.
not_available None of your people can find him.
not_available He must have stepped out.
not_available He didn't log out.
not_available Did he say where he was going? Not to me, sir, but I'll letyou know as soon as I find him.
not_available No, you'll tell me what's going on over there.
not_available I know Ryan Chappelle was going to assess the situation.
not_available I cannot think why he would be out of contact during a national crisis.
not_available Mr Hammond, I'm sorry, I've told you all that I know, sir.
not_available I'll make sure Ryan calls when he returns.
not_available You do that.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available What's goin' on? 
not_available Division knows something's up.
not_available So what are we gonna do? 
not_available GetAlex Hewitt here as quickly as possible.
not_available Alex! Alex! Alex, if you don't come with me, Kingsley will kill you.
not_available You knowthat! I just did what they told me.
not_available I didn't know what was gonna happen.
not_available Your only way outta this is to let me take you into CTU.
not_available You can cut a deal, testify! Alex, you're gonna have to trust me! Alex! Alex! Stop running! Alex! Alex, listen to me.
not_available A chopper's on its way to take us to CTU, where no one can hurtyou.
not_available Please, Alex.
not_available Help me stop this war and I will help you stay alive, I promise.
not_available Please.
not_available Alex! Stop, dammit! I knowthe oil stocks closed high in Hong Kong last night, Max, but remember, once the president announces the war, the margins will change dramatically.
not_available Prices will spike immediately.
not_available It's still worth acquiring shares.
not_available Do we still have our problem? 
not_available That'll be taken care of.
not_available This must go smoothly.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I have to go.
not_available OK.
not_available What'd you get? 
not_available All the recordings and data.
not_available But no Hewitt? We got there as soon as we could, but I had no lead time.
not_available Everything, including Hewitt, was meant to have been vaporised last night.
not_available I won't let some pimply
not_available faced techie ruin everything that we've planned.
not_available If he gets brought in and testifies, there's gonna be no place for any of us to hide.
not_available Alex! Alex! There's nowhere left to run.
not_available It's over.
not_available All right.
not_available You you promise I'll be safe? I give you my word.
not_available Alex, drop the gun! Drop the gun! If you try to shoot me, I will have to shootyou back, and I won't miss.
not_available And I don't wanna do that.
not_available I can't stop this war withoutyou, Alex.
not_available Please, drop the gun.
not_available Please, drop the gun.
not_available Alex, you're a smart guy.
not_available Thinkthis through.
not_available I am the only guy that can getyou through this alive.
not_available Please, drop the gun.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Alex You shot me! You shot me! 
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available No! Alex, Alex Can you hear me? 
not_available OK, stay calm.
not_available Don't move.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available What happened? 
not_available You fell.
not_available Alex, stay with me.
not_available I wantyou to keep your eyes open, OK? Just keep your eyes open.
not_available OK Agh! 
not_available You're OK.
not_available The bullet didn't hit an artery.
not_available The chopper should be here soon.
not_available You're not gonna bleed to death.
not_available It hurts.
not_available I'm gonna getyou something for the pain as soon as we get on the chopper.
not_available Is there any other part of your body besides your leg that still hurts? No, not really.
not_available OK, good.
not_available It looks like you got lucky.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available My head feels wet.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Try and relax.
not_available Just putyour head down.
not_available OK.
not_available I gotta make a phone call, OK? I'm not goin' anywhere.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Come on.
not_available Almeida.
not_available It's Jack.
not_available Hewitt's been hurt.
not_available I need medical assistance on the roof now.
not_available There's no EMT on the chopper, but there's a med kit.
not_available Can you handle it? I don't know.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Look, I gotta get backto this.
not_available Wait.
not_available What? You may not be able to contact me after this.
not_available Why? 
not_available Chappelle became a problem.
not_available I had to take him out of play, and they're onto me.
not_available They'll take me out soon.
not_available Who do I contact if I need help? Michelle is setting up an off
not_available site station.
not_available She'll do what she can by remote access.
not_available She'll be on her closed cell, channel B, node 12
not_available 12.
not_available B, node 12
not_available 12.
not_available I got it.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Alex, how you doin'? 
not_available This'll getyou into the van.
not_available How will I breakthrough the firewall? 
not_available This has a range of a few blocks.
not_available It's Huffman encoded.
not_available It'll getyou in.
not_available Give me a call when you're set, all right? 
not_available Michelle.
not_available Hi.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available I'm going out to my car.
not_available Are you leaving? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm just getting something.
not_available Is there a problem? Have you seen Chappelle? 
not_available No.
not_available I've looked everywhere and I can't find him.
not_available If I see him, I'll tell him you're looking for him.
not_available And if you don't see him? What's that supposed to mean? My job is to monitor communications around here.
not_available You don't think I know what's goin' on? 
not_available Why don'tyou tell me, Carrie? You called Chappelle in to see Rudin.
not_available I just talked to Rudin.
not_available He doesn't know anything about it.
not_available Well, of course he told you that.
not_available His system wasn't loaded properly and it was your fault.
not_available He wanted to see Chappelle to complain aboutyou.
not_available Stay out of my business, Carrie.
not_available You'll do a better job.
not_available Brian.
not_available How did you find out about me? The Attorney General said you'd want me for your counsel.
not_available What have they told you? 
not_available You'd been removed from office under the 25th Amendment.
not_available Is what they did legal? 
not_available Technically, yes.
not_available The cabinet can declare the president incompetent without further definition or clarification.
not_available That also gives me the right to appeal.
not_available Yes, which I will do vigorously.
not_available Unfortunately, it's a lengthy process.
not_available We don't have time.
not_available I don't know howto make it go any faster.
not_available None of those legalities matter.
not_available We're about to go to war based on evidence that I am convinced is false.
not_available No one outside this room believes that.
not_available The evidence was manipulated by a man named Peter Kingsley.
not_available I need you to find out all you can about him.
not_available Mike Novick's tying my hands.
not_available Get him to untie them 
not_available whatever you have to do.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Almeida.
not_available I'm in place.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available I'm in the north lot.
not_available Van 15a.
not_available Listen, Tony, Carrie's onto us.
not_available She was asking about Chappelle.
not_available What did you tell her? That I didn't know anything, but we need her out of the way.
not_available Keep her occupied.
not_available OK, I'll handle it.
not_available Get ahold of Jack.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Hammond's here.
not_available Mr Hammond.
not_available Tony.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I told you on the phone.
not_available I thinkthere's a problem here.
not_available Where's Ryan Chappelle? 
not_available I haven't seen him yet, sir.
not_available I see.
not_available Two of you take this side.
not_available I want this section covered.
not_available What are you doin'? 
not_available I'm locking you down.
not_available We're in the middle of preparing a domestic response to this war.
not_available That's not what I heard.
not_available I heard you were supporting a rogue agent against orders.
not_available Where'd you hear that? 
not_available One of your people.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Cover every square inch of the place! 
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available That flyover space is critical.
not_available Will David help us? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Mike.
not_available I don't see us having much success with him.
not_available We need this, Mike.
not_available Yes, sir, I'll try.
not_available How is he? David is convinced his decision to hold off on the bombers was correct.
not_available He'll appeal his removal from office.
not_available The 25th Amendment gives him that right.
not_available We'll prove we're being manipulated and that the Cyprus recording was falsified, plus we nowthink we know by whom.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available A man named Peter Kingsley.
not_available He's got ties to oil interests both here and abroad.
not_available Have you found anything to connect him to the Cyprus recording, or the bomb? No.
not_available We won't be able to without access to the Intelligence database.
not_available David's locked down until we've gone public with the military action.
not_available By then it'll be too late.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Mike, wait.
not_available Just hold on a second.
not_available I remember when you signed up for David's first run at the Senate over 20 years ago.
not_available That's that's a lot of history to just throw out the window.
not_available Come on, Mike.
not_available I know you just did whatyou thought was right, but let him try to prove his case.
not_available You owe him that.
not_available I'll have Colleen set up a computer station for you.
not_available You won't be able to transmit outgoing messages.
not_available That's fair enough.
not_available What's in here? 
not_available A holding room.
not_available No one's in there now.
not_available All right.
not_available And this? 
not_available The other holding room.
not_available It shouldn't be locked.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Someone must have reconfigured the lock.
not_available Come on, Alex.
not_available Keep talking to me.
not_available Everything's a little blurry.
not_available What's happening to me? Nothing.
not_available You just banged your head.
not_available It's gonna be all right, OK? 
not_available You just hang in there.
not_available Alex, I can hear 'em.
not_available They're coming, OK? Help's on the way.
not_available Just hang in there, OK? I've located the CTU chopper that Tony Almeida sent to Jack Bauer.
not_available They're landing.
not_available Would you like them to detain Bauer? No, I don't wanna waste any more resources on him.
not_available Just get the chopper back here.
not_available Mr Chappelle wants you to come back now.
not_available We're about to land.
not_available I know.
not_available I can see him 
not_available Just do it.
not_available What are you waiting for? 
not_available I'm putting her down.
not_available No, cancel that.
not_available Land the chopper now! What are you doing?! Land the damn chopper! My witness is gonna die! Land! Your orders are to pick us up! Pick us up now! Dammit! 
not_available Dessler.
not_available The chopper won't pick us up.
not_available Hammond's locked us down.
not_available I don't give a damn! Get me that chopper back! Hewitt is dying! Alex.
not_available Want me to deal with Almeida? 
not_available No, Brad, thanks.
not_available I'll take care of him myself.
not_available Michelle, it's me.
not_available Jack, where are you? Going backto Hewitt's loft.
not_available Set up and be ready to interface with his computer.
not_available What about Hewitt? 
not_available He didn't make it.
not_available He's dead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Call me when you're ready.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I need to speak with you.
not_available It concerns national security.
not_available As I am not the commander in chief any more, that's irrelevant.
not_available We have a problem with the Turkish government.
not_available Our Stealth bombers are nearing their airspace, but one of their fighter patrols spotted them a few minutes ago.
not_available Askthe prime minister for the flyover.
not_available He should agree.
not_available The secretary of state has spoken to him.
not_available He'll grant us this under one condition.
not_available What's the condition? He wants a personal request and assurances from the president.
not_available The prime minister doesn't know I've been removed from office.
not_available He couldn't be told before the American people.
not_available That wouldn't be right, would it, Mike? Nowthat the bombers have been spotted, it's critical that they get to their targets quickly.
not_available Any detour will take them over unfriendly skies.
not_available You want me to speakto the prime minister, under the pretence that I'm still the president? Yes.
not_available This mission is going to continue regardless, sir.
not_available This phone call, no matter how distasteful, could prevent those planes from being attacked.
not_available We only have minutes, sir.
not_available Why did you leave me like this? I've been stabbed! Let me look at it.
not_available Be careful.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available The wound's superficial.
not_available The bleeding's already stopped.
not_available I'll getyou a clean bandage for it.
not_available Where's Alex? 
not_available He fell.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What happens now? You are going to help me.
not_available Just put this right here.
not_available Help you do what? 
not_available We got one last play.
not_available To deliver Kingsley.
not_available No.
not_available He's far too dangerous, and you'll never get close to him.
not_available You're right.
not_available I won't, butyou will.
not_available Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed.
not_available If you say you can deliver him, that should get his attention.
not_available Kingsley has evidence that will implicate me.
not_available There is no way Mrs Palmer, you What? It's nothing.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Don't tell me it's nothing.
not_available What's going on? My heart stopped when Kingsley's men were interrogating me.
not_available Your heart could be damaged.
not_available You need to get to a doctor.
not_available We need to get Kingsley first.
not_available Mrs Palmer, you are going to help me.
not_available I'm not gonna give you another choice.
not_available You wouldn't dare hurt me.
not_available Make no mistake about it.
not_available I will do what I have to do.
not_available What do you want me to do? Tell Kingsley you'll exchange Hewitt for any evidence that incriminates you.
not_available He'll want proof that I have Hewitt.
not_available He'll get it.
not_available How? Hewitt's gonna talkto him.
not_available At this point, we can assume the chip containing the source recordings has not landed in government hands.
not_available Did you intercept the federal agent who was in possession of the chip? No.
not_available But since the bombers are still on course, we can assume that he wasn't able to deliver it to the president.
not_available Which leaves Hewitt as the last remaining loose end.
not_available Where are we on finding him? I have several teams out looking for him.
not_available He cannot be allowed to talk.
not_available Not now, nor ever.
not_available Hewitt will be found, and he'll be eliminated.
not_available Clean this up, Peter.
not_available Go over it again, even if you need to pull a couple of agents in to help you.
not_available I don't need to tell you you're under arrest.
not_available Where's Michelle Dessler? 
not_available She knew nothing about this.
not_available She called me to the room where you drugged me.
not_available She didn't know what I was gonna do.
not_available I need to issue a warrant.
not_available Contact local police, issue a memo.
not_available I can find her.
not_available How? This whole thing's been about helping Jack Bauer.
not_available She's doing that somewhere off
not_available site.
not_available How do we find her? 
not_available Track her access code.
not_available See if she's logged onto the CTU computer network.
not_available Then do it.
not_available Right away.
not_available Put him in Holding 2.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I'm connected to his computer.
not_available Press "escape" and I can take control.
not_available Done.
not_available What did Hewitt tell you? He had a program that could recreate anybody's voice.
not_available With a voice sample, he could get it to say anything.
not_available He kept all the audio files in a main file.
not_available All right, I think I've found it.
not_available I've never seen this.
not_available Samples connect through an integrator.
not_available I need anything with Hewitt's voice on it.
not_available All right, hold on.
not_available I'm gonna need Berkeley and Wilkerson at that lunch.
not_available Is that him? 
not_available No, dammit.
not_available There's hundreds of files.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Mrs Palmer, when did you call Hewitt? 
not_available Last night, around midnight.
not_available Why? 
not_available He might have recorded it.
not_available Michelle, can you filter the audio files by time and date? Let me see Yeah.
not_available Find an audio file that was recorded late last night or early this morning, around midnight.
not_available This must be it.
not_available Hello? Who's this? 
not_available That's him.
not_available Sherry Palmer.
not_available We have to let it run.
not_available I know all about your relationship with Peter Kingsley.
not_available I don't know him.
not_available I also know you had all his phone conversations recorded.
not_available Let me ask you.
not_available Was that to protect yourself or to blackmail him? 
not_available It's OK, Alex.
not_available I'm here to help you.
not_available Who says I need help? Peter thoughtyou'd die in Los Angeles with everybody else today.
not_available Now thatyou haven't, he's gonna come after you.
not_available So listen to me, and I can protectyou.
not_available We have enough material to create a phonetic template.
not_available Good.
not_available What do we do? 
not_available Open up a .gen file and type in the phrases we want voiced.
not_available What do you mean, open a .gen file? He created a separate module for playback.
not_available We have to find what menu it's under.
not_available What am I looking for? 
not_available It's not here.
not_available Try a subroutine called Prologue.
not_available It's this one.
not_available They've found me, Jack.
not_available It's loading.
not_available What am I looking for now? A playback graphic interface.
not_available They're almost here.
not_available Come out of the van! 
not_available Hold on, Michelle.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Ma'am, hands off the keyboard.
not_available I've got it.
not_available Michelle! Do we take her in? 
not_available Michelle! Affirmative, Central.
not_available She's in custody.
not_available Hello, Heather.
not_available Mr President.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's all right, Heather.
not_available Mr President, we're ready.
not_available David.
not_available I realise how awkward this is.
not_available I hope Mike has told you how much we appreciate your help.
not_available Make no mistake.
not_available I believe you're making a gross and tragic error.
not_available I'm doing this for the men in those planes.
not_available We're ready here.
not_available Patch in the prime minister.
not_available Mr Prime Minister.
not_available Hello, Mr President.
not_available I've been trying to reach youfor some time.
not_available Kim? Kim! Hello? Hello? Kim? Kim? Who are you? 
not_available I'm Kate Warner.
not_available Your father sent me to come getyou.
not_available How do I knowthat? OK.
not_available You shot a man who came in here to attack you.
not_available It was self
not_available defence.
not_available Your father, Jack Bauer, called me, asked me to come getyou, take you to CTU.
not_available How else would I know all of that? How do you know my dad? Do you work at CTU? No.
not_available My family was involved with what happened today.
not_available Why would my dad send someone he'd just met to come get me? Huh? He trusts me.
not_available Come on, Kim.
not_available It's OK.
not_available The sooner we leave, the sooner you and your dad can be together, OK? What do you thinkthey'll charge us with? They could push for treason if they wanted to.
not_available Thinkthey will? Depends on how big of an example they wanna make of us.
not_available Look, Michelle no one can prove thatyou knew what I was gonna do to Chappelle.
not_available I'm gonna tell them thatyou were helping Jack under my orders, all right? No.
not_available What do you mean, no? I did what I thought was right.
not_available I still believe that.
not_available And I won't letyou lie for me.
not_available David Thank you.
not_available I know how difficult it must have been for you.
not_available How much longer will Prescott keep me here? Until after the press conference.
not_available I've requested you be released sooner, but there's only so much I can do.
not_available I spoke to Brian.
not_available He requested some low
not_available security access on your behalf.
not_available I wanted you to know I granted it.
not_available So what's going on with you and my dad? Excuse me? Out of everyone he could have called, he called you.
not_available There's gotta be a reason.
not_available I don't think he trusts very many people.
not_available He trusts you.
not_available Is it true you guys just met today? 
not_available Yesterday really, butyeah, it is.
not_available I don't resent it or anything.
not_available I just want him to be happy.
not_available It's been a long time.
not_available Since you lostyour mother? Yeah.
not_available I lost my mother too.
not_available When I was aboutyour age.
not_available I really don't think I can do this.
not_available You'll do fine.
not_available Just tell him everything I told you to say.
not_available Make the call.
not_available Understood.
not_available Still no sign of Hewitt.
not_available Yes? It's Sherry Palmer, Peter.
not_available Are we on a secure line? 
not_available Of course we are.
not_available I want the tapes thatyou made of our conversation, the original DATs.
not_available Why would I give you those? 
not_available Because I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return.
not_available You've found Hewitt? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Where is he? Don't insult my intelligence.
not_available Agree to the exchange, then you can do whatever you want with him.
not_available I want to talkto him.
not_available You'll have to hold on.
not_available My bodyguard has him restrained in the next room.
not_available All right, Alex, you can talk.
not_available It's not whatyou think.
not_available They came in here with guns and threatened to kill me.
not_available I didn't tell them anything aboutyou, I swear, please.
not_available Who's been there, Alex? Who have you told about this? Do we have a deal or not? 
not_available Not until I know what's going on there.
not_available Give me Alex back.
not_available I'm not gonna keep this call going on so thatyou can trace it.
not_available Is ityes or no? Look, this is an ultimatum, Mrs Palmer.
not_available You putAlex back on, or this conversation is ended.
not_available You force my hand and I'll make sure Hewitt tells his story to as many people as possible.
not_available It's your final chance, Mrs Palmer.
not_available Then it's goodbye, Peter.
not_available Fine.
not_available Let's do this.
not_available Neutral ground.
not_available All right.
not_available LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes.
not_available Justyou and Alex.
not_available All right.
not_available Very good work, Mrs Palmer.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Sherry Palmer has Hewitt.
not_available What does she want? I get this feeling I'm being set up.
not_available Hewitt's just the bait to draw me out into the open.
not_available So what are you gonna do? I don't have any choice.
not_available I have to play this out.
not_available Scott'll have shooters in place.
not_available Sherry Palmer and whoever else she's involved with in this won't leave there alive.
not_available And then I'm heading outta the country.
not_available Time to roll things up around here.
not_available Now.
not_available Is there anything I can do for you? You've already done so much.
not_available I'll see you in Lisbon next week.
not_available I am enormously grateful.
not_available What support will you get from CTU? 
not_available As of now, none.
not_available Wait.
not_available You don't expect to take Kingsley down by yourself? That's insane! When Kingsley incriminates himself, CTU will help.
