
not_available I've been told a cruise missile was launched containing a nuclear warhead.
not_available That's correct.
not_available What about Marwan? You think he'll break? That won't be easy, sir.
not_available He's planned and organized everything that's happened today.
not_available How do I fight terrorists while provoking a nuclear superpower? We marched on Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals, and in the process the Chinese consul was killed.
not_available The murder of our consul on Chinese soil could be construed as an act of war.
not_available I assume you know this man.
not_available Howard Bern, one of your field agents.
not_available Camera at the consulate picked up your face.
not_available I was wearing my mask.
not_available Trust me, I saw the freeze
not_available frame.
not_available It was you.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available You gotta go.
not_available There's a chopper waiting for you.
not_available It doesn't matter where you take me.
not_available What I want is already happening.
not_available Go! Notify the perimeter we no longer have Marwan in custody.
not_available Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.
not_available They're bringing him to CTU.
not_available This is a sketch of the guy Richard Heller described.
not_available He and the girl are our only leads to finding Marwan.
not_available One of us is gonna get caught to save the other? It's gonna be you.
not_available Tony, wait.
not_available I can't spend another day without you.
not_available I'm ready to leave here.
not_available I'm ready to go with you.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Tony, this is Jack.
not_available Has anybody reported outside movement? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? The man is dead.
not_available The girl is no longer in the apartment.
not_available Tony, do you copy? Tony, do you copy? Castle, why is Almeida not on com? All teams, this is Bauer.
not_available Castle is down.
not_available Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.
not_available Have you apprehended her? 
not_available No, we do not have her in custody.
not_available She's hiding here in the apartment complex.
not_available She killed Castle and I believe she's taken Almeida as a hostage.
not_available Is there any way she slipped the perimeter? 
not_available No.
not_available There's over 600 apartments.
not_available We have to search them room by room.
not_available Listen, we need more personnel here.
not_available We're running low on manpower.
not_available There's a missile in the air carrying a nuclear warhead.
not_available This is our best shot at taking it out before it hits.
not_available The White House is searching for the missile.
not_available We're stretched thin.
not_available We'll have LAPD send more men.
not_available We'll send Curtis and another tac team to the location.
not_available OK.
not_available We've initiated a search starting with the buildings nearest the perimeter, working our way in, but we need LAPD here now.
not_available Keep us posted.
not_available Contact Division.
not_available See if they can spare more men.
not_available I'll call our liaison at LAPD.
not_available We've almost completed our satellite pass over the radius of the missile.
not_available And no sign of it yet? 
not_available No, not so far.
not_available What do you think our chances are of locating the missile with subsequent passes? They're not very good.
not_available This missile's an S
not_available class.
not_available It uses elements of Stealth technology.
not_available It was designed to evade detection.
not_available I know, but it will still have a heat signature.
not_available Yes, but the lower the missile flies to the ground, the harder it is to pick up.
not_available How much longer until you've completed the pass? Uh, less than 20 minutes.
not_available Get back to me when you have the results.
not_available All right.
not_available We need every agent there.
not_available They're not cleared for field work.
not_available Bump up their security level on a provisional basis.
not_available Call me back with the exact number.
not_available All right.
not_available Coordinate that with Edgar Stiles here at com.
not_available Thanks, Rick.
not_available What did LAPD say? They're keeping units in reserve They're sending more patrolmen to Jack? 
not_available They're sending nine over there now and Nine? That's not nearly enough.
not_available We'll have to reassign our people there.
not_available I'm taking care of that.
not_available When? We need people there now.
not_available This woman has to be captured.
not_available Michelle.
not_available Everyone understands what's at stake here.
not_available We're gonna do our best to find this woman, but we have to remain calm, or everything will spiral out of control.
not_available You're right.
not_available I'm not being objective.
not_available I'll admit it.
not_available I'm worried about what this woman might do to Tony, but I will not lose sight of the big picture.
not_available The big picture is that we have to apprehend this hostile alive.
not_available Nothing else matters.
not_available What is it, Marwan? 
not_available You're late.
not_available You were supposed to check in.
not_available I know.
not_available There was a hitch.
not_available Nothing serious.
not_available Um, I am gonna be there.
not_available What kind of hitch? There was a problem in the apartment and I'm dealing with it.
not_available I'm leaving in one hour.
not_available I'm not waiting for you.
not_available I know, and I'm gonna be there.
not_available Well, we don't have much time.
not_available They're very close to finding us and that would be very, very bad for both of us.
not_available So tell me.
not_available Two years ago you put Michelle Dessler's life ahead of national security.
not_available You let a suspect escape and you committed treason.
not_available Is she gonna do the same for you? 
not_available Mike, it's Audrey Raines.
not_available Yes, Audrey.
not_available What have you got? The satellite pass is complete.
not_available We could not detect the missile with thermal imaging.
not_available There's just too much radiant heat from ground sources.
not_available Ms Raines, this is President Palmer.
not_available Is there a chance another satellite pass will find the missile? Well, the more data we have, Mr.
not_available President, the better, but a more intensive pass will take two to three hours.
not_available And we expect the missile to find its target before then.
not_available Yes, sir, we do.
not_available All right.
not_available Make sure FBI's on a real
not_available time link with all local emergency channels.
not_available I'll get that done right now.
not_available I also want you to compile disaster scenarios for the urban centers within range of the missile.
not_available Sir, that's 20 of the largest cities in this country.
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available I want death rates, fallout patterns, emergency response predictions for all of them.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'll take care of that right now.
not_available Thank you, Ms Raines.
not_available Assign teams sections of the grid.
not_available We do not want people bumping into each other.
not_available If the subject is spotted, what's the protocol? We maximize for capture.
not_available There can be no lag time.
not_available You wanna evaluate the formation? She's got Tony hostage.
not_available We proceed as if there is no hostage.
not_available There is only one operational objective 
not_available to capture this woman.
not_available Make sure that's the profile you send out to all the teams.
not_available Understand? Yes.
not_available Dessler.
not_available Why don't you go somewhere private so we can talk? Who is this? 
not_available I'm sending you the answer.
not_available Tony.
not_available Now do you know who this is? And don't bother trying to triangulate the call.
not_available It's scrambled.
not_available Please, don't hurt him.
not_available He's OK for now, but he won't be unless you do everything that I say, Michelle.
not_available I understand.
not_available I need your help getting outta here.
not_available Whwhat kind of help? 
not_available You're hesitating.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I just need to know what you want me to do.
not_available Your men are between me and my exit.
not_available I need to know what their search patterns are and how many men there are.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll find out.
not_available You'll tell me right now.
not_available I have to talk to my tactical teams.
not_available Oh, Michelle, you're stalling.
not_available How many men are there, total? Upwards of 30, not including LAPD, and reinforcements are on the way.
not_available You will need to remove your men from the northeast driveway of the complex.
not_available I
not_available I don't know if I can do that.
not_available You will redeploy your men by the time I call you back, or Tony dies.
not_available When are you calling back? 
not_available Soon.
not_available Get moving, Michelle.
not_available Oh, she still loves you.
not_available The question is how much.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available Send the deployment group to my screen.
not_available It's updating.
not_available You want the last version? 
not_available Just send it.
not_available Are reinforcements there? 
not_available Some are on site now.
not_available Some will be there in 15 minutes.
not_available You want me to send the upgraded grid when it's in? Ms Dessler? Yes.
not_available Yes, do that.
not_available No.
not_available No, we can't eliminate the Midwest or any region within the missile's flying range.
not_available All areas of the country are vulnerable? Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
not_available This warhead could hit anywhere.
not_available We're putting together the projected casualty numbers.
not_available They're gonna be high.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where are we on the apartments search? 
not_available Nothing so far.
not_available LAPD there yet? 
not_available They're on their way.
not_available I'll be at com.
not_available I can't do this.
not_available Can't do what? I can't sacrifice the lives of all those people if this warhead goes off.
not_available She called me.
not_available Who? Who called you? The hostile who has Tony.
not_available When? What did she say? 
not_available A couple of minutes ago.
not_available She said to redeploy our men so she can get away or Tony dies.
not_available Yes, sir? 
not_available Patch me through to Jack Bauer.
not_available Take your team.
not_available Start working the second floor, building 11.
not_available Jack, you read me? 
not_available I copy.
not_available We've got something.
not_available The suspect contacted Michelle.
not_available She confirms she's holding Tony hostage.
not_available She's trying to use him as leverage against Michelle to open an escape route.
not_available Is Michelle there? 
not_available I'm right here, Jack.
not_available Do we have any idea where she is? She wants me to clear the northeast driveway.
not_available She's going to call to confirm I did it.
not_available When? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It could be any second.
not_available I want you to make her believe that you're still cooperating with her.
not_available I need you to draw her into the open.
not_available I promise you that we will do everything we can for Tony.
not_available OK.
not_available Stay ready for her call.
not_available I'll pull all our units out of the northeast driveway, put them in concealed positions.
not_available She might change her mind at the last minute and try another escape route.
not_available We'll be ready for that, but I want her to believe Michelle's complying.
not_available Once she's 50 yards outside of the complex and can't re
not_available enter, our teams will converge.
not_available Let me know when your men can redeploy.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Are you gonna be all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was gonna do what she wanted.
not_available Michelle.
not_available I didn't call you right away.
not_available AII I could think of at first was saving Tony's life.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's done.
not_available Los Angeles Police Department.
not_available Open up! Yes, sir.
not_available All designated teams, prepare to move into secondary positions on my command.
not_available Curtis.
not_available What should I do? 
not_available Some residents aren't cooperating.
not_available Have LAPD units arrest anybody that's giving us a problem.
not_available Why don't we pull some of the resources off the search? We'd have a better chance of finding the hostile.
not_available The hostile will look for any sign that Michelle's betrayed her.
not_available We have to act as if we have no idea they've been in contact.
not_available Understood.
not_available Once you're done with LAPD, I need you.
not_available You got it.
not_available Bill, this is Jack.
not_available Do you copy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're ready to go here.
not_available Any new communication from the hostile? No, Michelle's still waiting for her call.
not_available Have you been able to make any ID on scene? Forensics tried to pull prints, but came up with nothing.
not_available Same result here.
not_available No match on the voiceprint.
not_available She's managed to stay completely out of the radar.
not_available We're gonna have to hope she slips up and makes a mistake, otherwise we're in trouble.
not_available Proceed when ready.
not_available We're standing by.
not_available Copy that.
not_available All northeast driveway teams, move into secondary positions.
not_available We're a go.
not_available Hi.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Hey.
not_available You're supposed to stay in your apartment.
not_available There's some crazy person loose.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Hey, where's Joss? 
not_available He just got up.
not_available Can you just get him? I need to talk to him.
not_available Something happened.
not_available Joss! What's going on? 
not_available Nothing, just weird stuff.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Why don't you just tell me? 
not_available No, it's cool.
not_available Hey, what's going on? 
not_available Hey, man, how are you? Not a sound.
not_available I just got off a very disturbing phone call from the Chinese foreign secretary.
not_available They're pressing us on the consulate attack? It's much worse than that, David.
not_available The fallout from that attack you authorized is escalating.
not_available They're determined to pin this on us.
not_available If they confirm this is one of our men, I don't have to tell you how disastrous it would be.
not_available No, sir, you don't.
not_available This is not conclusive enough for the Chinese to turn this into an international incident.
not_available If they find corroborating evidence? 
not_available CTU is preventing that from happening, including getting this agent out of sight until it blows over.
not_available I gave you the authority to make the decision, but you never should have ordered that assault.
not_available If we hadn't carried out the raid, we'd be nowhere in stopping the missile.
not_available And where are we, David? Is there some progress I don't know about? CTU is closing in on one of Marwan's associates.
not_available If they apprehend her in time, they feel they can use her to find Marwan.
not_available Do you know how speculative that sounds? My God, we're never gonna find it in time! Don't say that! We will.
not_available You must believe that if you're going to lead today.
not_available How? Every second brings that missile closer to its target, which, for all we know, is us.
not_available We are not sitting on our hands, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available We are using every resource at our disposal to find this missile.
not_available We will prevent the warhead from going off.
not_available I wish I was as confident as you are.
not_available You need to be.
not_available Remain presidential.
not_available Demand nothing less than success from your people and you will get it.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available What do I tell the Chinese foreign secretary? 
not_available You don't.
not_available Let Mike handle this.
not_available He'll tell them unless they have proof of our involvement, you don't wanna hear from them today.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan, Agent Bern on six.
not_available Send it to my cell phone.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available It's Agent Bern, sir.
not_available I got a message to call you as soon as I landed.
not_available Are we on a secure line? 
not_available Yes, sir, it's an encrypted cell.
not_available The Chinese are pressing the case that we're involved in the assault on their consulate.
not_available Have they found evidence beyond the video of me? No, and we have to make sure they don't.
not_available I want you to start fabricating an alibi with CTU in San Diego.
not_available Make it look like you worked there during the assault.
not_available Our transport's arriving right now, sir.
not_available I'll get right on it.
not_available The alibi has to withstand careful scrutiny.
not_available San Diego phone logs, rosters and mainframe records all have to back it up.
not_available It'll be airtight, sir.
not_available It has to be.
not_available Sir, about my family, do you think there's any chance the Chinese will try to get to them? They can't.
not_available We've already contacted your wife and we've moved her and your kids to a hotel.
not_available I'll be in touch, Agent Bern.
not_available Thank you very much, sir.
not_available Drive.
not_available What the hell is this? 
not_available I think you already know what this is.
not_available CTU sent a team into our consulate just a few hours ago.
not_available You were on the team and our consul general was killed.
not_available You're gonna tell me who was responsible.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Really? Then why were you being transported here by helicopter from CTU Los Angeles? 
not_available You don't know where I came from.
not_available Actually, I do.
not_available Before entering CTU earlier tonight, we turned our satellite on that location.
not_available While I was questioning your superiors, our satellite picked up someone being taken away by helicopter.
not_available So what? That wasn't me.
not_available No, it was you! The Chinese government insists that someone take responsibility for the death of our consul.
not_available What does that mean, "take responsibility"? Now, I believe you were only following orders.
not_available Tell us who gave you orders and I'II let you go.
not_available I'm not telling you anything.
not_available I believe you're gonna change your mind.
not_available Yes? Have you redeployed your men? 
not_available Yes, I have.
not_available Bill, it's Jack.
not_available Uplink is on.
not_available You sure they followed your instructions? 
not_available I'm sure.
not_available It's starting to rain pretty hard.
not_available Michelle do you love Tony? 
not_available Yes, I love him.
not_available Good.
not_available If I find out you're trying to play me, the first thing I'll do is blow his brains out.
not_available Don't think there's anything you can do to stop it.
not_available There's not.
not_available You understand? 
not_available OK.
not_available I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available Stay by the phone.
not_available All com analysts, clone that call and filter it through all our servers.
not_available Do you have multiple source? 
not_available No, just one feed, low res.
not_available I know the configuration, Edgar.
not_available I need to know if we can multiplex.
not_available We need to pinpoint the source.
not_available I was gonna do that.
not_available This is happening now.
not_available I shouldn't have to walk you through this.
not_available Dammit! 
not_available You don't have to.
not_available I'm setting it up now.
not_available Go to Delta two, Edgar.
not_available It's all there.
not_available I will not let this thing fall apart because of technical incompetence.
not_available All right.
not_available All our visible forces have been pulled away from this street.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Jack.
not_available We've got something.
not_available Building three, west entrance.
not_available Edgar, video feed.
not_available Yes.
not_available OK, we're on our way.
not_available OK, it's them.
not_available I've got a gun on Tony.
not_available My finger's on the trigger.
not_available If I move it, he'll die.
not_available I told you, I moved my men.
not_available She's completely in the open.
not_available She's running a huge risk exposing herself like that.
not_available So far, so good.
not_available She's crossing the street.
not_available When she gets near the car, she can't stay on top of him.
not_available That's our chance.
not_available She's moving towards the black jag.
not_available All teams, hold your position.
not_available Here's the deal.
not_available Once we're in the car and have cleared the area, I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you where you can find Tony.
not_available OK.
not_available All right, move.
not_available Everybody, move.
not_available Bill, not yet! All teams, stand down.
not_available I see your men.
not_available You lied to me, you bitch.
not_available You are not gonna take me alive, got it? No! No! Bill, they're gone.
not_available She blew herself up in the car.
not_available She took Tony with her.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Bill Buchanan requested a conference call.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We were waiting for you to begin.
not_available Bill, we're all here.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'm afraid that Marwan's associate, the woman we hoped would help us locate the missile, has killed herself and one of our agents.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Bill, did she leave behind any physical evidence that could help us? It doesn't appear so.
not_available So, what is CTU gonna do now to find the missile? Mr.
not_available President, at this point, CTU has no reasonable expectation of finding the missile before it reaches its target.
not_available This is it.
not_available It's going to happen.
not_available What do we do? At this point we have no choice but to alert all state and federal agencies and focus all our resources on managing the aftermath.
not_available But we don't even know the missile's target.
not_available I know.
not_available We can assume it will be a major city, but no matter what the target is, there will be widespread panic across this country.
not_available We need to mobilize the army and the National Guard in every state and draw up a declaration of martial law.
not_available Yes, we need to do that.
not_available Bill.
not_available All federal agencies need to prepare for the aftermath of a nuclear attack.
not_available CTU's priority should be disaster management.
not_available Redeploy your people now.
not_available Understood.
not_available Edgar Stiles.
not_available Tell Jack the field operation is over.
not_available Have him bring his people back here immediately.
not_available Got it.
not_available The worst disaster in this country's history has taken place on my watch.
not_available I gave you the responsibility to stop this.
not_available You've failed me, David, and you've failed your country.
not_available I can't even imagine what you must be feeling.
not_available I know part of you is second
not_available guessing your decision but you couldn't place Tony's life before the lives of potentially millions of people.
not_available You made exactly the decision Tony would have wanted you to make.
not_available That's our job.
not_available That's why we sign on.
not_available We decided we were gonna leave this.
not_available Go somewhere and start again.
not_available Michelle.
not_available I wanna get to work and find this missile.
not_available No, no.
not_available I want you to go home.
not_available I'll be OK, Bill.
not_available It's not advice.
not_available It's an order.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Sir, Jack said he's not pulling his men out.
not_available We have orders from the White House.
not_available Yeah, but he says he's not ready.
not_available Put him on the videophone in the situation room.
not_available You lied to me, you bitch.
not_available You are not gonna take me alive, got it? Play it again.
not_available Give me more volume on the phone.
not_available We need to redeploy.
not_available Do it! Jack.
not_available Tony's gone.
not_available I'm sorry, Curtis.
not_available Look, just play it again, please.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, you've got a phone call.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, why haven't you redeployed? 
not_available The operation's over.
not_available Because it doesn't make any sense.
not_available Everything we know about this woman tells us she's a professional, not a fanatic.
not_available We had her cornered.
not_available Her next move was to negotiate for her freedom, not kill herself.
not_available In theory I agree with you, but you saw what I saw.
not_available AII I saw were two darkened figures concealed by an umbrella in an explosion, and I saw that from half a block away.
not_available Jack, you've got to focus now.
not_available Nobody here is holding you responsible for Tony's death.
not_available Let this go.
not_available You're not listening.
not_available AII I want We reviewed the tactical feed.
not_available There's nothing to suggest we were deceived.
not_available Look, I know Tony was your friend, and you probably feel responsible for getting him involved This is not about Tony! This is about her, and until I can absolutely confirm she is dead, I am maintaining this perimeter and I am gonna continue this search.
not_available I'm under orders from the White House.
not_available You have ten minutes, then I want you to move out.
not_available Can you enhance the image from here? 
not_available Not in the field.
not_available Then play it again.
not_available Here's the deal.
not_available I still can't hear properly.
not_available Give me a headset.
not_available ..
not_available I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you where you can find Tony.
not_available I see your men.
not_available You lied to me, you bitch.
not_available You are not gonna take me alive, got it? 
not_available Play back the last 15 seconds.
not_available What are you seeing? It's not what I'm seeing.
not_available Come on, play it back.
not_available I see your men.
not_available You lied to me, you bitch.
not_available It's pouring rain.
not_available You see it bouncing off the car.
not_available You can't hear it on her side of the call.
not_available She was making that call from indoors.
not_available She'd want a position with a clean line of sight to the car.
not_available That would put her in the building the couple exited from.
not_available Get teams ready.
not_available All teams, we're gonna converge on building 11.
not_available Converge on building 11.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Well, they're heading back in.
not_available Looks like my neighbors died for nothing.
not_available They know you're still in here.
not_available Open up the palm of your hand.
not_available Here are the keys.
not_available Take off your cuffs.
not_available Put these on.
not_available We're getting outta here.
not_available OK, now cuff yourself back up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We've got every way in and out covered and men going room by room.
not_available We need to take her alive.
not_available Everyone's aware.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available We found fresh blood outside an apartment.
not_available Where? 
not_available 208.
not_available Stand down until we get there.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Curtis, take the door.
not_available Curtis, she went this way.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Move.
not_available Don't move! Drop the gun.
not_available It's over.
not_available Take one more step and I'll kill him.
not_available Do it, Jack.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Do you really have what it takes to let me kill him while you're looking him in the eye? Yes.
not_available I believe you.
not_available So what's to stop me from shooting him? You can't kill me, can you? You need me.
not_available Tony.
not_available Hostile is down.
not_available I repeat, the hostile is down.
not_available Get a medic down here.
not_available I want her conscious as soon as possible.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Are you OK? Are you OK? Yeah.
not_available Get me that medic now! 
not_available He's on his way.
not_available Does Michelle know I'm alive? No, not yet.
not_available I'll call CTU on my cell so you can talk to her privately.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available Jack, have you redeployed back to CTU? 
not_available No.
not_available We just apprehended the hostile.
not_available What? She's unconscious but she's unharmed.
not_available Tony's OK too.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I'll alert the White House.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Bill, Tony wants to talk to Michelle.
not_available Can you put her on the line? She's not here.
not_available I sent her home.
not_available I'll find her and patch her through.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Michelle, it's Bill.
not_available Tony's alive.
not_available What? 
not_available He wasn't in the car.
not_available He's OK.
not_available I'II let Tony explain to you.
not_available Hold on for him.
not_available Michelle, it's me.
not_available Tony.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It's OK, sweetheart.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She made somebody else wear my clothes.
not_available She needed to keep me alive until she got out.
not_available Jack figured it out.
not_available He was able to save me.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available You don't have to say anything, sweetheart.
not_available I'm coming to CTU right now.
not_available I'll see you in a few minutes.
not_available Michelle.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you, Tony.
not_available Get Palmer patched through.
not_available We'll have to structure a deal.
not_available All right.
not_available She's conscious.
not_available Pick her up.
not_available Call the White House now.
not_available Where is Marwan? That's what I thought.
not_available We're both professionals.
not_available You know that I can force this information outta you, but I'm running outta time.
not_available We never get second chances in our work, but I'll give you one.
not_available I have the power to give you a deal signed by the president that grants you immunity from past and present crimes.
not_available In exchange, you can help me find Marwan and stop this warhead from hitting its target.
not_available Do you understand? You are either gonna help me now, or I will kill you.
not_available Show me the deal.
not_available You were part of the team that mounted the assault on our consulate, an operation that resulted in the death of our consul.
not_available Who lead the mission? Who was responsible? 
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Please, Mr.
not_available Bern, you're wasting time.
not_available Give us a statement and we'll release you.
not_available I'm telling the truth.
not_available You'll have to release me when CTU realizes what's happened to me.
not_available Actually, Mr.
not_available Bern, no one will ever know.
not_available No one will ever tell them.
not_available What are you talking about? The China Queen container ship is moored at the port of San Diego.
not_available If you don't give us our statement, we'll put you on board and you will arrive in 18 days in the port of Guangzhou.
not_available Then we will transport you 2800 miles to the province of Xinjiang where you will be remanded to the maximum security labor camp on the Siberian border.
not_available You wouldn't do that.
not_available Why wouldn't we, Mr.
not_available Bern? We want justice.
not_available If you won't tell us who is ultimately responsible for the situation at the consulate, that leaves you.
not_available Your wife and your two daughters will not be notified.
not_available The US government will not be notified.
not_available Therefore, there will be no chance for prisoner exchange.
not_available There will be positively no chance of escape for the rest of your life.
not_available Decide, Mr.
not_available Bern.
not_available The China Queen is on a tight schedule.
not_available I don't know.
not_available All we want is a name.
not_available A recorded statement naming the person responsible for what happened at the consulate.
not_available Then Then what happens? 
not_available You will walk out of that door.
not_available No.
not_available I meant to him.
not_available As I said, all we want is justice.
not_available His name is Jack Bauer.
