not_available Your wife survived the attack.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I should never have given in.
not_available I should have ordered back the motorcade.
not_available The attack failed.
not_available We have to assume they'll make good their threat to use the Sentox on American soil.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I didn't think I had any choice.
not_available Charles.
not_available You didn't stand up to them.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available Well, you're welcome.
not_available The country's lucky to have men like you.
not_available I'm lucky.
not_available Mrs Logan.
not_available Henderson set up the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.
not_available He left me for dead.
not_available Henderson is our primary link.
not_available You are gonna tell me now how to find the rest of the gas.
not_available Go ahead and do it, Jack.
not_available Get it done.
not_available Shoot me.
not_available Oh, you son of a bitch! 
not_available I shot her above the knee.
not_available She can still walk.
not_available If you make me shoot her again, she'll be in a wheelchair.
not_available Tell him what he wants to know.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm bringing Christopher Henderson into CTU.
not_available I need an interrogation room prepped.
not_available I don't care that you took my wallet.
not_available I just need to get my key card back.
not_available It's of no value to you, itjust lets me in this building.
not_available You told me we were gonna take his cash and a credit card.
not_available That's how I'm getting us all this money.
not_available A $20,000 line of credit right here.
not_available Who's gonna pay you that kind of money? 
not_available I have the key card.
not_available How long will it take you to reprogram it? Five minutes.
not_available Then we will be able to use it to access CTU.
not_available Good.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I'm reprogramming the CTU key card now.
not_available Will it work? I need to change the ID but preserve McGill's executive entry privileges.
not_available It won't be a problem.
not_available Good.
not_available Our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets.
not_available When are you launching the attacks? 
not_available After you're done at CTU.
not_available I'm a few minutes out.
not_available Call me when you're there.
not_available Understood.
not_available We neutralised the attack on the hospital.
not_available Good.
not_available Do we have any idea what the terrorists' next target might be? We're working with state authorities to harden security around the highest
not_available value targets.
not_available In other words, no.
not_available We're just sitting around waiting for Bierko to hit us again.
not_available We do have one promising lead, sir.
not_available Jack Bauer was able to recapture the man who escaped, Christopher Henderson.
not_available Henderson was a defence contractor who brokered the sale of the nerve gas to Bierko.
not_available And this Henderson knows how to find Bierko? We believe so.
not_available He's not cooperating.
not_available Jack's bringing him in for further interrogation.
not_available Keep me posted on any progress.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Mr Buchanan.
not_available Tony Almeida's been asking to see you down in the clinic.
not_available Tell him I'll get to him as soon as I can.
not_available And Ms Raines, Kim Bauer is here.
not_available She's just clearing Security.
not_available Put her in the field ops office, please.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available What's Kim Bauer doing here? 
not_available Jack asked me to call her.
not_available Does she know? Not yet.
not_available Who's with her? 
not_available I don't know, but I'll find out from Security.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Is Burke prepped for the interrogation? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Jack, Kim just arrived at CTU.
not_available What did you say to her? 
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available Good.
not_available I want her to hear it from me.
not_available Jack, it might be easier for her if she knows that you're alive before she sees you.
not_available When I first saw you Itit's just 
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I
not_available I understand.
not_available Look, when you talk to her, explain that I couldn't tell her I was still alive cos I was trying to protect her.
not_available Of course I will.
not_available Audrey, thank you.
not_available Kim's at CTU right now.
not_available You know, after you died, Chase left her.
not_available She hit bottom.
not_available Did you know that? It's only right now she's putting her life back together.
not_available Maybe you did know but couldn't do anything about it.
not_available This doesn't concern you.
not_available I think it concerns me.
not_available Miriam and I were there for Kim when you weren't.
not_available Whatever you may think of me, Miriam and I love that girl.
not_available Are you OK? Both my parents died here.
not_available I swore I'd never come back to this place.
not_available We can leave right now if you want.
not_available Here, she's coming.
not_available Kim.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Barry Landes.
not_available Hi.
not_available Audrey Raines.
not_available So, what it is? What did you have to tell me that was so important? 
not_available It would be better if we talked in private.
not_available You can say it in front of Barry.
not_available Kim, I really think 
not_available No, no.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's about your father.
not_available What about my father? He's alive.
not_available Kim, he wanted to tell you but he couldn't, in order to protect you.
not_available Someone in the government wanted your father dead, so he staged his own death and went underground.
not_available He knew that you wouldn't be safe if he told you that he was alive.
not_available I didn't know either until this morning.
not_available I thought maybe if I told you now before you saw him it might be a little bit easier.
not_available He's on his way in now to CTU.
not_available Hello, Mike.
not_available Mr Vice President.
not_available I thought you were at Salt Lake City today.
not_available Hal cancelled his engagements to be here, Mike.
not_available We need all hands on deck to deal with this situation.
not_available Of course, Mr President.
not_available OK.
not_available So, what's on your mind, Hal? Mr President, when these terrorists attack you're gonna need to maintain order.
not_available And I submit to you the plan you're implementing with CTU is inadequate.
not_available Sir, it was drawn up after careful study for an attack ofjust this magnitude.
not_available CTU is already coordinating with first responders.
not_available Fine, and they should still do so.
not_available But what I'm proposing is something far more sweeping.
not_available I believe it's warranted by the facts.
not_available Andrew.
not_available To begin with, I'm revising all of CTU's casualty estimates.
not_available Based on the assumptions the terrorists will hit all of these targets hospitals, malls, sporting arenas, transit hubs 
not_available my low estimate is 400,000 casualties.
not_available That's a considerable upward revision.
not_available I'd like to know how you reached it.
not_available You're free to talk to my working group.
not_available There are a lot of people who don't take this threat seriously enough.
not_available I assure you we're taking it very seriously.
not_available We have no agenda but to do so.
not_available What's your recommendation? We should think of a pre
not_available emptive declaration of martial law in the greater Los Angeles area.
not_available Mr President, martial law is appropriate only as a last
not_available ditch measure.
not_available Not as a pre
not_available emptive one.
not_available Go on.
not_available Every study we've done has shown it would incite more unrest, not less.
not_available And you'd need approval from Congress.
not_available Which is why we won't call it martial law.
not_available We're putting troops on the street to try to keep people from killing each other.
not_available The panic hasn't happened.
not_available Right now the public isn't even aware of a threat.
not_available You declare martial law, you'll have to tell them.
not_available How long will it take to deploy the troops? 
not_available I'm in touch with the Pentagon.
not_available The National Guard is on stand
not_available by pending your decision.
not_available I agree there's a case to be made, but for God's sake, let's make it to Congress.
not_available We can declare an emergency 
not_available We don't have time.
not_available Hal is right.
not_available This attack could take place any minute.
not_available If CTU can't find this man Bierko, we're gonna get hit.
not_available It would be smart to have control of the streets.
not_available This is a mistake.
not_available You don't wanna do this.
not_available Get out.
not_available I'll get immediate immunity if I talk.
not_available You know it and I know it.
not_available I'm not gonna ask for it.
not_available I'm not trying to protect myself.
not_available I'm trying to protect this country.
not_available What? 
not_available You don't wanna know what I know.
not_available You get me to talk, I promise you you'll just be opening Pandora's box.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Let me judge that for myself.
not_available That's what I thought.
not_available I'll set him up in Holding.
not_available Let me know when he's ready.
not_available Jack.
not_available Key card, please.
not_available Well, all clear, sir.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, I will.
not_available Curtis is on his way back from the hospital.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Audrey.
not_available Did you speak to Kim? What was her reaction? She's a little confused.
not_available She's here with someone.
not_available I think it might be her boyfriend.
not_available His name is Barry Landes.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available She's in the field ops office.
not_available OK, thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available I don't know what you expect me to say.
not_available You don't have to say anything.
not_available Why didn't you just tell me you were alive? I couldn't.
not_available If you knew I was alive you would have been at risk.
not_available I had no choice.
not_available You could have chosen to trust her.
not_available I'll speak with my daughter alone.
not_available That's not a good idea.
not_available I don't care what you think.
not_available I'm sure you don't.
not_available All that matters is you, even if it affects those that love you.
not_available Kim.
not_available Barry, please let me speak to my dad.
not_available I'll be right outside.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don'tjudge him.
not_available He was there when no one else was.
not_available The most painful thing that I've ever been through was having to walk away from you.
not_available Even more painful than losing your mother.
not_available But it was the only way to make sure that you would be safe.
not_available I buried you.
not_available I know.
not_available You know, there's something wrong with people like you.
not_available You can't hold on to anything.
not_available Chase couldn't either.
not_available He tried for a while, then he was gone, just like you.
not_available And now you're back, and I'm just supposed to I'm happy that you're alive.
not_available I am.
not_available But I can't give you what you want right now.
not_available OK.
not_available OK.
not_available I understand that.
not_available I need you to know that I'm sorry and I 
not_available Please, just go.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Burke needs you in Holding.
not_available I'll be there in a minute.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available Barry's got a conference.
not_available We have a plane to catch.
not_available Please, Kim.
not_available I want you to stay just a little longer.
not_available There's some things that I still need to tell you.
not_available Please.
not_available I'll talk to Barry.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available You called for me, Tony? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available That's what I wanted to ask you.
not_available What do you mean? What do you think I mean, Bill? My wife was killed this morning right in front of my eyes.
not_available Nobody here's told me who did it or why.
not_available The investigation's ongoing.
not_available Come on, Bill.
not_available I used to work here.
not_available I know that's what you say to people when you don't wanna tell them the truth.
not_available The truth is you're not an agent any more.
not_available What you're asking me is classified.
not_available Tony, there's nothing you can do.
not_available I know there's nothing I can do! Look at me, for God's sake.
not_available I just wanna know who did it.
not_available For the sake of all the years I've given this place, I think I deserve to know, don't you? All I can tell you is Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas.
not_available Who was behind it? Who's responsible, Bill? The highest we've got is someone you might know from when he worked here.
not_available Christopher Henderson.
not_available W
not_available what? Why? We're working on it, Tony.
not_available Don't let him get away with this, Bill.
not_available Don't you let him cut a deal.
not_available I won't.
not_available What do we know about the man who's with Kim? He's registered with the state as a clinical psychologist.
not_available She was his patient.
not_available I think so, yes.
not_available He's ready.
not_available Whatever he's not telling us is important.
not_available He knows what's coming and he's willing to tolerate an inhuman amount of pain.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Dammit, Christopher.
not_available I don't think you became a part of this because of self
not_available interest.
not_available I believe you think what you're doing now is the best thing for this country, but it is not your choice to make.
not_available That's good.
not_available Disarm your subject's resolve by showing empathy and respect for his agenda.
not_available This is not ajoke.
not_available Thousands of lives are at stake.
not_available People that we promised to protect, to make feel safe.
not_available There is enough time for you to tell me what I need to know to stop this insanity.
not_available Please.
not_available I'm sorry, Jack.
not_available I really am, but I can't tell you what you wanna know.
not_available Start it.
not_available Mrs Logan.
not_available Mrs Logan, if I could have a minute? 
not_available If this is about Aaron it doesn't concern you.
not_available No, Mrs Logan, it doesn't, and I'm not here to discuss it.
not_available Then what is it? 
not_available The country's facing a crisis.
not_available The president needs you.
not_available He he needs me? If you think the decision to let the attack on the motorcade proceed was easy for him, you're wrong.
not_available I was with him when he got down on his knees and prayed.
not_available He did? 
not_available He loves you.
not_available He didn't wanna lose you.
not_available But with the the lives of so many people in jeopardy, he felt he had no choice.
not_available We've known each other a long time.
not_available Stop talking about what a positive influence I am and tell me precisely what it is you're trying to get me to do.
not_available Vice President Gardner is advising your husband declare martial law in Los Angeles in preparation for the release of the nerve gas.
not_available He wants to do it without Congressional sanction or a timetable to lift it.
not_available He can'tjust rewrite the law.
not_available Hal's got an agenda.
not_available Well, he's wrong.
not_available This'll make things far worse.
not_available Mrs Logan, all I know is the president is listening to Hal Gardner, and it will only help the country to have him listening to you as well.
not_available Hold off on deploying units seven to twelve until we finalise our scenarios.
not_available What is it? I noticed that one of the environmental systems put out a trouble flag.
not_available It's probably a circuit board change.
not_available I logged on to the manifest and there's nothing scheduled.
not_available Carrie, I'm in the middle of coordinating the first responders.
not_available I don't have time for this.
not_available You don't have to snap at me.
not_available I thought someone should check it out.
not_available Then check it out.
not_available Carrie! Can you forgive me? You acted like the President of the United States.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available But you wanted me to be your husband first.
not_available I can't pretend that I didn't.
not_available I still love you as much as I always did.
not_available Marty 
not_available Shh.
not_available Shh.
not_available There'll be plenty of time for us later.
not_available You have to get back to work.
not_available The country needs you more than I do.
not_available Hello? Anybody working on the system? Chloe.
not_available Hi, Kim.
not_available You're still here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My father had to do something.
not_available Do you know how long he'll be? 
not_available No.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Chloe I'm kinda busy right now.
not_available You knew my father was alive, didn't you? For a yearanda
not_available half you've known.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He trusted you.
not_available Because he had to.
not_available I helped stage his death.
not_available You don't have to make excuses.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Four people knew he was alive.
not_available Two are dead, President Palmer and Michelle Dessler.
not_available Tony Almeida's in serious condition.
not_available Michelle's dead? I'm only alive because your dad found me in time.
not_available I know this is hard for you and it's none of my business, but you should cut him some slack.
not_available What's going on, Bill? Lynn What is it? We just got a call from LAPD.
not_available They found your sister's body in her apartment.
not_available She'd been shot.
not_available What? I
not_available I just talked to her.
not_available I saw her today.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available She can't I'm sorry, Lynn.
not_available The police ID'd her body.
not_available My God.
not_available If you need a phone to make some personal calls or talk to the police Her boyfriend did this to her.
not_available Tell me he's in custody.
not_available Is his name Dwayne Thompkins? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He didn't do it.
not_available They found his body too.
not_available Lynn, the police are trying to make sense of something.
not_available Do you know if either your sister or her boyfriend were involved in dealing drugs or had ties to organised crime? She was a pretty serious user.
not_available But organised crime? No way.
not_available Why? The killings were clearly the work of a professional.
not_available My God.
not_available Who's investigating? I have to talk to 'em.
not_available I can arrange a meeting.
not_available No.
not_available They have to search the apartment, see if my key card was there.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available My CTU key card.
not_available She has it.
not_available What was she doing with your key card? 
not_available It was stolen from me.
not_available Her boyfriend took it.
not_available Why didn't you report this? 
not_available I am now.
not_available We don't have time to argue.
not_available Call and see if anyone used it to breach Security.
not_available It was taken about four hours ago.
not_available Chloe, I'm in Holding with Lynn.
not_available I need you to check the gate logs now.
not_available What am I looking for? 
not_available If anyone used Lynn's key card to enter CTU.
not_available Isn't Lynn standing right next to you? 
not_available Chloe, do it! It's showing that his card was used less than an hour ago at the executive entrance.
not_available He was already here.
not_available 
not_available Lock down CTU now.
not_available This is Chloe O'Brian.
not_available Initiate a lockdown now.
not_available Mr Bauer, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't know what's going on.
not_available He should be talking by now.
not_available Dammit, Christopher.
not_available I don't wanna do this.
not_available Just talk to me.
not_available Can't.
not_available I need to stabilise him in the clinic before administering another dose.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available We've been compromised.
not_available Someone used a stolen key card to access CTU.
not_available Did you get an ID? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available They're still here.
not_available We're in lockdown.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Get him to Medical.
not_available Stabilise him.
not_available Don't let anyone near him.
not_available Did you get him? 
not_available Still working on it.
not_available Exits are sealed.
not_available Security are going room to room.
not_available Give me a comm unit.
not_available Is Kim still up in field ops? 
not_available With Landes, yes.
not_available Get her here.
not_available I want a guard on her.
not_available I found the hostile.
not_available He's in third west.
not_available Could exit south or north.
not_available Jack, take north.
not_available Mack's team will head south.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Pull up north and south angles.
not_available There he is.
not_available Run his face through recognition software.
not_available Where's Carrie? I need her to check for intrusions.
not_available She's checking on a warning signal on a B socket.
not_available Got it.
not_available Checking the grid.
not_available You're gonna help me get outta here.
not_available He's in the north corridor.
not_available I wanna see what's keeping Carrie.
not_available All units, the hostile's in the north corridor.
not_available He's got one of our men.
not_available Enter your pass code.
not_available But it's a lockdown.
not_available Just do it.
not_available He's in the north hallway, sublevel B.
not_available Jack, do you read? 
not_available On my way.
not_available Bill, he's in the stairwell.
not_available I don't think so, Jack.
not_available Davis said he checked sublevel B.
not_available Bill.
not_available It's all clear.
not_available No, he's doubled back.
not_available He's using the stairs to get to the roof.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available I'm sending units to the landings.
not_available Let me know when you're ready to move.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Freeze! Let me see your hands.
not_available Slowly.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Now! Hostile's down.
not_available He's dead.
not_available It was the only shot I had.
not_available Do you have an ID, Jack? We got a bigger problem than that.
not_available He's got a device on him.
not_available Looks like a relay switch.
not_available He's got a PDA.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What is it, Jack? A schematic of CTU's ventilation system.
not_available I think he tried to deploy nerve gas.
not_available Order an evacuation.
not_available Code six! Everybody out! Go! Go! 
not_available I have Kim with me.
not_available Stay with her.
not_available Make sure Burke gets Henderson outta here as fast as he can.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Don't move.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Chloe, what's going on? 
not_available Edgar, get out of the building now.
not_available Carrie.
not_available We have to get out of the building now.
not_available Just hurry.
not_available What's wrong with those people? Oh, my God.
not_available The gas is coming in.
not_available The ducts run from the outside in.
not_available Outside in? What does that mean? 
not_available They reach the building core last.
not_available Lock the outer doors.
not_available Which rooms can we seal? I'm working on it! 
not_available Burke, I need you to stand by.
not_available I'll let you know where you can move Henderson.
not_available Chloe, what rooms can you lock down? 
not_available Hold on! The situation room, the upper offices and clinic isolation.
not_available Go, people! 
not_available Kim, everybody, in the situation room.
not_available Now.
not_available Burke, you can move Henderson to the clinic isolation.
not_available Seal it off for bio
not_available air.
not_available Get into the situation room now.
not_available Move! Chloe, seal it.
not_available Seal all the rooms.
not_available Open the door! You have to let me in! Open the door.
not_available Let her in.
not_available We can't break the seal.
not_available Find another exit.
not_available Hurry! Go! Chloe, are the rest of the rooms sealed? 
not_available Yes, it's done.
not_available Everybody, stay calm.
not_available There's nothing we can do for her now.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Chloe.
