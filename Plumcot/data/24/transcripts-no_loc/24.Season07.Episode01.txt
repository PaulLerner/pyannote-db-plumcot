not_available The following takes place between 8:00 a.m.
not_available And 9:00 a.m.
not_available Events occur in real time.
not_available Put the phone away.
not_available Uh, one more minute.
not_available That's what you said five minutes ago.
not_available Put it away.
not_available Dad.
not_available I got you the phone for emergencies, honey.
not_available Well, this is an emergency.
not_available Fine.
not_available Now how come you get to talk on the phone? That's not fair.
not_available Uh, life's not fair.
not_available Hello? Hello? Who is this? 
not_available Emily? Oh! Are you okay? 
not_available Don't move! 
not_available Take it! Everybody down! 
not_available Dad.
not_available Dad! What's going on? 
not_available Dad! Dad! Emily! Dad! Dad! Dad! Emily! Emily! Emily! Go! Get in there! Let's go! Dad! 
not_available Let's go! 
not_available Please don't hurt my daughter.
not_available I've got money.
not_available We don't want your money, Mr.
not_available Latham.
not_available We just need you to fix something for us.
not_available Let the record show this is the third day of this Senate hearing investigating human rights violations by the recently disbanded Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available Yesterday, when we adjourned, we were discussing brutality and torture by C.T.U.
not_available Agents in the course of their operations.
not_available Will the witness please state his name? Jack Bauer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I don't see your counsel present.
not_available Is he or she not aware that we're about to start? I have chosen not to retain counsel.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I have to advise you that many of the questions we're about to pose to you are of a legal nature and might result in answers that could incriminate you.
not_available I understand that, Senator.
not_available We can postpone your testimony until this afternoon if you'd like to bring in representation something that I would strongly advise.
not_available What is the first question, Senator? All right then.
not_available Let's begin.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer who is Ibrahim Haddad? That information is classified.
not_available We represent the people of the United States and we have declassified those files on their behalf.
not_available Now, I'm going to ask you one more time
not_available Who is Ibrahim Haddad? He was a member of a terrorist sleeper cell C.T.U.
not_available Had under surveillance in 2002.
not_available And isn't it true that you detained Mr.
not_available Haddad without due process and that you used extreme interrogation methods on him until he answered your questions? Yes, sir.
not_available Would you say that you broke procedure with this interrogation? 
not_available Probably.
not_available "Probably." Well, that's a very cavalier answer.
not_available You don't seem to care about the implications here.
not_available Well, Mr.
not_available Bauer? I'm sorry, Senator.
not_available I didn't hear a question.
not_available All right then.
not_available Did you torture Mr.
not_available Haddad? According to the definition set forth by the Geneva Convention yes, I did.
not_available Senator, why don't I save you some time? It's obvious that your agenda is to discredit C.T.
not_available U and generate a series of indictments
not_available My only agenda is to get to the truth.
not_available I don't think it is, sir.
not_available Excuse me? Ibrahim Haddad had targeted a bus carrying 45 people The truth, Senator, is I stopped that attack from happening.
not_available By torturing Mr.
not_available Haddad.
not_available By doing what I deemed necessary to protect innocent lives.
not_available So basically what you're saying, Mr.
not_available Bauer is that the ends justify the means and that you are above the law.
not_available When I am activated, when I am brought into a situation, there is a reason and that reason is to complete the objectives of my mission at all costs.
not_available Even if it means breaking the law.
not_available For a combat soldier, the difference between success and failure is your ability to adapt to your enemy.
not_available The people that I deal with, they don't care about your rules.
not_available All they care about is a result.
not_available My job is to stop them from accomplishing their objectives.
not_available I simply adapted.
not_available In answer to your question, am I above the law? No, sir.
not_available I am more than willing to be judged by the people you claim to represent.
not_available I will let them decide what price I should pay.
not_available But please do not sit there with that smug look on your face and expect me to regret the decisions that I have made because, sir, the truth is, I don't.
not_available Excuse me, Senator.
not_available Agent Walker is here.
not_available Sorry for interrupting, Senator.
not_available I'm Renee Walker with the F.B.I.
not_available We have a subpoena forJack Bauer.
not_available I need him remanded into my custody immediately.
not_available I'm not surprised that anyone has a subpoena for Mr.
not_available Bauer but you're gonna have to wait your turn.
not_available He's being questioned by the United States Senate.
not_available Sir, we need Mr.
not_available Bauer immediately.
not_available Well, apparently we're going to have to let you go for now.
not_available But we're not done with you.
not_available We'll reconvene with you tomorrow morning at the same time.
not_available Is that understood? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Then you go along with these agents.
not_available Well, let's proceed.
not_available Bailiff, call the next witness.
not_available What's this about? Mr.
not_available Bauer, I'm Special Agent Walker.
not_available This is Agent Teller.
not_available I need you to come to our office.
not_available It's just down the block.
not_available Why? 
not_available You'll be briefed when we get there.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Janis, it's me.
not_available Where's Larry? 
not_available He's briefing Dornan's group.
not_available Tell him I've got Bauer.
not_available We're leaving the hearing now.
not_available That's good, 'cause the situation's heating up.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available That crew we've been tracking? They just grabbed a man named Michael Latham.
not_available Latham.
not_available He worked on Homeland's firewall project.
not_available He didn't just work on it.
not_available He designed it.
not_available He's the chief engineer of the government's infrastructure security system.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be there soon.
not_available Did you get Bauer cleared through security yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Well, Renee's bringing him in.
not_available They're only a couple minutes out.
not_available Then you won't need him cleared for a couple of minutes.
not_available Sean, as a friend, I'd like to give you
not_available You're not my friend.
not_available Sure.
not_available As someone as close to a friend as you are ever going to get, let me give you some advice.
not_available Most people don't like sarcasm.
not_available I myself have no problem with it 'cause I'm cheerful.
not_available I'm a cheerful person.
not_available You're a cheerful person? Just get Bauer cleared.
not_available For the past eight weeks this office has been investigating a series of technology thefts
not_available software, custom gate array chips, neural networks.
not_available Forensics concluded that the break
not_available ins were the work of the same crew but we didn't know what their endgame was until now.
not_available This is Michael Latham.
not_available He's chief engineer on the classified infrastructure portal
not_available Homeland's firewall project.
not_available He was abducted 10 minutes ago by the same group behind the technology thefts.
not_available You think they're using Latham to get through the C.I.P.
not_available Firewall? That's our concern.
not_available The hardware they stole could be used to build a device to do just that.
not_available And Latham is one of the few people that could do it.
not_available We assume he's being forced to work on the device or that he's already dead.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Renee's on her way in with Jack Bauer.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We've tasked your people to help with this investigation.
not_available See Sean.
not_available He's got the packets.
not_available We're on it.
not_available We're online with G.S.A.
not_available 117.
not_available How many systems? 
not_available Communications.
not_available Navigation.
not_available But we need the other systems working.
not_available Check on Latham.
not_available All right.
not_available It's done.
not_available Northeast Three, this is Global Skies 117.
not_available We are ready for clearance.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, roger.
not_available You're clear toJ.F.K.
not_available Airport as filed.
not_available Maintain 5,000.
not_available Expect flight level 280 Cleared toJ.F.K.
not_available Expect flight level 280.
not_available [P.A.
not_available System Beeps.]
not_available Welcome to Global Skies flight number 117
not_available passenger service from Reagan National toJ.F.K.
not_available Weather in New York is cloudy with a chance of thundershowers so we may run into some turbulence along the way.
not_available Tower, awaiting traffic off of Dulles.
not_available Position hold, G.S.A.
not_available 117.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, that's correct.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, I'm Agent Larry Moss.
not_available I'm the head of this office.
not_available You're here because Agent Walker thinks you might be able to help us with an investigation.
not_available Now, personally I have my doubts but I'll be happy to be proven wrong.
not_available Lucky for me I'm not here to apply for a job, Agent Moss.
not_available Personally, I don't care what makes you happy, so let's just get this over with.
not_available Take him to Renee's office.
not_available You want me in the room with you? 
not_available No.
not_available Renee, you've read his file.
not_available Bauer's the kind of guy
not_available you say the wrong thing, he can go off.
not_available I'll be fine, Larry.
not_available If he goes off, I'll call you.
not_available Yeah, but if he doesn't produce, don't waste our time.
not_available Throw him back.
not_available What do you want? Mr.
not_available Bauer, we have a national security matter that has gone critical.
not_available I'm hoping you can help us with it.
not_available Please sit down.
not_available I sent the differentials to Homeland.
not_available Was there anything else you needed me to do? No.
not_available Has Bauer been indicted yet? 
not_available No, but he will be after the Senate hearings.
not_available The C.I.P.
not_available Firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country.
not_available If it were breached, telecommunication, transportation, power grids
not_available they would all be vulnerable.
not_available Agent Walker, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm not active.
not_available The D.O.J.
not_available Is about to file criminal charges against me.
not_available I'm not exactly in a position to help you with your situation.
not_available As much as I understand how dire it is
not_available No, I don't think you do.
not_available One of the men behind this threat is someone you know.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available Tony Almeida's dead.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available I was there when he died.
not_available He was rushed away by the E.M.T.
not_available A minute later.
not_available You never saw him after that.
not_available And hours later you were abducted by the Chinese government.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available LfTony were still alive, I would know.
not_available He would have contacted me.
not_available We recovered this image from a security camera where one of the technology thefts took place.
not_available It's time
not_available stamped and dated.
not_available Images can be manipulated.
not_available Not this one.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available I had Almeida's grave exhumed.
not_available D.N.A.
not_available Test confirmed that it was not his body that was buried.
not_available The evidence is right here.
not_available If you wanna leave without looking at it, go ahead.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117 on the roll.
not_available Masters.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available We in their system? 
not_available Yes.
not_available G.S.A.
not_available 117, switching to departure 126.8.
not_available Have a good day.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available The C.I.P.
not_available Module
not_available it stopped working.
not_available What do you mean, it stopped? It keeps going out of phase.
not_available I thought Latham said it was good to go.
not_available Well, it's not.
not_available All right.
not_available Let me have it.
not_available So what'd you do? I didn't do anything.
not_available I swear.
not_available Then why isn't it working? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Fix it.
not_available Now.
not_available You're gonna want to move faster than that.
not_available See, 'cause if you can't make this work in the next few minutes I won't need you anymore.
not_available You understand what that means? Good.
not_available Now fix it.
not_available Officials say that an estimated have been killed as part of General Benjamin Juma's campaign of ethnic cleansing.
not_available Survivors in the African nation of Sangala believe American intervention is necessary to prevent further bloodshed.
not_available The White House has made no public statements.
not_available [TVTurns Off Juma's perpetrating the worst mass murder Africa has seen since Rwanda.
not_available But if you read the columns
not_available I do.
not_available Half of them are against our taking action.
not_available But if we don't, six months from now those same members of the press will be accusing us of moral bankruptcy.
not_available We can always revisit the U.N.
not_available Option.
not_available The U.N.
not_available Paralyzed, Ethan, while people are being butchered by that madman.
not_available We have to lead, even if it means going it alone.
not_available I'm not gonna have hundreds of thousands of lives on my conscience.
not_available General Juma has to be stopped.
not_available He will be, Madam President, soon as you give the order.
not_available Are theJoint Chiefs here yet? 
not_available They're gathering in the Situation Room.
not_available They'll call as soon as they're ready for you.
not_available I just heard Kevin Aldridge is doing a piece for CNB.
not_available He's still pressing his case against sending our troops in.
not_available As if getting through this day won't be hard enough.
not_available If you want, I can try to get him to hold off.
not_available He's in the press room.
not_available I'm not sure that's a good idea, Henry.
not_available This is the last thing you need right now, especially with public opinion so split.
not_available Yes? If you think you can talk Aldridge down, do it.
not_available Madam President, Joint Chiefs are ready.
not_available Here's your briefing package.
not_available Wish me luck.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Is this everything? 
not_available It's all there.
not_available I don't mean to sound like a broken record but I'm not sure your husband is up to handling Aldridge.
not_available Henry's fine.
not_available He's better, I realize that, but
not_available It's going to take more than a few months.
not_available He lost a son.
not_available So did you.
not_available And you haven't let your loss interfere with yourjob.
not_available Your husband's a strong man but he doesn't have your resilience.
not_available It's not a matter of resilience, Ethan.
not_available There's not a day that goes by, not a moment when I don't think about my son.
not_available But I'm about to take this nation to war and grief is a luxury I can't afford right now.
not_available Stand.
not_available Before we begin, let me thank each of you for the time and work you've put into this operation.
not_available Putting American lives at risk is the hardest decision I've ever had to make but it is one that has to be made.
not_available What was that? 
not_available It's working.
not_available What was wrong? 
not_available It was overheating.
not_available I came up with a work
not_available around.
not_available Try it now.
not_available There.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's transmitting again.
not_available We can send and receive.
not_available A.A.
not_available 123, maintain course.
not_available Whoa.
not_available What was that? 
not_available I just got it too.
not_available Did you guys lose sync? Yeah, I did, but we're back up now.
not_available Anybody else lose sync? 
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available What's goin' on? This is gonna sound crazy, but the three of us just got bumped for a second.
not_available But the log file doesn't show a power surge.
not_available This came from the system kernel.
not_available What are you talkin' about? The kernel's protected.
not_available Let me have a look.
not_available All we know for sure is Almeida is part of a homegrown terrorist group that's targeting our infrastructure.
not_available He could be working undercover
not_available some kind of sting operation.
not_available You need to check every federal agency.
not_available We have.
not_available State and city too.
not_available Almeida's not working for any of them.
not_available Then there must be some other explanation.
not_available Yeah, there is.
not_available His wife was brutally murdered by a faction operating inside the government led by the president himself.
not_available Everybody involved in that is either in prison or has been killed.
not_available The government gave President Logan a slap on the wrist.
not_available They cut him a deal.
not_available Sentencing him to house arrest on a hundred
not_available acre ranch? You think Tony's looking for justice by attacking this country? Almeida lost everything he had and he's blaming it on the government he spent his life serving.
not_available But you'd know better than me how that feels how far a man might go.
not_available Not that far.
not_available And not Tony Almeida.
not_available There's a logical explanation for this.
not_available It's just something you're not seeing.
not_available Help me find Almeida, and you can ask him yourself.
not_available You know how he thinks.
not_available You had the same training, you know the same people.
not_available I need complete access to all of your source material.
not_available Everything you've got on this.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Renee, come out here.
not_available Something just came in.
not_available Be right there.
not_available Everything we have on Almeida's crew is in this directory.
not_available Start here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Northeast Air Traffic Control just called.
not_available They reported a possible intrusion into their communication systems.
not_available It's just happened.
not_available Can they source them? They're trying, but so far, nothing.
not_available Why do we think this has to do with Almeida's crew? I don't think you get intrusions like this unless someone's driving it and the only way to drive it is through the C.I.P.
not_available Firewall.
not_available So they're going after air traffic control.
not_available That's what it looks like.
not_available Put me through to the White House.
not_available Doing a turn
not_available around in New York? Nope.
not_available Got two days off.
not_available I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city.
not_available Oh, that'll be fun.
not_available Doug said we were gonna hit some weather.
not_available I'm gonna need tech support to cross
not_available reference your files.
not_available You'll be working with one of my analysts, Sean Hillinger.
not_available He can get you whatever files you need to help us find Almeida.
not_available Good.
not_available They raise the threat level yet? Yeah.
not_available We think Almeida's group got into air traffic control.
not_available What? That doesn't make sense.
not_available I don't need you to figure it out, Jack.
not_available Just help me find him.
not_available Sean, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available He's gonna be working with the Almeida files.
not_available Give him whatever he needs.
not_available What about interfacing with F.A.A.
not_available Janis is working with some of Dornan's people on that.
not_available You just helpJack.
not_available Right.
not_available I'll check in.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What do you wanna see? Let's start with the technology thefts.
not_available How many were there? 
not_available Six.
not_available Let's run a comp on all of them.
not_available Fantastic.
not_available The expeditionary strike force and its carrier air wing are now on scene.
not_available This gives us full spectrum dominance of the battle space.
not_available What kind of resistance are you anticipating from Juma's military? Minimal.
not_available Our air strikes'll take out whatever defenses they've got.
not_available We can expect an open path toJuma's front door.
not_available Good.
not_available All we need to launch is a go order from you.
not_available You'll get a green light as soon as I've gone over Secretary Stevens' post
not_available invasion report which I'm still waiting for.
not_available I'll have it for you in a few minutes, ma'am.
not_available Unless there's a problem you'd like to discuss.
not_available Madam President, my objection to this operation isn't a secret to anyone in this room.
not_available For us to be wading into the middle of another civil conflict halfway around the world
not_available We're done debating this, Joe.
not_available The U.N.
not_available Been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions while Benjamin Juma has slaughtered over 200,000 of his own people.
not_available That number will continue to grow if we don't stop him now.
not_available And if you can't get behind what we're doing, I'll find a secretary of state who can.
not_available But I am done with your hand
not_available wringing.
not_available Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available Tim Woods from Homeland Security is outside.
not_available He needs to see you on another matter.
not_available Can't it wait? 
not_available No, ma'am, it can't.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll continue when I return.
not_available And, Joe, I want that report in front of me when I get back.
not_available What is it? I don't have the details, but it involves a potential domestic breach.
not_available Tim is here to fill us in.
not_available Madam President.
not_available Tim, make this brief.
not_available TheJoint Chiefs are waiting.
not_available We've been working with the F.B.I.
not_available The last eight weeks investigating a series of technology thefts.
not_available We didn't understand the implications of this until today.
not_available The same people behind these thefts abducted a man named Michael Latham.
not_available He's one of the chief engineers in charge of protecting critical infrastructure.
not_available Tell me what we're dealing with.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Thinks these same people have forced Latham to create a device to hack through the C.I.P.
not_available Firewall.
not_available The firewall protects all national systems
not_available energy, utilities, transportation.
not_available I'm here because the F.A.A.
not_available Reported some irregularities in their air traffic control system.
not_available Are you saying commercial flights are in danger? Possibly.
not_available Do I need to give the order to ground air traffic? I'm afraid it's not that simple.
not_available Right now, there are more than 3,000 flights over the continental United States.
not_available To ground them all would take 12 hours, minimum, and it could create a panic.
not_available Then what do you recommend? Let us quietly decrease air traffic while the Bureau works their leads.
not_available We'll make sure you're briefed on a real
not_available time basis.
not_available I don't like the timing of this.
not_available Timing? Could this be connected to our intervention in Sangala? The F.B.I.
not_available Hasn't found any connection.
not_available All evidence suggests that we're dealing with a domestic terror group
not_available homegrown, strong antigovernment bias.
not_available And these leads you mentioned
not_available Do you think you'll be able to catch these people before they do any real damage? The Bureau's got everyone on it, ma'am.
not_available You didn't answer my question.
not_available No, ma'am, I didn't.
not_available Of course I don't condone whatJuma's doing over there.
not_available But tribal wars are being fought all over the world.
not_available Why not intervene in Thailand, Malaysia? This isn't a tribal war, Kevin.
not_available It's a genocide.
not_available Ending it is the moral obligation of a nation as powerful as ours.
not_available That's a lofty aspiration but the reality is a lot more complex.
not_available The president's going into this with both eyes open.
not_available How can she be sure the cycle of violence won't continue afterJuma's been taken out? Could be stuck there indefinitely, keeping the peace.
not_available If I gave you an exclusive preview of the president's post
not_available invasion plans you might change your mind.
not_available You're trying to bribe me with an exclusive? I'm trying to get you to give us some rope.
not_available What are you asking me to do, stop writing or write what I don't believe? Either one would be fine with me.
not_available Sir, you have a phone call on your private line.
not_available Could you excuse me for a moment, please, Kevin? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available It's Chuck Toland, sir.
not_available Wait.
not_available Chuck.
not_available Did you find something? I did.
not_available But don't get carried away.
not_available It doesn't confirm your theory about how Roger died, but it is suspicious.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available His girlfriend, Samantha, received a large lump
not_available sum deposit in an offshore bank account about three days after Roger's suicide.
not_available You mean, his alleged suicide.
not_available Right, sir.
not_available Where did the money come from? I couldn't tell.
not_available Looks like it's been washed.
not_available There was no readily identifiable source.
not_available So what does this mean? All it means is that she suddenly came into $400,000.
not_available Now, I'm gonna find out anything more, I'm gonna need to talk to her personally.
not_available Is that how you want me to handle it? 
not_available No.
not_available If she's got anything to hide, she's not going to talk to a private investigator.
not_available I agree.
not_available So how do you want me to proceed? I'll talk to her myself.
not_available Is she still at that brokerage firm? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh, Sloan Kittredge.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm gonna finish up here with Aldridge.
not_available Then I need you to take me somewhere.
not_available And keep it off the manifest.
not_available I don't want anyone to know where we're going.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Agent Gedge.
not_available Yes, sir? You think Chuck's taking advantage of me, don't you? 
not_available It's not my place to say that, sir.
not_available I'm asking you anyway.
not_available Sir, the police and F.B.I.
not_available Have both investigated your son's death.
not_available And, yes, I believe this P.
not_available I could be exploiting your grief for personal gain.
not_available These so
not_available called leads that he's generating have led nowhere.
not_available My son didn't kill himself.
not_available I'm sure of it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Can you check that socket again, please? Has F.A.A.
not_available Reported any more anomalies? Not since the first three.
not_available Maybe it was just a glitch? It could've been a ripple caused when they broke through the firewall and entered the system.
not_available Well, if they're in the system, I can't see them, and I've checked every E.L.R.
not_available Socket.
not_available Okay.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Renee.
not_available Uh, what's gonna happen? 
not_available What do you mean? If Almeida's broken through the firewall, then we're screwed, right? I mean, crashing a couple planes is really nothing compared to contaminating the water system or bringing down the power grid.
not_available Don't think about it, Janis.
not_available Just stay on task.
not_available Okay.
not_available So I will just stay calm.
not_available Right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Pull up the second one.
not_available You already looked at it.
not_available I wanna look at it again.
not_available Pull it up.
not_available Have you found anything? No.
not_available We keep looking at the same six forensic reports over and over.
not_available What are you looking for, Jack? 
not_available An entry point.
not_available They had access cards.
not_available Yeah, but no one reported their access cards stolen 
not_available which means they were forged.
not_available So
not_available These access cards have individual signatures, making them almost impossible to forge.
not_available There's only a couple guys who can do it.
not_available Can you access old C.T.U.
not_available Files? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Pull up August 1999.
not_available Code name: Hatteras.
not_available Just got a call from Homeland.
not_available And? They briefed the president, and she's not ready to ground planes yet.
not_available There you go.
not_available Hatteras file.
not_available You could hire a $14an
not_available hour data applications geek to do this.
not_available You don't need me.
not_available I wouldn't advertise that.
not_available There he is.
not_available Gabriel Schector.
not_available Who is he? 
not_available He was a supplier.
not_available Tony and I used him to buy things off
not_available book.
not_available See if he's in your database.
not_available Yeah, he's there.
not_available Is he still in Los Angeles? 
not_available No.
not_available According to this earmark, he came to D.C.
not_available Nine weeks ago.
not_available The thefts started a week after that.
not_available That's your guy.
not_available You have an address? Subletting an office downtown.
not_available Put a field team together, pick him up.
not_available I'll callJudge Simons, have a warrant ready.
not_available That's a mistake.
not_available Why? You don't have time to go through the motions with Schector.
not_available You serve him with a warrant, he'll call his lawyers.
not_available He'll stall as long as he needs.
not_available So what's the alternative, Jack? Break in and torture the guy like you used to do? Isn't that how you ended up in front of a Senate subcommittee? Oh, is this how it starts? You get in my face, tighten your jaw then if I say somethin' you don't like, you slam me against the wall? You have no idea what I do.
not_available And the last time I checked, you subpoenaed me.
not_available You want my help, you want my advice, take it.
not_available You don't, don't.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, you said you used to work with this man, Schector.
not_available How well does he know you? He knows me.
not_available Larry, can I talk to you for a second? I wanna take Bauer with me.
not_available No.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I'm not lettin' him put his hands on a suspect.
not_available He won't need to put his hands on anybody.
not_available My guess is if he's in the room, Schector will talk.
not_available You saw what he just did.
not_available I'm trying to find Almeida before it's too late, and Schector is our best lead.
not_available So you want to intimidate him with Bauer? Schector knows how far Bauer might go.
not_available Let's use that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And if Schector doesn't blink, then what? I'll keep Bauer on a short leash.
not_available Renee, we're the F.B.I., not C.T.U.
not_available We honor the law even when it's not convenient.
not_available The situation is heating up fast, Larry.
not_available The president's into it now, and she's expecting results.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available It's your call.
not_available But I promise you, I can handle Bauer.
not_available All right.
not_available But I'm holding you responsible.
not_available And I'm sending backup teams.
not_available Okay.
not_available Jack, you're coming with me, and you're doing this my way.
not_available Tell me about Schector.
not_available He used to work for a defense contractor out of San Diego till he went on his own.
not_available Legitimate? 
not_available Yeah, at first.
not_available Then he got greedy, started using his connections to acquire technology, sell it on the gray market.
not_available And who'd he sell to, terrorists? 
not_available No.
not_available Usually foreign governments trying to get around treaties.
not_available And how did you and Tony get involved with him? 
not_available We arrested him, turned him.
not_available He was a great conduit for intel.
not_available C.T.U.
not_available Didn't mind that you were letting this guy stay in business? C.T.U.
not_available Didn't know.
not_available It was just Tony and me.
not_available So you and Tony were tight? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, we were close.
not_available All right.
not_available So it sounds like Tony, who everyone thinks is dead puts together a plan to hijack American security.
not_available He contacts Schector to help him with his plan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Except you don't believe it, that Tony's dirty.
not_available I believe that Tony's alive and I believe he's doing something dangerous and that we need to find him.
not_available We confirmed Schector's inside.
not_available How do you want to handle this? 
not_available I'm going in with Bauer.
not_available Alone? I want Schector to talk.
not_available I don't want to spook him.
not_available Call me when backup gets here.
not_available Matobo's fighters are hidden outside of the capital in three camps
not_available Alpha, Beta and Delta.
not_available Our ground forces will join up with them once the air strikes are completed.
not_available Make sure General Wagner understands our priority is to maintain order in the streets.
not_available The people need to see that their country is being governed under the rule oflaw.
not_available What happens when Matobo's men execute GeneralJuma without a trial? Should we intervene or let the mob tear him apart? I'm meeting with Mr.
not_available Matobo in a few minutes.
not_available I'll make sure he keeps his men in line.
not_available And, Joe, I was wrong to dress you down in front of theJoint Chiefs.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No need to apologize, Madam President.
not_available You're under a lot of pressure.
not_available That's still no excuse.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available I appreciate that.
not_available The fact remains if you can't get behind this operation with both shoulders, I will need your resignation.
not_available That won't be necessary, ma'am.
not_available Whatever doubts I have, I'll keep them to myself.
not_available Good.
not_available Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available What is it, Ethan? I thought you'd want to know.
not_available Henry Aldridge has agreed to delay his broadcast for 24 hours.
not_available Henry's doing? 
not_available I, uh, underestimated him.
not_available Letting him intervene was the right call.
not_available Well, that's some good news.
not_available What about the firewall situation? Has the F.B.I.
not_available Made any progress? They've identified a man who may have information.
not_available They're about to question him.
not_available It's more than likely Schector's not gonna give you this information easily.
not_available Just remember, this is an F.B.I.
not_available Operation.
not_available We work within the confines of the law.
not_available You can threaten him, but do not lay a hand on him.
not_available The minute I see you crossing that line, I will pull you back.
not_available Understood? Understood.
not_available Agent Walker, F.B.I.
not_available I'm here to talk to Gabriel Schector.
not_available Just a second.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available How are you, Gabe? Didn't know you were F.B.I.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Just came along for the ride.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer is here under my authority.
not_available Oh.
not_available So I can hold you responsible for anything he does while he's here.
not_available I have a witness.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available Well, well, well.
not_available This should be an interesting conversation.
not_available How long's it been, Jack? Years.
not_available How's the, uh, Senate thing doing? I hear they dismantled the C.T.U.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available It was your fault, wasn't it? Mr.
not_available Schector, we're not here to make small talk.
not_available I have questions.
not_available Well, you have my undivided attention.
not_available Where's Tony Almeida? Tony Almeida? In the ground, I suppose.
not_available Unless he was cremated.
not_available Didn't he die at C.T.U.
not_available A while back? You've got an out here, Gabe.
not_available They're not after you.
not_available They're willing to accept that you didn't know what Tony Almeida was gonna do with the components that you helped him steal.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available Nobody I knew stole anything, and if they did, I knew nothing about it.
not_available This is far more serious than you know, Mr.
not_available Schector.
not_available If you help us find Almeida, I can see to it that you're kept in the clear.
not_available Otherwise, you could be a coconspirator to multiple terrorist acts.
not_available Oh, well, I think this conversation's over.
not_available I've tried to answer all your questions honestly but I think from now on you can speak to my lawyers.
not_available So, good
not_available bye, Jack.
not_available And good luck with the Senate.
not_available Hope they fry your ass.
not_available Ari, could you show these people to the door, please? You're sure you wanna play it like this? 
not_available That's the way I wanna play.
not_available Drop your weapon! Drop it now! 
not_available Okay, okay, okay! You two are going to prison! This was unprovoked! Unprovoked! Your man Ari was going for his gun.
not_available I've got a witness.
not_available Why don't we try having this conversation again? Where's Tony Almeida? No.
not_available I'm not talking to you.
not_available Where is he? Tony Almeida's dead.
not_available What do you want me to do? This is your call.
not_available Do whatever it takes.
not_available This is against the law.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available I'm gonna enjoy this.
not_available Enjoy what? Hey.
not_available Hey! All right, all right! All right! I'll tell you what I know! There's no need for me to lose my good looks over this.
not_available Okay.
not_available Last time I saw Almeida
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tell your men they've got a shooter on the Columbia Building, heading south! Shots fired.
not_available Suspects are down.
not_available The shooter's on the roof of the Columbia Building across the street.
not_available Seal all exits.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Get away from this, Jack.
not_available Tony? There's nothin' you or the F.B.I.
not_available Can do about this.
not_available Just stay away.
not_available Tony, just talk to me.
not_available What the hell's going
not_available Tony! Tony! 
not_available What's goin' on at Schector's office? I don't know.
not_available They haven't checked in yet.
