
not_available Previously on 24.
not_available You have already been briefed on the Cordilla Virus that's now threatening our cities.
not_available A vial of that virus has already been release.
not_available We discovered the identity of the perpetrator.
not_available His name is Stephen Saunders and he is a former MI6 agent.
not_available In 32 countries across the Middle East and Asia, your government employs intelligence consultants.
not_available Theyre spies.
not_available In 45 minutes, I want a list of their identities.
not_available If you fail to comply, I will release 2 vials of the virus in major cities.
not_available Looks like Saunders has a daughter.
not_available A daughter? We know she is 19 years old, she goes to school in Santa Barbara.
not_available I was just about to call the Santa Barbara office to have her picked up.
not_available Tony, thats not the right play.
not_available If you want to grab her for questioning, you are going to have to do it without him knowing, which means we have to conduct a plain sight swap.
not_available Switch her out with one of our own agents.
not_available Ok, lets see her.
not_available Kim, you are not going to fool anyone who knows Jan Saunders up close I know.
not_available Clear You think I am playing a game here with you? Hundreds of thousands of peoples lives are on the line.
not_available You have no idea how far I am willing to go to acquire your cooperation.
not_available Where is your father, Jane? I don't know.
not_available Could you help me find something on this aisle? Yeah, no problem.
not_available Call for help and I will kill you right now.
not_available Kim? Damn it.
not_available Saunders is going to know we have his daughter.
not_available The following takes place between 8:00 am and 9:00 am.
not_available These are the quarantine zones that were set up an hour ago.
not_available Since then, 2 new symptomatic patients were discovered at an ER in Silver Lake and one in Hancock Park.
not_available Those 2 cases engendered 5 new quarantine areas.
not_available Thats 3% of the city.
not_available If containment isnt total, it will grow exponentially.
not_available All right, thanks Adam.
not_available We are all tired, I know that.
not_available And some of you have been working for 24 hours straight.
not_available I dont have to tell you how serious the situation is, but we can't drift.
not_available If there ever was a worst case scenario, this is it.
not_available We are in it.
not_available Everyone has to stay on point.
not_available We have switched from prevention to containment.
not_available The virus is out.
not_available You all right? Yeah, I am fine.
not_available I am sorry it had to go down like this.
not_available The man I shot, is he dead? Yeah.
not_available What's going to happen now? Saunders is going to know we have Jane.
not_available This is Jack.
not_available Jack, its Forrester.
not_available The Saunders girl is calmed down.
not_available You can try talking to her again.
not_available Ok, thanks, Rachel.
not_available We will see what we can get from the daughter.
not_available I understand that, Tony.
not_available So you'll tell him? Yeah, I will tell him.
not_available I want every precaution taken.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's going on with Jack Bauer? The operation wasn't completely successful.
not_available Now, David, they do have Saunders daughter, but they were unable to remain covert.
not_available So, Saunders knows we have her? No, not yet, but CTU is estimating he will find out within the hour.
not_available What's Jacks plan? Use Saunders daughter, try to locate him.
not_available David, listen.
not_available The deadline for his next demand is gonna be up here in about 15 minutes.
not_available Now, giving this guy a list of every foreign operative on our payroll is an act of treason.
not_available I know that.
not_available But he will release more of the virus if we dont.
not_available So what do you want to do? I want to see what Bauer gets out of Saunders daughter first.
not_available You know what just happened? A man who your father hired to protect you just tried to kill one of my agents.
not_available So, you killed him, right? A man that worked for my father.
not_available You are a smart girl, Jane.
not_available Look out in that room.
not_available Everyone here is a federal agent whose job i t is to protect the lives of American citizens.
not_available Jane, I know how hard it must be for you to believe everything that everybodys been telling you about your father.
not_available But I am going to show you something that will change your mind.
not_available And the sooner you stop resisting me, the sooner you can help us start saving lives.
not_available Why are you putting all this on me? Because you are Stephen Saunders daughter.
not_available And unfortunately, you are the only leverage we have against him.
not_available You cant just say these outrageous things and expect me to believe you.
not_available I know.
not_available Truth is, I know your father.
not_available I worked with him.
not_available He was a good man.
not_available He was a brave man.
not_available But something has happened to him.
not_available All I care about right now is stopping him from doing what he is doing.
not_available I can't do that without you.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Palmer still hasn't sent the list yet.
not_available He has 15 more minutes.
not_available CTU has been trying to use IP locators to get at your through the domain name.
not_available We've protected it though, right? Yes.
not_available It's a dead end Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I am going to show you who your father really is.
not_available These photographs were taken over 8 years ago.
not_available Your father told your mother that he was going to Europe on a fact finding mission.
not_available But the truth of the matter is, we were both part of a special forces unit that was dispatched to Kosovo to kill a man named Victor Drazen.
not_available This is where the mission ended, Drazens hideout.
not_available When I left Kosovo, I believed your father had died in the blast.
not_available The British government told your mother that thats where he died, too.
not_available But recently, we discovered through phone records that your father had contacted you 4 years ago to tell you he was still alive.Is that right? Yes A couple of months after my mother died, I get a call from him.
not_available He said he was living in Europe under an assumed name.
not_available And that nobody knew he was alive.
not_available And for his protection, I couldn't tell anyone that I had spoken to him.
not_available Did he ever tell you why he had contacted you after so many years? Yes.
not_available He missed me.
not_available I understand that.
not_available Over the last 3 to 4 hours, we have been pooling data from Interpol.
not_available Here are some more recent images.
not_available This is your father with Sayed Ali, a known weapon dealer in the Middle East.
not_available Here you see his meeting with Ari Consul, a biologist from Jakarta who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for the manufacturing of illegal biological weapons.
not_available This doesn't prove anything.
not_available He could have been meeting with these people for any number of reasons.
not_available I will play you an audio file, one of three that we got from your father earlier today.
not_available This is your father talking to the President of the United States.
not_available Working against these countries at the behest of the American military machine.
not_available In 45 minutes, I want a list of their identities sent to me by way of a website, sylviaimports.com If you fail to comply, I will release He has already released one.
not_available This is a live video feed from the Chandler Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, where your father ordered the release of one if the vials of the virus into the ventilation system of the hotel.
not_available The people that you are looking at will all be dead within the next 2 to 3 hours.
not_available There is almost 800 of them,jane This is how they will die.
not_available I don't want to see any more.
not_available I don't want to see any more, either.
not_available You can help us stop this, Jane, please.
not_available Please.
not_available I have a phone number.
not_available He told me to call it day or night if I ever got in trouble.
not_available Have you ever used it before? No.
not_available We need it.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available It's a mistake.
not_available I am ok.
not_available I don't have any infection.
not_available No.
not_available Don't take me in there with those people.
not_available I don't want to die.
not_available Please.
not_available I don't want to die.
not_available Michelle, I just got a call.
not_available Your lab results are on the way here.
not_available I am sorry to interrupt, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available What's this? Aaron? Our bureau chief just informed me that NHS believes Los Angeles is no longer safe.
not_available We would like to move you out of the state.
not_available I appreciate your concern.
not_available Tell Chief Kurtzman, I'd rather manage matters from here.
not_available Sir, I am afraid this isn't a request.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Secret service is invoking section 32.
not_available For your own protection, we are requiring you to accompany us to Air Force One.
not_available You are ordering me? Yes sir.
not_available It's for your safety.
not_available Wayne? I don't know the specifics of the code, but secret service is invoking it.
not_available And here in LA, the threat is serious.
not_available It's serious everywhere.
not_available At least here, we know what we are facing.
not_available Who has to sign off on this, Aaron? Chief Kurtzman and myself.
not_available I'd like a word in private with you, Aaron.
not_available Sir, I am sorry for appearing to overstep my bounds.
not_available But it's my job to protect you.
not_available Listen, Aaron.
not_available You have been with me from the beginning.
not_available You don't have to apologize for doing your job.
not_available But this crisis will end.
not_available And the people in this city and this country will be stronger, knowing that their president stood by them shoulder to shoulder.
not_available I am asking you as a friend and a fellow citizen Protect me, but here in Los Angeles.
not_available Can you do that for me? Yes, sir.
not_available For you I can.
not_available Thank you Yes, sir.
not_available Mr.
not_available President the conference call is about to begin.
not_available Jack, you there? Yeah, I am on.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? Mr.
not_available Almeida, I understand.
not_available We may have a way to locate this man, Stephen Saunders.
not_available We do, sir.
not_available However, my technical staff just informed me that to do this properly, it may take 15 minutes, possibly longer.
not_available So there is no way we can get to him in the next few minutes? No, sir.
not_available There's not.
not_available Ok, gentlemen, time is upon us.
not_available Having considered all the possible scenarios, I see no other choice than to draw our line in the sand.
not_available I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, I hope you understand that leaves us with only one option.
not_available That's to use Stephen Saunders' daughter as a hostage and hope that will stop him.
not_available I understand.
not_available All right, gentlemen, get to it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available David, are you sure we are doing the right thing? The only thing I am sure of is we can't let this country be taken over by this madman.
not_available Jack, how do you want to do this? How long do we have to keep him on the line so we can run a trace? About a minute.
not_available Ok, we need to cover our bases.
not_available We will use Jane to try and keep him on the line.
not_available If we have to jump in, we will.
not_available All right, look, I will initiate the trace.
not_available You tell Jane what we need her to do.
not_available I will get back to you.
not_available Damn it.
not_available What's happening? We have run out of time.
not_available We need you to call your father.
not_available And tell him what? Anything.
not_available We just want you to keep him on the line.
not_available For how long? At least a minute.
not_available Do you think you do that? I need to think about it.
not_available Jane, we don't have anymore time.
not_available Your father just threatened to release more of the virus in the next few minutes.
not_available Is the list up, yet? No.
not_available Well, his time is up.
not_available Yeah? It's me.
not_available Release San Francisco.
not_available That's my daughter's line.
not_available Ian, wait.
not_available I will call you right back.
not_available Find out where this is coming from.
not_available Jane? Yeah.
not_available Hi, Dad.
not_available What's wrong? I told you only to use this number in an emergency.
not_available I want to see you.
not_available I am scared.
not_available All the airports are shut down, and the news channels are talking about the alert level being raised.
not_available Just, just stay where you are, honey.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Someone is monitoring the call.
not_available Hang on a second, honey.
not_available Are you sure? Yes The signal is splitting.
not_available They've got her.
not_available Jack, we just got a hit on the trace route.
not_available He knows we are on the phone.
not_available What do I do when he gets back on? Nothing.
not_available You are doing great.
not_available Just keep talking.
not_available Jane.
not_available Yes, Dad.
not_available There's a man named Jack Bauer with you, isn't there? What, Dad? Hand the phone to him.
not_available Dad You heard me.
not_available I am on the line, Stephen.
not_available Jack, you know how many vials I have, and what I am capable of.
not_available And you know what I am capable of, too.
not_available Did you get a lock on the signal? It's dead.
not_available We are negative for passive triangulation.
not_available Tony, did you get him? We are working on it, Adam? I have got 2 microwaves that can give me a longitude reading, but I don't have the latitude yet.
not_available Here, try this.
not_available Adam? I am trying, Tony.
not_available I am working on it.
not_available Ok, here it is: 21904 Collins.
not_available We have got him, Jack.
not_available We will send teams from here.
not_available Ok.
not_available Patch the location through to the chopper.
not_available We will be airborne in minutes.
not_available Get me Chase.
not_available We got a location.
not_available Tell the chopper to come in.
not_available I want you to assemble the team.
not_available Take Jane back to CTU.
not_available I want her fully protected.
not_available What are you going to do to my father? I am going to stop him.
not_available I want you to go with her.
not_available Michelle The test results, they just came in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Almeida Honey, it's me.
not_available What's going on? I am ok.
not_available I am not infected.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available They did AA swab and a blood test and I am going to be fine.
not_available I am going to be fine.
not_available Oh, my god.
not_available Oh, my god, sweetheart, that's fantastic.
not_available Look, I want you to get out of there right now.
not_available Ok? Away from anybody who's infected.
not_available Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart.
not_available They said those of us that didn't come down with the infection, that we have an immunity to the virus.
not_available Well, where are they taking you? Downtown, to NHS.
not_available They want to keep us under watch for 18 hours.
not_available But they said it's just a formality.
not_available All right, look.
not_available I will get there as soon as I can, all right? No, no.
not_available Stay where you are.
not_available They need you at CTU.
not_available I can work from downtown.
not_available Honey, you don't have to work.
not_available We can handle it from here.
not_available I want to help, Tony.
not_available Ok Michelle Yeah I can't believe I almost lost you.
not_available I almost lost you, too.
not_available But we are still here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have to go.
not_available I will call you from NHS.
not_available Hey I love you I love you so much.
not_available Excuse me, everybody, can I have your attention, please? The President has asked you to this informal setting without cameras or recording devices to tell you what relationship, if any the outbreak at the Chandler Plaza Hotel has with the airport closures.
not_available Was the Chandler Plaza the reason yellow level was raised? The President will deal with that in his statement.
not_available So Saunders knows we have his daughter.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Found out about 5 minutes ago.
not_available How did he react? He broke off communication.
not_available The good news is, CTU has position of Saunders, and they are sending in teams now.
not_available What's our confidence level? David, this man knows our system, our protocols.
not_available He is going to be tough to corner.
not_available Stay on top of our emergency response teams.
not_available The abduction of his daughter may have made things worse.
not_available The President of United States.
not_available Please be seated.
not_available As you know, this morning our alert level was raised to red.
not_available We do have information regarding a possible biological attack on American soil.
not_available We have maximized our preparedness across the nation.
not_available Now the best way for our citizens to insure their own safety is to stay home.
not_available If you are at work, go home.
not_available That's the message I hope the media can convey.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we have heard reports that the local British intelligence office was attacjed a couple hours ago.
not_available Is that related? I can't release any details on that right now.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the people of the city of Los Angeles are starting to panic.
not_available And information is not following from this office.
not_available We have had major outbreaks, we have had quarantines, and now a hint of biological terror Carol, Please No.
not_available Gerry, no.
not_available The President has got to be more forthcoming.
not_available It's ok The President has to be in control, and so do you.
not_available If you want to help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
not_available Biological agents do their worst damage where large groups of people congregate.
not_available The best defense we have right now is to encourage everyone to go home and stay home and await further instructions.
not_available Chase, it's Jack.
not_available Are you en route? Yeah, I am a little more than 10 minutes out.
not_available Jack, what are the chances Saunders knows we have his location? Not likely.
not_available Saunders will think he had 90 seconds more of talk time before we could ever lock onto this location.
not_available Look, I want you to move your teams into position and remind local law enforcement to stay out of sight.
not_available We can't tip him off.
not_available Done.
not_available Adam, I want you to keep an eye on the satellite, track anyone coming in and out of that building, and feed all that information over to local law enforcement.
not_available You copy? I am watching the data now, Jack.
not_available Ok, plug Chloe into it, too.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen, everybody, this is our time.
not_available Get it right.
not_available Stephen, we have to leave.
not_available We are not leaving.
not_available Why not? You said they probably have our location now.
not_available Not probably.
not_available They do.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available They have got us on satellite.
not_available They will pick us up if we try to leave now.
not_available So we sit around here and wait till they surround us? Exactly.
not_available The more bodies they send, the easier it will be for us to disappear.
not_available No.
not_available I am not waiting around to get caught.
not_available Osterlind I am leaving, Stephen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Has she left, yet? No.
not_available She will.
not_available Stay on her.
not_available We are going to need to do this soon.
not_available Ok Where are we going? Los Angeles.
not_available I thought your father said there was an outbreak there.
not_available Where we are going, it'll be safe.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Where in Los Angeles are they taking me? A place called CTU.
not_available CTU? Yeah.
not_available Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available I still can't believe this.
not_available That my father is a terrorist.
not_available he was alive after all that time, I was so happy.
not_available I had a father.
not_available I let myself believe all that he wanted me to.
not_available That he was this wonderful man.
not_available How often did you see him? Couple times a year.
not_available Sometimes he'd surprise me.
not_available And he'd always bring me something And it was always perfect.
not_available Like he knew.
not_available Maybe he did know.
not_available What do you mean? He had people watching you, Jane.
not_available He knew more about your life than you are probably aware of.
not_available What am I supposed to do with all these feeling for him? The person I love doesn't even exist.
not_available What's going to happen to him? My dad's going to try and bring him in.
not_available Adam, it's Jack.
not_available What's the status of Saunders' location? I am watching it now, Jack.
not_available No one's left the building.
not_available Who's working with us? LAPD has set up a staging area about a block away.
not_available They have surrounded the area and are hidden from view.
not_available Ok, good work.
not_available Tell them I will be there in a few minutes.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're absolutely sure.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Tony, I need to talk to you.
not_available Yeah, just a second.
not_available Why don't you go ahead and put these simulations on my system.
not_available I need to talk to you right now.
not_available I will catch up.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available What's it? I have been working on the tented quarantine area, you know.
not_available And? I have been going over the list of people who have been isolated and I found a familiar name.
not_available And? One of them was Sarah Kaufman.
not_available Who is Sarah Kaufman? Adam's sister.
not_available You are sure it's Adam's sister? Yeah.
not_available She tested positive in the medical sense.
not_available She's going to die.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available You are not going to tell him, are you? Yeah, I have to.
not_available But we still have a lot of work to do.
not_available I mean, how can he concentrate knowing that his sister gonna die in a couple hours? Did you ever think about that? Chloe, I am getting real tired of your personality.
not_available I am just trying to help.
not_available You want to help? Get back to work.
not_available Adam, could you come with me a second? I am sitting on these satellite feeds for Jack right now.Can it wait? No, it can't.
not_available Chloe will watch it.
not_available Fine.
not_available What is it? Tony, I really have to stay on this.
not_available It's personal.
not_available Just come with me.
not_available Tony, whatever it is, just tell me.
not_available Did I do anything wrong? No.
not_available I am afraid I have some bad news for you.
not_available Your sister, Sarah, is in one of the quarantine zones.
not_available What? You have a sister named Sarah, right? Yeah.
not_available But how can they be sure that it's her? There have to a hundred Sarah Kaufman.in Los Angeles.
not_available Chloe confirmed it.
not_available Have they kept her away from the people that are infected? She's infected.
not_available What are you saying, Tony? Are you telling me that Sarah's going to die? It looks that way, yeah.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available Oh, my god.
not_available Adam, I am going to give you a chance to talk to your sister, but then I am going to need you to stay on until the crisis passes.
not_available You think you can do that? Adam Because we need you here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available No, I am completely surrounded.
not_available How do you know? There was a security guard across the street making his rounds every 15 minutes.
not_available He missed his last rotation, which means CTU has taken over that building.
not_available What are you going to do? I am going to wait until Bauer gets here.
not_available Baker and his team are running operations from behind the building.
not_available They will move when we tell them to.
not_available LAPD set up a perimeter here, here, here and here.
not_available We got SWAT teams moving in this way and from over here.
not_available Snipers on the roof.
not_available Nobody goes until we give the word.
not_available Understand? What's the situation? We have taken over building on either side of him.
not_available We got snipers on the roof, ready to go.
not_available Phones? We didn't jam the area.You said he'd know.
not_available What about infrared? We can't get through those walls, Jack.
not_available He knows we are here.
not_available What makes you say that? Because I would.
not_available You think he's still in there? Yeah.
not_available Why wouldn't he try to escape? I don't know All right, on my signal move your teams into position.
not_available Minimum 3 men per exit.
not_available Remember, no one goes into the builder till I give the order.
not_available We have to assume Saunders has taken defensive measures.
not_available Everybody ready? Let's go All team move into first position.
not_available This is a go.
not_available Repeat, this is a go.
not_available positions all set 
not_available Let's go Stephen Saunders This is Jack Bauer.
not_available You are completely surrounded.
not_available The President is refusing to capitulate to any further demands.
not_available I need to remind you that we still have your daughter.
not_available Stephen.
not_available It's over.
not_available The only way you are getting out of this thing alive is coming through the front door with your hands on your head.
not_available That's not exactly true, Jack.
not_available Adam Not now, Chloe.
not_available I am running comm on the Saunders pickup.
not_available I know what you are doing Robin, take over Adam's screen for a minute.
not_available Come here.
not_available Why? Chloe, this is really not a good time.
not_available Tony, I need you to hear this.
not_available What? I have to report some bad news.
not_available Field ops lost 2 satellite feeds because Adam forgot to segregate the channels.
not_available What are you talking about? It's true.
not_available I checked your system.
not_available I had to reinitiate everything.
not_available You touched my system? Tony, let's face it.
not_available Adam shouldn't be here.
not_available He's under duress because his sister's going to die.
not_available I did not forget to separate those channels, Tony Yes, you did.
not_available All right, look, we don't have time for this.
not_available We have teams on the ground that are depending on us.
not_available Did you back up the satellite data? Yes.
not_available I reprogrammed almost everything.
not_available We lost about 30 seconds.
not_available We didn't lose it, Chloe.
not_available I can prove it to you right now.
not_available I thought that I ¡­ Chloe is right.
not_available I forgot to separate them.
not_available All right, look.
not_available You made a mistake.
not_available But what I need to know is if can you get through the rest of the day without making another one.
not_available Adam? I'm fine, Tony.
not_available Ok I want you to know that I don't agree with Tony's decision.
not_available But since you are going to stay, I am going to double check your logs every 10 minutes in case you screw up again.
not_available Jack, what do you want to do? If he's not in there, we are wasting a lot of time we don't have.
not_available Just have the men maintain their position.
not_available This is Bauer Congratulations, Jack You found me.
not_available Stephen, it's over.
not_available Come on out.
not_available It would suit me better if you came in here and got me.
not_available I'd hate to be in the crosshairs of all those unstable CTU snipers.
not_available Come out the front door with your hands on your head.
not_available I assure you, you'll be fine.
not_available That doesn't affect your nerves a little bit? The President has made himself clear.
not_available He's not following orders from you anymore.
not_available I work for him.
not_available Well, if that's the case, you won't mind if I take a few minutes to think things over.
not_available While you are thinking things over, you might want to take a second and think about your daughter.
not_available Tony just confirmed that he's in the building.
not_available All teams hold your position.
not_available We got confirmation.
not_available Is it done? Yes All right.
not_available Stay on the line.
not_available Almeida.
