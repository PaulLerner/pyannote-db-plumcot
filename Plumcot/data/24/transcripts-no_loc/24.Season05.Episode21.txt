
not_available We'll release the Sentox here and 200,000 people die.
not_available We need access to the control room.
not_available Jack, Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute.
not_available If we ignite that gas before it leaves the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated.
not_available Bierko! Give me a hand.
not_available Organise an escort team.
not_available You get him back to CTU alive.
not_available You got it.
not_available I just got word from the FAA about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight.
not_available So what? 
not_available Jack Bauer is the hijacker.
not_available What is he doing on that flight? He's looking for the recording that implicates me in David Palmer's death.
not_available Order the plane down and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.
not_available We need to take him down now, dead or alive.
not_available Mr President.
not_available I don't care if Bauer is making threats.
not_available That plane has to land immediately, and when it lands, I want my Secret Service detail to take him into custody.
not_available Sit down! 
not_available He has a gun! Everybody, stay in your seats and no one will get hurt.
not_available Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.
not_available The person that I'm looking for is sitting next to you.
not_available He's your copilot Scott Evans.
not_available You need to open the door.
not_available Could you, uh take the stick for a second? I'm the only one who can fly this plane.
not_available Give me the recording.
not_available Advise CTU I have the recording.
not_available I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.
not_available Bauer's got the evidence.
not_available He is in control of the plane.
not_available What do we do? 
not_available You have to shoot down that plane.
not_available Otherwise you go to prison.
not_available For treason and murder.
not_available Sierra Tango clear to flight level 220.
not_available We can expect the approach to Van Nuys.
not_available Good.
not_available Can you patch me through to Karen Hayes? 
not_available Hold, please.
not_available 
not_available You broke my nose.
not_available You'll get medical attention on the ground.
not_available Your only concern should be flying this plane.
not_available Jack Bauer on line one.
not_available 
not_available Put him through.
not_available You are connected.
not_available 
not_available The recording was on the copilot.
not_available The copilot? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He was working for Henderson.
not_available I've secured the copilot.
not_available We're en route back to Van Nuys.
not_available What's our ETA? 
not_available 21 minutes.
not_available It is imperative we do not let it fall into the hands of anyone loyal to the president.
not_available I'm gonna need you to provide me with a safe corridor back to CTU.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available I'm here with Karen.
not_available We can dispatch a team to meet you at the airfield.
not_available They can take you into protective custody.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Bill, how is Audrey? Curtis just brought her in.
not_available She's in Medical, but it looks like she's going to be OK.
not_available Thank God.
not_available OK, I'll get back to you as soon as we're on final approach.
not_available All right.
not_available I just got off the phone with the county general.
not_available I have some great news.
not_available Your father survived the crash.
not_available He's alive? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available One of our teams picked him up He's still in ICU, but they expect him to pull through.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available We have a team stationed at the hospital.
not_available He'll be well protected.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I have to take this.
not_available Curtis 
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Manning.
not_available Is Henderson secured? 
not_available He's in holding room three.
not_available I need you to pick up Jack.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available He's on a plane heading towards Van Nuys.
not_available ETA is 20 minutes.
not_available Why is he on a plane? He had to commandeer the plane in order to secure the evidence against Logan.
not_available I'll brief you en route.
not_available I cannot emphasise strongly enough the explosive nature of the evidence.
not_available I need you to put him into protective custody and bring him back here to CTU.
not_available Understood.
not_available Logan will send his men to retrieve it.
not_available You've got to get to Jack first.
not_available We will.
not_available I'm heading out.
not_available Yes? We have a solution to allow the plane to be shot down.
not_available I sure as hell hope so.
not_available I may be the president, but there are certain protocols in place.
not_available This will circumvent your protocols.
not_available What is it? We're going to simulate a VCI distress signal.
not_available It will be broadcast on the plane's code, and will appear to come from Bauer's flight.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What is a VCI distress signal? It indicates that there's a hijacking in progress, and that the aircraft is to be used as a weapon.
not_available It'll give you the pretext to shoot it down.
not_available There really is no other legitimate response to this scenario.
not_available All you need to do is appear to struggle with the ethics, and then give the order.
not_available Mr President? 
not_available Fine.
not_available All right.
not_available You sound reluctant.
not_available I can't believe it's come to this.
not_available I'm going to shoot down a plane full of innocent people.
not_available None of us is happy about this, but you don't really have a choice.
not_available Bauer has evidence implicating you in this conspiracy, and I don't have to tell you what the consequences will be if it's released.
not_available We should contact Chloe and bring her in.
not_available We'll want her help bringing Jack to CTU.
not_available Fine.
not_available Send an escort.
not_available Karen, I appreciate this.
not_available I know you're putting everything on the line to help us.
not_available This recording better be everything Jack claims it is.
not_available I know Jack.
not_available I don't always agree with his methods, but I trust his judgment.
not_available I'll go make that call.
not_available What's Buchanan doing out of Holding? 
not_available The situation changed.
not_available There's new intel.
not_available What new intel? 
not_available I don't have time to explain now.
not_available What? 
not_available I'll brief you when I've got the chance.
not_available Have you completed the orders for Bierko's transfer? 
not_available I'm still working on it.
not_available Let me know when you've got them.
not_available What is it? A situation has come up regarding the hijacked plane.
not_available Tell me what's happening.
not_available The FAA picked up a VCI distress code.
not_available It originated from flight ST 520.
not_available What's a VCI distress code? VCI is a coding system that was recently installed in all commercial airliners.
not_available This code indicates a hijacking is underway, and that the plane is going to be used to target installations on the ground.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Admiral Kirkland is on video conference.
not_available He's ready to brief you with the details.
not_available Admiral Kirkland, I'm Mike Novick.
not_available I have the president here.
not_available Mr President.
not_available 
not_available Mike's told me about this VCI signal.
not_available How could that be sent without Bauer's knowledge? Most likely one of the pilots secretly activated the transponder code.
not_available At last report, Bauer was in the passenger cabin.
not_available Does this mean that he's now in the cockpit? It appears that way, sir.
not_available What do we do, Admiral? 
not_available The protocols are clearly specified.
not_available We're compelled to take pre
not_available emptive action.
not_available What action? 
not_available The aircraft must be shot down.
not_available We've scrambled an F
not_available 18 out of Point Mugu.
not_available We just need your approval to engage.
not_available There are over 50 people on that plane, Admiral.
not_available We have to think of the people on the ground.
not_available Over 20 million citizens live in Los Angeles.
not_available Each one of them is now a potential target.
not_available 
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available If I could interject.
not_available It's hard for me to accept Bauer intends to use the aircraft as a weapon against civilians.
not_available Jack Bauer is a distraught individual with a history of erratic behaviour.
not_available Jack Bauer has spent his entire career protecting American lives.
not_available There's a reason he's doing what he's doing.
not_available What would that be? I don't have the answer, but we should try to find out.
not_available We don't have the time.
not_available We could have the F
not_available 18 shadow the aircraft.
not_available We could issue a standing order to fire only if the target deviates from its present course.
not_available It's not a viable option, Mr President.
not_available 
not_available Why not? The plane is over the desert.
not_available In 15 minutes, it'll be above Los Angeles.
not_available If we shoot it down then, there'll be massive casualties.
not_available We must consider the possibility that Bauer intends to attack the presidential retreat.
not_available The retreat? 
not_available You're inside the target zone.
not_available Bauer has already been accused of killing one president.
not_available The simple fact is we don't know what his intentions are.
not_available Mr President 
not_available Mike, stop.
not_available I've made my decision.
not_available I'm authorising you to shoot down that plane.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available 
not_available Mr President Mike, please.
not_available Don't make this any more difficult for me than it already is.
not_available Ms Hayes.
not_available This just came in over the interagency subnet.
not_available What is it? We have to alert Jack.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Air Traffic Control received a VCI distress signal from your aircraft.
not_available That authorises Logan to shoot you down.
not_available Shoot us down? An F
not_available 18's been scrambled out of Point Mugu.
not_available You have eight to ten minutes.
not_available Patch me through to the pilot of the F
not_available 18.
not_available No chance.
not_available It's a coded frequency.
not_available I can get in touch with the White House.
not_available And tell them what? They don't want to hear anything I have to say.
not_available We need to land now.
not_available We're 100 miles from the nearest airport.
not_available They're going to shoot us down.
not_available We need to get on the ground now.
not_available You didn't hear me.
not_available There's nowhere to land.
not_available How much runway do you need? 
not_available At least 5,000 feet.
not_available Bill? 
not_available Yeah, Jack.
not_available Look for a stretch of freeway at least I'll pull up maps of the area, Jack.
not_available Get back to me as soon as you got something.
not_available We can't land on the freeway.
not_available Yes, we can.
not_available It's late, there's a curfew, there won't be any cars on the freeway.
not_available Cuff your right hand to the flight controls now.
not_available All the way.
not_available Just start taking us down.
not_available Do it now.
not_available What's Chloe O'Brian doing here? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Ms Hayes.
not_available You can go.
not_available What's going on? An F
not_available 18's been sent to shoot Jack down.
not_available Can you open up a socket with the ATC radar tracking plot? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Do it.
not_available We need to know the amount of time Jack has before the plane reaches him.
not_available Look at this.
not_available We have two possible landing sites.
not_available This one's the best shot.
not_available I agree.
not_available Let's get Jack on the phone.
not_available I need to speak with you.
not_available We need to make an emergency landing.
not_available Get your passengers ready.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Everything'll be fine.
not_available Get them ready.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, listen up, everybody.
not_available We're going to prepare for an emergency landing.
not_available Bauer.
not_available I think we've found something.
not_available Bill, hold on one second, I want to put you on speakerphone.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's a stretch of the 118 freeway between mile
not_available markers 91 and 92.
not_available 4,000 feet, then there's an overpass.
not_available That's not long enough.
not_available It's the best we can do.
not_available Copy that, Bill.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Give me a second.
not_available You can either try and land this plane on the freeway, or I will.
not_available Give me the coordinates.
not_available We need to know where that F
not_available 18 is.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available I'm working on it.
not_available Manning.
not_available We have the exact location.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available 118 freeway.
not_available Mile
not_available markers 91 and 92.
not_available He should be there within minutes.
not_available Redirecting.
not_available 118 freeway.
not_available Yep.
not_available We're five minutes away.
not_available I'm patching us in with the pilot of the F
not_available 18.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Bravo One, it's Kirkland.
not_available You're on with the president and myself.
not_available Report status.
not_available My radar is locked on the target.
not_available OK, I've got the ATC radar plot.
not_available Put it on the main screen.
not_available Jack, the F
not_available 18 is within 15 miles.
not_available He'll be within range in two minutes.
not_available You're not descending fast enough.
not_available We won't be able to pull out of the dive.
not_available We don't get on the ground before that F
not_available 18 reaches us, it's not gonna matter.
not_available Descend! Put the oxygen masks on! Target has increased angle and rate of descent.
not_available One minute from missile lock.
not_available Jack, they're almost within weapons range.
not_available The aircraft can't take this.
not_available I have to pull up.
not_available Not yet! I can see the freeway! Come on.
not_available OK, level up now.
not_available Now! We can't pull out the dive.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Pull! Ground proximity alert.
not_available 20 seconds to missile lock.
not_available Target's at 1,000 feet and levelling.
not_available Levelling? 
not_available Affirmative, sir.
not_available What does that mean? Target may be preparing to land.
not_available The objective seems to be the 118 freeway.
not_available Lower the landing gear.
not_available We're going too fast! Lower it! Lowering his landing gear.
not_available The F
not_available 18's in range.
not_available I have missile lock.
not_available I recommend we abort.
not_available What? 
not_available The parameters have changed.
not_available I want that plane shot down.
not_available Order your man to fire, now! Mr President.
not_available Admiral Kirkland is right.
not_available The aircraft's not a threat.
not_available There's no reason to do this.
not_available I implore you to reconsider.
not_available Sir, we have a lock.
not_available What are your orders? 
not_available Abort.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available But if they don't land, I want you to shoot that plane down immediately.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Bravo One, hold fire.
not_available I repeat, hold fire.
not_available Copy, base.
not_available Bravo One, holding fire.
not_available We have marine units deployed in the area.
not_available I want them to apprehend Jack Bauer.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available 500 feet.
not_available We're not gonna make it.
not_available CTU.
not_available I've spotted the plane.
not_available They're coming in.
not_available We're heading towards them.
not_available I'm handing the controls back to you.
not_available Touch it down.
not_available We're still going too fast! 
not_available Touch it down! Target's touched down.
not_available All clear.
not_available Returning to base.
not_available Bill, we made it.
not_available We're down on the ground.
not_available We've redirected Curtis to your location.
not_available I'm just east of the Balboa overpass.
not_available Have him meet me there.
not_available Send a secondary team to pick up the copilot.
not_available Got it.
not_available Get out of there, Jack.
not_available Everyone keep moving to the rear of the plane.
not_available Exit from the rear, now! You should have ordered that pilot to fire.
not_available They were landing on the freeway.
not_available I had no pretext to shoot them down.
not_available I had to abort.
not_available It's gonna be much harder to contain now Bauer's on the ground.
not_available Even before the plane touched down, I ordered two battalions of marines to the area.
not_available They're cordoning off the landing site, even as we speak.
not_available Bauer has nowhere to run.
not_available I hope you're right.
not_available This is our last chance.
not_available I know.
not_available I know what's at stake, Graham.
not_available I'll get back to you as soon as I have any news.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Curtis, it's Jack.
not_available The marines are moving in.
not_available Where are you? We're approaching your position from the north.
not_available OK, I got you.
not_available I'll meet you on the north side of the freeway.
not_available We gotta get outta here now.
not_available Move.
not_available Dammit.
not_available You're gonna have to try and talk your way through the roadblock.
not_available Get your hands up! Everybody in the vehicle, hands up! 
not_available Hands where we can see them.
not_available We're federal agents.
not_available Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit.
not_available We have to detain everybody inside this perimeter.
not_available We're on the same team.
not_available We're trying to apprehend the hijacker.
not_available Jack Bauer? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Now, let us do ourjob.
not_available I need to see individual IDs.
not_available I'm gonna call this in.
not_available The longer we sit here, the better chance Bauer has.
not_available This will only take a minute.
not_available A minute is all Bauer needs to escape.
not_available We're not prepared to let that happen.
not_available We're moving out.
not_available If you really want to fire on federal agents, that's your call.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Move out.
not_available Stand down.
not_available Head east for a while, then turn south.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available 
not_available We've got Jack.
not_available We're heading back.
not_available OK, Curtis.
not_available Marines are everywhere.
not_available We barely got past.
not_available They must be taking direct orders from Logan.
not_available We can't run into any more patrols.
not_available We'll use back streets.
not_available Understood.
not_available Hayes.
not_available I wanna know what's going on.
not_available Miles, I said I would tell you when the time was right.
not_available I'm watching you work with two people under arrest for aiding and abetting a fugitive.
not_available If you don't talk to me, I'll have to get my answers somewhere else.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Don't tell him.
not_available I can't hold him off any longer.
not_available You really think that's a good idea? 
not_available I have to trust him.
not_available He's been nothing but loyal.
not_available I probably shouldn't have kept him in the dark this long.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I don't appreciate being threatened, Miles.
not_available And I don't appreciate being shut out.
not_available We've worked a lot of years together, Karen, and I have never wavered in my allegiance.
not_available I don't deserve this.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Come with me.
not_available Jack Bauer's acquired evidence implicating President Logan in David Palmer's death.
not_available Have you seen this evidence? 
not_available Bauer's bringing it here.
not_available What is it? 
not_available A recording of a conversation.
not_available You haven't heard it.
not_available That's what you're doing with Buchanan and O'Brian? Helping Bauer? Yes.
not_available Logan has done everything in his power to keep Jack from getting back here alive.
not_available You're working against the president and you haven't actually heard the evidence.
not_available This is why I didn't ask you.
not_available You knew I'd talk you out of it.
not_available I know what I'm doing is risky.
not_available If I'm wrong, my career is over.
not_available Notjust your career, Karen.
not_available I believe that Bauer is telling the truth.
not_available But you don't know.
not_available OK, OK.
not_available Let's say he is.
not_available Let's say that recording implicates Logan.
not_available Then what are you gonna do? Are you gonna arrest the President of the United States? 
not_available That will be up to the attorney general.
not_available You're 
not_available Sorry to interrupt.
not_available Yes? 
not_available They're ready to move Bierko.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be right out.
not_available Look, I have to go over the transfer protocols.
not_available I know what I'm asking from you is difficult.
not_available Everything rests with what's on that recording.
not_available Tell me what you need.
not_available Bauer will be here any minute.
not_available The best way for you to help me is to keep things running smoothly.
not_available All right.
not_available Miles.
not_available It's imperative this stays between us.
not_available Of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We have a full tactical complement, enhanced ordinance package, two
not_available vehicle escort.
not_available Vladimir Bierko, you are being transferred to a primary holding facility at our headquarters.
not_available Let me know the second he arrives.
not_available Understood.
not_available Let's move out.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Where is Novick? 
not_available He's on his way.
not_available 
not_available You told me that three minutes ago.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was on the phone with Colonel Owens.
not_available He's the field commander on the site.
not_available Is Bauer in custody? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available What happened? As ordered, the marines sealed off a one
not_available mile radius around the landing site.
not_available They've completed a sweep of the area.
not_available And? And it's Colonel Owen's estimation that Bauer is no longer inside the perimeter.
not_available He got away? 
not_available It appears so, sir.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available Mr President, it's only a matter of time before Bauer's apprehended.
not_available Sir, are you all right? Thank you, Mike.
not_available I need some time alone now.
not_available The attorney general's on his way to his office now.
not_available He'll be ready in ten minutes.
not_available OK, good.
not_available Chloe, I want you to prepare the recording for playback.
not_available Apply a digital signature so we can establish a chain of evidence.
not_available Work alone.
not_available I don't want anyone else near that recording.
not_available Don't let it out of your sight.
not_available I won't.
not_available You said I had ten minutes.
not_available I'd like to see Audrey.
not_available Of course.
not_available She's in Medical.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He's in ICU.
not_available When will I be able to speak with him? 
not_available I'm sorry, I really don't know.
not_available 
not_available All right.
not_available I understand.
not_available Just let him Can you please tell him that his daughter called and that she loves him very much? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available 
not_available Thank you.
not_available It looks like my dad's gonna be all right.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I heard.
not_available Oh, God, I'm so glad to see you.
not_available Me too.
not_available We did it.
not_available We got the evidence.
not_available The attorney general's going to hear it.
not_available So it's over.
not_available Yeah.
not_available President Logan's gonna pay for David Palmer's assassination.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Close your eyes.
not_available I'm gonna sit with you for a minute.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Graham.
not_available 
not_available I've been trying to reach you.
not_available I know.
not_available Bauer slipped through, didn't he? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I've just been told that the attorney general's office received a phone call from the director of CTU.
not_available I think it's fairly obvious they're in possession of the recording.
not_available I think that phone call was about you.
not_available I didn't expect it to happen so soon.
not_available I am sorry, Charles.
not_available You don't deserve this.
not_available Listen, Graham.
not_available Despite how things turned out, I still believe that we were in the right.
not_available I still believe that we acted in the best interests of the country.
not_available And we have to keep putting the country's wellbeing ahead of our own.
not_available The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder would be devastating.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, it would.
not_available Aside from the psychological damage to the country, a trial would expose certain realities that should never see the light of day.
not_available If only we could keep such a trial from taking place.
not_available That thought occurred to me as well.
not_available I'm glad we agree.
not_available I've taken steps to ensure that you and your associates won't be implicated in any of this.
not_available I appreciate that, Charles.
not_available We all do.
not_available I have nothing more to say.
not_available I'm going to hang up now.
not_available There are a few things I'd like to take care of before Goodbye, Charles.
not_available Goodbye, Graham.
not_available Martha, may I come in? Now you want to talk? 
not_available Marty, please.
not_available What do you want? Is there something else you wanna confess? No.
not_available I wanna tell you how sorry I am.
not_available For everything.
not_available When you forget to give me something for my birthday, that's when you say you're sorry.
not_available I know what I did was wrong.
not_available It was horribly wrong, and unforgivable.
not_available I know that.
not_available But what I can't live with is the fact that I hurt you.
not_available That's the last thing I wanted to do.
not_available Marty? Marty, please.
not_available That's the truth.
not_available The truth? You know what really gets me, Charles? What? 
not_available That you had me going for so long.
not_available I had no idea you were such a good liar.
not_available If I wasn't so horrified by that fact that I'm married to you, I might actually be impressed.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
not_available I have an urgent call coming in from CTU.
not_available I don't want to talk to anyone from CTU.
not_available He insists that you'll want to speak with him.
not_available He says it's concerning Jack Bauer.
not_available 
not_available Put him through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available You're on with the president.
not_available Mr President?
