not_available The Teodore Hotel, suite 514.
not_available Just stay where you are.
not_available The police will be there shortly.
not_available I thought we agreed you weren't gonna take your mother's call.

not_available Cover the south fire escape now.
not_available Medics, men down on the fifth floor.
not_available That doesn't make sense.
not_available What do you mean? Tarin just took out three men.
not_available Why is he using the fire escape? He should be heading down the stairs.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available N.Y.P.D., target is impersonating an officer.
not_available He has the girl.

not_available Arlo? We should join the sweep.
not_available They're gone.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Yeah, l do.
not_available They're gone.
not_available Chloe, it's Jack.

not_available He has the girl.
not_available Hello.
not_available Ahman.
not_available Samir, where are the nuclear rods? They're still outside the city.
not_available We haven't disabled the American radiological detectors yet.
not_available Then how will you bring the rods to me? lt's been taken care of.
not_available We've backtracked through drone and traffic cam footage looking for Kayla and Tarin.
not_available Nothing's come up yet.
not_available What's Bauer's status? Îe's two minutes from the U.N.
not_available An electronic intercept team is en route to him.

not_available What is it you do here? lntelligence analyst.
not_available Mr.
not_available Prady, we've got a major situation here
not_available l understand.
not_available I won't take up much of your time.
not_available Okay.
not_available lt's 3:00 in the morning.
not_available You're 2,000 miles from home.
not_available Would you mind telling me what's so urgent? Yeah.
not_available lt's about the young man I mentioned on the phone.
not_available Kevin Wade.
not_available This is him right here.
not_available You know him, don't you? Yes.
not_available l should have been honest with you on the phone.
not_available l met Kevin a couple of days ago at a bar.
not_available Was there another man with him? Îe was traveling with an ex
not_available con named Nick Coughlin.
not_available Bad news.
not_available Done time
not_available armed robbery, attempted murder.
not_available No.
not_available No, I've never seen him.
not_available Mm
not_available mmm.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, what happened with you and Kevin? Um
not_available We talked for a while.
not_available l drank more than l should, and we ended up back in his van.
not_available You had sex with him.
not_available Yes.
not_available You know where he is now? No.
not_available I didn't see him again.
not_available The whole thing was a mistake.
not_available Why so? Because l am getting married in a few weeks.
not_available lt was the pressure.
not_available l
not_available l don't know.
not_available All the wedding plans.
not_available l went out for a drink.
not_available I didn't intend to
not_available Maybe I did.
not_available I don't know.
not_available l don't know anything anymore.
not_available All that l know is that if my fiancé finds out, he will never forgive me.
not_available l'm not looking to ruin your life.
not_available l just wanna retrieve Kevin before he gets in more trouble than violating his parole.
not_available l understand.
not_available l
not_available l hope that you find him.
not_available Yeah, thing is, Ms.
not_available Walsh, l got a call a couple hours ago from my N.Y.P.D.
not_available friend, Tom Hardiman.
not_available Seems like there was a break
not_available in at a police evidence lockup.
not_available Again, bad business.
not_available Officer got beaten up, left in a coma.
not_available But guess whose prints were on the assault weapon.
not_available Yeah, that nasty S.O.B., Nick Coughlin.
not_available Now, what l'm afraid of is where Nick is, Kevin is too, and I really need to find him.
not_available And, like l told you, I only saw him the once.
not_available l have no idea where he is.
not_available And you're sure about that? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Prady, we are in the middle of a national security crisis.
not_available I have to go back to my desk.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Perhaps if I talk to your supervisor, he could let you take a few minutes off.
not_available Or l could wait here, stay out of your way till you have some time.
not_available Fine.
not_available You have to stay here though.
not_available Of course.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available l don't understand.
not_available The Americans knew where Kayla was.
not_available How did they lose her? Before we blame them, remember, it was our people, our own people who kidnapped Kayla, not the Americans.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, C.T.U.
not_available is here.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, l'm Jack Bauer.
not_available You already know Cole Ortiz.
not_available We deeply regret not being able to find your daughter.
not_available But l promise you, we're going to do everything in our power to recover her.
not_available Îow did you lose her? How did that happen? 
not_available Tarin had been warned, ma'am.
not_available We arrived too late.
not_available It was your people
not_available Dalia, please.
not_available What do they want with Kayla? We were hoping you could tell us, sir.
not_available Î¤arin Faroush was your head of security.
not_available Îe knows everything that you know.
not_available Îe took your daughter because he's trying to leverage something from you.
not_available Do you have any idea what that couId be? I don't know.
not_available Sir, we believe the kidnappers will contact you directly.
not_available We need to set up monitoring devices on your phone so we can track their call.
not_available Do what you need to do.
not_available Just please, get our child back.
not_available Dalia.
not_available Please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available With me.
not_available Set up tech here.
not_available Tarin! Don't! Please.
not_available No.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available No! Please.
not_available Do what he says, and you won't get hurt.
not_available Who is he? Another traitor? Î¤he only traitor is your father.
not_available Î¤ie her up.
not_available No.
not_available Do you recognize the number? 
not_available There isn't one.
not_available Chloe, we've got a call coming in on the mother's cell phone.
not_available We're working on it.
not_available Answer it.
not_available Keep them on the phone as long as possible.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Your husband is a traitor to the people of the Republic.
not_available Îe alone has made our actions necessary.
not_available He cannot be trusted.
not_available Where's my daughter? l want to talk to her.
not_available Whether you ever see her again depends on what your husband does right now.
not_available Put him on.
not_available Dalia.
not_available Î¤hey want to talk to you.
not_available Here.
not_available Give me the phone.
not_available Chloe, we need to be hearing this.
not_available We're still working on it.
not_available Okay, we've got it.
not_available You should have audio.
not_available This is President Hassan.
not_available Who are you? l'm a loyal servant of the Republic you are trying to destroy.
not_available Now, shut up, Omar, and listen.
not_available l want to talk to my daughter.
not_available Let me tell you what l want.
not_available File 33.
not_available File 33.
not_available That is the price of your daughter.
not_available l don't know what that is.
not_available You had to say that.
not_available Of course.
not_available You're a vain man, concerned about appearances, and the Americans are listening.
not_available But please, do not insult me by saying this again.
not_available l won't say anything until I talk to my daughter.
not_available Fine.
not_available lf that's what you want.
not_available l'm sending you an l.P.
not_available address.
not_available Give it to one of the people listening in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Got it.
not_available Don't hurt her.
not_available It's me you want.
not_available l told you what I want.
not_available File 33.
not_available l told you I don't know what that is.
not_available Take me instead.
not_available You have 1 5 minutes.
not_available No excuses, no stalling.
not_available Fifteen minutes or she dies here, like this, while you watch.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Stop it! I'll find the file.
not_available Whatever it is, I'll get it for you! 
not_available Mr.
not_available President, what is File 33? Omar! 
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, l've got Brian Hastings on the line.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack, you know anything about this file? No, but l'm standing here with President Hassan.
not_available I'll put you on speaker.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, this is Brian Hastings.
not_available l have no intel on the file they're talking about.
not_available Can you tell me what this is? Sir, they gave you lf you wanna see your daughter again, you don't have time to waste.
not_available Omar, what is this file? Show them.
not_available Dalia, l'll do anything for Kayla.
not_available I would give my own life.
not_available Then give them this file.
not_available Sir.
not_available Put it up on the screen.
not_available Mirror it over to C.T.U.
not_available Hastings, are you seeing this? Yes, I am.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, this file appears to contain operational details of all U.S.
not_available antinuclear defenses.
not_available Î¤hat's correct.
not_available lncluding our radiological detection arrays.
not_available Î¤his is highly classified D.O.D.
not_available material.
not_available l need to know how you got this.
not_available How do you think, Mr.
not_available Hastings? For 20 years, your nation has threatened mine with everything from economic sanctions to military attack.
not_available So we gathered intelligence and found weaknesses in your defenses.
not_available We did what any other country would do.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, that file shows the fatal flaws of our nuclear detection capabilities.
not_available lf the terrorists were to get that, they could smuggle the fuel rods into Manhattan.
not_available Surely you understand, we cannot let you give that to them.
not_available We're talking about the lives of tens of thousands ofpeople.
not_available And what of my daughter? What of her life? With all due respect, madam, your family brought this threat to my country.
not_available We're doing the best we can.
not_available Jack, you still on? 
not_available Yeah, we all are.
not_available Jack, we may have a lead on the daughter's location.
not_available Arlo isolated a subway noise from the video feed at the end of the transmission, crossreferencing it with the real
not_available time train positions as of this moment.
not_available There aren't a lot of trains this late at night, especially within the radius that they could have traveled to.
not_available They were heading southeast when they left the hotel.
not_available They've got to be near the "F" train stop by the Williamsburg Bridge.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Cole and l will head down there now.
not_available We'll bring tac from here.
not_available You need me to send a second team? Yes, and aerial.
not_available Everything you've got.
not_available Have your men ready and assembled right away.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, we're going to need you to stall them when they call back.
not_available How? We'll set up a fake file that you can transmit.
not_available They'll see through that, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Eventually.
not_available But right now we just need you to stall them long enough so we can locate your daughter.
not_available Stall them any way you can, but you need to make this work.
not_available We will do whatever we have to.
not_available Thank you.
not_available TarinPlease don't sayWhy
not_available Why are you doing this? Please don't say anything more.
not_available Please.
not_available No.
not_available ls there trouble? No.
not_available Why would there be? What's the problem? They're never going to hand over that file.
not_available Î¤hey have to.
not_available And if they don't? Killing her was not part of the plan.
not_available You were willing to die in Îassan's limousine earlier today.
not_available You were willing to do anything for our cause.
not_available l still am.
not_available You assured me your feelings for this girl would not get in the way.
not_available So tell me, do l need someone else to take care of her? 
not_available No.
not_available Stay strong.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Arlo, what's the status on our target area? Still looking at almost six square blocks.
not_available How far out are Jack and Cole? 
not_available Six minutes.
not_available That leaves us about 30 seconds to find her.
not_available We've got to narrow this down.
not_available Where's the second tac team? Leaving now.
not_available Uh, Dana? Îuh? Who is that? Nobody.
not_available Mr.
not_available Prady, this is a secure area.
not_available lf you're not gonna wait in Holding, l'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available I had a question.
not_available And I'm in the middle of a situation.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available l wouldn't be bothering you, but l just got off the phone with my N.Y.P.D.
not_available friend.
not_available He said I absolutely have to ask you about the security cameras at the police evidence lockup, because you know what? lt turns out they malfunctioned for the exact duration of the incident.
not_available Well, somebody obviously disabled the cameras.
not_available WelI, yeah, but not Nick and Kevin.
not_available A crowbar is about as high
not_available tech as those two get.
not_available Now, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
not_available See, l'm thinking that someone must have helped them.
not_available Now, my friend says that all the raw video from every government facility feeds right here into C.T.U.
not_available Am l understanding that right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He also saidcorrect me if I'm wrong
not_available that the digital images are archived every eight hours.
not_available And metadata
not_available ls that what it's called, metadata? That allows you to trace the exact source of any service outage.
not_available So everything I need to solve this is right here.
not_available You can get it for me, right? Mr.
not_available Prady, we don't just give data to people off the street.
not_available Well, now, that's right.
not_available That's right.
not_available You need, uh, an IDRAN, an lnteragency Data Request Authorization Number.
not_available Yeah, Hardiman gave me one of those.
not_available Îe said everything should fit on a hundred
not_available gig thumb drive.
not_available So is that gonna be a problem, getting that for me? No.
not_available Good.
not_available They reprocessed the subway noise, managed to narrow down the search grid.
not_available How big? 
not_available About 12 buildings total.
not_available Apartments, offices, retail.
not_available It's still too much ground to cover.
not_available Agent Ortiz.
not_available Dana? Cole.
not_available lt's over.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available I'm not sure I heard you.
not_available The parole officer looking for Kevin is here at C.T.U.
not_available Îe knows about the robbery, the cameras, everything.
not_available Are you certain? Yeah.
not_available Îe's after the raw feeds.
not_available Îe's got an interagency request.
not_available l'm gonna give it to him, Cole.
not_available l'm sorry to call you.
not_available l just thought that you should know.
not_available Why don't you wait? Do you hear me? He knows everything.
not_available He'll go to Hastings.
not_available Don't do anything We'Il talk about it when I get back.
not_available l can't wait.
not_available lf you're here, you'll just get in more trouble trying to protect me.
not_available l can't let that happen.
not_available I love you, Cole.
not_available Dana? Dana
not_available You got a problem? No.
not_available Good, 'cause I need you to keep your head in this.
not_available You got it.
not_available Omar.
not_available We're running out of time.
not_available The technicians have prepared the file I'll be sending.
not_available But these people who have Kayla
not_available they won't believe a fake file.
not_available But they might beIieve you.
not_available You have a gift, Omar.
not_available When you talk, people listen.
not_available You need to convince them, for our daughter.
not_available Say whatever you need to to buy time.
not_available l have seen you move so many people.
not_available You can do this.
not_available l know it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available President? l'm sorry.
